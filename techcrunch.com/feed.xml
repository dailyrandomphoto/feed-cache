										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L">Android 12L</a>, which sounds like a new version of Android, but Google calls it &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">a special feature drop that makes Android 12 even better on large screens.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea here is to provide users on tablets, foldables and Chrome OS laptops &#8212; anything with a screen above 600 dp &#8212; with an improved user interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The developer preview of <a href="https://developer.android.com/12L">Android 12L</a> is now available for developers who want to give it a try, as well as a new Android 12L emulator and support for it in Android Studio. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But 12L is also for phones, Google says, confusing no one. Since you won&#8217;t really see most of the new features there, though, the focus right now is on other devices, with beta enrollments for Pixel devices launching later in the preview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Google calls it a &#8216;feature drop&#8217; and &#8216;feature update&#8217; in its announcement today, we&#8217;re not looking at a full fork of Android for these devices the way Apple split up iOS and iPadOS. Instead, it&#8217;s an update for large-screen devices that introduces additional multitasking tools and an optimized user interface. By default, Android 12L should also make apps look better on these devices, too. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225070" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225070" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2225070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="820" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=768,615 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=680,545 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=1536,1231 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-5.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2225070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Specifically, this means Google refined how <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications, quick settings, lock screen, overview and the home screen look on large screens. System apps on Android 12L have also been optimized, too. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s probably most interesting here is the new multitasking features, with a new taskbar that is a bit reminiscent of iPadOS. Android already supported split-screen mode on tablets, but Google notes that it&#8217;s now more discoverable. You simply drag and drop an icon from the taskbar onto the screen to invoke it. This also means every app on Android is now enabled to support split-screen mode (something that developer previously had to opt-in to).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2225069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>Google plans to release 12L early next year, &#8220;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldable.&#8221; We should probably expect to hear a lot about Android tablets and foldable at MWC then.</p>
<p>In addition to Android 12L, Google also today announced new features in OS and Play for developers to better support these devices. These include updates to its <a href="https://m3.material.io/foundations/adaptive-design/foldables/compositions">Material Design guidance</a> for large-screen devices, but also updates to Jetpack Compose to make it easier to build for these machines and to ensure that apps can more easily adapt to various screen orientations and sizes. Android Studio is also getting a resizable emulator to help developers test their apps on a wider variety of screen sizes and a new visual linting tool to surface UI warnings and suggestions when the layout has issues.</p>
<p>As for Google Play, the company will now check apps against its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1635357399454000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jQo0QmGf9Oo99MstS3xmf">large screen app quality guidelines</a> and its search rankings will take the results of this into account. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For apps that are not optimized for large screens, we’ll start warning large screen users with a notice on the app’s Play Store listing page,&#8221; Google says. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daring Foods</a> closed on $65 million in Series C funding Wednesday as the plant-based chicken startup launches its products into 3,000 Walmart stores nationally.</p>
<p>Daring offers four plant-based chicken products, including Original, Lemon &amp; Herb, Cajun and Breaded, that looks, cooks and tastes like its chicken counterpart.</p>
<p>CEO Ross Mackay told TechCrunch that the goal of the company is to provide a product that can be “a true one-to-one substitute for chicken” that is also healthy. Daring’s product contains just five ingredients compared to some of its competitors that have a blend of 30 to 40 ingredients, and it also is high in protein and lower in calories than traditional chicken, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5eiqBfYdH8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/">Daring Foods will offer healthy, tasty plant-based chicken</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Daring Foods will offer healthy, tasty plant-based chicken&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/embed/#?secret=5eiqBfYdH8" data-secret="5eiqBfYdH8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Eighty percent of people changing to a plant-based diet do it for health reasons,” Mackay added. “They want to be able to trust the ingredient profile, and at Daring, we can say absolutely it is healthy.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch last visited with Mackay in 2019, about a year after the company was founded and it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/daring-foods/">received a $10 million investment</a> from Rastelli Foods Group. Back then, the company was young, with just one product and fewer than 10 employees.</p>
<p>Today, the company’s new funding, led by Founders Fund, is the third investment into the company during the past 12 months, Mackay told TechCrunch. Joining Founders Fund is existing investor D1 Capital Group and new athlete and celebrity investors including Naomi Osaka, Cameron Newton, Steve Aoki and Chase Coleman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following this latest round, the company has now raised over $120 million. Its Series A, led by Maveron, was raised last September, and its B round, led by D1 Capital, was announced in May.</p>
<p>Daring Foods’ products can be found in Whole Foods, Sprouts and Kroger, with Wegmans and Albertsons coming soon, Mackay said. With the addition of Walmart, its distribution has doubled to 6,000, including online markets like Gopuff and Imperfect Foods, and is also being served in some restaurants across the country.</p>
<p>The company saw 900% growth over the past 12 months and will be using the new funding to support that growth and new innovation. In addition, the company grew to 60 employees. Mackay says Daring remains focused on plant-based chicken and has plans for new product launches, some in the coming months and others in the next year.</p>
<p>Daring’s growth is in line with what is going on in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/plant-based-foods-market-to-hit-162-billion-in-next-decade-projects-bloomberg-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global plant-based foods</a> market, which is poised to be a $162 billion market by 2030.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is a trend, but the future of food, and we are excited to lead in chicken,” Mackay said. “More brands can step into the category, and the innovation going on in the space is super exciting. Capital plowing into the industry is showing the growth trajectory, and at the end of the day, the consumers win.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://delta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Air Lines</a>, in partnership with TSA PreCheck, today announced an expansion of how it uses biometrics to let passengers drop their bags, go through security and board their plane by simply showing their face. For now, the newest part of this, the PreCheck bag-drop experience, is a pilot that&#8217;s only available in Atlanta and for Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program members who are also registered for TSA pre-check.</p>
<p>The project builds and expands upon the work <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-launches-first-domestic-digital-identity-test-us-providing-touchless-curb-gate-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airline has done</a> at its Detroit hub and for its international flights out of Atlanta. But now it includes a facial recognition-powered bag-drop experience, too.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, where Delta and the TSA are running this pilot, members of Delta&#8217;s SkyMiles frequent flier program who are also TSA pre-check members now get their own self-service PreCheck bag-drop area. There, passengers who opt in to the program (which they have to do every time they check in to a flight on the Delta app) simply walk up to the new bag-drop machines, scan their face, which will validate who they are through the TSA&#8217;s database, and the machine will print out their baggage label for them. Once they attach the label, they set the bag on the belt and the new automated bag-drop machines weigh the bag and use cameras to check its size.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224260" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Forbes noted that this only works for regular roller bags, suitcases and duffle bags. It&#8217;s essentially the bag-drop area for frequent fliers who know what they are doing.</p>

<p><span class="">Currently, about a quarter of Atlanta-based Delta fliers are already qualified to drop off their bags this way. Since the experience is linked to a SkyMiles account, this may also incentivize a few people to sign up for Delta&#8217;s frequent flier program, too, which then gives it new ways to market to those fliers as well.</span></p>
<p>In trying out the experience firsthand, the promise of a 30-second bag drop seemed quite achievable. The facial recognition, with the mask briefly removed, takes a few seconds. Attaching the luggage tag probably took longer than anything else.</p>
<p>For now, Delta set up a small space for this with only four machines, but Forbes noted that if capacity becomes an issue, the airline already has plans for a second bag-drop area elsewhere in the airport.</p>
<p>The new bag-drop machines also feature affordances for the visually impaired and, in case there&#8217;s any confusion about who you are, a boarding pass scanner.</p>
<p>From bag drop, it&#8217;s off to the PreCheck line, where there&#8217;s another facial scan and then the boarding gate, for yet another one. If all goes well, you never need to get out a boarding pass or ID (but you should bring an ID anyway, of course).</p>

<p>By default, the use of biometrics raises some privacy questions. Delta stresses that it only takes the image to send it to the TSA to validate your identity. And to be fair, if you opt in to PreCheck or Global Entry, the TSA already knows what you look like and when you travel. Forbes also noted that Delta itself doesn&#8217;t touch any of the biometric data but leaves that up to its partners who provide the technology for it. The security of their technology has been validated by the government, but we all know that there is no system that is guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve now crossed the U.S. border a number of times this year, mostly using Global Entry, which at this point fully relies on facial recognition, too. It felt a bit odd the first time, but since Homeland Security already has all of my information, it became a non-issue and simply got me on my way to my connection faster. Using the Delta system from curbside to boarding felt quite similar (and not having to touch anything is a nice bonus in the age of corona).</p>
<p>Still, not everybody is going to be willing to make these tradeoffs. For them, nothing really changes. All of this is opt-in, after all.</p>
<p>For now, this is a somewhat exclusive partnership between Delta and the TSA, at least for the current pilot program. Other airlines are surely already working on something similar (United is a likely next adopter, despite its partnership with CLEAR). I would expect Delta to expand on this throughout its various customer touchpoints in the airport and others to follow suit soon.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robnsngh/">Robin Singh</a> is co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://www.doxel.ai/">Doxel</a>, provider of AI-powered project controls for the construction industry.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and President Joe Biden’s larger domestic policy package garnered national interest because of the bipartisan struggles and brief periods of unity for the United States.</p>
<p>Now, in the passed legislation, there is $100 million <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/infrastructure-technology-funding/604766/">earmarked</a> over five years to “accelerate the deployment of digital construction technologies such as 3D modeling software and digital project management platforms,” thanks to the <a href="https://infrastructurecoalition.org/">Coalition for Smarter Infrastructure Investments</a>.</p>
<p>“President Biden believes we must produce, here at home, the technologies and goods that meet today’s challenges and seize tomorrow’s opportunities,” the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">said</a> in a fact sheet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Yet while the sweeping package &#8212; which aims to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality &#8212; gets off the ground, we in the private sector know infrastructure on this level will need robust changes that incorporate emerging technologies during design and construction, or much of the construction will only hamper our major cities and hubs.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances truly do have the ability to aid an industry that has been beaten down by the pandemic and then global supply chain shortages. New York City alone lost an <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/74k-nyc-construction-jobs-lost-during-pandemic/">estimated</a> $9.8 billion in construction activity and 74,000 jobs because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, over 73 cargo ships could not dock at major ports within Los Angeles and Long Beach because of a backup in offloading goods. The uptick in some material prices and these delays lead to shortages, causing new tensions in supply-chain business relationships, making it more important than ever to complete major infrastructure projects on time.</p>
<p>The infrastructure bill would add $488 billion to the U.S. GDP by 2027 with just the additional $153.7 billion slated for new highway, bridge and public transit investment, <a href="https://www.artba.org/2021/09/22/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-iija-would-provide-major-u-s-economic-boost-new-analysis-reveals/">according to ARTBA</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The full bipartisan bill contains $550 billion in new spending; the $1.2 trillion figure comes from including additional funding normally allocated each year for highways and other infrastructure projects. The new spending <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/08/10/senate-infrastructure-bill-what-is-in-it/">includes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>$110 billion for roads and bridges.</li>
<li>$66 billion for railroads.</li>
<li>$65 billion for the power grid.</li>
<li>$65 billion for broadband.</li>
<li>$55 billion for water infrastructure.</li>
<li>$47 billion for cybersecurity and climate change.</li>
<li>$39 billion for public transit.</li>
<li>$25 billion for airports.</li>
<li>$21 billion for the environment.</li>
<li>$17 billion for ports.</li>
<li>$11 billion for safety.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Smarter Infrastructure Coalition and I know from our respective fields is that within that list, there is north of $500 billion that is about to be dedicated to infrastructure projects that still use outdated methods, hurting return on investment and eventually the next generation of taxpayers who will foot this bill.</p>
<p>With this kind of spending and need for accountability, it’s time to harness the power of algorithms and call on AI for greater accountability. Machine learning tools can examine huge volumes of data for patterns. Varying sizes of construction companies will be looking for solutions to manage applications, mobile devices and a range of other collaborative tools to ensure projects land on time and on budget.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the success that firms like Uber, Amazon and Airbnb have built on their ability to analyze vast amounts of data. It may have taken longer for a hands-on industry like ours to adapt, but now AI is realizing massive savings in construction by reducing the cost of equipment and manpower while also helping to spot delays and recommend improvements with accuracy and scale previously not possible.</p>
<p>Piping insulation might sound like a small thing, but there are a million “small things” that make up these projects and need tech enablement to save taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>In an example from my work with Doxel, a multibillion-dollar project from a global oil and gas company saved millions and avoided a three-week delay because computer vision was able to immediately prioritize corrective action when piping systems had not been properly installed.</p>
<p>Essentially, when digital surveying and our algorithms caught the fact that insulation had not been installed according to the plan, we saved that company money by opening the plant on time, avoiding sending home thousands of workers at that plant.</p>
<p>Even before the infrastructure bill was announced, there was a global uptick in appetite for major infrastructure projects because they provide jobs and then positive ongoing economic impact for the regions where they are implemented. Boots on the ground waned, however, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/economy/construction-worker-shortage/index.html">and are reaching new lows</a> &#8212; perhaps because of stigma attached to the work, or maybe because of vocational fads and new adult education learning patterns.</p>
<p>What is abundantly clear is that tech-enabled surveillance and daily project reporting are simply imperative for the infrastructure bill’s success to stimulate our GDP. Construction is a power player on the world stage, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-55293920110303">representing</a> 13% of global GDP, but construction has seen a meager productivity growth (1% annually), largely because of fragmented solutions and lack of tech adoption, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-equity-and-principal-investors/our-insights/rise-of-the-platform-era-the-next-chapter-in-construction-technology">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>
<p>According to the same report’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/infrastructure-productivity">Infrastructure Productivity Guidelines</a>, streamlining delivery (e.g., investing heavily in the early stages of project planning and design) can save up to $400 billion annually and accelerate timelines of large construction projects.</p>
<p>We currently have the ability to precision-track job-site progress with the use of cameras and lidar devices, in addition to the ability to connect progress to budget and schedule to predict delays and cost overruns when job-site conditions stray from the plan. We can augment worker presence by freeing up time previously spent on job-site walks, in addition to providing critical progress reports with contextualized insights weekly — and much more.</p>
<p>After 2022, a boom in U.S. construction is inevitable and will play a significant role in reviving a battered global economy. Let’s not be afraid to use technology, when properly managed and deployed, to empower the limited workers we will have available to us to be more productive and avoid the costly pitfalls from the schedule delays that so many huge infrastructure projects in the U.S. have been dogged by in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Abacus.ai">Abacus.ai</a> wants to build an AI platform that simplifies machine learning model creation, while still leaving room for power users. Today the company announced a $50 million Series C. At the same time, it announced that the platform was expanding to include computer vision use cases.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round with participation from Coatue, Index Ventures and Alkeon Capital. With today&#8217;s investment, the company says that it has raised over $90 million in under 30 months. The most recent funding prior to this was the company&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/"> $22 million Series A</a> last November.</p>
<p>Abacus co-founder and CEO Bindu Reddy, whose background includes stints at Google and AWS, says the company is trying to create a complete AI platform. &#8220;We have this end-to-end AI/ML platform where the unique thing is we have these vertically integrated solutions, which are kind of specific to common enterprise AI use cases. So think of things like churn reduction or lead scoring or personalization,&#8221; Reddy told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224965" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She says that this enables companies which lack dedicated data science team to build machine learning models with the help of the platform. &#8220;With Abacus, you have all the pieces and modules that a standard AI platform like SageMaker has, but it is customized for each of those use cases,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>With this approach, you choose a vertical, point to a data set, and Abacus builds the model for you. This is sometimes known as AutoML. For companies that have data science teams, and have already built a model, they can use that model instead of one provided by Abacus, giving a complete experience depending on the customer&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>The approach puts Abacus in competition with the major cloud vendors and with startups like DataRobot, the Boston AutoML startup that has raised $1 billion, but she believes that Abacus has been able to simplify the model production process more than the cloud companies, and while she acknowledges that DataRobot is a competitor, but she says her company&#8217;s ability to offer those vertical solutions is a big differentiator.</p>
<p>One of those vertical solutions is computer vision, and as part of today&#8217;s news, the company also announced new computer vision use cases including image detection, classification and segmentation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Abacus, which was founded in 2019, currently has 45 employees. With the new capital, the plan is to double that number by year&#8217;s end. As they build up, she says it&#8217;s important to add women and build a diverse company, and Abacus has an internship for high school girls to show them that STEM is an exciting career proposition, something she says that she hopes to expand because the industry needs to attract more girls and women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things we need to do is to increase that pool dramatically because one of the problems we definitely have is women [going to places] where there&#8217;s 80-90% men and saying, &#8216;We don&#8217;t even want to do this. Why would I want to work with a bunch of dudes?&#8217; So we have to increase that pool. We need that balance. So we try very hard. We also reach out to women PhDs because we also have a research science department, and we want to make sure that we are also encouraging women researchers in the AI space,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform seems to be working in the market with 10,000 users on the platform, who have created over 30,000 models to-date. While Reddy didn&#8217;t want to discuss specific paying customer numbers, she did share that companies like 1-800-Flowers, Flex and Recorded Books are using models in production built on the Abacus platform.</p>

<p>The new privacy option was one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">many changes the company announced in August</a> in an effort to preemptively build in additional protections for users under the age of 18. Google&#8217;s other planned safeguards included making video uploads private by default, disabling and weed out some &#8220;overly commercial&#8221; YouTube kids content, including unboxing videos.</p>
<p>Anyone under the age of 18 or their parent or guardian can ask Google to remove an image from appearing in search results by <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10949130?hl=en">filling out this request form</a>. You&#8217;ll need to specify that you&#8217;d like Google to remove &#8220;Imagery of an individual currently under the age of 18&#8221; and provide some personal information, the image URLs and search queries that would surface the results.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Google says that it will review all requests and follow up with additional verification questions where needed. The company will provide a notification when images in question are removed, so you won&#8217;t be left waiting.</p>
<p>In many countries, including the U.S., there is no national legal framework addressing the &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; online. The EU&#8217;s sweeping privacy ruleset known as GDPR, widely regarded as the gold standard for strong privacy regulation, gives people recourse to request that some kinds of online identifying information be removed, including photos.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s new request tool is helpful and available globally, but stops short of the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/article-17-right-to-be-forgotten/?cn-reloaded=1">requirements that GDPR enforces</a>. In Google&#8217;s case, to request that a photo be removed the person in question must be under the age of 18. GDPR goes further by requiring internet companies to remove images of an individual at their request if they were a minor at the time the image was uploaded.</p>
<p>Google announced the image removal option and a suite of other changes as the company and its peers in the tech industry come under increased regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">YouTube testified before the Senate Commerce Committee</a> about efforts it takes to protect young, vulnerable users on its video platform, touting the recently announces changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors CEO Mary Barra is “pretty confident” that the driver will be out of Cruise vehicles by 2022, as the company looks to enter early commercial operations for autonomous robotaxi and delivery services.</p>
<p>Her comments reiterate a timeline outlined earlier this month by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann at the automaker’s investor day. The guidance from Barra, made during an earnings call with investors Wednesday, comes as several autonomous vehicle companies prepare to launch commercial services or expand existing ones.</p>
<p>One key to Cruise’s success relative to other autonomous vehicle developers is its vertical integration with GM, one of the largest car manufacturers in North America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“[Cruise’s] vertical integration with GM is the key differentiator,” she said. “That seamless integration of the technology, along with leveraging Ultium, as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Cruise received its &#8220;driverless deployment permit&#8221;</a> from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, a key approval to start accepting compensation for driverless rides. Only one more permit remains, from the California Public Utilities Commission, until the company can launch its commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“As we speak, Cruise is just one state-level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco, and it is still the only company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hail service in the city,” Barra said.</p>
<p>Her comments were made as part of the automotive giant’s second-quarter earnings call. GM announced revenues of $26.8 billion, a 25% fall from $35.5 billion in the same quarter in 2020. The decline was largely due to the ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which have halted production and decreased dealer inventory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM also reported a net income of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, down from a year-ago third-quarter earnings of $4.1 billion.</p>
<p>“The quarter was challenging due to continuing semiconductor pressures,” Barra said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
<p>However, despite the weak earnings, GM executives remained bullish on the year’s outlook overall, telling investors that full-year earnings would be at the high end of its adjusted guidance of $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dream of understanding, exploring and even settlin1g other worlds is alive and well at</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TC Sessions: Space 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On December 14-15, some of this planet’s foremost experts will be in the house to talk about lunar samples and why they’re critical to determining whether humans can live on other planets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunar samples, in the form of rocks, regolith or dust, offer greater insight to the origins not only of the moon itself, but also of our planet and the inner solar system.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, rock samples collected by China’s Chang’e-5 (the first expedition to do so in more than 40 years) proved that lava flowed on the moon’s surface a relatively mere 2 billion years ago — when multicellular life began to evolve on Earth.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223739" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These substances have also been researched in the creation of lunar energy-storage regolith bricks, which could enable lunar construction and potential eventual habitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extraterrestrial resource collection isn’t just for government agencies anymore. Instead, it will require collaboration among government, private and public entities. NASA hopes to return humans to the moon by 2024 and, as part of that effort, it’s accepting proposals from commercial companies to collect samples of rocks and substances from any lunar location. Compared to samples collected in the 1970s, today’s advanced analytical capabilities will provide deeper understanding and exciting possibilities</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/"> TC Sessions: Space 2021</a>, we’ll have a panel discussion with lunar expedition experts from iSpace, Masten Space Systems and Lockheed Martin Space to discuss recent lunar sample research and explore what the future of lunar sampling looks like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one example of the</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stellar speakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have on tap at TC Sessions: Space. We’re talking folks like Natalya Bailey, Accion Systems co-founder and CTO, who will talk about advancements in</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in-space satellite propulsion systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars), Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lisa Rich (Xplore) will have a lot to share about investing in space startups from the earliest stages and beyond.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[We can't help but read Rent the Runway's IPO pricing as not only good news for unicorns, but also for tech-enabled unicorns.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s early in the Wednesday trading session, meaning that we&#8217;re waiting on the first trades of Rent the Runway stock on the public markets.</p>
<p>But what we do know is that the company <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/rent-runway-ipo-goes-bigger-114955222.html">priced at $21 per share</a>, giving it a valuation of $1.33 billion using a simple share count and around $1.47 billion on a fully diluted basis. For a company last valued at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rent-the-runway-series-f--57b9ddfa">around $1 billion in 2019</a>, those figures may not sound too impressive. But I think that they are.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s earlier coverage of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway IPO filing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">pricing run</a> was, respectively, skeptical and pessimistic. And yet public investors not only had enough interest for the IPO to proceed but also for the clothing rental company to price at the top of its range.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about why that&#8217;s bullish for unicorns more broadly.</p>
<h2>Tech-enabled versus tech</h2>
<p>A software company is a tech company. And an e-commerce platform is a technology company. But a firm that merely employs e-commerce channels to sell its goods is not. It&#8217;s, instead, tech-<em>enabled</em>.</p>
<p>The difference is no small nuance. Tech companies can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">find themselves valued at 40x or 50x revenues</a> in today&#8217;s markets. Concerns that are merely tech-enabled, however, tend to trade at lower multiples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.gringo.com.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian startup that has built an app aimed at supporting drivers in a variety of ways, has raised $8 million in a new round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek led the financing, which also included participation from GFC and OneVC. Kaszek also led the company’s seed round in 2020. The latest investment brings its total raised to $10 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based Gringo’s self-proclaimed mission is to be “the Brazilian driver&#8217;s best friend.” What that means is that it has built an app &#8212; launched in early 2020 &#8212; to help drivers monitor and perform services related to their documents and vehicles. For example, users can use the app to monitor, manage and pay for documentation (such as their driver licenses and vehicle registration). They can also pay taxes and fines through the app, which today has about 2.5 million users (2 million of whom are in São Paulo).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started with documentation because we realized that it is the main pain point of Brazilian drivers,” said Rodrigo Colmonero, founder and CEO of Gringo. “Everything starts and ends with documentation. When a driver needs to buy or sell, or finance a vehicle or obtain contract insurance, for example, it is very painful for them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, he said, the startup’s goal is to become a “super app” for drivers. Today, the app offers real-time alerts on fines, annual taxes, points and license expiration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of our competitors are focusing on selling products, while we are building a customer-focused company and as a consequence we are solving their pain points while monetizing,” Colmonero told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gringo must be doing something right. It has seen the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> number of drivers on its platform grow “10x” year over year, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colmonero. Its GMV grew 100x year over year, while revenue grew 150x year over year. (Of course we don’t know the base, but the multiples are impressive).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224473" style="width: 219px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224473" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2224473 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?w=157" alt="" width="209" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg 1090w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=78,150 78w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=157,300 157w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=768,1470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=355,680 355w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=803,1536 803w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=1070,2048 1070w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/gringo-home.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gringo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to building out its app’s services, Gringo aims to also build community around the issues it addresses via WhatsApp and social networks. It shares content around auto-related topics such as notices of new legislation or anything “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers need to know to have a practical routine in traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shift to more digital everything has helped Gringo’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The driver and vehicle licenses became digital in Brazil,” noted Colmonero. “Drivers are becoming more digital and it is no longer necessary for them to solve their problems with brokers and physical locations.”</span></p>
<p>Gringo offers its services for free and is monetizing by charging<span class="s1"> a service fee for the issuance or renewal of digital vehicle registration. It also offers credit for the payment of fines and taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital mainly to expand into</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new services for drivers, toward hiring and to continue to expand within Brazil, and eventually into Latin America. In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company is re-investing all of its profits in “growth into Brazil and later in Latin America,” according to Colmonero. Today, it has 100 employees, 5x more than a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaszek partner Santiago Fossatti said he was impressed by Gringo’s aim to help drivers manage “everything around car-related documentation,” including driver licenses, fines and annual registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is uniquely positioned to become a trusted hub from which drivers manage every step of their journey as car owners,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p>He was also drawn to the fact that the founding team had solid experience in growing other companies previously.<span class="s1"> Colmonero co-founded an equity fund called NEO Future Fund and invested in several public companies. </span><span class="s1">Juliano Dutra was a partner at ifood and co-founded Rapiddo, a logistic startup sold to Ifood.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has dipped back into its $2 billion climate fund and invested in several startups, including one that is developing fast-charging technology for electric vehicles as part of the e-commerce giant&#8217;s broader effort to have net-zero carbon operations by 2040.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday it has invested in CMC Machinery and Resilient Power. The company put additional capital into Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company it previously backed. Amazon didn&#8217;t disclose exact funding amounts, although separate announcements from the startups provide a bit of insight into the scale of the funding.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund has now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/amazons-first-five-climate-fund-investments-include-redwood-materials-rivian/">invested in 11 companies</a> to date, including previous investments in CarbonCure, Pachama, Redwood Materials, Rivian, TurnTide Technologies, BETA Technologies, Ion Energy, ZeroAvia, and Infinium.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224204" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Resilent Power, an Austin, Texas-based company, announced Wednesday it has closed a $5 million seed round, which Amazon participated in but did not lead. The seed round was led by Energy Transition Ventures, with investment from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund and GS Futures, the corporate venture capital arm of GS Group from Korea.</p>
<p>The startup has developed a solid-state transformer that enables multi-megawatt medium voltage fast charging at one-tenth the installation time. It&#8217;s also able to handle solar generation, energy storage, vehicle-to-grid and microgrid tasks. Resilient says its system is capable of charging up to 24 vehicles at a time. It can also connect direct current or alternating current sources to a medium voltage line on the grid, which is a handy feature that helps avoid costly upgrades to the distribution grid.</p>
<p>This is the kind of system ideal for charging fleets of vehicle, which is where Amazon comes in. Amazon said its investment into Resilient will help the e-commerce company reach its broader decarbonization goals around transportation, including the ongoing incorporation of EVs into its delivery fleet, including deploying 100,000 custom EVs by 2030. Rivian, another Amazon-backed company, is producing the 100,000 electric vans for the company.</p>
<p>Other investments announced Wednesday include the Italian-based CMC Machinery, a company that designs and manufactures custom-sized boxes tailored to the dimensions of the items in each order. This &#8220;right-sizing&#8221; helps reduce or even eliminate the need for single-use plastic padding while still protecting the items during shipping, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon said it expects that by the end of 2022, CMC Machinery&#8217;s technology could reduce the cubic volume for each box by 24% on average. The technology is projected to reduce the use of approximately 1 billion plastic air pillows by the end of 2022, Amazon said.</p>
<p>Amazon also put more money into Sacramento-based Infinium, which has developed a technology that converts renewable power into &#8216;green&#8217; hydrogen, then uses the green hydrogen and waste carbon dioxide to produce ultra-low carbon fuels. Infinium said Wednesday it closed a $69 million round that was co-led by Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund and a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources LLC. The round also included investment from AP Ventures LLP, 8090 Partners, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Pavilion Capital.</p>
<p>Infinium said the capital will be used to complete the development of large-scale facilities that can each generate nearly 40 million gallons of electrofuels annually for the commercial transportation sector. The fuels Infinium plans to produce are a replacement for traditional jet fuel and diesel, and can be used in planes, ships and truck fleets without changes in infrastructure or engine design, according to the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While dozens of vertical farms have sprouted in the past decade, few have attracted the amount of attention that New Jersey-based Bowery Farming enjoys. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farming is the most fundamental activity of civilization. Efficient, reliable and abundant food allows the great majority of people today to eschew cultivating plants and raising livestock and instead pursue every other activity that makes up an economy. It’s also an enterprise that has seen extensive innovation over the millennia, and farming has never been more efficient than it is today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s no longer enough.</p>
<p>The skyrocketing global human population — expected to hit 10 billion sometime this century — coupled with the accelerating effects of the climate crisis are leading to a decisive crossroads: How can the world continually increase food production while also mitigating its overall environmental impact?</p>
<p>A growing chorus of researchers, activists and entrepreneurs believe that at least part of the solution is vertical, indoor farming. Once derided for tasteless vegetables and wild-eyed (read: unprofitable) schemes, vertical farms are increasingly compelling thanks to progressive technological improvements and more efficient designs.</p>
<p>While dozens of vertical farms have sprouted in the past decade, few have attracted the amount of attention that Manhattan-headquartered <b>Bowery Farming</b> enjoys. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $500 million in venture capital — most recently at a $2.3 billion valuation — and is expanding from two experimental grow facilities to multiple scaled-up production hubs as it serves its leafy greens to customers at more than 850 grocery stores. The question the company asks is simple: Can it bring the newest and most innovative technologies to bear on civilization’s oldest and most optimized industry?</p>
<p>Answering that question in this TC-1 is <b>Brian Heater</b>, TechCrunch’s hardware editor. Heater has been writing about hardware and robotics for more than a decade and also hosts our annual TechCrunch Sessions: Robotics conference. As we’ll see shortly, hardware and robotics are key to making the Bowery model work at scale, profitably. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Bowery Farming had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Heater has no financial ties to Bowery Farming.</i></p>
<p>The Bowery Farming TC-1 comprises four main articles measuring 11,100 words and 44 minutes of reading time. Here are the topics we’ll be uprooting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture</a>&#8221; (3,500 words/14 minutes) — explores the evolution of vertical farming, it&#8217;s expansion in Japan and how Bowery Farming was started to bring indoor farming to the masses in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2: Produce development</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a>&#8221; (2,500 words/10 minutes) — evaluates how Bowery collects data from its farms in order to optimize flavor while also potentially expanding its produce line into new categories like strawberries and turnips.</li>
<li><strong>Part 3: Agtech engineering</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-technology/">Can LEDs ultimately replace the sun?</a>&#8221; (2,100 words/8 minutes) — investigates two of the most important questions about Bowery Farming: Can it develop a competitive moat with its technology (which it dubs BoweryOS) and just how much environmental benefit can the company derive from its farms?</li>
<li><strong>Part 4: Branding, finances and competitive landscape</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">The voracious fight for your salad bowl</a>&#8221; (3,000 words/12 minutes) — looks at the extremely competitive nature of the produce section at the grocery store and how Bowery intends to build a brand with consumers while finding a route to profitability.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food is the very nourishment of life, but it’s also becoming increasingly challenging to grow at scale. A combination of explosive and unsustainable population growth, human-made climate change and depleted sources of clean water is contributing to overcultivation across the world.</p>
<p>For its many advocates, vertical farming is a critical piece to solving that puzzle, even as skeptics cite its intensive power demands as a major hurdle toward achieving the long-term positive climate impact it promises.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Existential crises of climate change and substantial food shortages have fueled interest in alternative forms of food production, while innovations in technology have created the potential for delivering those ideas at scale.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The pursuit of sustainability was a key catalyst in the formation of <a href="https://boweryfarming.com">Bowery Farming</a> — and, for that matter, the development of vertical farming as a whole. Global climate disasters have spurred companies and governments to increasingly explore large-scale solutions, and that’s why increasingly bullish investors are pumping money into the space — the company raised a $300 million round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/">this May</a>.</p>
<p>Companies like Bowery have captured the imagination of the public for the role they might eventually play in helping reshape the 10,000-year-old practice of agriculture. It’s big talk, but it’s unsurprising in a world inexorably drawn to the notion that the solution to righting the wrongs of decades of harmful technologies can be found in technology itself. It’s a hopeful thought.</p>
<p>In the first part of this TC-1, I will look at the origins of Bowery Farming as well as the vertical farming movement as a whole. I’ll also discuss how Japan’s 2011 tragic earthquake catalyzed interest in the model and also explore how these new approaches to agriculture could usher in critical changes on an Earth with rapidly changing climates.</p>
<h2>We’re not in Kansas anymore</h2>
<p>The best way to understand a farm is to visit it, so I set up a tour to see what Bowery is building. I intend to arrive early, making some vague plans to walk to a nearby coffee shop, set up camp with caffeine and Wi-Fi, and prep for the day. As we approached the destination, however, that plan is quickly scrapped.</p>
<p>As the crow flies, Bowery Farming’s Kearny, New Jersey R&amp;D center is roughly five miles from Manhattan, but the surrounding neighborhood contains none of the trappings of bustling city life. Just industrial warehouses and little else as far as the eye can see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The first thing you notice is just the smell,&#8221; chief science officer of Bowery Farming Henry Sztul says excitedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s got that smell, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>There’s a kind of visceral sense memory that hits you as you enter Farm Zero, a Proustian moment that overtakes the senses after years of living in a major city. It smells like greenhouses and grow rooms: fresh, alive and a dramatic contrast from the world immediately outside the building here in Kearny, New Jersey.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Years of indoor farming breakthroughs have made it possible for leafy greens to be grown at larger and larger scales — and, eventually, at a profit.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As I walk through Bowery Farming’s three active vertical farm and research facilities, my mind is teeming with questions about climate change and the potential of sustainable vertical farming. Yet, when it comes right down to it, it’s the taste and, yes, that smell that will drive the company’s — and the industry’s — success.</p>
<p>We’re decked out in clean room coveralls and hairnets. Watches and jewelry are off, the soles of our shoes still damp from standing in sanitizing solution. “In here, we have a fully enclosed environment,” Sztul continues. “We control temperature, humidity, CO2, water flow, nutrients, light levels. When I say light levels I mean the color of the light spectrum, the intensity of the light, the photo period, the day/night cycles.”</p>
<p>Unlike traditional software products, inventing produce is an entirely different endeavor. Perturbations in the inputs of Bowery’s vertical farm can lead to radically different flavor profiles in the leafy greens it distributes.</p>
<p>In the second part of this TC-1, I’ll look at how the company experiments in Farm Zero and what it dubs Farm X, how it develops new produce lines as it expands outside of leafy greens and how it transforms farm work for the urban 21st century while scaling up at its newer Farm One production facility.</p>
<h2>Tilling concrete</h2>
<p>The smell is the first sense to hit, but it’s the visual that really grabs you. Right in front of me are the grow systems that give vertical farming its name. It’s a kind of scaffolding setup with row atop row of leafy greens nestled in long trays and lit by bright LEDs. PVC piping snakes up and down, delivering the water that cycles through the systems — saving 15 to 20 million gallons of water per farm over traditional growing each year, according to the company’s estimates.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223088" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223088" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2223088 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0094.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223088" class="wp-caption-text">Grow trays bask in light at Bowery Farming. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>This entire room is part of one closed irrigation system, circulating the nutrient-rich liquid to all the plants. Bowery says that even the water lost from natural plant perspiration can be captured with its HVAC system and recirculated back into the loop.</p>
<p>The glowing lights are a stark contrast to the gloomy industrial park outside, but even indoors, the visual is somewhat difficult to reconcile. The little pods of bright green vegetation exist in almost a laboratory setting, a strange juxtaposition of the natural and the synthetic that speaks to the heart of what vertical farming attempts to do — effectively hacking 10,000 years of agricultural knowledge.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For Bowery Farming, no technology is too small to optimize, and no data is too insignificant to track. Combined together, the startup hopes to orchestrate the future of farming and build a moat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Agriculture has a 10,000-year history, and it’s predominantly a history of technology. Developments from the plow and wheel to enclosures and the modern mechanical miracles of gas-powered tractors and sorters have consistently improved crop yields, allowing humanity to expand from tens of millions of people to a global population projected to top 10 billion this century.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next stages of that long course of innovation, vertical farming would seem to have all the right properties. Precise controls backed by data analysis can calibrate food quality, leading to further improvements in yields while reducing raw inputs like water. That’s critical at a time when the world’s climate is increasingly at a breaking point.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The energy efficiency of lamps or production systems can be improved, but not infinitely, so indoor crops will always be heavily dependent on electricity and other industrial support. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For Bowery Farming, no technology is too small to optimize, and no data is too insignificant to track. Combined together, the startup hopes to orchestrate the future of farming — and build a competitive moat in the process. To ultimately create a company of value, it needs to not just build differentiated technology but also build a brand with consumers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-competition/">which we’ll turn to in the final part of this TC-1</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">parts one</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">two</a>, I covered the history of vertical farming, Bowery’s origins and how it develops produce. In this third part, I’ll look at the company’s core tech infrastructure, explore how developments of just one component, LEDs, made vertical farming viable and investigate just how much climate savings Bowery can be expected to wring out as it grows in scale.</p>
<h2>Lettux</h2>
<p>We can’t understand Bowery without describing BoweryOS. It’s the secret sauce that ties its automated systems, sensors and data collection together into a central nervous system. The company is tight-lipped about specifics but notes that it unlocks the ability to rapidly replicate its growth system at new farms.</p>
<p>“You could be the greatest farmer in the world in Salinas Valley, and I pick you up and bring you to New Jersey and that knowledge doesn&#8217;t transfer,” says Irving Fain, founder and CEO of Bowery Farming. “You put the Bowery operating system inside of that farm, and that farm now has the knowledge and understanding of every crop we&#8217;ve ever grown and every process we&#8217;ve ever run immediately available to it. In essence, what we&#8217;re really doing is building a distributed network of farms, whereby every new farm that enters that network benefits from the collective knowledge of the network that came before it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The size, the scope, the potential impact — the mind reels. Vertical farming may be a nascent space, but it is growing rapidly, and the greenfield is being taken quickly.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are several plastic clamshells sitting in front of me on a conference room table — around 20 or so boxes, labels facing forward, with a plate of turnips and a tub of those R&amp;D strawberries <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">we saw back in part two</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a nice photo opportunity, backdropped by Bowery Farming’s impressive grow system and a good visual representation of the product’s life cycle. More importantly, it’s a reminder of how most people will ultimately interact with the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223125" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2223125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0096.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223125" class="wp-caption-text">Bowery&#8217;s clamshells in the foreground and grow system in the background. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>My position at TechCrunch afforded me the grand tour, of course — the whole Willy Wonka, clean suit coveralls and taste-testing experience. In the company’s FAQ, the answer to “<a href="https://boweryfarming.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045552574-Can-I-visit-a-Bowery-farm-">Can I visit a Bowery Farm?</a>” is a simple, “At this time, we do not allow visitors to our farms.”</p>
<p>It’s understandable, of course. While the farms themselves are a great visual, there are too many resources and health precautions required to worry about giving tours to outsiders. On my own visit, my guides were extremely cautious about what could and couldn’t be photographed — trade secrets and all.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given the novelty of vertical farming, and that some stigma still exists against the taste of indoor-grown produce, Bowery’s branding strategy largely revolves around blending in.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Press coverage, like this feature you’re currently reading, is part of the outreach. The company opens itself to journalists and the occasional video camera knowing that putting its farms on visual display is a powerful way to unlock the fascinating story of vertical farming.</p>
<p>Ahead of my own visit, I watched a broad range of videos featuring vertical farms from all over the world. My playlist featured everything from Nordic Harvest’s newly opened 75,000-square-foot facility in Copenhagen, to the modular urban farming setups Brooklyn-based Square Roots creates inside a shipping container you can purchase for just $80,000.</p>
<p>The size, the scope, the potential impact — the mind reels. Vertical farming may be a nascent space, but it is growing rapidly, and the greenfield is being taken quickly.</p>
<p>Most consumers will never interact with a Bowery farm beyond reading an article or watching a clip online, and there’s nothing particularly wrong about that. The truth is that urbanites will almost never set foot in the place where our food is grown — that there’s a connection at all is a kind of win in and of itself.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, building that individual connection with consumers will determine the fate of Bowery in the ultra-competitive produce market. Branding is a high priority for the firm, particularly as it battles competitors like AeroFarms, which recently announced that it will go public via SPAC before failing to secure investor approval.</p>
<p>In this fourth and final part of the TC-1, I’ll look at how the company is trying to invent brand loyalty in the produce section, figure out its packaging, design its supply chain and, finally, seek a path to profitability against a broad competitive landscape.</p>
<h2>Lettuce have a taste</h2>
<p>Bowery sees opportunity in the boutique clamshells that have begun propagating across produce shelves in recent years — first in upscale markets and then more mainstream grocery stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram announced on Wednesday that all users now have access to its Link Sticker feature in Instagram Stories. The expansion comes as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/instagram-is-ditching-swipe-up-links-in-favor-of-stickers/">recently ditched</a> the “swipe-up” link in Instagram Stories in favor of the new Link Stickers. Both the previous “swipe-up” link and new Link Sticker feature have been historically limited to businesses and high-profile creators.</p>
<p>The company says link sharing is helpful in many ways to accounts of all sizes and types, which is why it&#8217;s expanding access to enable everyone to share what they want in their Stories. In the past, link sharing has been largely used by creators and businesses to direct their viewers to a website to learn more about a product, read an article, sign up for a service and more.</p>
<p>“We made this decision based on feedback we heard from the community about how impactful it would be for creators and businesses of all sizes to benefit from link sharing to grow in the same way larger accounts do,” Instagram said in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can access the feature by selecting the sticker tool from the top navigation bar when you capture or upload content to your Story. After selecting the “Link Sticker,” you can add your chosen link and then tap “Done.” From there, you can place the sticker anywhere on your Story and tap on it to see the other color variations.</p>
<p>Instagram previously noted that the decision to expand Link Sticker access to everyone had to be made carefully, as it could impact the app’s integrity and safety. For instance, if Link Stickers were to be adopted by bad actors, they could be used to spread misinformation or post spam. It&#8217;s worth noting that accounts that share misinformation and hate speech will be blocked from using Link Stickers.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s expansion is the first step in broadening access to link sharing on Instagram for all users. It&#8217;s worth noting that Instagram still doesn&#8217;t allow direct linking in posts, which is why &#8220;link in bio&#8221; platforms like Linktree, Shorby and Linkin.bio have become popular over the past few years. However, with this latest expansion, users now have an additional way to share links through their accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In September, <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-poised-overtake-apple-podcasts-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts at eMarketer</a> predicted Spotify was poised to overtake Apple Podcasts in U.S. listenership sometime this year. Today, Spotify announced for the first time it may have succeeded on that front. During the company&#8217;s Q3 2021 earnings call, the company said that according to Edison Research and its own internal sources, it &#8220;recently became&#8221; the No. 1 podcast platform U.S. listeners use the most. Given the U.S. is the largest global podcast market, the milestone is significant and speaks to the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/12/spotify-continues-its-podcast-shopping-spree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable investment</a> Spotify has made in podcasts over the past few years.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t break down its podcast listener numbers specifically, however. Instead, it shared its monthly active users overall grew 19% year-over-year to reach 381 million in the quarter, up from 365 million last year. Premium subscribers also grew 19% to reach 172 million, up from 165 million last year.</p>
<p>According to eMarketer&#8217;s recent data, Spotify and Apple Podcasts have been neck and neck in terms of U.S. podcast listeners. Its <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-poised-overtake-apple-podcasts-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts said</a> last month Spotify would reach 28.2 million monthly U.S. podcast listeners by year-end, topping Apple Podcast&#8217;s 28.0 million by a thin margin. (The firm <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had predicted these same numbers</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">earlier</a> in 2021, as well.) It forecast Spotify&#8217;s number of U.S. podcast listeners would continue to grow to reach 43.6 million by 2025.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224825" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reached for comment, Edison Research confirmed the podcast milestone is based on usage, not downloads.</p>
<p>The data is from the firm&#8217;s second-quarter Podcast Consumer Tracker, its subscription service that covers the podcast industry. Respondents were asked &#8220;what platform or service do you use <em>most</em> to listen to podcasts?&#8221; and Spotify came in at No. 1, at 24% of weekly podcast consumers. This put it ahead of Apple Podcasts for iOS (21%) and YouTube (18%). Edison Research says its sample is in excess of 8,000 weekly podcast consumers.</p>
<p>But without hard numbers from Spotify or Apple, it&#8217;s hard to specifically confirm how close the race still is at this time.</p>
<p>Spotify attributed its podcast listenership growth not only to its content slate, but also to its product improvements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started our journey three years ago in podcasting with a catalog of about 185,000 podcasts. And we were really nowhere, compared to the largest players in the industry. Today, we have 3.2 million podcasts on the platform, a growth rate of over 1,500%,&#8221; noted Spotify CEO Daniel Ek. In the prior quarter, Spotify had 2.9 million podcasts.</p>
<p>&#8220;So why did we succeed this fast? Well, obviously our content investments have helped a great deal,&#8221; said Ek. &#8220;But it&#8217;s also another proof point of the impact our platform improvements and product innovations are having on our business overall. And the velocity of shipping matters &#8212; from the recent launch of interactivity and enhancements like polls and Q&amp;A, to the release of enhanced listening features and new original programming around the world. We fought hard to gain new listeners. And our success is not attributable to just one thing, but literally hundreds, if not thousands, of improvements that we&#8217;re working on in parallel for the benefit of creators, users and advertisers alike,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ek said that the company&#8217;s culture of innovation, which leads to an improved user experience, brings more creators to the platform to share their content. This in turn, brings more advertisers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And all of these things coupled together &#8212; users, creators and advertisers &#8212; unlock the power of our flywheel,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>However, Spotify&#8217;s milestone in U.S. podcast listenership (which Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch had not yet been shared until now) comes shortly after a revamp of Apple&#8217;s Podcasts app, which was criticized by creators and end users. Podcasters <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/18/report-details-podcaster-complaints-surrounding-new-apple-podcasts-subscriptions-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complained</a> of bugs, errors and a confusing interface. Apple <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/apple-podcasts-bug-fixed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a fix</a> for one critical bug related to automatic downloads in an update this summer, but the <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/07/apple-podcasts-reliability-problem-is-turning-into-an-image-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">damage to its reputation</a> may take longer to recover.</p>
<p>During the quarter, the percentage of monthly active users remained strong, Spotify said, and was up 20% year-over-year on a per-user basis. Podcasts&#8217; share of overall consumption hours also reached an all-time high in the quarter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, podcasts are helping Spotify boost its bottom line. Spotify noted it had its biggest-ever quarter for ads in Q3, partially fueled by its growing podcast slate, and said 2021 would mark the first time it surpassed €1 billion in advertising revenue. It did not break out how much of its ad revenue is now generated by podcasts, but said its podcast advertising growth rate was &#8220;in the triple digits.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the product side, the company released a number of updates to its podcasts platform in the quarter, including the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">paid podcast subscriptions</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/spotify-rolls-out-podcast-polls-and-qas-to-creators-and-users-worldwide/">new interactive features</a> for Anchor creators, expansion of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/spotify-expands-its-radio-dj-like-format-music-talk-to-global-creators/">Music + Talk podcast format</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/">video podcast support</a>, among other things. It also released 32 new Originals &amp; Exclusives, including &#8220;Armchair Expert&#8221; with Dax Shepard and &#8220;Call Her Daddy&#8221; in July, and announced a multi-year content partnership with The Ringer and WWE for original and exclusive content. Internationally, Spotify release 76 new Originals &amp; Exclusives.</p>
<p>Overall, Spotify revenue was $2.9 billion in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year, with ad sales rising 75% to reach $374 million, at the top end of its guidance.</p>
<p>The company added that it had not been significantly impacted by the iOS privacy changes that had impacted other ad-supported businesses, like Snap and Facebook, as it had &#8220;a ton of first-party data&#8221; thanks to all its users being logged in.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Robinhood's crypto revenues dropped like a stone. And that matters quite a lot for other companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/"> impressive growth run</a> on its way to the public markets, when Robinhood did finally price its IPO, the result was a bit slack. The consumer-friendly trading platform priced at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">the lower end of its IPO range</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/robinhoods-stock-drops-8-in-its-first-days-trading/">traded lower in its opening session</a>.</p>
<p>For a company that rode a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">boom in consumer saving and investing activity</a>, it was a sort of odd final entry in its private life.</p>

<p>Now public, Robinhood is writing a new book, adding a first chapter last evening when it reported its Q3 2021 earnings. The results were lackluster, leading to the company trading sharply lower this morning.</p>
<p>Robinhood <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/robinhood-drops-10-25-to-below-ipo-price-as-investors-worry-about-bleak-outlook/ar-AAQ0FWq">greatly missed expectations</a>, and its guidance was far from inspiring. What happened to the company that once posted sequential revenue gains that raised eyebrows and popped eyeballs? It&#8217;s worth a little time to understand.</p>

And Robinhood and Coinbase are hardly alone in doing so. There are other richly valued equities-and-cryptos trading platforms out there, including WeBull and FTX. Could they face similar issues? It will serve us well to pay attention to what Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 performance may be able to tell us.</p>
<p>Into the numbers!</p>
<h2>Q3 by the numbers</h2>
<p>Before we get into the why, let&#8217;s talk raw figures. In the three months concluding September 30, 2021, Robinhood <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">generated</a> $365 million in revenue, up 35% from its year-ago quarter. The company generated options-related transaction revenues of $164 million (+29% YoY), cryptocurrencies-related revenues of $51 million (+860% YoY), and equities transaction top line worth $50 million (-27% YoY).</p>
<p>Robinhood&#8217;s net loss came to $1.32 billion, though seeing companies take huge losses in the quarter following their IPO is not uncommon. In adjusted EBITDA terms, Robinhood turned in -$84 million worth of the stuff in Q3, off sharply from a year-ago $59 million adjusted profit.</p>
<p>Robinhood expects to post yet another quarter of sequential revenue declines in Q4, noting that it will have revenues of less than $325 million. That&#8217;s not good. Especially for a company that posted revenues of $565 million in Q2 2021, or given that analysts<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HOOD/analysis?p=HOOD"> expect</a> Robinhood to generate $497.99 million in Q4 revenue.</p>
<p>How did it all get so weird so fast?</p>
<h2>Down, to the right</h2>
<p>In simple terms, Robinhood saw its user base, crypto trading revenues and revenue per user metrics fall. The combined whack to its overall revenue led to the company&#8217;s profitability picture taking a beating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm, one of India’s most valuable startups, is seeking to raise as much as $2.4 billion in what is shaping up to be the biggest initial public offering in the country at a valuation of $20 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter and internal documents seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Paytm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed the paperwork for an IPO with the local regulator in July this year</a>. The startup, which has raised more than $3 billion over the past decade and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, said at the time that it was looking to raise about $2.2 billion. In an updated filing this week, Paytm said it is seeking to raise $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>The startup is moving to price its share in the range of 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.70 to $28.60), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that the subscription will be available from November 8 to 10, and the trading will begin on November 18 &#8212; or thereabout.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A successful listing would make Paytm the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Paytm, which is backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank among others, launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold.</p>
<p>The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led super app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed over 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually.</p>
<p>In the new filing, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm’s imminent IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">made a stellar debut earlier this year</a>. Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, is scheduled to list on Thursday. Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-online-insurer-policybazaar-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-over-800-million/">insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar</a> is scheduled to list next week.</p>
<p>In its filing, Paytm said that it plans to deploy over $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup&#8217;s offerings compete with a range of services including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip and BookMyShow.</p>
