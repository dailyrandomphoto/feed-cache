										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mention-me.com/">Mention Me</a>, a platform to generate customer referrals, has raised a $25m Series B round, led by London’s Octopus Ventures. Eight Roads Ventures, the lead investor from the prior round, a $7 million Series A in a 2018, also participated.<br />
 <br />
The London-based startup helps businesses turn referrals into a channel for acquiring customers, while also gathering data for other marketing activities.<br />
 <br />
Mention Me now plans to expand into the US, and develop its product offering.</p>
<p>Customers include Puma, Pret a Manger, InsurTech Bought By Many, Bloom &amp; Wild and ASOS.</p>
<p>Its competitors include Friendbuy (raised $1.8M), Talkable (raised $4.2M), Extole (raised $28.7M) and Yotpo (raised $436M).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259753" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Cockburn, CEO and Co-Founder of Mention Me said: “With third-party data disappearing, paid social delivering diminishing returns and consumers increasingly overwhelmed by endless brand advertising, our technology puts advocacy at the heart of marketing to reconnect marketers and consumers. The most successful brands are realizing how this can drive growth, increasing customer acquisition and returns across the marketing activity spectrum.”</p>
<p>Octopus Ventures Principal Uthish Ranjan, who will join Mention Me’s board, commented: “Mention Me’s pioneering approach to customer advocacy and impressive growth trajectory is creating a new strategic channel of marketing technology. We believe the team is well-positioned to accelerate its growth in the changing world of marketing, and we look forward to supporting its international expansion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://terraquantum.swiss/">Terra Quantum</a>, a Zurich, Switzerland-based startup that aims to build a Quantum-as-a-Service platform (including, eventually, its own proprietary quantum hardware), today announced that it has raised a $60 million Series A round led by <a href="https://www.lakestar.com/">Lakestar</a>, which also backed the company&#8217;s 2019 seed round. The additional investors in this round prefer to remain anonymous. According to Terra, they include two of the largest and globally renowned German family offices and one of the most influential cryptocurrency investors globally.</p>
<p>The idea behind Terra Quantum is to build a new end-to-end quantum platform. With its own quantum chips still a couple of years out, this currently means the company focuses on offering a library of quantum algorithms to its customers and quantum security tools, including a quantum key distribution service.</p>
<p>As for its own hardware, the company tells me that it is &#8220;very interested in superconducting qubits.&#8221; It currently offers its users access to simulated virtual qubits and is able to support workloads on any of the currently available hardware platforms, no matter the topology or architecture.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Series A funding round enables us to drive forward our leading position in the field of quantum computing as we have evolved from a DeepTech start-up into a global quantum business,&#8221; said Markus Pflitsch, founder and CEO of Terra Quantum. &#8220;I am extremely proud of our recent milestones having launched the first hybrid quantum cloud data center (QMware) and a super-secure global quantum protocol based on quantum key distribution (QKD), and grateful for the support of all of our partners who have and will support us on our path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terra Quantum currently counts a number of DAX40 companies in the automotive and biotech industry among its clients.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to expand its R&amp;D capabilities (something it&#8217;ll need if it wants to build its own quantum hardware) and extend its Quantum-as-a-Service offering (for which it&#8217;ll need that hardware).</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in partnering with exceptional technology founders. We have trusted the incredible potential of Terra Quantum&#8217;s quantum technology from day one,&#8221; said Lakestar partner and CTO Stephen Nundy. &#8220;Terra Quantum has consistently proven its leading role in driving the second quantum revolution. Its pioneering quantum applications have tremendous potential, for example to solve the imminent quantum cryptography challenges. We are incredibly excited to further support Terra Quantum in its continued growth on a global scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in March Vienna-based <a href="http://PlanRadar.com">PlanRadar</a> snapped up a €30 million Series A to digitize construction and real estate. The Austrian startup &#8211; a platform for documentation and communication in construction and real estate projects &#8211; is continuing its funding roll with a $70 million fundraising round co-led by Insight Partners and Quadrille Capital.</p>
<p>The round also drew participation from existing investors including Headline, Berliner Volksbank Ventures, aws Gründerfonds, and Cavalry Ventures, plus new investors Proptech1, Russmedia and GR Capital. </p>
<p>To add context to that, this is a significant raise for an Austrian company and PlanRadar claims it’s the third-largest Series B in Austrian history to date. I&#8217;ve detailed previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/vienna/">detailed</a> how Austria is one of the newer, emerging tech hubs in Europe in one of my European city surveys.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>PlanRadar now plans new offices in the US, Australia, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The company will also boost R&amp;D investment and hopes to double its global headcount over the coming 12 months.</p>
<p>Since launching in Vienna, Austria, in 2013, PlanRadar says it has grown revenues by over 250% and more than doubled its customer base to 14,500 customers in over 60 countries. It has launched 10 new markets across Europe and Russia since 2020, with offices in Vienna, London, Amsterdam, Moscow, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zagreb, Warsaw, and Bucharest.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Imam, PlanRadar Co-Founder and Co-CEO said: “We’re on a mission to make construction and building operations easier to manage, and we’ve proven there’s a huge global appetite for our technology.”</p>
<p>Thomas Krane, Principal at Insight Partners said: “The PropTech sector is poised for enormous growth, and PlanRadar is bringing the global construction and real estate industry into the digital future.” </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Competitors to PlanRadar include Bluebeam Revu, Autodesk Construction Cloud, Procore, and IBM&#8217;s TRIRIGA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">M2P Fintech, a payments infrastructure startup that has established market dominance in India, has raised $56 million in a new financing round, less than three months after closing its previous funding, as it works to deepen its footprints in several international geographies.</p>
<p>Insight Partners, the New York-based private equity and venture capital firm, led the Chennai-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series C financing round. MUFG Innovation Partners, part of the giant Japanese bank, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-in-talks-to-back-indian-fintech-yap/">existing investors Tiger Global and Better Capital</a> also participated in the ongoing round.</p>
<p>The new round, which moves <a href="http://m2pfintech.com">M2P</a>&#8216;s all-time raise to $107 million, has seen the startup nearly double its valuation to about $605 million in a span of just three months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>M2P Fintech, founded by two Visa alums, has two core offerings. It helps banks and other financial institutions that have the regulatory licenses but need help with tech to launch banking services.</p>
<p>“We also help them upgrade their tech stack. There’s a movement underway as banks are transitioning from being capex-heavy product implementation model to opex, SaaS-kind of model,” said Madhusudanan R, co-founder and chief executive of M2P Fintech, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Scores of tier 1 as well as fast-emerging fintech-friendly banks are customers of M2P Fintech, which is helping them power their new-generation services, he said.</p>
<p>The startup’s second marquee offering is providing the payments layer to hundreds of fintech startups with card offerings (such as Slice and Open) to manage their entire money flow. For instance, if a fintech startup wants to launch a new offering, they may want to work with half a dozen banks. This will require building their own pipelines to tap the banks&#8217; APIs. They can instead work with M2P Fintech, which already has the railroads in place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

(Image credits: M2P Fintech)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;M2P is India’s leading fintech infrastructure-as-a-service company – they knit together the broadest set of banking and fintech relationships in the market and have built powerful products delivered as an API with a strong commitment to customer delight,&#8221; said Nikhil Sachdev, Managing Director at Insight Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>“M2P’s stellar founding team and rapid growth have established the company as a clear market-leader that is transforming financial innovation in the region. We’re excited to partner with Madhu and team as they continue to scale up.”</p>
<p>The startup, which largely bootstrapped its growth for nearly five years, today operates in nearly two-dozen markets in Asia and North Africa. Madhusudanan said the startup is planning to expand its presence in those markets, expand to some new ones, and port many of the product features that are popular in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a very micro-level, a lot of fintech action that is happening in India is getting replicated in other markets,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also eyeing some acquisition opportunities to fuel inorganic growth in adjacent categories. The startup, which last year acquired two startups, is currently eyeing acquiring over half a dozen more, he said.</p>
<p>M2P Fintech is at a unique position currently. It faces little to no competition and is a direct beneficiary of the increasingly fierce battle among fintech startups as most of them are its customers. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There are firms with similar offerings as M2P such as Marqeta, which went public last year and quickly assumed a market cap of over $16 billion, in the U.S. But most of these firms &#8212; and there aren&#8217;t many &#8212; have yet to expand into Asian nations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Madhusudanan said he hopes that more players will emerge in India and other Asia markets in the next few years. &#8220;I think there is easily room for three to four, billion dollar companies in the space,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wandercraft was founded in 2012, with the vision of improving mobility of wheelchair users. The company’s solution comes by way of exoskeletons, which can offer wearers the ability to walk with robotic assistance. In 2019, the Parisian firm launched Atalante, a self-balancing exoskeleton with 12 degrees of freedom that relies on walking on algorithms to determine a user’s gait.</p>
<p>Today, the firm announced that it has closed a $45 million Series C, which more than doubles the $30.5 million the company has raised to-date. The round was led by Quadrant Management, a U.S.-based firm, along with existing investor Bpifrance. Quadrant’s participation is particularly noteworthy here, as it finds the company expanding Atalante’s reach beyond Europe, into the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are super excited to have attracted world-class investors from the USA and Europe to advance the development program of the company,&#8221; the company’s CEO Matthieu Masselin said in a release. &#8220;With the support of patients, medical professionals and the DeepTech community, Wandercraft’s team has created a unique technology that improves rehabilitation care and will soon enable people in wheelchairs to regain autonomy and improve their everyday health.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company will be entering a crowded market as it takes on the U.S., which is home to a number of prominent exoskeleton companies, like ReWalk Robotics, Ekso, SuitX and Sarcos, which have thus far raised a ton of money and announced some high-profile partnerships. One of the things that sets the company apart, however, is a fairly single-minded focus on user mobility, where much of the competition also focuses on things like labor and or a military audience.</p>
<p>That means, in, part, partnering with hospitals and other healthcare providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://luko.eu">Luko</a> is acquiring German startup <a href="https://www.coya.com">Coya</a> in order to grow its European presence and get an insurance license from German regulator. While Luko isn’t disclosing terms of the deal, the company says it’s a 100% share deal, which means that Coya investors are now Luko investors. Those investors include Valar Ventures, Headline and Roland Berger’s family office.</p>
<p>Luko started as a home insurance company for both homeowners and renters. It’s a big market as you have to prove that your home is insured when you rent or buy a home in France. Since then, the company has expanded with new insurance products and services.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional insurance companies, Luko has chosen a direct-to-customer model. People sign up on Luko’s website or in the company’s app directly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After that, Luko tries to be as efficient as possible. You can chat with the company in the app directly. When the insurance pays you back, it tries to send you the money as quickly as possible. For instance, you can receive money instantly on a <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> account.</p>
<p>When it comes to transparency, Luko takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. If there’s money left at the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share.</p>
<p>And the startup has been quite successful. It has attracted 220,000 customers — in particular, the customer base has doubled between November 2020 and November 2021. Luko started accepting clients in Spain a few months ago as well.</p>
<p>Coya, on the other hand, offers various insurance products for the German market. Insurance products include home content, private liability, dog liability and bike insurance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following today’s acquisition, Coya is going to be called Luko Insurance AG. Coya’s 80,000 clients are joining Luko’s customer base, which means that Luko now has 300,000 clients in total.</p>
<p>More importantly, Coya has obtained an insurance license in Germany. Luko is going to leverage that license across all its markets thanks to European passporting rules. This way, Luko controls a bigger chunk of the insurance stack.</p>
<p>Up next, Luko has ambitious goals as it plans to build a European leader in the insurtech startup space. The company plans to hire 100 new employees this year alone. By 2023, the startup wants to reach one million customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.staffany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StaffAny</a>, a management platform for SMEs with shift workers, has raised a $3.4 million Series A led by GGV Capital. The round included participation from East Ventures, FreakOut Shinsei Fund, Far East Ventures, Farquhar Venture Capital and angel investors including Allen Shim, former CFO of Slack. The round will be used to expand into more markets and develop new features for StaffAny’s platform, which currently operates in seven countries, including Singapore, where it is based, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It brings the startup’s total raised to $4.2 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder Janson Seah told TechCrunch that StaffAny is used by businesses with more than 30 employees, and serves clients ranging from single outlets to chains with more than 1,000 employees. “Whilst we serve smaller businesses perfectly, there is much larger value for SMEs with aspirations to scale where labor processes need to be optimized with data and visibility,” he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before onboarding to the platform, a lot of StaffAny’s clients, who are primarily in the F&amp;B or retail sectors, were using spreadsheets, punch cards or apps that do not sync rosters, pay slips and leave management the way StaffAny does. The software also provides both management and workers with the ability to communicate in real-time.</p>

<p>Its features include an online rostering schedule that enables managers to view staff schedules across different outlets and forecast where workers might be needed and labor costs for the next week. Empty shifts are automatically scheduled and staffers are immediately notified about changes to their hours or additional shift requests. They can clock in and out through StaffAny using their smartphones, replacing punch-in cards or manual sign-ins, and adjustments to payroll are made automatically if their hours change. Both staff and management can see timesheets, so errors can be spotted. This means less disputes over pay slips.</p>
<p>StaffAny’s other features includes ones to handle leave requests and track employee work performance in case of auditing. To adapt to the pandemic, it also added features for contact tracing, testing reminders or vaccination status, depending on each country’s regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In statement, GGV Capital global managing partner Jixun Foo said, “Despite F&amp;B being the worst-hit industry by COVID-19, StaffAny saw strong growth and unprecedented adoption among the SMEs, a testament to its product and the resiliency of its leadership team. SMB tech is a sector GGV invests in globally. We are excited to work with StaffAny as they expand and scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS Labs has raised $42 million in a new financing round, less than three months after closing its previous funding, and acquired two startups as it looks to aggressively grow its automation platform that serves sales and support teams at small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital India led SaaS Labs’ Series B round. Base 10 Partners and Eight Roads Ventures, two existing backers, as well as entrepreneurs Anand Chandrasekaran, Allison Pickens, Michael Stoppelman, and Amit Agarwal participated in the round. The new funding follows California and Noida-headquartered startup&#8217;s $18 million Series A raise in October.</p>
<p>For big businesses and enterprises, scores of tools exist to bring more efficiency in their sales and support operations. But the same isn’t true of small and medium-sized businesses. That was the learning Gaurav Sharma walked away with at his previous venture, called HelloSociety, in the US. (The firm was acquired by The New York Times.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259866" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“SMBs are very underloved and underserved if you look at the software offerings they have at their fingertips,” he told TechCrunch in an interview. Enterprises, in comparison, “have access to awesome tools to improve the productivity of their agents,” he said.</p>
<p>For the last six years, <a href="https://www.saaslabs.co">SaaS Labs</a> has been building AI-powered tools that are “equally powerful” to empower sales and support teams at smaller firms. These offerings are no-code solutions, removing the need of having an IT team to deploy it.</p>
<p>“These tools are also very affordable and integrate seamlessly with other business stacks and on-premise hardware solutions that small businesses rely on,” he said.</p>
<p>The challenge over 15 million sales and support agents face today is that they have to manually update their call logs and CRM tools that are not designed to offer real-time updates to their managers. This creates a gap in their communication channels, where no intervention can happen in real-time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2259868" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259868" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2259868 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/justcall-offering.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259868" class="wp-caption-text">Dashboard of JustCall, a SaaS Labs offering that allows SMBs to set up a cloud-based contact center for sales or support teams within minutes.

<p>“Chaos starts happening when you’ve a five-person team that is doing customer communication. So these teams can use our offering called JustCall.io, for instance, which integrates with over 100 other business tools. JustCall, which has a database of over 100 million calls to work through, uses machine learning to access the quality of the calls and whether the playbook or workflow is being followed. Managers then can only looks at the calls that have been poorly graded instead of trying to sift through every call,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 6,000 customers globally. It typically sees a small business join the platform by paying as little as $25 a month and overtime happily move to paying tens of thousands of dollars annually as their businesses grow.</p>
<p>Over 70% of these customers are based in the U.S. today, and 10% in the UK. Some of its customers include Grab, GoStudent, Booksy, HelloFresh.</p>
<p>The startup, which has been profitable for years, said it grew its revenue by 2.5 times last year.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it also announced two acquisitions – Poland-based CallPage, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/callpage-lets-you-call-your-website-visitors/">callback automation tool for sales teams</a> to connect with their leads instantly, and France-based Atolia, a productivity and collaboration tool. (Their teams will join Saas Labs as full-time employees.) Sharma said these acquisitions are helping SaaS Labs broaden its product offerings and also deepen its footprints in various markets.</p>
<p>A portion of the new funds will be deployed to acquire many more startups, said Sharma.</p>
<p>“While we are well-capitalized, this round gives us the firepower needed to double down on what&#8217;s working, hire great talent globally, launch innovative products, focus on brand marketing and get aggressive with strategic M&amp;As. As SMBs continue to adopt software to modernize different functions like sales, support, and marketing, etc. within their business, we are confident that SaaS Labs will be able to capture that opportunity and grow 30x in the coming 5-7 years.”</p>
<p>He is looking to take SaaS Labs public within the next four to five years, he said.</p>
<p>“SaaS Labs is building a multi-channel customer communication platform for small and medium businesses. Through a suite of products, it offers an experience that marries the efficiency of digital and the intimacy of offline communication channels,” said Tejashwi Sharma, MD at Sequoia Capital India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Its flagship product JustCall, for example, has been able to drive deep impact. Customers, on average, reported time savings of 12 hours a week per agent on manual tasks while customer satisfaction improved by 30%. Sequoia Capital India is thrilled to partner with Gaurav and the team as they build the future of customer communication,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another startup focused on SMEs in Southeast Asia has announced a funding round. <a href="https://www.dropee.com/">Dropee</a>, a Malaysia-based B2B wholesale platform that also offers financial services, like working capital loans, to SMEs, said today it has closed a Series A round totaling $7 million. The <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dropee">Y Combinator alum</a> raised $3 million in equity and $4 million in debt, led by returning investor Vynn Capital. Other participants included HCL Capital, Resolution Venture and LKF Capital, along with returning investors Brama One Ventures.</p>
<p>Operational in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, Dropee plans to introduce new financing products for wholesalers and retailers over the next 12 months by working with strategic partners, including regional banks and non-banking financial institutions. It has now raised a total of $8.7 million.</p>

<p>Launched 5 years ago, Dropee focuses primarily on food and beverages and fast-moving consumer goods. The startup says it is used by over 80,000 SMEs, mainly small retail stores, to buy wholesale inventory through its marketplace, and now totals more than $100 million in annualized transaction value. Its marketplace is integrated with a SaaS e-commerce platform that automates payment collection, tracks orders and sales and manages offline-to-online orders.</p>
<p>Lennise Ng, CEO of Dropee, said the startup was created because she and one of her co-founders came “from family businesses that are involved in B2B trading on fast-moving consumer goods products for over two generations.” That gave them a close-up look at inefficiencies in the wholesale trading space across Southeast Asia. Dropee was created to make the process more efficient.</p>
<p>For example, the platform makes product recommendations through its AI-based smart catalog: each B2B consumer sees a personalized selection of best-selling goods, complementary products and campaigns based on their business needs. SMEs can also order directly from its wholesale marketplace or an assigned sales agent, allowing wholesalers real-time transparency and allowing orders to process more quickly.</p>
<p>Dropee began offering financial products in November 2020, including up to 60 days credit financing for invoices and supply chain. “It can be challenging for traditional wholesalers to extend longer credit terms to SMEs, especially during the pandemic,” Ng said. She added that credit financing for retailers helps increase the number of immediate inventory purchases. To gauge creditworthiness and loan terms, Dropee uses multiple variables captured through its platform, including an SME’s transaction data to lifetime value per business network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new round of financing will be used to expand Dropee’s supply chain financing, with plans to work with more brands and wholesalers across Southeast Asia to extend credit term payments for SME retailers.</p>

The Google Play Games PC application, which was announced last month during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS4m2O3V93o">The Game Awards event</a>, allows people to play Google Play games on Windows PCs, in addition to currently supported platforms like mobile, tablet and ChromeOS. The new PC support will include both laptops and desktops, Google said, and players will be able to pick up from where they left off when switching from another device, like their Android phone, over to their computer.</p>
<p>The company had previously announced the first markets to gain access to the PC app, which was expected to arrive in early 2022. However, an exact date had not yet been given.</p>
<p>After gaining access to the beta, testers will be able to try out popular mobile games like &#8220;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang,&#8221; &#8220;Summoners War,&#8221; &#8220;State of Survival: The Joker Collaboration,&#8221; and &#8220;Three Kingdoms Tactic,&#8221; which already reach hundreds of millions of players worldwide each month. In total, beta testers will have access to more than 25 games, Google says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new PC app lets users browse through the catalog, then download and play games on a larger screen, while also taking advantage of their mouse and keyboard inputs. Users&#8217; gameplay progress, meanwhile, swill sync between devices, and they&#8217;ll continue to early Play Points when gaming on the PC, Google today noted.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TqkKjtp34Jg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The PC app&#8217;s launch follows a recent move from Microsoft to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/microsoft-starts-testing-android-apps-on-windows-11/">bring Android apps to Windows 11</a>, which included a partnership with Amazon and its own Amazon Appstore, as demand for cross-platform gameplay has heated up. But the Google Play Games for PC app isn&#8217;t being built in partnership with Microsoft &#8212; it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s own app, which it built in-house and distributes. It&#8217;s also not a game streaming service. Players will download the games to their computer in order to play.</p>
<p>As the beta version goes to launch, Google says it will publish more details for Android developers that will help them optimize their existing games to be compatible with Windows PCs, so they&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of the expanded access the PC app will provide. Google had said last month that, with the launch of a Windows app, Google Play games could reach a gaming ecosystem of 2.5 billion monthly active users, across platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Timed alongside this news at 4 PM PT today, Google will launch <a href="https://developer.android.com/games/playgames">a developer website</a> for those interested in participating in the beta where they can express interest and opt-in to receive updates as the beta continues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 19, 2022! What a news roundup we have for you today: China’s changing venture landscape, the power of passwords, no-code startups, and why women are still raising paltry sums compared to men. Please enjoy! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/tiktok-bytedance-dissolves-strategic-investment-arm/">China’s corporate venture landscape hits regulatory wall</a>: Chinese tech giant ByteDance dissolved its strategic investment team, it became known today. The news comes as other sources reported that the country’s government may require larger internet firms to get approval before making investments. If that comes to bear, the ByteDance news could prove more harbinger than one-off, perhaps reducing the total capital available to startups in the country.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/why-arent-female-founders-getting-a-bigger-piece-of-the-pie-theories-abound/">Funding for women founders continues to disappoint</a>: New data indicates that less than 2% of VC funding last year went to all-women teams. The dollar amount rose as the larger venture landscape grew, but the data was still more than desultory. What’s going on? TechCrunch explored the question.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/when-will-vcs-hit-the-brakes/">When will VCs hit the brakes</a>? The boom in venture capital activity that the world recorded last year, and appears to be still afoot today, is increasingly in contrast to falling valuations for public tech companies. The rising dissonance between public concern and private enthusiasm has us wondering when VCs might slow their roll just a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest piece of startup news today is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/1password-series-c-funding/">1Password raised a massive $620 million round at a valuation of $6.8 billion</a>. The new funding was led by Iconiq Growth, and saw participation from a murderers’ row of venture capital firms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Putatively a Series C, the investment comes after the company raised a huge $200 million Series A and a similarly large $100 million Series B. Companies waiting to raise capital and then raising a big check is rare, but not so rare that we don’t occasionally see the news event double up. Such was the case today: Dovetail, which, after raising a modest amount since its birth and only burning half the funds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/dovetail-raises-63m-to-grow-its-researcher-focused-software-business/">raised a massive $63 million Series A, it announced today</a>.</p>
<p>1Password, of course, is a password manager, while Dovetail is building researcher-focused software for corporate teams.</p>
<p>Before we turn to venture capital rounds, let’s chat about some fund news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/the-berserk-pace-of-fintech-investing-outshines-the-global-vc-boom/">The pace of fintech investing is pretty insane</a>: The venture capital domain is awash in superlative numbers, enormous sums, titanic tallies and big rounds. But perhaps the single biggest niche, or at least the one that seems to make the most noise, is fintech. So we dug into that category to find out more.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/israels-viola-ventures-hits-250m-for-its-new-fund-appoints-yael-alroy-as-partner/">Viola Ventures closes $250M</a>: The Israeli tech scene has been more than busy in recent years, evidence of which can be found in that Viola’s latest fund was “oversubscribed and reached its hard cap,” TechCrunch reports. The firm now has $1.25 billion under management.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/inflection-raises-40-million-for-its-second-crypto-focused-fund/">It turns out you can raise a small crypto fund</a>: As crypto funds reach the billion-dollar mark and often soar right past that figure, it’s almost nice to find a smaller capital pool. Inflection raised a blockchain-focused fund worth just under $41 million, and our own Romain Dillet took a peek. (And speaking of crypto, POAP, or the “proof of attendance protocol” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/web3-proof-of-attendance-startup-raises-10m-to-mint-shared-memories-as-nfts/">just raised $10 million</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/tom-bradys-buzzy-celebrity-nft-startup-autograph-banks-170m-from-silicon-valleys-top-crypto-investors/">something involving Tom Brady and NFTs raised $170 million</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, the day’s deluge of new capital rounds from a bevy of startups:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/former-spacex-engineers-bring-autonomous-electric-rail-vehicle-startup-out-of-stealth/">$49.55M for autonomous electric rail transit</a>: Parallel Systems, founded by a crew of former SpaceX folks, wants to “build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles.” It just came out of stealth. Decarbonization is hot. Autonomy is hot. Transit is hot. So it’s not a surprise that the company just landed eight figures of capital.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/lattice-raises-175m-more-at-a-3b-valuation-for-its-people-management-platform/">HR tech firm Lattice raises $175M at a $3B valuation:</a> The new round, a Series F, will go to build out its people-management service. Given that we’re in a never-ending pandemic and the work landscape has been forever shifted, it’s not a huge surprise that folks are lining up to fund Lattice’s work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/a16z-avenir-and-google-back-south-african-mobile-games-publisher-carry1st-in-20m-round/">South African mobile games company lands $20M</a>: Meet Carry1st, a social games publisher that just landed eight figures. The round indicates that the African continent’s fruitful 2021 fundraising cycle is persisting into the new year, and marks a16z’s first investment in a startup with an African HQ.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/filmhub-backed-by-6-8m-from-a16z-and-others-helps-filmmakers-get-their-work-streamed/">Filmhub is like the DistroKid for movies</a>: If you make a movie and want to have it land on streaming channels, you might need some help. Filmhub just raised $6.8 million to help filmmakers get their work onto “more than 100 streaming channels,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/softrs-series-a-is-a-reminder-that-the-no-code-boom-continues/">Softr raises on the strength of the no-code market</a>: Softr’s product lets folks build apps from data sets – today Airtable, with more on the way – and intends to create a marketplace of templates and extensions in the future. It just landed $13.5 million to keep at it. TechCrunch covered its seed round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/softr/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close us out, Revolut is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-the-us/">launching stock trading in the United States</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/a-hard-rain-is-coming-for-uks-crypto-boom/">there could be rainy days ahead for crypto in the U.K</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Microsoft’s $2T+ market cap makes its $68B Activision buy a cheap bet</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2259527" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259527" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1237816149.jpg" alt="Microsoft's Xbox One video game console and Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare video game arranged in Denver, Colorado, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022. Microsoft Corp. agreed to buy Activision Blizzard Inc. in a $68.7 billion deal, uniting two of the biggest forces in video games to create the worlds third-biggest gaming company.

<p>Risk is an essential part of gambling, so it may be improper to describe Microsoft’s planned purchase of Activision Blizzard as a “bet.”</p>
<p>Considering that Microsoft has a market cap over $2 trillion, purchasing a gaming company that pumps out titles like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and Candy Crush for $68 billion isn’t exactly fraught with danger.</p>
<p>According to Box CEO Aaron Levie, the move solidifies Redmond’s entry into AR/VR gaming.</p>
<p>“If you believe VR and immersive computing is the future — whether for consumer or business use cases — Activision helps Microsoft build a flywheel of content and technology that gets more users on board to this future.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said around 400 customer accounts have been compromised in a hack </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergLive/status/1483841347824099330"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview with Bloomberg TV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday. His confirmation of the breach comes after multiple Crypto.com users alleged their funds had been stolen – complaints that had until now been met with vague responses from the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Marszalek did not provide details as to how the hack occurred, he told Bloomberg TV that the exchange was back online “about 13-14 hours” after the incident and that all the impacted accounts were reimbursed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marszalek’s statement marks the first official acknowledgment by Crypto.com that a hack did, in fact, occur. Crypto.com first paused withdrawals on its platform on Sunday after noting </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1483050866894868484"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a “small number of users [are] reporting suspicious activity on their accounts.” It also asked customers to reset their two-factor authentication out of “an abundance of caution.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company then reassured users numerous times in its communications that customer funds were safe, drawing speculation that Crypto.com would cover any customer losses incurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The losses may amount to $15 million worth of ETH, blockchain security provider PeckShield tweeted on Monday. PeckShield claimed in the tweet that about half of the funds were being sent to Tornado Cash to be “washed.” Tornado Cash </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TornadoCash"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it provides “non-custodial anonymous transactions” on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning it can hide where crypto is being sent. Another analyst from blockchain data firm OXT Research </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-breach-may-be-worth-up-to-33m-suggests-onchain-analyst"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the hack may actually have cost the exchange $33 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the scope of the losses, Marszalek told Bloomberg TV that Crypto.com was still working on a post-mortem of the incident that would be posted on the company’s blog “in the next couple of days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Crypto.com is </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/crypto_com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world’s fourth-largest crypto exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has been pushing hard into U.S. markets in recent months, with stunts including viral advertisements featuring actor Matt Damon and a $700 million purchase of the naming rights to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers Arena. It calls itself the “fastest-growing” crypto exchange and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/crypto-com-500-million-fund-web3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded its venture capital arm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $500 million to back early-stage startups in the space earlier this week; the fallout regarding this week&#8217;s hack could threaten to stall some of its stateside growth.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Employees across industries are quitting their jobs. One recent study reported that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/1-in-4-workers-quit-their-job-this-year-according-to-new-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in four</a> people quit their job this year. Whether we want to chalk it up to career moves that were delayed due to the uncertain pandemic economy, a reevaluation of work environments, or a revolt against unsatisfactory employers, one thing is certain: It’s a job seeker’s market, with more than <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million</a> job openings as of November.</p>
<p>Many of these job seekers have disabilities, as these employees were disproportionately impacted by COVID-related layoffs – March to April 2020 saw a <a href="https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SEED_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> reduction in workers with disabilities. With so many organizations already reevaluating their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, recruiters need to identify access as a key ingredient for developing a workplace that welcomes <em>all</em>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259542" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not only is deploying accessible hiring practices the right thing to do – and a requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) – but it could also help mitigate widespread labor shortages, connecting companies to a large, talented pool of applicants.</p>
<p>But before developing strategies for reaching applicants with disabilities, there are some myths and misconceptions to confront.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> We’d have to lower our hiring standards if we want to include people with disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> People with disabilities often <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-018-9602-5#ref-CR56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outperform</a> others. What’s more, companies inclusive to people with disabilities see <a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20181029T185446Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-89/Accenture-Disability-Inclusion-Research-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28%</a> greater annual revenue as a result of increased innovation that develops inclusive products to capture new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Employees with disabilities will have a higher rate of absence than others.</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> People with disabilities often track equal or better attendance rates. They also have lower <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10672-008-9063-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turnover rates</a>, a problem that&#8217;s greatly impacted productivity in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Accommodations will be too expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> First, <a href="https://askjan.org/topics/costs.cfm?csSearch=2546498_1">56%</a> of accommodations have zero cost. And of those that do incur a cost, 50% cost less than $500. Add in the increased profits and shareholder returns expected from disability-inclusive hiring, and organizations can only expect to gain.</p>
<p>Once organizations realize the positive impact of a culture of accessibility, they can begin exploring ways to hire candidates with disabilities using these guidelines from Loule Gebremedhin and Jennifer Stark of <a href="https://www.disabilityrightsca.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disability Rights California</a>, a public advocacy organization advancing the rights of Californians with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Phase 1: Recruitment</h2>
<h3>Look in the mirror</h3>
<p>Before even embarking on the recruitment process, organizations need to look inward. It’s not just a matter of realizing the facts and accepting people with disabilities as competent employees. It’s about valuing the expertise and experience of employees with disabilities and creating an environment that supports their professional growth.</p>
<p>Set clear goals by asking questions: What is our current culture around disabilities? Are we prepared to accommodate growth and retention? How does an equitable hiring process connect to our bigger goals?</p>
<p>Part of this internal review should focus on benefits. It’s no secret that great benefits can often be the deal-maker or -breaker for any candidate as they weigh opportunities. For people with disabilities, the stakes are higher. For many, a comprehensive physical and mental healthcare plan is a top consideration in selecting an employer.</p>
<p>Remote work is another important benefit. We’ve all witnessed the advantages of working from home this year, from a lower commute time/cost, greater flexibility around childcare and higher productivity. People with disabilities saw these advantages, too, along with the ability to design a personal work environment that meets their needs — for example, people with low vision can dictate how much light they need in the room to best support them.</p>
<h3>Prepare the application</h3>
<p>Next, recruiters need to revise job descriptions and applications to ensure they’re disability-friendly. Rather than talking about <em>how</em> a job needs to get done, reframe descriptions to focus on the end skills needed to accomplish goals (e.g., strong oral communication versus the ability to effectively communicate). <a href="https://production-askearn-org.s3.amazonaws.com/EARN_Explainer_Job_Descriptions_Checklist_ab47437635.pdf">This guide</a> from the Employee Assistance and Resource Network can help develop descriptions.</p>
<p>Locating and filling out job applications is a top challenge for people with disabilities, with many digital applications not meeting accessibility requirements. This not only diminishes the number of applicants with disabilities, but can also open organizations to legal risk under the ADA. Training and tools that help developers produce accessible sites and forms supporting the application process are easy ways to ensure all qualified candidates have equal access while simultaneously maintaining compliance.</p>
<h2>Phase 2: Interviews</h2>
<h3>Proactively accommodate</h3>
<p>People with disabilities are accustomed to requesting accommodations – but what if they didn’t have to? An interview process that offers accommodations upfront confirms to job seekers that accessibility matters to the organization (and it’s also required under the ADA).</p>
<p>For example, for in-person interviews, consider whether a person in a wheelchair could easily get to the location. For virtual interviews, double-check that your meeting platform has automated captioning switched on at the very least. Even better if you’ve got a live captioner or ASL provider available.</p>
<h3>Train hiring managers</h3>
<p>Hiring managers’ <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w21560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biases</a> are at the core of the low employment rates for people with disabilities. Organizations can play an active role in building awareness and mitigating bias by implementing training around basic disability etiquette and ethical, ADA-compliant questioning. Including people with disabilities on hiring panels can also increase mindfulness of disabilities.</p>
<h2>Phase 3: Offers</h2>
<p>When it’s time to hire employees with disabilities, organizations need to take steps to provide an offer that’s both competitive and meets candidates’ needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure compensation is on par with similar roles across the industry</strong> – Remember that people with disabilities are often unfairly paid less, with some policies still in place allowing workers with disabilities to be paid <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/17/912840482/u-s-agency-urges-end-to-below-minimum-wage-for-workers-with-disabilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than minimum wage</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Create a system for providing accommodations </strong>– Ensure potential employees know they can request accommodations and have a policy for responding to and meeting requests. The <a href="https://askjan.org/info-by-role.cfm#for-employers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Job Accommodation Network</a> can help provide insight into which accommodations to provide.</li>
<li><strong>Build mentoring and retention programs</strong> – Offer specialized mentoring, education, and networking opportunities to support growth and leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past year, organizations have made great strides in considering diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. Accessibility is part of this equation and needs to be seen as such for organizations to meet their overarching goals.</p>
<p>Beyond doing the right thing, fostering a hiring process that seeks candidates with disabilities and provides an environment in which they can thrive can help mitigate current staffing gaps, power innovation, and support a strong organizational culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Podcasts is rolling out a new &#8220;Listen With&#8221; editorial franchise to give users a new way to discover podcasts. The company says Listen With helps users discover new shows by sharing those that popular artists, authors, filmmakers, journalists, influencers and other podcasters are listening to. Each collection includes a few shows and quotes about why they were selected to be featured. The collections are curated by Apple&#8217;s editorial team and are now available in the United States and Canada and can be found in the &#8220;Browse&#8221; section of the Apple Podcasts app.</p>
<p>The first collection is with Jay Shetty, who is an author, life coach and former monk. In his collection, Shetty recommends &#8220;A Slight Change of Plans&#8221; with Maya Shankar from Pushkin Industries; &#8220;Anything goes with Emma Chamberlain&#8221; from Ramble; &#8220;How I Built This with Guy Raz&#8221; from NPR; &#8220;We Can Do Hard Things with Glenn Doyle&#8221; from Cadence13 and Oprah’s &#8220;SuperSoul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen With is Apple&#8217;s third editorial franchise. The company launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/apples-new-editorial-franchise-apple-podcasts-spotlight-to-highlight-interesting-creators/">&#8220;Spotlight&#8221;</a> editorial franchise last year to highlight rising podcast creators in the United States. The editorial team at Apple selects new podcast creators to feature every month and give them prominent screen real estate in the Apple Podcasts app and promote them across social media and elsewhere. Apple also has a &#8220;Kids &amp; Family&#8221; collection curated in partnership with Common Sense Media.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to launching Listen With, Apple also shared insights on podcasts subscriptions, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">launched</a> in April 2021. The company revealed that launching a subscription grows the total audience of a podcast. Apple notes that the total audience increased for the top 50 subscriptions with existing audiences on Apple Podcasts in the four weeks after their subscription launch. The company also said that among the best-performing creators, more than 10% of listeners have signed up for a subscription. Since the launch of Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, one in five subscriptions enjoy an adoption rate of more than 10%.</p>
<p>Apple has been working to expand its podcasts platform and it&#8217;s clearly not the only one to do so. For instance, <a href="https://podnews.net/article/spotify-bigger-than-apple">Spotify has</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/spotify-agrees-to-buy-podcast-ad-tech-company-for-235-million">spent</a> over $800 million on podcast companies, like Anchor, the Ringer, Gimlet Media, and Megaphone. SiriusXM, meanwhile, has bought podcast management and analytics platform Simplecast, ad tech platform AdsWizz, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">and podcast app Stitcher</a>. On the other hand, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-podcast-network-wondery/">has acquired</a> the podcast network Wondery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many ways of spinning up a startup, but it takes a particularly brave set of founders to take on a deeply entrenched industry with a small number of incumbents who have the market all sown up. You&#8217;d have to be a special flavor of bold to take on internet search for example &#8212; where the name of the leading company is literally synonymous with searching for something on the internet. The world of speakers is similar; the technology has barely moved in the past hundred years, and only a handful of manufacturers create almost every single speaker element that plays the sweet dulcet tones of Shania Twain into the ether around you.</p>
<p>Plenty of startups think they can put a dent in this world, and every year, I see dozens of pitches for companies that are &#8220;making speakers better&#8221; in various ways. And every year, it falls flat. Yes, innovations are happening, but core speaker technology rarely moves in a way that could be described as truly innovative. At CES this year, I got to talking with the team of <a href="https://www.mayht.com/">Mayht</a>, which might just be the exception to that general rule.</p>
<p>The company has created speakers that are pointing in opposite directions of each other, with motors that move the speaker elements apart at the same time &#8212; creating a similar motion to you clapping your hands. That means that the speakers are perfectly balanced. The company claims the impact is more bang for the buck, and that the more-compact speakers can be more energy efficient in use, and smaller to ship and store. The speaker tech is interesting, but what really piqued my interest was how a small rag-tag bunch of innovators from the Netherlands is planning to shake things up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259521" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Mayht is a technology company. Early on in its journey, it realized that in the world of speaker tech, there&#8217;s not much point in going head-to-head against the behemoths in the space. Armed with a handful of patents and some cool reference speakers (i.e. prototypes they can show off to potential partners), the company is hoping to build what is essentially an outsourced R&amp;D arm. They are the skunkworks that creates new and interesting tech, before licencing it to the well-known speaker brands out there. I decided to take a closer look at the little Dutch startup, and how it is taking on one of the most well-entrenched industries in consumer electronics.</p>
<p>In this interview, I talk with the Mayht team and its investors to figure out what the special sauce is when you&#8217;re a scrappy David in a world of Goliaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on this speaker technology since 2016. In the first couple of years we were just creating prototypes, but now we got a lot of stuff that is really close to mass production &#8212; or in mass production. We&#8217;re not a manufacturer of drivers, we just defend the technology and we license it,&#8221; explains Mattias Scheek, CEO at Mayht. &#8220;We can finally show our technology in different kinds of applications &#8212; from soundbars to small subwoofers to small voice-assistant speakers. We believe the latter, in particular, will really disrupt the market. If say, an Echo Dot can have the same sound as the Sonos One, or a soundbar. Or if a speaker without a subwoofer can have the same sound as something that does have one. It makes a big change in the market. We are finally able to show those things to the public.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company claims it has invented a new generation of speaker drivers. Whereas a typical speaker driver has a membrane, it can make limited movement, because the whole motor structure is behind the membrane. Mayht&#8217;s innovation is to put the motor structures at the sides of the membrane. That means more movement, and more displacement. You see a similar thing in automobile engines: A &#8220;bigger&#8221; engine can work in one of two ways &#8212; either you make each cylinder bigger, which means that more gas and air mixture can explode and create power. Or you make the stroke longer. Mayht is applying the same idea to speakers here. Speakers need to be smaller in a lot of different applications &#8212; the company suggests smart home speakers like the Google Mini and Alexa&#8217;s speakers, but also in vehicle tech, where space is at a premium. The company also claims that its speaker tech reduces rattle:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2259570" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mayht-speaker.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259570" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mayht-speaker.gif" alt="" width="240" height="268" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259570" class="wp-caption-text">Mayht&#8217;s speaker technology puts the motors on the side of the membranes. The theory is that this makes the speakers balanced, and able to displace a lot more air than a comparable-sized speaker with a traditional design. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mayht</p></div></p>
<p>The company doesn&#8217;t have many kind words for the current generations of smart speakers &#8212; while adding voice controllability, mesh Wi-Fi, great design, power management and great user experience were all meaningful innovations, the speaker tech itself is pretty underwhelming.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exactly the same story for all the manufacturers &#8212; Bang &amp; Olufsen, Bose, Sony. Every company uses the same technology and the same drivers because they essentially come from the same factories. There are three or four major manufacturers and all those different speaker brands take their drivers from those manufacturers. It&#8217;s not strange that there is no innovation in that field,&#8221; laments Scheek. &#8220;Because the manufacturers themselves don&#8217;t really develop drivers, they are not pushed to make higher-quality tech. They may move the needle by 1 or 2% but not to change the complete architecture of the driver. Doing so would mean changing their whole manufacturing setup, which is just a huge risk for those companies.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259587" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259587" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg 5985w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=1536,1009 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=2048,1346 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/DSC07569.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2259587" class="wp-caption-text">Taking apart a Sonos One shows you that underneath all the fancy technology is&#8230; some pretty underwhelming-looking speaker elements. (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Haje Kamps <a href="https://blog.bolt.io/sonos-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a Bolt teardown</a>)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The speaker companies are not rewarded to really, truly innovate. From a cost perspective, they have to perform for the best quality with the lowest level of cost. And so there&#8217;s no incentive for speaker manufacturers to really think out of the box to bring out something really new and innovative,&#8221; explains Max van den Berg, Mayht&#8217;s chief commercial officer. &#8220;To put this into perspective, we&#8217;ve spoken to around 45 speaker companies globally since the start of this company. None of them have seen anything like this before &#8212; this is truly disruptive innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company raised a total of €4 million in its most recent round, led by <a href="https://www.forward.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forward One</a>; I caught up with the partner who spearheaded the investment, to figure out why it felt confident to put its money behind a company that from the outside seems like it is facing an uphill battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the team makes Mayht special. The two founding brothers have been working with speakers since they were seven years old really impressed me,&#8221; said Frederik Gerner, partner at Forward One, a South Africa-based venture capital firm that is investing in hardware startups. &#8220;Their story on how they want to disrupt the speaker industry just makes so much sense! It&#8217;s a massive and still-growing market that has been operating for decades on the same technology, and it&#8217;s ready for disruption. Hardware is a real means to create a step-change in many industries, and we see the need for high-tech hardware innovation as more achievable and more important than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building out a factory to out-manufacture the existing speaker element manufacturers would be a fools&#8217; errand &#8212; one that the company is cleverly side-stepping by taking a licencing approach instead, building a very lean, engineering-focused team, and raising relatively small amounts of money. Mayht currently has 20 employees, 70% or so of whom are on the engineering side. The company also made the shrewd move of stacking its advisory board with strategically powerful folks who can add a tremendous amount of leverage, and may just be the key to building this type of company going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have some very experienced people in our advisory board who are really active in the team. There are two people who formerly worked at Philips in the licensing department. One of them actually led the licensing department and made that side of Philips a huge business. He&#8217;s really helping us with the licensing structure, but also with how you handle [patent] litigation. He&#8217;s also an incredible deal-maker,&#8221; explains Scheek.</p>

The company claims the two speakers have the same sound volume and quality. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mayht</p></div></p>
<p>The company highlights the importance of building a company that fits well with the type of startup you are building. For example, Mayht also added Piet Coelewij, who was the managing director and VP of Global Operations for Sonos for five years, to its advisory board. It also highlights the company&#8217;s chief commercial officer, Max van den Berg, who was the marketing manager for personal audio for Sony in the mid 1990s, and continued in senior executive positions within Sony for several decades after that. &#8220;Having the right people in the room really helps open doors,&#8221; Scheek mentions in what might be the understatement of the year.</p>
<p>The company created a brand that it&#8217;s hoping to use to co-brand with other companies; a shrewd move that solves a significant branding problem. Most people don&#8217;t know who made the speaker elements inside their speakers &#8212; and why would they care. But there are predicates in other industries; unless you&#8217;re a very special kind of nerd, most people don&#8217;t care who made the processors inside their computers &#8212; not until Intel decided to pick up the fight and create the &#8220;Intel inside&#8221; campaign when AMD started nipping at its heels. Mayht is taking a sheet from the same playbook, and trademarked the Heartmotion brand. It hopes that it can convince its licensees to co-brand their speakers. &#8220;Sonos powered by Heartmotion&#8221; &#8212; that sort of thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, so our technology brand for licensing would be Heartmotion. We called it that because the speaker looks like a pumping heart,&#8221; says Scheek. &#8220;Our goal is to have that on every product, and that our partners that use our technology will use it as part of the marketing on the box of the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>By minimizing the size and weight of the speaker tech, the company has a couple of clever talking points at its disposal. For car and RV makers, it means that they can cram more sound into smaller spaces &#8212; such as door panels and dashboards &#8212; without compromising on sound output. Those are obvious, but I was particularly impressed by how Mayht is tapping into a number of marketing messages that work particularly well in the current climate, where (finally!) people are starting to show some interest in greener tech. Packaging smaller speakers that have big performance and low energy consumption has a number of perhaps unexpected impacts. One example is the company&#8217;s prototype speaker that is clad in <a href="https://www.powerfoyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerfoyle light-harvesting tech</a>, which means <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/mayht-and-powerfoyle/">it&#8217;s possible to create a Bluetooth speaker that just keeps on going</a>. Energy consumption aside, smaller form factors mean less weight and less shipping volume, which has a ton of second-hand environmental benefits.</p>

<p>Between Mayht&#8217;s licencing-first business model backed by a patent portfolio strategy, a great founder story, an advisory board staffed with a who&#8217;s-who of licensing and audio experts, and the willingness to move slow enough to get things right the first time around, the company is slowly positioning itself for an interesting 2022. The team hopes it is well resourced as it&#8217;s gearing up for a year of execution after many years of research and setting the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the year of getting our products into consumers&#8217; hands, and I am excited to see that happen. We&#8217;ve been working on it while staying under the radar for quite some time. It&#8217;s been really strange &#8212; the industry knows that this is amazing, but the consumer hasn&#8217;t experienced it yet. For us, this is the year of the big reveal. In addition to working with our partners to get this to the consumer, we are going to do something ourselves&#8230;&#8221; Sheek trails off, itching to tell me the details, but remembering the recorder is running. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to announce it quite soon &#8212; in Q2 of this year. I can&#8217;t tell you much, but we are working on a reference product that the consumer can buy directly from us. We want consumers to experience this, so we are making a limited edition speaker for people to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company told me it isn&#8217;t really planning to make much money on its own product; this is really a mass-produced sample to help build brand awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building a product with the [3-inch] T3 driver ourselves because the whole industry is really starting to move once you prove yourself. We made a lot of prototypes over the past years,&#8221; explains van den Berg. The problem is that it takes a bit of time to design a new product, and the big speaker brands take their time in doing so. To really hit the ground running, the company is taking a risk and taking matters into its own hands. &#8220;We feel [third-party designed speakers] are a bit of a longer process; they need time to make decisions. Most likely, their products will be on the market by the end of 2022 or in early 2023. In the meantime, we think it&#8217;s very important that we announce this technology to the consumers. We don&#8217;t want to be a competitor of anybody out there, but we think what we are doing is cool, and we are excited to release a limited edition product; a beautiful Bluetooth speaker powered by Heartmotion.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Wth a market cap just over $2 trillion, Microsoft has vast resources to invest in the most logical parts of its business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even though consumer gaming constitutes a small fraction of its overall business, Microsoft&#8217;s announcement yesterday of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">all-cash $69 billion deal</a> to buy Activision Blizzard proves that the technology corporation takes the sector plenty seriously.</p>
<p>It is easy to think that Microsoft should have invested the money into other, perhaps more lucrative businesses in its portfolio. But with a market cap just over $2 trillion (a number so large it&#8217;s hard to wrap your head around), Microsoft has vast resources to invest in the most logical parts of its business.</p>
<p>Even if this $70 billion bet doesn’t pay out, Microsoft will come out on the other side fairly unscathed. That kind of financial power gives a company myriad options, even if it involves making one of the largest acquisitions in tech history.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that this deal comes on the heels of Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of speech-to-text company Nuance last spring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">for $20 billion</a>. That deal that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">stuck in regulatory limbo</a> in the U.K., which begs the question: Given it size and scope, could regulators end up taking a close look at the Activision Blizzard deal, what could be perceived as a gaming market land grab?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even if this $70 billion bet doesn’t pay out, Microsoft will come out on the other side fairly unscathed.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With that in mind, we&#8217;re examining this deal&#8217;s financial viability to see whether Microsoft might have been better off putting those resources into the enterprise/business side of the house, or if its resources are simply so vast that the company doesn&#8217;t have to consider the sort of tradeoffs most companies must make when it comes to an M&amp;A of this magnitude.</p>
<h2>Digging into the portfolio</h2>
<p>Although Microsoft is reporting earnings next week, we can still see the breakdown of how the company makes the majority of its money from its <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/10/26/microsoft-cloud-strength-drives-first-quarter-results-4/#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20October%2026%2C%202021%20%E2%80%94%20Microsoft,%2420.2%20billion%20and%20increased%2027%25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent report,</a> disclosed October 26, 2021. In that earnings digest, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant reported over $45 billion in revenue, with its Intelligent Cloud division accounting for $17 billion of the total, and its Productivity and Business Processes group good for $15 billion more.</p>
<p>The consumer side of the house produced more than $13 billion in top line, but gaming was just a portion of that division’s results that includes certain Windows and Surface incomes, along with search and advertising.</p>
<p>In spite of the differential in scale between the company’s entertainment work and its enterprise income, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called out gaming in its <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/microsoft-msft-q1-2022-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings report call</a> with analysts, praising its growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>And in gaming, revenue increased 16% at 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Better-than-expected console supply, and continued strong demand resulted in Xbox hardware revenue growth of 166% and 162% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior-year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly one point year over year, driven by sales mix shift to gaming hardware.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the company sees gaming as an important growth driver. How does that fit into the recent deal announcement? Not merely in terms of the company stacking accretive gaming revenues, with Constellation Research analyst Holger Mueller viewing the transaction as a way to grow related incomes via Windows and Azure cloud services.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If blockchains are immutable records of our digital history, what kinds of history do we want to inscribe on them? Predictably, most records thus far have been transaction data, but as entrepreneurs expand their ambitions for NFTs, startups are aiming to tie those asset transactions to real world events and interactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP</a>, which stands for Proof Of Attendance Protocol, wants to dial deeper into the idea of using NFT&#8217;s to create internet communities, with a protocol that helps build more active communities and award individual participation like taking part in an event. POAP is organized around badges as the visual signifier of their protocol. In the real world, a user could scan a QR code to received an NFT memento that could unlock admission to an online community and earn them future drops.</p>
<p>Plenty of this functionality exists elsewhere across Ethereum projects made possible by some of the underlying features of the blockchain which allows developers to create &#8220;snapshots&#8221; of active wallets which have been linked to the project at a given time. The POAP ecosystem also includes a number of other tools including Etheruem-backed polling, raffle contest mechanics and private chat verification tech.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259629" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup announced this week that they&#8217;ve raised a $10 million Seed round led by Archetype and Sapphire Sport with additional participation in the funding from Sound Ventures, The Chernin Group and Advancit Capital. A host of crypto native funds also invested including Collab Currency, 1KX, Libertus Capital, Red Beard Ventures, 6th Man Ventures, Delphi Digital and A Capital.</p>
<p>POAP <a href="https://decrypt.co/83614/ethereum-badge-app-poap-is-scaling-back-to-move-forward">met some challenges in 2021</a> as NFT community growth accelerated and the number of people looking to tap into their platform created an overwhelming influx of spam that brought the platform to a crawl. In a blog post, the company says it plans to use its new funding to invest in its application and platform layers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian user research software company <a href="https://dovetailapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dovetail</a> announced today that it has closed a $63 million Series A led by <a href="https://www.accel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accel</a>. The company has now raised just over $70 million in total, and it added its new capital at a valuation that it describes as &#8220;north&#8221; of $700 million.</p>
<p>As you can tell by the numbers, this is no ordinary Series A. Instead, it&#8217;s a late-stage investment of sorts by Accel, a venture capital firm that has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/how-one-vc-firm-wound-up-with-no-code-startups-as-part-of-its-investing-thesis/">history of making large investments</a> into technology companies that have raised little capital or self-funded until they raise, later in life, a large check.</p>
<p>Given that the Dovetail round is not our standard Series A fare, let&#8217;s take moment and talk through the deal, starting with the company&#8217;s early history and what&#8217;s it&#8217;s building.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259520" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Boostrapping(ish) Dovetail</h2>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Dovetail co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/humphreybc?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benjamin Humphrey</a> about the capital raise, turning the clock back to the start of the company itself. Per Humphrey, after a stint in the Bay Area working for a technology company, the New Zealander joined Atlassian in Australia, where he stayed for a multi-year tenure. After that, he co-founded Dovetail without the intention of raising venture capital, instead planning to build the company along the lines of Buffer and Basecamp, well-known technology firms that have pursued a more self-funded approach to growth.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus on building software for the user research market might sound niche, but Dovetail found enough traction in its early days to scale to a team of six with around a half-million dollars in annual revenue under its own power. At that point, however, Humphrey said, venture investors were approaching the firm, so Dovetail raised a modest round of around AUD$5 million back in 2019.</p>
<p>One of its investors, Felicis, wanted to put more capital into the company toward the end of 2020. Dovetail, its CEO said, didn&#8217;t need the money, so it raised a seed-1 round at a valuation north of $100 million, a price indicative of the position it had in the market. (Lesson: Being profitable-ish and growing is the real startup sweet spot when it comes to fundraising.)</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it, until today. Per new investors Rich Wong and Arun Mathew of Accel, Dovetail had burned only half of its total fundraising before they got the chance to invest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Software companies don&#8217;t tend to grow sans material burn in today&#8217;s market, which means that customers were showing up to buy what Dovetail is building.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Dovetail selling?</h2>
<p>The Accel duo described what Dovetail is building as a sort of new category, namely the &#8220;system of record for user research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humphrey put it in more prosaic terms, describing Dovetail&#8217;s product to TechCrunch as a productivity tool for researchers. Engineers have GitHub and designers have Figma, he said, noting that user researchers need their own software. Silicon Valley and the larger startup scene, he added, has done much work building tooling for the &#8220;D&#8221; in R&amp;D, but far less on the &#8220;R&#8221; part of the equation.</p>
<p>Dovetail&#8217;s product is software that allows customers to collect user feedback data from NPS (net promoter score) surveys, audio, video and text answers, which are then tagged by teams, machine-analyzed and shared across an organization. The goal, Humphrey said, is to build a relational database for companies to store their institutional knowledge about customers so that they can make faster decisions.</p>
<p>As an example, he said that when a product manager (PM) leaves a company, they take with them quite a lot of knowledge. This means that new PMs will have to race around asking questions of the company to get up to speed, instead of having that knowledge stored and secure. Dovetail could help companies hold onto the data and knowledge from research, making them both accessible and more permanent.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m still learning about what Dovetail does, so expect more over time as we explore the research software market. But what I can say today is that Dovetail is growing like a weed. Per Humphrey, the company tripled its revenue and customers last year. All self-serve, with the company only hiring its first acount executive a few months ago. That&#8217;s <em>actual</em> product-led growth.</p>
<p>Product-led growth, the idea that one&#8217;s actual service or good will draw in customers, is essentially a rebrand of the concept of product-market fit (PMF) &#8212; or is perhaps a more pure version of what PMF should mean. Regardless, the relatively young company is looking to match its 2021 growth rate this year, per its investors &#8212; or at least get close. And that&#8217;s why it is nearly a unicorn already.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll harangue Humphrey for growth data later this year, as he likely won&#8217;t be ringing our phone in the next months with new capital news.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m an entrepreneur in Guatemala and would like to come to the United States to expand my tech company. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the best way to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Groundbreaking Guatemalan</strong></p>
<p>Dear Groundbreaking,</p>
<p>What fantastic news that you’re looking to tackle the U.S. market. In a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/106-how-to-set-up-your-company-for-immigration-success/">podcast</a> (which is actually trending in your country the last several weeks!), I discussed my take on how to best establish a startup for immigration success. Whether a founder wants to make their way to the United States – or if they’re already here and want to start a venture of their own – we discussed the details. There are even options for companies that are newly formed with limited funding.</p>
<p>It’s important to know your options when setting up your company in the United States. This knowledge enables your company to successfully sponsor you, your founding team, and other prospective hires for visas and green cards if needed – prospective investors will also feel more comfortable investing in your company. Super important, right?! Before you get too deep into your plans, I recommend you consult both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney to assist you in your efforts.</p>

<h2>LLC versus Delaware C-corp</h2>
<p>One of the first decisions you’ll need to make is how to structure your company in the U.S. A business or corporate attorney will be able to help you make this decision. In general, both corporations and LLCs are able to sponsor individuals for a U.S. visa or green card.</p>
<p>What I typically see in the startup ecosystem are that most VCs prefer investing in a C corporation created in Delaware (Delaware C-corp). That’s primarily because Delaware laws protect investors, and Delaware C-corps can distribute two or more classes of stock and stock options to employees, investors, and board members.</p>
<p>There is no U.S. residency or citizenship requirement to set up a Delaware C-corp, and it can be done within a day. For more info on this topic, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/039-startup-law-with-attorney-lindsey-mignano/">listen to my chat</a> about startup law with my good friend and trusted colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-mignano-477a0167/">Lindsey Mignano</a>, founding partner of <a href="https://www.smithshapourian.com/">Smith Shapourian Mignano</a>, a corporate law firm based in San Francisco that focuses on startups.</p>
<p>Also, talk to your business attorney about the ownership structure of these entities as well. For example, one possibility is that your Guatemalan company could own your U.S.-based company. However, most investors prefer to invest in a parent company based in the United States, so you could consider setting up your U.S. company to own your company in Guatemala. However, if you’ve already distributed shares in your company in Guatemala, this could be a cumbersome process that might best wait until you’re ready for a funding round. Then, you could do what’s called a Delaware flip — and you should definitely have your corporate attorney advise you on doing that.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney announced today it plans on expanding its direct-to-consumer streaming business to more global markets and is creating a new International Content and Operations group to aid in this push. The group will be headed by nearly 25-year Disney veteran <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/rebecca-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Campbell</a>, who will focus on local and regional content production for Disney&#8217;s streaming services, while also overseeing Disney&#8217;s international teams. The new role will report directly to Disney CEO Bob Chapek. The company also today offered an update on its current streaming footprint and 2023 forecast for Disney+.</p>
<p>As of the end of fiscal 2021, Disney says it had 179 million total subscriptions across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu. It plans to more than double the number of countries Disney+ is available in to over 160 by its fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Though the new international content group is new, Disney says it already has more than 340 local and regional titles in various stages of production and development for its streaming services. That number will grow over time, as Campbell, who previously served as chairman of International Operations and Direct-to-Consumer, will focus on expanding the international content pipeline. In her expanded role, she&#8217;ll also continue to overseas teams in Asia Pacific, EMEA, India and Latin America.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259536" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The creation of the International Content and Operations group gives Disney a fourth home for content creation, alongside its Studios Content, General Entertainment Content and Sports Content groups, Disney says. This addition highlights the importance of establishing an expanded global footprint in streaming to better compete with streamers like Netflix, which is still trying to figure out how to win subscribers in some markets, like India, where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/struggling-to-win-subscribers-netflix-cuts-prices-in-india/">recently had to cut prices</a>. HBO Max has also had its eye on gaining an international footprint, with <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/hbo-max-launch-first-european-countries-october-26">recent launches</a> in parts of Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to the new international content hub, Disney has also reorganized other parts of its streaming business.</p>
<p>The company promoted Joe Earley, previously EVP, Marketing &amp; Operations for Disney+, as the new president of Hulu. He&#8217;ll report to Michael Paull, who has been promoted to the newly created role of president, Disney Streaming, which will be accountable for Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and Star+ globally. Paull&#8217;s prior role as head of Disney+ has yet to be filled. In his new position, he reports to Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution (DMED) Chairman, Kareem Daniel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disney’s direct-to-consumer efforts have progressed at a tremendous pace in just a few short years, and our organization has continued to grow and evolve in support of our ambitious global streaming strategy,&#8221; Chapek said, in a <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-creates-international-content-group-to-expand-pipeline-of-local-content-and-continue-to-grow-its-global-direct-to-consumer-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> announcing the organizational changes. &#8220;Rebecca has played a vital role in orchestrating our global platform expansion, and I’m excited that she will be leading our new International Content group, bringing her expertise and talent to oversee the growing pipeline of original local and regional content for our streaming services while continuing to lead our international operations. Likewise, with a relentless focus on serving consumers, Kareem has developed an industry-leading team of seasoned executives who are uniquely equipped to take our streaming business into Disney’s next century.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
