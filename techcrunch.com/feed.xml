										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HBO, including the HBO Max streaming service, now reaches 73.8 million global subscribers as of the end of 2021, according to news <a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/desroches-citi-appseconomy-conference.html">shared</a> by parent company AT&amp;T today ahead of the company&#8217;s fourth-quarter earnings planned for <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4-2021-results-january-26.html">later</a> this month. The figure tops the company&#8217;s forecast for its year-end total, which it had earlier said would be in the range of 70 million to 73 million.</p>
<p>It also represents a 4.4 million gain in subscribers in Q4, up from the 69.4 million <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/t-posts-strong-q3-results-095318189.html">reported</a> in the prior quarter &#8212; the latter which had then represented a 12.5 million year-over-year increase. While the service was growing, HBO&#8217;s U.S. subscribers had dropped in the third quarter &#8212; but the loss had been offset by international subscriber additions. One of the contributing factors to that domestic decline had been the company&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit">remove HBO Max from Amazon&#8217;s Prime Channels in the quarter</a>, leading to a 1.8 million drop in U.S. subscribers (from 47 million in Q2 down to 45.2 million in Q3).</p>
<p>At the time, AT&amp;T&#8217;s WarnerMedia <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/t-posts-strong-q3-results-095318189.html">said</a> its average revenue per domestic subscriber stood at $11.82. The company also said it expected to recoup some of the domestic subscriber losses in the months to come, as Amazon Prime Channels customers returned to HBO through direct subscriptions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253851" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this week, HBO <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/">touted</a> how well its final quarter of 2021 had been going. The holiday season often sends a boost of activity to entertainment services as people take time off from work to relax at home with family and watch TV. That seemed to be true for HBO Max as well, as the streamer noted that <a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1027633/and-just-like-that-sex-lives-of-college-girls-ratings-hbo-max/">December had been its most-viewed month</a> since the service&#8217;s launch in May 2020.</p>
<p>Contributing to this jump was the buzzy launch of the &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; reboot called &#8220;And Just Like That&#8230;&#8221; which became HBO Max&#8217;s No. 1 series in the U.S., E.U., and Latin America. The streamer also benefitted from the season three finale of the critically acclaimed &#8220;Succession,&#8221; which saw total viewing up 47% over the season 2 finale, as well as finales for &#8220;Insecure&#8221; (a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/arts/television/insecure-finale-recap.html">series finale</a>) and &#8220;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&#8221; The new film &#8220;The Matrix Resurrections&#8221; also helped close out the year as one of the top four films released on the service, as HBO Max embraced same-day movie releases. &#8220;King Richard&#8221; was another same-day release in the quarter.</p>
<p>The interest in these shows and movies and helped pull in viewers who then spend more time watching other HBO Max original content, driving up overall viewing trends. Some subscribers also signed up in anticipation of the New Year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/harry-potter-20th-anniversary-reunion-special-trailer-release-date-and-how-to-watch/">release</a> of the &#8220;Harry Potter: Return to Hogwarts&#8221; reunion special.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the year-end HBO numbers exclude free trials. But the domestic figures do include U.S. accounts &#8220;with access to&#8221; HBO and HBO Max, which muddies the waters. This means the company is counting among its subscriber base those who <em>could</em> be watching HBO but have not yet signed in to do so.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey announced the new subscriber numbers at a Citi investor conference earlier today, where the company also <a href="https://about.att.com/aboutus/pressrelease/2022/desroches-citi-appseconomy-conference.html">detailed other areas of its business</a>, including its postpaid phone and fiber subscribers which ended the year at 3.2 million net adds (its best figure in a decade-plus), and 1.0 million net adds, respectively.</p>
<p>The exec also expressed optimism that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">planned WarnerMedia-Discovery merger</a>, expected to close mid-2022, would meet regulatory approval. And when Discovery&#8217;s portfolio is integrated into the HBO Max catalog, the company believes it will see further gains, he said.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission has approved a settlement with a mortgage data analytics firm for a 2019 security lapse that exposed millions of sensitive mortgage documents containing private information of thousands of Americans.</p>
<p>The settlement, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-finalizes-order-mortgage-analytics-firm-requiring-it">announced late December</a>, orders the Texas-based firm Ascension to strengthen its security practices and ensure that its vendors also maintain proper data security safeguards. The order comes two years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/financial-files/">after a TechCrunch investigation</a> found that OpticsML, a New York-based vendor working for Ascension, left a database of highly sensitive financial data exposed to the internet without a password.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253900" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FTC accused Ascension of failing to ensure that its vendors were complying with data security safeguards as required by the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act&#8217;s Safeguard Rule.</p>
<p>Much of the 24 million records exposed by the security lapse included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information that revealed intimate details of a person’s financial life. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/financial-files/">also found</a> exposed bank account information, and loan agreements. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21173878-ascension-notice-of-data-event">data breach notice</a> filed with the California attorney general&#8217;s office revealed credit files and driver&#8217;s license numbers were also exposed.</p>
<p>According to the FTC, more than 60,000 Americans were affected by the lapse.</p>
<p>OpticsML was hired by Ascension to convert written documents into computer-readable text, known as OCR. Both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/mortgage-loan-leak-gets-worse/">original documents</a> and the converted text were accessible from anyone who knew its IP address. The FTC found that the database was exposed for about a year, during which time the database was accessed more than 50 times, mostly from computers that appear to be located in Russia and China, the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/mortgage-analytics-company-settles-ftc-allegations-it-failed">complaint said</a>.</p>
<p>The order was finalized with the majority votes of two of the agency&#8217;s four remaining commissioners. FTC chair Lina Khan did not participate. A spokesperson for the FTC did not immediately say why Khan did not vote.</p>
<p>FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter voted against the final settlement, arguing that the complaint &#8220;alleges only a rule violation&#8221; and fell short by not laying charges against the company. Prior to leaving the FTC to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, then-FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra also criticized the federal agency for settling with Ascension and not its parent company, Rocktop Partners, because the settlement &#8220;misses the mark on identifying the responsible company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Ascension and OpticsML did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors will sell personal autonomous vehicles by &#8220;the middle of the decade,&#8221; the company&#8217;s CEO and Chair Mary Barra said during her 2022 CES keynote presentation Wednesday.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Barra has mentioned a goal of personal AVs. Barra first disclosed during an earnings call last May that it was exploring the idea of selling personal AVs by leveraging technology from its self-driving subsidiary Cruise.</p>
<p>Cruise, which GM holds a controlling interest, is working on shared, electric, autonomous vehicles that will operate in dense urban areas and shuttle people and likely packages. The company testing its technology on public roads in San Francisco and late last year started giving employees access to hailing driverless (so without a human) rides. The service has yet to open to the public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253822" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear exactly what vehicles would be autonomous and if Cruise would still be involved in the effort. The self-driving vehicle subsidiary is going through its own executive upheaval while trying to launch its commercial robotaxi business.</p>
<p>Last month, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/longtime-gm-exec-dan-ammann-is-out-as-cruise-ceo/">unexpectedly left the company</a> with insiders claiming he was forced out. Kyle Vogt, who co-founded the autonomous vehicle company, and was the company’s first CEO, has take nover the role on an interim basis. Vogt has been serving as Cruise’s president and CTO. Wesley Bush, the former chairman and CEO of Northrop Grumman and a GM board member, will join the Cruise board, GM said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel, conferences, hotels, they all have something in common: Everything is designed to be used once, and then discarded. Of course, it would be delightful if everyone was able to not use single-use plastics for their cups, razors, toothbrushes and everything else, but unless consumers rebel, that&#8217;s unlikely to change anytime soon. It ain&#8217;t just single-use issues either: According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd_C3YK3kI4&amp;list=PL-tVAdsUv2idyS9ndVnV0CwNoVwTQtyDc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Journey of a Toothbrush short documentary</a>, most people go through 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime. That&#8217;s a big pile of plastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have started this company effort together with my husband. It was his idea &#8212; he&#8217;s an industrial designer and he was working a lot with different materials, prototyping and working with different gadgets. He actually told me about this idea on our first date: the nonsense of using a disposable toothbrush in your hotel for three minutes and then throwing it away and nothing will happen with it afterward,&#8221; explains Dasha Kichuk, CEO at <a href="https://effabrush.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Effa</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies trying to make these high-volume disposable products have a little bit less of an impact. <a href="https://lifewithoutplastic.com/bath-body/dental-hygiene/?aff=616">Life without Plastic</a> makes toothbrushes out of wood, <a href="https://www.brushwithbamboo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brush with Bamboo</a> makes &#8217;em out of, well, you guessed it. <a href="https://ecoroots.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eco Roots</a> makes toothbrushes and dental floss out of bamboo. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=plastic+free+toiletries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It&#8217;s a thing, lots of people are doing it</a>. At CES, a Ukrainian company announced it is joining the fray in the retail market. Effa, which makes toothbrushes out of paper, just announced a disposable razor made mostly of paper, and is preparing to offer a number of other products as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Effa&#8217;s toothbrush is made out of sugarcane-based paper. The brush head is made of PBT Nylon &#8212; the same as many of the Bamboo brushes use, which <a href="https://www.plasticstoday.com/ge-produces-virgin-pbt-recycled-pet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be made from recycled plastic bottles</a>. The company also innovates in its approach to recycling &#8212; after use, you can separate the head from the body and throw them into different bins for proper recycling. In addition to the toothbrushes, the company makes a razor made of the same materials as the toothbrushes, with removable heads for separate recycling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating a white label brand, because a lot of companies we&#8217;re working with, want to have our logo &#8212; and theirs &#8212; on the products. They want us to be part of a sustainable journey and they want to show their support of sustainable startup,&#8221; explains Kichuk. &#8220;We started shipping just a month ago. So far, we have shipped our first batch to retail shops all over Ukraine &#8212; that batch is around 20,000 pieces &#8212; and we have made 2.6 million sales for toothbrushes to be delivered within 2022. Right now we have orders in Korea, in Europe, in Ukraine, but we are here at CES to look<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for new customers who are eager to go to the U.S. market. Our mission is not to be the manufacturing company: We want to create a brand. America is the best country to do that; this is where brands are born.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The founders, Dasha and Ilya Kichuk, told me that the company was originally focusing on the travel space, and claims it had made sales to a number of high-profile clients, including Marriott, Radisson, Lotte Hotels and others. The pandemic put a significant dent in travel, and the company decided to pivot to the retail market in its native Ukraine, with an imminent launch in local grocery chains. At CES, the company is trying to find broader distribution for its products.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love this question!&#8221; beams Kichuk as I ask her why the company is named Effa. &#8220;It is named after a butterfly that lives and dies in just one day, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera_simulans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ephemera.</a> The ultimate goal for our company is to replace those plastic disposables. We are eager to replace plastic disposables in the medical industry. Another market that is interesting is prisons because apparently plastic toothbrushes are forbidden in prisons. That&#8217;s what we want to explore &#8212; along with working with social organizations like UNICEF and the Red Cross, to bring our social mission there as well. We are ready to ship up to 4 million pieces in the next year, and we need to start growing our team to start growing from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company currently consists of six people, including the husband-and-wife CEO and CMO team, a marketing person, a salesperson and an R&amp;D department.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say R&amp;D department,&#8221; laughs Anna Sulim, the company&#8217;s marketing and PR manager, &#8220;but it is one person. So we are a small team, but we work around the clock to fulfill this mission.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors&#8217; commercial electric vehicle unit BrightDrop has scored Walmart as a customer with a reservation of 5,000 e-delivery vans to help the retail giant reach a zero-emissions logistics fleet by 2040, the company said on Wednesday at CES.</p>
<p>In addition, existing customer FedEx has reserved priority production for 2,000 vans over the next few years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">upping its initial order of 500 EVs, which was announced at CES last year</a>.</p>
<p>Walmart expects to receive a combination of EV600s, which are currently in production, and smaller EV410s, which will be available in late 2023, by next year. The vehicles will add to the company&#8217;s fleet of InHome delivery service vehicles, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/walmart-to-expand-inhome-grocery-delivery-to-30-million-u-s-households-in-2022/">the retailer announced would be expanding from around 6 million households today to 30 million U.S. homes</a> by the end of 2022, as well as bolster its broader last-mile delivery network. Walmart will also deploy BrightDrop EVs for its GoLocal white-label delivery service geared toward third parties.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Walmart joins the lineup of big-name customers like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/gms-electric-commercial-vehicle-unit-brightdrop-introduces-second-smaller-van-for-verizon/">Merchants Fleet and Verizon</a> that are backing BrightDrop to help electrify their delivery fleets. In total, BrightDrop has upwards of 25,000 reservations, which doesn&#8217;t include the as-yet-unknown number of vehicles Verizon has ordered. FedEx, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/fedex-receives-its-first-fully-electric-gm-brightdrop-delivery-vans/">received the first five of its order in Inglewood, California,</a> last month, is considering adding 20,000 more EVs to its order in the coming years, pending a definitive purchase agreement.</p>
<p>As many companies look toward decarbonizing their transport to reach emissions goals, BrightDrop&#8217;s demand will only increase, but will it be able to scale from essentially zero to tens of thousands over the next couple of years?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM&#8217;s electric delivery unit BrightDrop expands deal with Merchants Fleet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gms-electric-delivery-unit-brightdrop-expands-deal-with-merchants-fleet/embed/#?secret=72X2vs1hKt" data-secret="72X2vs1hKt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the unique things about how we&#8217;ve set up BrightDrop is that we&#8217;re marrying the best of both worlds where we set it up to run like a technology startup,&#8221; Travis Katz, president and CEO of BrightDrop, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can move with speed, agility, and really focus on innovation and rapid cycles, but we&#8217;re marrying that setup with the manufacturing might of General Motors, and General Motors is just this amazing company when it comes to manufacturing at scale. When we open the doors next year at our Canadian factory, we will start producing these vehicles in large numbers and grow very quickly to meet the demand, and the demand for these vehicles is incredible.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BrightDrop&#8217;s batteries will come from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/gm-starts-construction-on-the-cornerstone-of-its-ev-strategy/">GM&#8217;s Ultium plant in Lordstown, Ohio</a>, but the company aims to produce its vehicles at scale at a manufacturing plant in Ontario, Canada, which will begin production in the fourth quarter of the year. Until then, the company is relying on a low-volume production facility in Michigan run by one of its robotics suppliers, Kuka AG, so that it can go to market now.</p>
<p>&#8220;For FedEx specifically, the first vehicles were delivered last month [and] they are on the road delivering packages, and that first order of 500 we will be delivering to FedEx on a rolling basis,&#8221; Katz said at a press briefing on Tuesday. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be sending more and more out to FedEx starting now, so you should expect to start to see those on the road, and if you live in the Los Angeles area to start having packages delivered to you with zero emissions in the months to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>FedEx also shared plans to expand its testing of BrightDrops EP1 electrified container to 10 markets this year. The companies just completed a second pilot program in New York City, which has already allowed the shipping and delivery company to increase package deliveries by 15% per hour, remove one on-road vehicle from its delivery route and cut curbside dwell time in half, according to BrightDrop. The first pilot, announced in January 2021, took place in Toronto and saw a 25% increase in package deliveries per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;By 2025, we&#8217;re planning for 50% of all FedEx Express global pickup and delivery vehicle purchases to be electric, rising to 100% of all new purchases by 2030,&#8221; FedEx Express regional president of the Americas and EVP Richard Smith said Tuesday. &#8220;We employ what we call a Goldilocks strategy for vehicle sizing, that small, medium and large vehicles with specific operational uses for each. BrightDrop&#8217;s current commercial EV portfolio with the EV410s and the EV600 can cover the small and medium-sized needs for FedEx. This means about two-thirds of the total pickup and delivery EV demand &#8230; could be sourced from BrightDrop, and we hope that they are, because the vehicles are tremendous. We&#8217;ve also talked to BrightDrop about the remaining one-third, which would require a larger vehicle with cargo space in excess of 1,000 cubic feet, and we&#8217;re hoping to work with them on that, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>While FedEx&#8217;s new vehicles will hit the streets of LA first, Walmart&#8217;s will depend on where the company wants to start testing EVs and deployment, and where it&#8217;s already got charging infrastructure set up, Katz said. The retail company has also partnered with another GM subsidiary, autonomous vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/walmart-and-cruise-partner-to-test-autonomous-grocery-delivery-in-arizona/">Cruise, to begin testing grocery delivery in Arizona</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you can imagine when you have two companies with the same parent that overlap in these spaces, it unlocks a lot of potential and a lot of possibility,&#8221; said Katz. &#8220;And so I think, hopefully, we&#8217;ll have more to share about that in the future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon-owned Ring’s home security ecosystem got another key piece of the puzzle this week at CES. The new <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-snapshot-of-our-ces-news%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor</a> is designed to detect the sound of breaking glass up to 25 feet away, sending a notification to the app, so the user can act accordingly.</p>
<p>It also can be set to trigger a siren or alert Ring’s home monitoring service, if you’ve got a premium account. You’ll obviously want to tweak accordingly, and maybe flip it off during your annual holiday rewatch of Die Hard. The product joins a handful of other sensors from Ring, including contact sensors and motion detectors, designed to add ears to the camera eyes.</p>
<p>The feature follows Amazon’s introduction of Alexa Guard, which makes it possible for Echo devices to detect sounds like glass breaking and smoke alarms going off. That feature was included on Amazon’s Echo Show 15 device announced last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253844" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Ring Glass Alarm goes up for preorder starting today at $40. It starts shipping February 16, so you can give the gift of breaking glass alerts just in time for a slightly late Valentine’s Day. It&#8217;s designed to be installed on doors, mounted to a wall or say atop furniture near a glass window. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">also announced</a> additional roll outs for Fire TV at CES today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has started testing private likes on Stories as part of a limited test. The Meta-owned company confirmed that the feature is not broadly available and is currently only visible to a small group of people globally. The company also explained that only the person who has posted the Story can see the total number of likes and that there aren&#8217;t any plans to make the like count public.</p>
<p>“We’re always working on ways to help people connect with those they care about,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;We’re now testing Story Likes, a way for people to react to stories that only the story author can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many users have revealed that they&#8217;ve started to see the feature and have posted screenshots of the new option on Twitter. The screenshots show that users who are part of the test will receive a notice stating that they may receive likes on their Stories.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Instagram testing likes on stories. <a href="https://t.co/Pn6jRlq0rF">pic.twitter.com/Pn6jRlq0rF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Melissa G (@MelissaGoBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/MelissaGoBlue/status/1478489430189088776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Currently, all Instagram users have the option to reply or react to a story with eight options, including the laughing, surprised, heart eyes, teary-eyed, clap, fire, celebration and 100 emoji. These reactions are not publically visible, but the person who posted the Story is able to see the total number of reactions they&#8217;ve received for each emoji. The introduction of likes on Stories would allow a new way for users to engage with Stories. It also gives users and influencers a new means of measuring engagement on their Stories in the same way as their posts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s experiment with likes on Stories comes as the platform now allows users to hide like counts on their posts. The social media giant first started testing the option in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">officially rolled it out</a> to all users last May. This latest test indicates that Instagram is going to continue to focus on the idea of private likes, especially since the company doesn&#8217;t have any plans to make likes on Stories visible to the public.</p>
<p>The social media platform has been looking for more ways to get users to engage with Stories, as it recently introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">new “Add Yours”</a> sticker that creates public threads in Stories. The feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic. The interactive sticker can be used to create a content chain where each user adds their own Story. It’s worth noting that the new sticker is somewhat similar to TikTok’s “duet” feature, which allows users to create content featuring an original video.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. organizations that fail to secure customer data against Log4Shell, a zero-day vulnerability in the widely used Log4j Java logging library, could face legal repercussions, the Federal Trade Commission (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/">FTC</a>) has warned.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2022/01/ftc-warns-companies-remediate-log4j-security-vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an alert this week</a>, the consumer protection agency warned that the &#8220;serious&#8221; flaw, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/">first discovered in December</a>, is being exploited by a growing number of attackers and poses a “severe risk” to millions of consumer products. The public letter urges organizations to mitigate the vulnerability in order to reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers and to avoid potential legal action.</p>
<p>“When vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited, it risks a loss or breach of personal information, financial loss and other irreversible harms,” the agency said. “The duty to take reasonable steps to mitigate known software vulnerabilities implicates laws including, among others, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. It is critical that companies and their vendors relying on Log4j act now, in order to reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers, and to avoid FTC legal action.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FTC highlighted the case of Equifax, which failed to patch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report/">a known Apache Struts flaw</a> back in 2017, leading to the compromise of sensitive info on 147 million consumers. The credit reporting agency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/equifax-fine-ftc/">subsequently agreed to pay $700 million to settle with the agency</a> and individual states.</p>
<p>“The FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take reasonable steps to protect consumer data from exposure as a result of Log4j, or similar known vulnerabilities in the future,” the FTC said, adding that it plans to apply its legal authority to protect consumers in the cases of “similar known vulnerabilities in the future.”</p>
<p>For organizations keen to dodge a potential multimillion-dollar fine, the FTC is encouraging that they follow guidance issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This urges businesses to update Log4j software packages to the most recent version, to take steps to mitigate the vulnerability and to distribute information about the vulnerability to third-parties and consumers who may be vulnerable.</p>
<p>The FTC’s warning shot comes after <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft this week warned</a> that the Log4Shell vulnerability remains a “complex and high-risk” situation for companies, adding that “exploitation attempts and testing remained high during the last weeks of December,” with lower-skilled attackers and nation-state actors alike taking advantage of the flaw.</p>
<p>“At this juncture, customers should assume broad availability of exploit code and scanning capabilities to be a real and present danger to their environments,” it added. “Due to the many software and services that are impacted and given the pace of updates, this is expected to have a long tail for remediation, requiring ongoing, sustainable vigilance.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Both LPs and VCs have reasons to want to keep their involvement confidential. But when these reasons aren't solid enough, the anonymity of a fund's limited partners might diminish.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With capital aplenty for startups over the last few years, the balance of power between investors and founders has been tilting toward the latter. This manifests itself in several ways along a startup&#8217;s lifecycle, from more favorable early-stage term sheets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/the-year-of-the-disappearing-lock-up/">founder-friendlier public listing terms</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an area that remains untouched, though: The anonymity of a fund&#8217;s limited partners (LPs). Rarely if ever do VCs fully disclose who their LPs are, even to founders they invested in.</p>
<p>Both LPs and VCs have reasons to want to keep their involvement confidential. But when these reasons aren&#8217;t solid enough, my prediction is that this will change.</p>
<p>The main driver, in my opinion, will be founder pressure.</p>

<hr />
<p>With increased competition for the hottest deals, VCs increasingly have to sell themselves to founders they are hoping to back. In this context, the old model in which founders have to undergo thorough due diligence while not getting to ask a single question seems outdated. Now, when entrepreneurs get the chance to start prodding, odds are they&#8217;ll ask about LPs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It appears that the new OpenSea valuation is cheap compared to recent fundamentals, but a little expensive when we consider how much its market booms and busts.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OpenSea, the well-known NFT marketplace, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">raised a $300 million round</a> at a $13.3 billion valuation. Newcomer <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation">broke the news</a> yesterday before the company <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-openseas-new-funding/">confirmed</a> the transaction.</p>
<p>For critics of the present-day cryptoeconomy and NFT market, the round was perhaps more evidence of how overheated things have become. After all, OpenSea last raised at a fraction of its new valuation under a year ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">adding $100 million to its accounts at a $1.5 billion valuation in July</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>That sort of valuation appreciation must indicate prohibitive speculation among the investing classes, right? Well, let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<p>OpenSea is a pretty straightforward business to understand. As I <a href="https://thelatestagereview.substack.com/p/are-crypto-trading-fees-heading-to">wrote over my winter vacation</a>, the company takes a 2.5% cut of transactions on its service. That means we can track its aggregate trading volume and come up with ballpark estimates for its scale.</p>

Nope. Can we learn enough to better understand why OpenSea managed to command such a huge check and towering valuation? Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>I want to figure out how the new OpenSea valuation squares up with its revenues. From there, we&#8217;ll ask if the company feels underpriced or overpriced. This will be a fun journey of collecting data and executing minor math magic. Let&#8217;s do some thinking!</p>
<h2>OpenSea&#8217;s NFT business</h2>
<p>The simplest way to get a handle on the scale of OpenSea is to simply check its trailing 30-day trading volume and apply its 2.5% take rate to the sum. Per <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces">crypto data source Dappradar</a>, OpenSea saw $2.91 billion in trading volume in the last 30 days. That works out to an anticipated gross haul from OpenSea of $72.75 million.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a month, mind. If we took that single period and multiplied it to generate a yearly run-rate figure, OpenSea would be on pace to see $34.92 billion in volume, generating gross revenues of $873 million over 12 months.</p>
<p>There are other ways to get our hands on the company&#8217;s scale. Data <a href="https://dune.xyz/rchen8/opensea">from Dune Analytics collected by @rchen8</a> has more granular historical data to parse. Per Dune, OpenSea saw trading volume of $3.25 billion in December, $2.37 billion in November, and $2.64 billion in October. Combined, those figures work out to $8.26 billion in volume, a 2.5% cut of which would be worth $206.5 million.</p>
<p>If we extrapolate that final number to a full-year tally, it would shake out to a yearly run rate of $826 million. That&#8217;s pretty close to our first number of a yearly run-rate estimate of $873 million for OpenSea&#8217;s gross revenues, provided that the company&#8217;s flat-percentage costs execute in-market as we anticipate.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use a yearly run rate of $850 million for the company because it&#8217;s in between our two estimates for the company&#8217;s recent revenue pace, extrapolated to a full-year tally. At a $13.3 billion valuation, OpenSea is only worth 15.6x its present-day run rate. That&#8217;s very not insane for today&#8217;s market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re building a SaaS company or a web app, you&#8217;re not going to roll your own analytics solution &#8212; it&#8217;s specialized work with lots of edge cases, rabbit holes and, for most companies, it&#8217;s so far removed from the core platform, that it just doesn&#8217;t make sense. <a href="https://formant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formant</a> is doing kinda-sorta the same thing for robotics, helping automation companies with a number of shortcuts that speed up their time to market. The company has three major strings to its bow: remote-controlling autonomous bots (&#8220;operation&#8221;), analytics and &#8220;why is my robot being so dumb,&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;observe,&#8221; as Formant would no doubt prefer I referred to it.</p>
<p>The company just closed an $18 million Series A round led by <a href="https://signalfire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SignalFire</a>, with participation from a selection of VCs and strategic investors, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hillsven-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillsven</a>, <a href="http://www.pelionvp.com">Pelion</a>, <a href="https://www.goodyearventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodyear Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.thursday.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thursday Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/ventures">Ericsson</a>, <a href="https://www.picuscap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picus Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.holmanenterprises.com/our-companies/holman-strategic-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holman Strategic Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded this in 2017, when I left Google and brought my team with me. I was working in the robotics group and I saw an opportunity. The insight was that the robotics hardware was incredible, with folks like <a href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boston Dynamics</a>, really pushing the envelope. Before that, we had 20-25 years of industrial robots that are incredibly accurate, powerful and build every car that you see on the road,&#8221; Jeff Linnell outlines the genesis of the company. &#8220;That said, the software was in the stone age. There&#8217;s no unified operating system. Everybody is building every part of the stack, for every application. If you were starting a company, you had to build your perception and your autonomy, of course. But on top of that, you&#8217;d also have to build your data management and everything else. We saw an opportunity to build a generalized solution that could amplify a lot of companies.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Linnell left Google to found that exact company. It started off as an API that would enable a machine or a robot to request assistance from a human &#8212; imagine a cart getting stuck in a corner, for example. The robot would get confused and could phone a friend for some help. A human could control the robot to get it free using a D-pad or a joystick and then hit the &#8220;resume&#8221; button so the robot could continue on its merry way.</p>
<p>From there, the company built a more substantial platform to help manage the edge cases in robotics and, specifically, robotic fleets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really touch the autonomy part of the robot &#8212; getting the robot to do what you need it to do is still the responsibility of our customers,&#8221; explains Linnell, &#8220;But when it goes off track, or when you need to figure out what happened when something goes wrong, or if you need to determine whether the robot is performing well, that&#8217;s where our software comes in.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your robo-vac has ever gotten stuck behind the sofa, the &#8220;oh crap not again, I wish I could control it with a remote rather than having to go back there and haul its sorry, confused little carcass out from the television wiring&#8221; use case will make sense to you. Except with much bigger and potentially more dangerous robots that have all sorts of fail-safes so they stop without just bumping into stuff until they run out of batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other use cases may need a bit of additional context.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> you&#8217;re in a services department for a company that makes floor-scrubbing robots. You notice a trend that a certain set of robots are struggling with a particular area of the warehouse. You see this happen, or someone contacts customer support to complain, or a customer goes &#8216;Hey, we have bad performance over here.&#8217; With Formant, you could go back in time and look at the logs, inspecting the moment that the customers say this happens,&#8221; explains Linnell. &#8220;You might notice that the Wi-Fi strength drops low in this corner of the warehouse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Of course, if the Wi-Fi drops altogether, most robots are smart enough to report that, but things like low connectivity or time-outs can be a nightmare to troubleshoot without either sending a (very expensive) customer service engineer to the warehouse or using something like Formant&#8217;s software. The solution might be as simple as plugging in a Wi-Fi extender.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The third use might be that a business owner could wish to measure the ROI of this fleet of 200 robots that are working in a particular warehouse, with efficiency statistics,&#8221; Linnell explains. &#8220;How many times do they need assists? How much time are they spending doing their jobs autonomously, versus being manually controlled? Think of it as an analytics workflow, where you are looking at dashboards that will show you trends of data over days, months, weeks and years.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Most of the customers come to Formant to solve one of those three specific problems, the company claims, and then stay for the full solution.</p>
<p>The final benefit is that Formant offers a platform to get a broader view of the performance of a number of different robotics manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of our larger customers are working with a diverse fleet of robots. They may have an autonomy department that is interested in robots from multiple vendors, and they might need to have a unified data platform that can speak to a Boston Dynamics robot, a Fanuc robot, a drone from DJI &#8212; and have all that data in the same place,&#8221; says Linnell. &#8220;By using Formant, they will know what&#8217;s going on within the operation of their heterogenous fleet of robots. And no individual robot manufacturers is able to offer that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company suggests that its software has been used to run tens of thousands of robots, and is going to spend the next 12-18 months to double the size of the company, building out engineering and sales operations, and expanding into Europe. The company is hiring in a few locations, including Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We acquired a stealth teleoperations company several years ago, that was based in Pittsburgh,&#8221; Linnell says, describing the city as a hub of automation. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got Carnegie Mellon University, and probably more-self driving companies, even than in the Bay Area. There&#8217;s a huge robotics community in Pittsburgh, and we are going to want to continue to invest there. I believe it is one of the hubs, in addition to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Bay Area. The cost of doing business in Pittsburgh is just tremendously different &#8212; you&#8217;ve got top talent, but it&#8217;s very cost-effective.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most fintechs pride themselves on digital everything, including customer acquisition strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But <a href="https://bankaya.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bankaya</a>, a Mexico City-based financial services startup, is attributing its early traction on the opposite model &#8212; going after target customers in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2019 by CEO Mauricio Cordero, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramón Chedraui and Diego Vargas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bankaya launched one year ago and boasted 450,000 customers as of year’s end. Impressively, and perhaps counterintuitively, most of that customer acquisition was via offline channels.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankaya’s target customers are the 50 million unbanked in Mexico. And the startup has made it its mission to drastically lower that number with what it believes is a unique approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we can’t reach this segment digitally. We have to go offline, face to face,” he told TechCrunch. “Especially because many of our target customers live in rural or remote areas, doing things like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saving money under the mattress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite literally, Bankaya’s salesforce works the streets, even setting up shop at places like supermarkets and vaccination centers flanked by kiosks filled with debit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The underserved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need a lot of handholding, someone in front of them explaining how to use a card, for example, or how to send money to family,” Cordero said. “They are usually not active online and they are not going to download an app out of Facebook or Instagram.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That human engagement is working wonders. In December, Bankaya processed more than 800,000 transactions from customers, including purchases, deposits, withdrawals, bank transfers and payments of services. That’s up from over 500,000 in October.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Its target population has an inherent distrust of traditional banks, hence the strategy of talking to people face to face with the goal of easing some of that hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re working with the truly unbanked customer,” Cordero explained. “So we’re about building trust and financial education. The human element in these cases is so important. Just really critical. And that impact agenda is our competitive advantage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordero estimates that Bankaya’s CAC (customer acquisition cost) is about $4 per account opened &#8212; likely far lower than that of most fintechs and traditional banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single digital bank in Mexico is spending millions on Facebook and Google ads, and that&#8217;s driving up their acquisition costs,” he told TechCrunch. “They’re all going after the same customer, and in a very expensive way that results in low-quality conversion rates and engagement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another crucial differentiator for Bankaya is the fact that it is built via a BaaS (banking as a service) platform. There are only about 50 fully-licensed banks in all of Mexico and the country rarely awards new banking licenses, noted Cordero. &#8220;Then you have the IFPEs, or wallets, via the fintech law.<b>&#8220;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re something in between,” explains Cordero. “We’re one of the first BaaS platforms connected to one of the 50 banks, and that has allowed us to have a really strong product. Fintech laws say that IFPEs are not allowed to touch consumer deposits &#8212; they can’t lend with them or share returns. But we are allowed to because we use the BaaS license of Consubanco.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its app has a digital card that is free for the user. The startup has a loyalty partnership with Chedraui, one of the country’s largest retailers. If Bankaya users buy goods in stores with their debit cards, they get 5% to 10% cash back on their Chedraui wallet. (Co-founder Ramón Chedraui is one of the family members that own <a href="https://www.grupochedraui.com.mx/">Grupo Chedraui</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 55% of Bankaya’s customers are women, and 59% earn an income below the national average of $600 a month. Sixty-nine percent don’t have a credit card. Over half of its customers are funded within the first three days of opening an account and all receive a digital card upon signing up, according to Cordero. The startup also offers a 2.5% return on deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driving engagement is the name of the game for neobanks,” he told TechCrunch. “It can be hard to monetize if customers don’t see real value. For Bankaya, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re coming from, we want to help give people financial freedom so they don’t have to do things like walk two hours to pay a utility bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over time, the startup will gather data that will only assist with future credit analysis.</span></p>
<p>To date, Bankaya is bootstrapped, funded by its founders, two of whom don’t participate in day to day operations. It has about 100 employees and a salesforce of about 300.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankaya is also launching a buy now, pay later platform so that customers, through its app, can get credit installments. It won’t work as a credit card and the startup is not onboarding merchants. It works directly with the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They use a debit card to buy a product and pay Bankaya over time,” Cordero said. Unlike with traditional buy now, pay later offerings, the startup does charge interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not Germany or the U.S. where you can offer BNPL at 0% interest. That’s extremely hard to do here,” Cordero said. “We have to charge interest but the idea is to graduate customers so that once someone pays off an item, they can finance the second item with a lower interest rate.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV streaming platform is coming to more cars, the company <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/fire-tv-is-on-the-move-in-2022-e3f8860bc6b9">announced</a> today at CES. In the fourth quarter last year, Stellantis became the first automaker to integrate Fire TV for in-car entertainment with its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and is now bringing the entertainment experiences to Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica, as well. In addition, Fire TV will come built-in on Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator&#8217;s 2022 models, Amazon said.</p>
<p>Automakers are able to customize their Fire TV experience to do things like integrate with the car&#8217;s audio systems or its comfort controls in order to offer unique features designed for their vehicles.</p>
<p>The version of Fire TV for autos works to take advantage of Alexa&#8217;s hands-free options, so passengers &#8212; or parents looking to pull up a show for the kids in the back &#8212; can easily play content by speaking voice commands. Parents can also select content front the front seat that plays for the rear passengers. And if there are multiple screens in the back, that content can be mirrored across both at the same time. If, however, the kids can&#8217;t agree on a program to watch, Fire TV lets the rear passengers watch individual content on each display. Viewers can listen to their shows and movies through Bluetooth or wired headphones, or over the car&#8217;s speakers, if desired.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can also ask Alexa on Fire TV to show their Ring doorbell video, by saying things like &#8220;Alexa, show me the front door,&#8221; among other voice commands.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Fire TV users will have access to over 1 million TV episodes and movies, including those from Prime Video. And because cellular signals aren&#8217;t always reliable when traveling, Fire TV for autos will allow for offline viewing through support for downloads.</p>
<p>The system will also soon be updated to catch up to the consumer experience for Fire TV in the home where the company has rolled out support for personalized profiles with their own recommendations and an updated home screen experience. With this update, Fire TV customers will be able to pause their shows at home then pick up viewing in the car where they left off, notes Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon has been working to bring Fire TV to more cars for some time. In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/fire-tv-edition-expands-to-more-soundbars-plus-cars-cable-boxes-and-more/">it partnered</a> with BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to offer hands-free Alexa and the ability to stream Fire TV in cars, while adding new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/amazon-drives-deeper-into-cars-with-new-alexa-partners-echo-auto-expansion/">auto-focused Alexa voice commands</a>, like &#8220;Alexa, pay for gas&#8221; which allows customers to pay for their gas at 11,500 Exxon and Mobil stations. The same year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/amazon-backed-rivian-will-integrate-alexa-into-its-electric-pickup-and-suv/">announced</a> plans to bring both Alexa and Fire TV to Rivian&#8217;s EVs and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In detailing its further plans for Fire TV at today&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show, Amazon also shared its latest Fire TV milestone, noting it&#8217;s sold more than 150 million Fire TV devices worldwide as of Q4 2021. Fewer people actually use the platform on a regular basis, of course. Previously, the company had shared Fire TV <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-advertisers-can-now-reach-up-to-50m-monthly-active-users-on-fire-tv">had 50 million monthly active users</a> as of Dec. 2020. That number should have inched up since, as Amazon reported that shoppers purchased a record number of Fire TV smart TVs during the week of Black Friday 2021, and its Fire TV Stick was the top-selling product on Black Friday itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://xage.com">Xage</a> (pronounced Zage) is a startup working to keep critical infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines, water supplies and electrical grids up and running securely. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p>Piva led the round with participation from Momenta, Valor Equity Partners and OurCrowd, along with existing investors March Capital, City Light Capital, Saints Capital and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures. The startup said it has raised $54 million to date.</p>
<p>Xage uses a bunch of complex technology to help keep critical infrastructure safe. Industrial infrastructure tends to be older and relies on fairly brittle security. Xage was designed to be a modern layer on top of that, which the company refers to as a fabric, CEO Duncan Greatwood said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The fabric is a mesh of software nodes that overlays the operation to provide granular control of every digital interaction. It provides <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/">zero trust</a> protection that spans operations, IT and the cloud, underpinning both cybersecurity and digital transformation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The solution uses digital ledger technology organized in nodes on a blockchain to limit the impact of an attack, so that getting control of one or two nodes would not compromise the entire network. But the company did not just jump on the blockchain bandwagon with the growing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/">popularity of web3</a> in 2021. It has been using this technology as a way to control access since its earliest days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distributed ledger is still an important part of our software stack. It&#8217;s part of how we achieve this no single point of failure in the Xage fabric, which is so important for protecting these exposed operational situations,&#8221; Greatwood told me.</p>
<p>Over the last year, he said that companies have begun to come around to a solution like Xage, driven by the increase in ransomware attacks and growing government regulations around critical infrastructure. This was also driven home by the attack last year on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/">a Florida water supply</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those factors, along with an increase in its partner network, fueled a big rise in interest in Xage, and that drove the need to seek additional funds to staff up. &#8220;Even with the right partners, which we have now, we still need staff to help support all of this rollout and the work that we&#8217;re doing, both bringing the customers on and the deployments, as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today, the company has over 40 employees, a number that he said is increasing by the week. Greatwood expects to be close to 90 or more by the end of 2022. He said that from the earliest days, diversity and inclusion have been top of mind for the company. While it&#8217;s easy to look at the obvious places like MIT and Stanford for new staff, he said the key is looking beyond that pool to find hidden gems.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​What we found is that we find superstars and people with superstar potential with much less obvious backgrounds from their resumes, and we kind of grow them and help them fulfill their potential. Very often, frankly, that&#8217;s the key to finding the right recruits who come from all kinds of different diverse backgrounds and situations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The other key is creating a welcoming culture, and he said that he and his team work consciously on creating a cooperative, collaborative and welcoming workplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spend time with the team talking about how we work together, and that goes above and beyond just the task-oriented work of the day, making sure that everybody is included and supported as they develop at Xage. The first step is to recruit a diverse workforce, and the second step is to enable the diverse workforce to succeed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company intends to take a hybrid approach to work as they enter 2022, with some people in the office and some fully or partially remote, depending on their needs, but he believes some work requires people sometimes being together in the same room to build software this complex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Italian startup <a href="https://www.filotrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filo</a> &#8212; better known in Europe for its Tile-like Bluetooth tracking devices &#8212; is showing off its shiny new product <a href="https://getmytata.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tata Pad,</a> a cushion that goes on top of a child seat, and can notify you if you&#8217;ve left your pride and joy strapped into the back seat as you saunter into the cool, refreshing, air-conditioned breeze of a mall. Already available in Italy, the company is announcing its U.S. launch at CES in Las Vegas this week.</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non-parent like myself, the Tata Pad seems like a pretty silly product. How likely are you to forget that there&#8217;s a toddler in the back seat? The company assures me that it&#8217;s a serious enough problem that <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3164/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there&#8217;s legislation coming down the pike in the U.S.</a> to make sure that children and pets left behind in vehicles need some sort of safety warning, after more than 900 children have died from being left behind in hot cars since the late 1990s &#8212; an average of 38 children per year. Under the mantra &#8220;one child is one too many,&#8221; it is offering a tech solution to forgetful parents.</p>
<p>The product is essentially a cushion that works much like a Tile device &#8212; if a child sits on the cushion, the device is activated. Walk away from it for more than three minutes and the Tata Pad will send a notification to your phone that you left something important behind. If that doesn&#8217;t inspire you to return to your car, the product initiates a call to your phone to give you a friendly reminder that, seriously, go get your kid. Ignore that call, and the Tata Pad escalates even further, sending SMS and/or calls to your emergency contacts, along with a location for your child so they can launch a rescue operation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Each pad can be connected to up to two phones and is powered by a couple of replaceable coin-cell batteries. The company didn&#8217;t comment on how long the batteries last. The company promises that the messages and calls will be free for the first four years &#8212; after that, it&#8217;ll be possible to buy an extension to continue using the alerts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253358" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253358" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253358" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=2048,1368 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tatapad_Tata_position_high.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253358" class="wp-caption-text">Filo&#8217;s Tata Pad is a cushion you can add to a child seat to be notified when you&#8217;ve left something important behind as you leave your car. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Filo</p></div></p>
<p>The company suggests that it is fully certified for sales in the U.S., and is starting to accept preorders following CES. The company&#8217;s CEO Giorgio Sadolfo told me that the company is looking for partners and distributors to make a big splash in the U.S. market. In Europe, the devices are sold for €60 (approx $68), and the company suggests that the pricing will be similar once the product hits U.S. shores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take the ability to connect to nearly all smart home devices, mix in some smart rules and sprinkle on a raft of security features and you&#8217;ve got a pretty decent idea of what <a href="https://homey.app/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homey</a> offers. Instead of beaming all your data to whoever your smart home provider is, Homey promises to keep your data safe and out of the grubby paws of advertisers.</p>
<p>The Homey company has been operating in Europe since 2014, and announced its U.S. expansion at CES today. The key issue it solves is that a lot of smart home solutions are very cobbled together, and in the process become huge data collectors that can be used for nefarious purposes. To date, customers have been made to accept that it&#8217;s just the cost of having a smart home, but this is where the company believes there is another way: The company claims it doesn&#8217;t listen in or sell any customer data, nor that it uses personal information to create user profiles or targeted advertisements.</p>
<p>In addition to blindfolding the smart home providers from each other, the company&#8217;s Homey Pro smart home hub brings some fun new features to the mix. If you&#8217;ve ever played with If This Then That (IFTTT), you&#8217;ve probably come up with some clever automation: Turn on the light when someone rings the doorbell, or turn the volume of the speakers down after 10 p.m., for example. Homey&#8217;s app builds a ton of this type of functionality into the core architecture of the apps. The company calls these automations &#8220;flows,&#8221; and gives a number of examples, including &#8220;Always dim lights in the bedroom when the drapes close,&#8221; or &#8220;Automatically turn the thermostat down, turn off the lights and enable the alarm when I lock the front door.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250662" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Flows can, of course, also be started using voice assistants, including as Google, Alexa and Siri Shortcuts. The company also offers widgets for mobile and Apple Watch.</span></p>
<p>In addition to voice controls, flows and the other obvious stuff you&#8217;d expect, the apps offer tools to analyze energy use in real time, and offers suggestions for how to save additional electricity. It can, for example, compare the energy consumption between a washing machine&#8217;s &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; cycles, or give insights into which are your most (and least) energy-efficient rooms.</p>
<p>Homey claims its smart hubs can connect to more than 50,000 smart home devices from more than 1,000 brands, and it offers iOS, Android and web apps to take control of, and configure, the whole experience. The hub itself has connectivity galore, with Zigbee, Z-Wave Plus, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 433MHz radios, plus infrared transmission LEDs to beam commands around the house.</p>
<p>The Homey app can be used to control smart home devices — either via <a href="https://homey.app/en-us/store/product/homey-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the $69 Homey Bridge</a> or as <a href="https://get.homey.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an app-only solution</a> without the need for Homey hardware. The free version of the Homey app controls up to five devices, while a premium version enables an entire household to connect an unlimited number of smart devices. The premium version of the app would set you back $2.99 per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every home is unique; it’s not one-size-fits-all. Most of today’s smart home systems are centered around a single brand, technology or use case. For example, Philips Hue is great for lighting, but that’s all it does,&#8221; said Emile Nijssen, co-founder and creative director of Athom, makers of Homey. &#8220;As a result, your smart home can become complicated and cluttered quickly with all sorts of different apps. Our goal with Homey is to change the status quo and create an open, affordable, user-friendly system that unifies all smart devices and ensures consumer privacy at the same time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Meez is a kitchen collaboration tool, recipe keeper and progression, training and prep all rolled into one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getmeez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meez</a>, a company creating professional recipe software and a culinary operating system, brought in its first-ever funding round of $6.5 million to continue developing its tools to help chefs manage their recipes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253419" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253419" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253419" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg" alt="Josh Sharkey,, Meez" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253419" class="wp-caption-text">Josh Sharkey, CEO of Meez. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evan Sung</p></div></p>
<p>CEO Josh Sharkey, a chef himself for most of his career, incorporated the New York-based technology company back in 2015. However, what touched off the search for a place to keep his recipes and processes came more like 15 years ago when he lost the notebook where he kept recipes and how to prepare dishes. Colleagues were using everything from the standard Google or Word documents to spreadsheets, but Sharkey wanted a more digital approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The idea of how to digitize everything stuck with me,” he told TechCrunch. “There are tools for things like inventory management or financial software, but there wasn’t anything built for the things we do in the kitchen or related to what we actually do.”</p>
<p>He and his team built Meez to be a collaboration tool, recipe keeper and progression, training and prep tool all rolled into one — Sharkey referred to it as a “Google Drive for chefs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The technology has two components, the first being how users put their recipes into the system and then how to make them scalable and usable by both the user and their kitchen colleagues. It also includes resources that chefs tap into daily, like ingredient yields and unit conversion, a menu cost calculator and automated allergen tagging and nutrition analysis.</p>
<p>The software was launched in 2020, and Meez already counts as clients major restaurateurs, like Jose Andres and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, as well as culinary schools, including the Institute of Culinary Education.</p>
<p>Struck Capital led the funding round and was joined by Craft Ventures, Relish Works, Aurify Brands, Food Tech Angels and Branded Strategic Ventures. Angel investors backing the company include Snap’s former head of product Bobby Lo, Shef founders and Bento Box founder and CEO Krystle Mobayeni.</p>

<p>Meez started in December 2020 with 20 paying customers and has grown to more than 750 today among a diverse mix of restaurants, from fine dining to fast casual and culinary schools, an area that Sharkey plans to dig into in the next year. Also during that time, the company’s revenue grew steadily 22% month over month, which he attributed to the company’s unique approach and digital adoption making its way into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“The adoption curve hit the infancy stages of the food world,” Sharkey added. “Culinary professionals are starting to realize how to do more with less, and they can’t rely on their labor all the time. Things that worked before the pandemic don’t work now. This is a helpful tool and necessity because you can’t just rely on the recipe anymore, there are other things you have to do to it to be able to operationalize your content, and there was not a place to do that before.”</p>
<p>Sharkey intends to deploy the new capital into developing an iOS app and technology development, including menu planning, self-onboarding automation and to launch and test direct-to-consumer recipe engagement.</p>
<p>In addition, the company plans on attracting new restaurants this year and growing the team. Meez has 17 employees now, and Sharkey expects to add another 10 this year.</p>
<p>“Culinary professionals are some of the most creative and inventive people on the planet. But due to the physical nature of their work, very little attention has been paid to how digital technology can be leveraged to improve their workflows and systems for collaboration,” said Adam Struck, CEO of Struck Capital, in a written statement. “Josh is a unique founder in that he’s a professional chef, restaurant industry operator, and technology expert. He’s been able to synthesize the pain points that plague almost all kitchens into a platform that’s intuitive, beautifully designed and addresses major pain points for one of the world’s largest and oldest industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative investments are having a moment. Their popularity has surged over the last decade, with the asset class growing from just over $3 trillion in 2008 to more than $10 trillion in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.preqin.com/academy/lesson-1-alternative-assets/past-present-future-of-the-alternative-assets-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data provider Preqin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have fueled a large part of this growth, investing at record pace into alternatives like crypto, private companies and real estate. Some ultra-wealthy investors have made a windfall investing in alternatives using tax-advantaged accounts, a strategy billionaire Peter Thiel used to grow his Roth individual retirement account from $2,000 to $5 billion in 20 years, tax-free, </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProPublica reported last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, average investors are seeking a slice of these markets, lured by the potential of making outsized returns, which are even more appealing if they come tax-free.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253465" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While investing dollars from one’s tax-advantaged retirement account in alternatives has long been legal, it has remained largely inaccessible to average retail investors. Veteran investor Eric Satz realized this in 2013 when he first tried to deploy money from his IRA into private companies and was met with pushback from his financial advisor, who was concerned about the potential risks, Satz told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 10 weeks of research and logistical hurdles, Satz was finally able to make his first tax-advantaged alternative investment through a self-directed IRA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of this 10-week process that seemed to have the goalposts constantly moving in terms of what was required in order to make the investment, I wrote the custodian that I was using a check for the privilege of making this investment that I discovered and did all the homework and research on,” Satz said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated with these complexities, Satz tried to go through the same process using three different custodians, and found that his experience “got worse each time.” The onerous process, according to Satz, explains why less than 2% of the </span><a href="https://www.planadviser.com/35-trillion-retirement-savings-tells-tale-two-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 trillion in assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sitting in individual retirement accounts is invested in alternatives. In contrast, most high-net-worth investors and institutions have much higher allocations to alternatives, ranging from anywhere between 15 to 80%, Satz said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retirement accounts are particularly suited to making early-stage investments in private companies because of their long duration and risk-return profile, Satz said. Using self-directed IRA companies to make such investments was costing Satz over $500 a year in fees, a problem he aimed to solve for others by launching <a href="https://www.altoira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alto</a> in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto’s self-directed IRA platform provides a simpler, more affordable option for individuals to invest their retirement savings into alternatives, according to the company. The Nashville-based startup provides its users with access to a host of alternatives through its partnerships with over 70 investment platforms, including AngelList, Grayscale and Masterworks, the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto hosts nearly 20,000 funded accounts representing close to $1 billion in assets, Satz said &#8212; and 40% of the accounts are dedicated to holding cryptocurrency, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto announced today that it has raised $40 million in Series B funding led by <a href="https://www.avp.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advance Venture Partners</a>, whose founder and managing partner David T. ibnAle is set to join the company’s board of directors. Existing investors <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unusual Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.acrewcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acrew Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.alphaedison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha Edison</a>, <a href="https://foundationcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation Capital</a>, <a href="https://gaingels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaingels</a> and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Ventures</a> also participated in the round. Alto last raised $17 million for its Series A in April 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use the fresh funding to grow its team of product and engineering employees from 50 today to 120 by the end of 2022, Satz said. It also plans to grow its content offering to help investors educate themselves on alternatives, though the company is not a registered broker-dealer or investment advisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While crypto is one of the fastest-growing areas of interest for Alto users, Satz said he expects demand to grow in other areas, including private company investing and artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what you&#8217;ll see from us in Q1 and Q2 is greater penetration into collectibles and collectibles marketplaces. There&#8217;s just some product innovation that we are coming out with that will make that a lot easier for most folks,” Satz said. “I [also] think we&#8217;ll see some innovation in 2022 in fund access, and the ability for more people to participate in fund investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more and more people are wanting to leave a smaller footprint on the earth, many of us are living in smaller spaces. <a href="http://www.daan.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daan Tech</a> is a startup we found at CES 2022 that is taking a fresh new look at tech aimed specifically at small households of one or two people.</p>
<p>I rarely cover washing machines or dishwashers here on TechCrunch, mostly because there&#8217;s rarely a startup angle, and, let&#8217;s face it, unless it is able to dance the Macarena, dishwashers are <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dull--as--dishwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dull as dishwater</a>, as the Brits like to mumble into their cups of tea. Daan Tech&#8217;s Bob Global fits the bill; it&#8217;s ultra-compact and perfect for apartment dwellers, as it doesn&#8217;t have to be plumbed in. It comes with a built-in one-gallon integrated water tank, and the company claims it uses only a fifth of the water that regular hand-washing does.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in a city where space is hard to come by, we wanted to provide an efficient solution for washing dishes in a cramped kitchen,&#8221; said Damian Py, president and CEO of Daan Tech. &#8220;We also wanted to create a product that has a positive impact on the environment and to keep our environmental footprint as small as possible.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251978" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

It also has a UV-C cleaning cycle that can kill bacteria without using water at all &#8212; perfect for sterilizing without using water. (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daan Tech)</p></div></p>
<p>The original version of the Bob design sold more than 35,000 units in Europe, and the new, updated version of the device is coming to a kitchen counter near you very soon. Daan Tech tells me that Bob Global will be available in most countries in 2022 and is currently available for preorder at <a href="http://www.daan.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a discounted price at the company&#8217;s website</a>, with a $299 price tag and an estimated delivery by late Summer 2022.</p>
<p>The company has a fetching video of the original version of Bob, which gives a bit more context for what the company is up to:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y66AjQUi7Nw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bob also has an optional additional feature of <a href="https://daan.tech/us/discover-bob-mini-dishwasher/bob-ultraviolet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a UV-C cleaning cycle</a>. In this mode, the washer doesn&#8217;t use water, but instead uses UV-C rays to disinfect items that can&#8217;t get wet &#8211; think phones, keys, wallets, etc. The theory is sound &#8212; and it&#8217;s neat to see this wrapped into a tabletop appliance like a small dishwasher, rather than in a separate device.</p>
<p>Riding high on the success of its diminutive dishwasher, the company is now working on a suite of additional small home appliances, including a smart toaster oven and an autonomous washing machine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tiktok.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> &#8212; the hugely popular mobile video app with more than 1 billion users &#8212; has been taking its first steps to break into a new screen, the TV screen, launching and integrating a new app called TikTok TV first with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tiktok-is-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-in-the-u-s-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Fire TV</a>, and <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then</a> Google TV and other Android TV OS devices, LG Smart TVs, and Samsung Smart TVs. Today comes news of another front in that strategy: TikTok has inked a partnership with <a href="https://atmosphere.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmosphere</a>, the startup that provides licensed and curated streamed video content for commercial venues like Westin, Taco Bell and Texas Roadhouse, as well as doctors&#8217; offices, gyms and other venues where people spend dwelling time.</p>
<p>Initially, the partnership will see Atmosphere develop a new channel on its platform dedicated to curated TikTok videos. It will be the first time that TikTok content is being used for an out-of-home video service.</p>
<p>“TikTok has become a destination for more than a billion people to be entertained, get inspired, and find community,” said Dan Page, head of global business development, new screens at TikTok, in a statement. “By partnering with Atmosphere, we’re excited to make it easy for people to experience TikTok together by bringing the joy and creativity of our platform to new screens, venues, and audiences.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253701" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Atmosphere has been using the CES tech event to announce a series of milestones. Earlier this week, it revealed that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/atmosphere-raises-100m-as-its-business-focused-streaming-tv-service-passes-19k-venues-and-20m-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $100 million</a> on the back of very strong growth in the last year: it doubled the number of venues using its ad-supported streaming services to 19,000, covering some 20 million monthly unique users.</p>
<p>Although Atmosphere already repurposes content from platforms like YouTube in channels that it builds, this will be the company&#8217;s first channel dedicated to a single social media brand. Leo Resig, the co-founder and CEO of Atmosphere, said his company and TikTok have been working on this deal and how the channel would look for eight months.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the largest internet social media platform right now, and so they are very particular about how their brand and content are distributed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they see the power of our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, TikTok has confirmed to TechCrunch that the Atmosphere partnership is <em>not</em> another outlet for, or a repurposing of, TikTok TV, as TikTok&#8217;s consumer-focused TV app is called. Instead, it&#8217;s an example of how, as TikTok continues to mature, it&#8217;s diversifying in how to reach new audiences, and build different revenue streams to complement advertising and other revenue models in its main app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In this case, a team of people from Atmosphere will have access to a library of TikTok content, from which they will select videos they believe might work well on an Atmosphere channel. The team then connects with the individual creator to get the okay to use the video, and to work out how to credit said creator. Atmosphere then strips out all the audio, overlays it with its own optional audio (or none at all &#8212; many of the venues that are Atmosphere customers use the service on mute by default), adds its own captions, and collates all that into its own video stream. The commercial arrangement in this deal is between TikTok and Atmosphere, which will run ads in the channel. That is to say, creators themselves &#8212; at least for now &#8212; do not get paid.</p>
<p>The financial details are not being disclosed but generally it sounds like content providers are paid, and Atmosphere makes its revenues from the advertising it runs alongside the content. As as for a basic guideline on payouts to providers, Resig said that currently the company pays &#8220;low millions of dollars per year&#8221; to content creators, but, he added, &#8220;We get most of our content for free,&#8221; instead giving creators attribution to help them grow their audiences and brands. TikTok is not an investor in Atmosphere, the startup pointed out (it said that avoiding confusion is why it chose to separate its funding news from the TikTok news).</p>
<p>From what we understand, Atmosphere will be able to access a selection of TikTok videos &#8212; tens of thousands of videos &#8212; rather than the much bigger catalogue.</p>
<p>For a first foray into partnering with a social media company to bring content from that platform to Atmosphere, TikTok is something of a bullseye for the startup. TikTok was already looking for more opportunities to expand to a wider variety of screens (and specifically TV screens), and this gives it an opportunity to repurpose and give new life to the long tail of its back catalogue of videos that might no longer get picked up for viewing via TikTok&#8217;s algorithms on its main app. On top of that, TikTok already had some parallels with Atmosphere in terms of how the two are being used, starting with audio consumption.</p>
<p>Atmosphere&#8217;s Resig told TechCrunch that more than 99% of its customers were already streaming its services with the sound off, which led the company to building out more content with the audio removed altogether. TikTok, as it happens, also has an audience that consumes videos on its platform with the sound off, so much so that TikTok has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-09-23/subtitles-once-a-barrier-to-foreign-film-have-found-a-home-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built its own captioning technology</a> to let creators on the platform either add their own words as graphics or use TikTok&#8217;s AI to do this for them. Resig said that in the initial integration, the videos that Atmosphere will be curating from TikTok are not necessarily going to be these, and it will be overlaying its own captioning around them for TikTok&#8217;s Atmosphere channel.</p>
<p>TikTok last year scored a notable point during the US Olympics, where it carved out a place for itself not as a destination for official Olympic event streams, or even official clips (these could be found on there from official accounts, yet they were elsewhere, too); but as a place for user-generated content from people on the ground &#8212; athletes, audience, others involved in the Olympics &#8212; that was either a complement to the official coverage, or sometimes (such as with the news of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-09-23/subtitles-once-a-barrier-to-foreign-film-have-found-a-home-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone Biles facing challenges in her exercises</a>) ahead of it altogether.</p>
<p>Atmosphere also has carved out a place for itself in providing sports content that is complementary to what a bar or other venue might already be showing. In fact, so far it has eschewed trying to provide its customers with a direct replacement for premium sports channels, which comprise some of the most popular content that they broadcast in their venues, bringing in customers and often the driver for a venue paying a premium for a commercial pay-TV subscription in the first place. These days, an Atmosphere customer &#8212; such as a bar &#8212; that has TVs installed broadcasting sports on them will continue doing so even as they bring in Atmosphere on other TVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we coexist with sports,&#8221; Resig said, noting that on average, Atmosphere will be on 25% of a venue&#8217;s screens, with the other TVs broadcasting more traditional content. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be on every screen.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s slowly changing. As Atmosphere scales, it is starting to have more conversations with sports media organizations &#8212; the companies that broadcast and manage the rights for teams, leagues, and so on &#8212; and is now thinking more about what shape Atmosphere premium sports content might take. Interestingly, it seems like this is precisely the place with TikTok is with sports, too.</p>
<p>This is just an early and first move into a partnership between the two. If it clicks, down the line there may also be more questions about how it will evolve as a business relationship. Right now, Resig confirmed that the commercial relationship it has here is with TikTok, not the creators on the platform, who are not being paid individually. Their compensation, such as it is, is currently coming in the form of promoting the creators and providing links to find them elsewhere.</p>
<p>One option down the line might be if creators one day start to build content specifically for TV rather than mobile formats. This would make some sense, considering how many of the videos now appear in awkward formats that need large areas of blurring on either side of the action to fill out the space on the horizontal TV screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will creators create content specifically for TikTok&#8217;s TV activities in the future? Absolutely,&#8221; predicted Resig. &#8220;Once it becomes ubiquitous those who create content will see value in the native app, and separately the TV format.&#8221; He said this is not something being discussed right now, but with any platform, &#8220;you know you’ve made it when people are creating content specific for that platform.&#8221;</p>
