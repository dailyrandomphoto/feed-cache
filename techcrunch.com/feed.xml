										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security operations teams face a daunting task these days, fending off malicious hackers and their increasingly sophisticated approaches to cracking into networks. That also represents a gap in the market: building tools to help those security teams do their jobs. Today, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.rezilion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rezilion</a> that is doing just that &#8212; building automation tools for DevSecOps, the area of IT that addresses the needs of security teams and the technical work that they need to do in their jobs &#8212; is announcing $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>Guggenheim Investments is leading the round with JVP and Kindred Capital also contributing. Rezilion said that unnamed executives from Google, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, IBM, Cisco, PayPal, JP Morgan Chase, Nasdaq, eBay, Symantec, RedHat, RSA and Tenable are also in the round. Previously, the company had raised $8 million.</p>
<p>Rezilion&#8217;s funding is coming on the back of strong initial growth for the startup in its first two years of operations.</p>
<p>Its customer base is made up of some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies, including two of the &#8220;Fortune 10&#8221; (the top 10 of the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune 500</a>). CEO Liran Tancman, who co-founded Rezilion with CTO Shlomi Boutnaru, said that one of those two is one of the world&#8217;s biggest software companies, and the other is a major connected device vendor, but he declined to say which. (For the record, the top 10 includes Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google, Walmart and CVS.)</p>
<p>Tancman and Boutnaru had previously co-founded another security startup, CyActive, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/paypal-confirms-acquisition-of-cyactive-plans-to-open-new-security-hub-in-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by PayPal in 2015</a>; the pair worked there together until leaving to start Rezilion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools out in the market now to help automate different aspects of developer and security operations. Rezilion focuses on a specific part of DevSecOps: large businesses have over the years put in place a lot of processes that they need to follow to try to triage and make the most thorough efforts possible to detect security threats. Today, that might involve inspecting every single suspicious piece of activity to determine what the implications might be.</p>
<p>The problem is that with the volume of information coming in, taking the time to inspect and understand each piece of suspicious activity can put enormous strain on an organization: it&#8217;s time-consuming, and as it turns out, not the best use of that time because of the signal to noise ratio involved. Typically, each vulnerability can take 6-9 hours to properly investigate, Tancman said. &#8220;But usually about 70-80% of them are not exploitable,&#8221; meaning they may be bad for some, but not for this particular organization and the code it&#8217;s using today. That represents a very inefficient use of the security team&#8217;s time and energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Eight of out ten patches tend to be a waste of time,&#8221; Tancman said of the approach that is typically made today. He believes that as its AI continues to grow and its knowledge and solution becomes more sophisticated, &#8220;it might soon be 9 out of 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rezilion has built a taxonomy and an AI-based system that essentially does that inspection work as a human would do: it spots any new, or suspicious, code, figures out what it is trying to do, and runs it against a company&#8217;s existing code and systems to see how and if it might actually be a threat to it or create further problems down the line. If it&#8217;s all good, it essentially whitelists the code. If not, it flags it to the team.</p>
<p>The stickiness of the product has come out of how Tancman and Boutnaru understand large enterprises, especially those heavy with technology stacks, operate these days in what has become a very challenging environment for cybersecurity teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are using us to accelerate their delivery processes while staying safe,&#8221; Tancman said. &#8220;They have strict compliance departments and have to adhere to certain standards,&#8221; in terms of the protocols they take around security work, he added. &#8220;They want to leverage DevOps to release that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Rezilion has generally won over customers in large part for simply understanding that culture and process and helping them work better within that: &#8220;Companies become users of our product because we showed them that, at a fraction of the effort, they can be more secure.&#8221; This has special resonance in the world of tech, although financial services, and other verticals that essentially leverage technology as a significant foundation for how they operate, are also among the startup&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>Down the line, Rezilion plans to add remediation and mitigation into the mix to further extend what it can do with its automation tools, which is part of where the funding will be going, too, Boutnaru said. But he doesn&#8217;t believe it will ever replace the human in the equation altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will just focus them on the places where you need more human thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just removing the need for tedious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that grand tradition of enterprise automation, then, it will be interesting to watch which other automation-centric platforms might make a move into security alongside the other automation they are building. For now, Rezilion is forging out an interesting enough area for itself to get investors interested.</p>
<p>“Rezilion’s product suite is a game changer for security teams,” said Rusty Parks, senior MD of Guggenheim Investments, in a statement. “It creates a win-win, allowing companies to speed innovative products and features to market while enhancing their security posture. We believe Rezilion has created a truly compelling value proposition for security teams, one that greatly increases return on time while thoroughly protecting one’s core infrastructure.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marginedge.com/">MarginEdge</a> announced Monday it raised $18 million in Series B funding to give restaurant operators a real-time view into their costs.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Bo Davis founded the company with Roy Phillips and Brian Mills in 2015. Both Davis and Phillips are veterans of the restaurant industry: Davis was previously the founder of conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain Wasabi, while Phillips was an executive at Bloomin Brands.</p>
<p>What they recognized with independent restaurants was that they struggled with workflow like invoices and tracking food costs and were either building internal tools to help them stay on top of things or were still operating with pen and paper or spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“We focused on building something our friends would like,” Davis told TechCrunch. “We spent three years on the product and worked with 20 restaurants to use the software and focus on getting it right instead of rushing to market.”</p>

<p>MarginEdge’s tool is a restaurant management app that works with a business’ point of sale to streamline inventory, cost-tracking, ordering and recipes to eliminate the paperwork. It also captures all invoices, receipts or bills and converts them to line-item details within 24 hours. It is designed for independent restaurant owners that have under 50 units, Davis said.</p>
<p>Since launching its app in 2018, the Virginia-based company is seeing its platform used in over 2,500 restaurants. It raised a Series A in 2019, then an A2 in 2020 and with the latest round, led by IGC Hospitality, has raised $25 million in total.</p>
<p>IGC Hospitality, which operates restaurant properties, is not only an investor, but is also a customer, said Jeffrey Brosi, founder and managing partner. The company was using some different technology platforms to manage inventory and sales, but was looking for something to manage its whole inventory process.</p>
<p>“Bo came in and did a presentation, and it was amazing,” Brosi added. “The biggest thing for us is [being] user friendly. MarginEdge also has great customer service. We’ve invested in a few companies in the hospitality industry, and know the pain points and what we want to fix. If it makes sense financially, we will invest. This was one pain point that we didn’t have, and Bo filled that void.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like all restaurants over the past 18 months, Davis said the global pandemic caused MarginEdge to step back and evaluate. Despite many restaurants going out of business, he credits his business taking off again to restaurants rethinking their processes.</p>
<p>“We were lucky enough to be in a good position with capital that we could keep our team,” he added. “Revenue decreased for the first time, but we grew 45% even with COVID and as of Q1 was seeing 200% annual growth.”</p>
<p>MarginEdge has over 400 employees and its platform processes 45,000 invoices a week. Davis intends to invest the new funding in building out the leadership team, product development, building new features for the back office and on data science, an area he just received an advanced degree in, he said.</p>
<p>The company is using benchmark data around sales, food costs and labor costs and would like to provide more insights to its customers as it relates to inflation, which affects all of those aspects, and as a result, the menu prices.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is using data to understand menu pricing and what other people are doing so you are not pricing yourself out of the market or operating on margins where you can’t survive,” Davis added. “It will be all about predicting rather than reporting. The two things in the kitchen that are hardest are the startup prep list and the inventory late at night, and we make both easier.”</p>

The California-based firm, which started its journey in India and rivals Salesforce, said it plans to sell 28.5 million shares at a price [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freshworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1544522/000162828021018417/freshworkss-1a1.htm">disclosed</a> on Monday that it is aiming for a valuation of up to $9 billion in its US initial public offering in which it is hoping to raise over $800 million.</p>
<p>The California-based firm, which started its journey in India and rivals Salesforce, said it plans to sell 28.5 million shares at a price range of $28 to $32. If the firm is able to sell its shares at the top range, it will raise $912 million. Freshworks had originally filed paperworks for its IPO in late August, but hadn&#8217;t disclosed several figures.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/freshworks-raises-150m-series-h-on-3-5b-valuation/">valued at $3.5 billion in a financing round in November 2019</a>. The startup considered raising a pre-IPO round earlier this year at a valuation of over $5 billion but decided against it, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Freshworks, which counts Accel, Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, and CapitalG among its existing investors, develops and offers a variety of business software tools, from CRM to help-desk software. In recent years, it has built enterprise SaaS platform to give customers a set of integrated business tools and aggressively pursued broadening its products offering.</p>
<p>The startup, which has applied to list its shares on Nasdaq under the symbol FRSH, serves over 50,000 customers and its revenue in the first six months of the year grew to $169 million, up from $11 million during the same period last year. At the same time, its net loss dropped to $9.8 million from $57 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, based on industry research from International Data Corporation (IDC), we believe we have a large addressable market of approximately $120 billion,&#8221; the firm said in an updated S-1 filing on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, based on our internal data and analysis, we estimate the annual potential market opportunity for our products to be $77 billion. [&#8230;] We expect our estimated market opportunity will continue to expand as customers onboard more or expand usage of our products, increasing the weighted average ARR per customer for use of our products.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with Freshworks co-founder and chief executive Girish Mathrubootham about the business. Mathrubootham is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in India. Along with three friends, Mathrubootham <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/high-profile-entrepreneurs-launch-85-million-fund-to-back-indian-saas-startups/">launched an $85 million venture fund</a> in late July this year to back early-stage SaaS startups in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company focuses on providing small to mid-size CPG companies with an automated way to manage their trade promotion in retail stores.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cresicor.ai/">Cresicor</a>, a consumer packaged goods trade management platform startup, raised $5.6 million in seed funding to further develop its tools for more accurate data and analytics.</p>
<p>The company, based remotely, focuses on small to midsize CPG companies, providing them with an automated way to manage their trade promotion, a process co-founder and CEO Alexander Whatley said is done primarily manually using spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in a trade promotion: When a company wants to run a discount on one of their slower-selling items, the company has to spend money to do this — to have displays set up in a store or have that item on a certain shelf. If it works, more people will buy the item at the lower price point. Essentially, a trade promotion is the process of spending money to get more money in the future, Whatley told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/">Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/embed/#?secret=GpgRCxoNsQ" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Figuring out all of the trade promotions is a complicated process, Whatley explained. Companies receive data feeds on the promotions from several different places, revenue data from retailers, accounting source data to show how many units were shipped and then maybe data directly from retailers. All of that has to be matched against the promotion.</p>
<p>“No API is bringing this data back to brands, so our software helps to automate and track these manual processes so companies can do analytics to see how the promotions are doing,” he added. “It also helps the finance team understand expenses, including which are valid and those that are not.”</p>
<p>What certain companies spend on trade promotions can represent their second-largest cost behind manufacturing, and companies often end up reinvesting between 20% and 30% of their revenue into trade promotions, Whatley said. This is a big market, representing untapped growth, especially with U.S. <a href="https://www.revtrax.com/cpg-marketing-strategies-to-maximize-holiday-sales/">CPG sales topping $720 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>“You can see how messy the whole industry is, which is why we have a bright future and huge TAM,” he added. “With this new funding, we can target other parts of the P&amp;L like supply chain and salaries. We also provide analytics for their strategy and where they should be spending it — which store, on which supply. By allocating resources the right way, companies typically see a 10% boost in sales as a result.”</p>
<p>Whatley started the company in 2017 with his brother, Daniel, Stuart Kennedy and Nikki McNeil while a Harvard undergrad. Since raising the funding back in February, the company has grown 2.5x in revenue, while employee headcount grew 4x over the past 12 months to 20.</p>
<p>Costanoa Ventures led the investment and was joined by Torch Capital and a group of angel investors including Fivestars CTO Matt Doka and Hu’s Kitchen CEO Mark Ramadan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>John Cowgill, partner at Costanoa, said though Cresicor raised a seed round, the company was already acquiring brands and capital before releasing a product and grew to almost a Series A company without any outside capital, saying it “blew me away.”</p>
<p>Cresicor is the “perfect example” of a company that Costanoa would get excited about — a vertical software company using data or machine learning to augment a pain point, Cowgill added.</p>
<p>“The CPG industry is in the middle of a rapid change where we see all of these emerging, digital native and mission-driven brands rapidly eating share from incumbents,” he added. “For the next generation of brands to compete, they have to win in trade promotion management. Cresicor’s opportunity to go beyond trade is significant. It is just a starting point to build a company that is the core enabler of great brands.”</p>
<p>The new funding will be used mainly to hire more talent in the areas of engineering and customer success so the company can hit its next benchmarks, Alexander Whatley said. He also intends to use the funding to acquire new brands and on software development. Cresicor boasts a list of customers including Perfect Snacks, Oatly and Hint Water.</p>
<p>The retail industry is valued at $5.5 trillion, and one-fifth of it is CPG, Whatley said. As a result, he has his eye on going after other verticals within CPG, like electronics and pet food, and then expanding into other areas.</p>
<p>“We are also going to work with enterprise companies — we see an opportunity to work with companies like P&amp;G and General Mills, and we also want to build an ecosystem around trade promotion and launch into other profit and loss areas,” Whatley said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obstetrics virtual care company <a href="https://babyscripts.com/">Babyscripts</a> raised $12 million in the first round of a Series B investment that will enable the company to accelerate the roll out of its virtual maternity care tool platform to providers.</p>
<p>MemorialCare Innovation Fund led the investment and was joined by Philips Ventures and the CU Healthcare Innovation Fund. The new round of funding gives Babyscripts around $26 million raised to date, Babyscripts co-founder and president Juan Pablo Segura told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>We last checked in on Washington, D.C-based Babyscripts two years ago when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/">Phillips led a $6 million investment</a> into the company. A lot has happened since 2019, Segura said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wWVirPNCv6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/">Electronics giant Philips invests in monitoring and information platform for expecting mothers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electronics giant Philips invests in monitoring and information platform for expecting mothers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/embed/#?secret=wWVirPNCv6" data-secret="wWVirPNCv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, the company had one product and was working with hospitals and healthcare providers to distribute a medical device and mobile app to expecting mothers for monitoring blood pressure and providing neonatal care information.</p>
<p>Today, the company has multiple kits that can be targeted to patients, including blood pressure monitoring, weight and captured blood sugars. Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy. At one physician site, use of Babyscripts helped open up close to 1,000 appointments in a year so obstetricians there could focus on higher-risk patients, Segura said.</p>
<p>It also has larger population health focuses — driven mainly by the pandemic — to help higher-risk expecting mothers with remote patient monitoring and virtual care, as well as work to solve health inequity issues.</p>
<p>More than 70% of patients using Babyscripts are on Medicaid, which may be the only safety net provider in the patient’s geography, Segura said. As a result, the company began forming partnerships with public health departments, managed Medicaid plans and providers, like <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/leading_pregnancy_app_babyscripts_announces_collaboration_with_privia_health/prweb18102627.htm">Priva Health</a>, so that Babyscripts could be paid for at the local level.</p>
<p>“Right now, one of the biggest challenges for a pregnant patient on Medicaid and working an hourly job is asking moms to choose between prenatal care and putting food on the table,” he added. “Fifty percent of maternal complications can be avoided, but a lot of these issues come from the fact that the model of delivery care hasn’t changed in 40 years. About 12% to 15% of deaths come from blood pressure complications. If we could monitor via Babyscripts or more coordinated care to get intervention faster, we could eliminate massive swaths of delivery events in maternity and reduce mortality events in this country.”</p>
<p>Amid the pandemic, Babyscripts saw enrollments grow 10x. Segura decided to go after a new round of funding to meet that need and opportunities that could be addressed. Babyscripts’s program is now being used by 75 health systems in 32 states, and the company is monitoring 250,000 women each year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company continues to receive inquiries from markets and payers that are looking to do more for pregnant patients, so Segura wants to be able to grow to meet that demand and invest in a go-to-market strategy to get its kits into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>The new funding will also enable the company to release new features. It recently launched a mental health product and is developing a substance use disorder experience amid others, he said. Babyscripts is also working on a national level with payers and is building an infrastructure around that as well.</p>
<p>The company has 45 employees currently, and Segura expects to double that in the next 12 to 18 months in the areas of product, payer growth, clinical expertise, implementation and customer success. Babyscripts is also working toward being available in all 50 states and bringing in more public health departments and payers as partners to get more health systems working together, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caleb Winder, managing director of MemorialCare Innovation Fund, said he was attracted to both Babyscripts’ outcomes data and addressing the high rates of complications in pregnancies. It also not only eliminates waiting for hours at the doctor’s office just to be seen for five minutes, but also closes some gaps in care, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the problems in this space is that providers, as much as they want to help, are stretched thin,” Winder said. “There are also access problems. Something like 50% of counties in this country lack one OB, so in-person care is difficult. Babyscripts can help patients anywhere be monitored and their health managed virtually. It can also alert a clinician when there is a real problem. We saw their data, for example, that showed preeclampsia was diagnosed 13 days faster than the standard of care.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Numan.com">Numan</a>, the European subscription service covering erectile dysfunction (ED) and men’s wellness/health needs more generally, has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by <a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, with participation from existing investors Novator, Vostok New Global, Anthemis Exponential, Colle Capital, and new investor Hanwha Group. The new round will be used to fuel expansion.</p>
<p>Numan’s current roster of services cover ED, premature ejaculation, hair loss, gut and lung health, and nutritional deficiencies. But they can also do blood tests for general health needs which don’t require in-person appointments.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic, the digitization of health and wellness continues apace. Had we not had a pandemic, vitamins, and the like, delivered through the letterbox, would almost certainly have continued to grow steadily as a business. But with the pandemic, businesses that can speak to our health needs remotely have exploded.</p>
<p>Who would have considered taking a blood test remotely a ‘normal thing’ two years ago? Now it’s practically required. Into this space, wellness companies have uncovered an extremely lucrative nexus of trends: an aging male population with a desire to remain sexually active, increasing awareness of their own health, the convenience of subscription, and the imperative of the pandemic to keep things remote has proven to be a powerful combination of forces.</p>
<p>Numan is not alone in this space. Roman and Hims, for example, are two big players in the US. The open door Numan is pushing against is more this wider movement around male health, which men themselves are becoming more open to. As well as growing organically, Numan has also made two strategic acquisitions of companies in the UK and Sweden to expand its footprint. It’s likely this new round will lead to similar strategic plays.</p>
<p>With sexual health a tricky subject for men, digital services are stepping in to mitigate any embarrassment around having to sit in front of the family GP. Numan is also regulated by the Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, giving it a further stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Numan claims men now prefer its model to in-person healthcare meetings. In its own survey of 800 subscribers, 88% said that using the service has improved their confidence, while 68% say that using Numan has also improved their relationships, and over half said the effects of the pandemic had given them a more positive impression of using digital healthcare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement Sokratis Papafloratos, CEO &amp; founder, Numan said: “This funding is a significant milestone on our journey to help millions of men be healthier. White Star Capital is one of the best investors in our space, and I’m delighted to be working together along with a wider team of brilliant investors.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Papafloratos added that despite there being a lot of competition in the space “this is not a winner-takes-all-market. We have 25 languages on the team so we understand the market, patients, regulation, we understand it more in-depth than many competitors.”</p>
<p>Eric Martineau-Fortin, Founder and Managing Partner, White Star Capital: “Men’s health has been under-served by traditional services and needs innovative businesses to break down barriers and ensure taboos don’t prevent men from being happy and healthy. Numan’s digital offering helps men take charge of their health discreetly and decisively. We’re incredibly excited by Sokratis and his team, and look forward to working with them as they grow.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding startups that help manufacturers and sellers distribute products and merchants access them on a single platform keeps increasing across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Cairo-based B2B e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.capiter.net/">Capiter</a> continues that trend by raising a $33 million Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment was co-led by Quona Capital and MSA Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other participating investors include Savola, Shorooq Partners, Foundation Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, and Derayah Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July 2020 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-nouh-363a2b119">Mahmoud Nouh</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-nouh">Ahmed Nouh</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, CEO Mahmoud Nouh says Capiter solves problems around reach and insights for suppliers and manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the manufacturers in Egypt today do not have the right infrastructure of the supply chain in place to reach merchants. Nouh says that manufacturers can only reach 30% of merchants in the market, but with Capiter, that number goes up between 80% to 100%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a large portion of the manufacturers&#8217; end trade happens via traditional channels where there is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no transparency over data or market insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using machine learning, Capiter says it helps these manufacturers gain critical insights into the markets they serve, the products they sell, and how they fair with competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then for merchants, Capiter attends to three problems. The first is the inconvenience merchants have to deal with engaging several suppliers to find the right product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is transparency which involves some back and forth between merchants and manufacturers on pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third is that merchants often have little or no access to working capital to get the right product and the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Capiter, merchants can order products from FMCGs and wholesalers while the company delivers them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter also provides fair pricing and matching techniques that showcases a wide range of inventory for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it affords working capital to them to buy more products even when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are strapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with cash. Capiter partners with local banks in Egypt and the Central Bank to perform this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has over 12 merchant types on its platform, including mom-and-pop stores, hotels, restaurants, cafes, electronic shops, supermarkets, grocery shops, and catering companies, each with its own customized solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re able to get the data from the products they buy. So we offer them the best solution on what they should sell, at what time and peak seasons, including when are the offerings happening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are customized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions that we offer,&#8221; said Mahmoud Nouh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s revenues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are derived</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from little margins on the products bought from manufacturers and sold to merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then on rebates for the suppliers and commission from the working capital provided to merchants. Capiter also makes money from providing market insights and data services to manufacturers and FMCGs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> B2B e-commerce platforms operate either asset-light, inventory-heavy models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nouh tells me that Capiter chose to use a hybrid model &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making deliveries without owning any trucks to ensure scalability and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning inventory, especially for high turnover products helping the company with high availability and better pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This way has enabled us to scale the business in a very fast manner and at the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warehouses and trucks, we don&#8217;t own them; we rent them. We deal with third-party logistics for transportation and we manage them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50,000 merchants and 1,000 sellers use Capiter. According to CEO Nouh, the company has provided up to 6,000 SKUs. He also adds that the company is targeting an annualized revenue of $1 billion by next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re on a very good trajectory for achieving this,&#8221; he added. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team members, we have a team of more than 1000 people at the moment, including in warehouses, delivery, etc. So we&#8217;ve seen good traction across all board,&#8221; he answered when asked about Capiter&#8217;s traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona Capital, the co-lead investor in this round, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have made some B2B e-commerce bets over the past years, for instance, Kenya&#8217;s Sokowatch. The investment in Capiter adds to the firm&#8217;s portfolio in that regard and a growing presence in the MENA region being its first check made in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Quona co-founder and managing partner Monica Brand Engel said, “Capiter’s embedded finance model, combined with its expertise and strong user engagement, can have a dramatic impact on the financial lives of SMEs, helping them optimize their income which helps communities to thrive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SME supply chain inefficiencies are massive throughout the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the key blocker is the lack of working capital in the system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has built an asset-light way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retailers and suppliers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> credit into the system through a comprehensive multi-product offering such as commerce, credit financing, digital payments, bookkeeping and inventory management for SMEs, leveraging on the ecosystem built by the local banks and financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” adds Ben Harburg, partner at MSA Capital, a global VC that has invested in fintechs like Nubank and Klarna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ahmed Nouh, the company&#8217;s COO, Capiter will expand into new verticals like agriculture and pharmaceutical offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-founder brings experience from the shipping and logistics space. Both he and Mahmoud are serial entrepreneurs. The latter&#8217;s journey is quite prominent, having worked in the mobility space as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-founder and COO of Egyptian ride-hailing company SWVL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/egyptian-ride-sharing-company-swvl-plans-to-go-public-in-a-1-5b-spac-merger/">announced a potential SPAC deal valuing it at $1.5 billion</a> and is one of the few African startups breeding a tech mafia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ahmed Sabbah, another co-founder of the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now runs early-stage fintech startup Telda</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has attracted a global team that brings together expertise from companies like Careem and Flipkart needed to achieve the company’s targets, said Mahmoud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that the team, alongside the provision of financial services via partnerships with banks and its hybrid model, are ways the company stands out in a competitive market with the likes of Fatura, Bosta, and MaxAB</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this investment, the company plans to expand v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ertically (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the buyer type) and geographically within the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to serve every single SME in the MENA region and expanding inside Egypt and globally.&#8221; He adds that Savola Group, one of its investors and the largest investor for FMCG products in the MENA region, will prove pivotal to this growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter also plans to diversify its financial services offerings to include payments. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Twenty years and one week ago, I was riding the monorail system at the Newark airport and pointed to the twin skyscrapers looming in the distance. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve never been to the top of the World Trade Center,&#8221; I said to my then fiancé and now husband. Days later, I would walk into a restaurant in a Slovenian town and see a report on the TV about a plane crashing into one of those towers. Like so many of us, we spent the rest of that day watching the news and wondering what would happen next.</p>
<p>In all, four aircraft were hijacked the morning of September 11, two of which crashed into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon and the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania. In all, 2,996 people were killed.</p>
<p>The September 11 terrorist attacks triggered a series of events that would change the world forever, including how we move about it. My September 6, 2001 flight to Newark and then onto to Europe was the last time I would experience what now seems unimaginable: getting to an airport less than 45 minutes before my plane took off.</p>
<p>My trip home from Europe provided a forecast of what air travel would look and feel like, although some measures like when we were separately interviewed two different times prior to boarding, ended up being temporary.</p>
<p>Within months of my arrival home, passenger screening and security at airports would be handled by a new federal agency called the Transportation Security Administration. Security wasn&#8217;t the only aspect of air travel that changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The airline industry experienced skyrocketing losses that sparked a wave of cost-cutting, new fees for travelers and consolidation. According <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-04-836.pdf">to the GAO</a>, the U.S. airline industry lost $23 billion between 2001 and 2003 and some of the nation&#8217;s biggest airlines including USAir and United Airlines filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The airline industry would suffer financial losses during the Great Recession of 2008, causing more bankruptcies and consolidation. Today, most domestic flights are controlled by four airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.</p>
<p>After recovering and stringing together a few years of profitability, the airline industry (and how we travel) would get hit again: this time from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked before about the possibilities of shared micromobility to help cities create more equitable and accessible transit ecosystems. Shared operators have expanded this idea to support activism.</p>
<p>Agencies and operators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/shared-micromobility-can-help-build-communities-residents-deserve/">provided free or discounted trips</a> for demonstrators to get to events, according to the <strong>North American Bikeshare and Scootershare Association&#8217;s</strong> 2020 report on the state of the shared micromobility industry, Many even donated or fundraised for racial justice nonprofits.</p>
<p>Not only are they aiding the fight on the ground, the report also shows that nearly three-quarters of all operators stated that diversity was a part of every hiring decision, and 69 percent reported that women and POC are represented at all levels of the organization.</p>
<h3>Operator update</h3>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> is back in Oakland with 500 scooters and plans to scale up to 1,000 over the coming weeks. The company pulled out of the city last year during the pandemic. This time, it&#8217;s focusing on &#8220;Communities of Concern&#8221; as designated by the city, and will deploy half its fleet to these neighborhoods that have been traditionally underserved by transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong> is hooking up with Irish computer vision startup <strong>Luna.</strong> Tier is adding Luna&#8217;s cameras and smart city technology to its shared e-scooter fleets across Europe and the Middle East. To handle the increase in work, Luna is hiring 15 new staffers to cover computer vision/AI, hardware, IoT and project management roles in Ireland. Interestingly, the partnership comes from an Ireland trade mission to Germany to better understand how the two countries could work together within the e-mobility and automotive industry. Luna just recently launched a pilot with <strong>Vo</strong>i in England, and Ford-backed micromobility operator <strong>Spin</strong> is slowly pushing out <strong>Drover AI&#8217;s</strong> similar tech on scooters in the United States.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Voi</strong>, the Swedish company is working with the UK government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/kickstart-scheme">Kickstart Scheme</a> to help create jobs for people ages 16 to 24 years old on Universal Credit who are at risk of long term unemployment. Voi is recruiting 25 young people across the country to work as Warehouse Operatives and Fleet Specialists. The young ones will be ensured a job for at least six months and will hopefully learn a thing or two about a growing transport industry.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong> has tweaked its branding. It recently announced its scooters and bikes will now be made in <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/electric-sky-why-bird-has-new-blue-look/">&#8220;Electric Sky&#8221; blue</a>, as opposed to its black, white and silver color scheme. The color evokes eco-friendly transportation, clear skies and cheerful days. It&#8217;s reminiscent of Revel&#8217;s blue mopeds and Swapfiets&#8217; bikes.</p>
<h3>Taking liberties with the term &#8220;micromobility&#8221;</h3>
<p>Chinese EV maker <strong>Xpeng</strong> says it&#8217;s going to make a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/">robot unicorn</a> for children to ride. The quadruped will navigate multiple types of terrain, recognize objects and provide &#8220;emotional interaction.&#8221; The robot pulls from Xpeng&#8217;s experiences with AI and automated driving development. The rendering looks cute and soft, for a metal beast, but the horn could be a bit longer IMO. Bonus: it&#8217;s not creepy-looking like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/oh-hey-xiaomi-has-its-own-creepy-robot-dog-now/">Xiaomi&#8217;s robot dog</a>.</p>
<p>Dutch startup <strong>Squad Mobility</strong> has introduced details for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">small, low-cost electric city car</a> that&#8217;s equipped with solar panels which drip feed the battery throughout the day. The company hopes to come out with a prototype for the solar-assisted quadricycle by October this year and begin deliveries by the end of next year. While it would be a fun passenger vehicle for city folks, the end game is to get in good with one of the car-sharing or shared micromobility operators and sell fleets of the Squad car for shared use.</p>
<p>At the Munich Motor Show, <strong>BMW</strong> revealed a couple of electric bike concepts that look pretty wicked. The Motorrad Vision AMBY looks like a motorcycle, but is probably more along the class of off-road motorbike, complete with fat tires and a seat-to-footrest ratio that brings to mind all the shredding that can be had. The <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341396EN/the-bmw-i-vision-amby">i Vision AMBY</a> is more of a traditional road e-bike, but maybe one that&#8217;s inspired by Back to the Future, such is its retrofuturistic vibe and, I&#8217;ll say it, postal service-beige frame.</p>
<h3>ADAS in scooters</h3>
<p>The desire to keep shared electric scooters off sidewalks has driven the development of advanced technology in the micromobility industry. Once the province of geofencing, scooter companies are so eager to get a leg up on the competition that they&#8217;re now implementing technology similar to advanced driver assistance systems usually found in cars. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">my story in Extra Crunch</a> that digs into this trend.</p>
<h3>Micromobility America event</h3>
<p>The folks who write our <a href="https://micromobility.substack.com/">other favorite micromobility newsletter</a> are going to be hosting a micromobility event in the SF Bay Area. On September 23, a range of experts, founders, investors and builders will be sharing top insights about the world of lightweight electric vehicles and their potential to disrupt transportation, including:<br />
Brazilian racing driver Lucas Di Grassi, American entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, senior writer at Wired Lauren Goode, analyst and founder of the term &#8220;micromobility&#8221; Horace Dediu</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors continue to sink money into ride-hailing companies. <strong>Cao Cao Mobility</strong>, the ride-hailing unit of Chinese automaker <strong>Geely Automobile Holdings</strong>, is the latest example.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/geelys-ride-hailing-unit-cao-cao-mobility-raises-589m-series-b-to-upgrade-tech-and-expand-fleet/">raised $589 million</a> (RMB 3.8 billion) in a Series B round led by Suzhou Xiangcheng Financial Holding Group, an investment company backed by the Xiangcheng district government of Suzhou. Suzhou High-Speed Rail New City Group and three other state-controlled enterprises also participated.</p>
<p>The raise brings the company&#8217;s total funding to around $773.2 million (RMB 5 billion).</p>
<p>As TechCrunch reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, Cao Cao is positioned for further growth and a larger market share, as long as the Chinese government believes the company is operating fairly. Its competitors Didi Global and Amap have come under increased government scrutiny that has hurt their business, while giving Cao Cao a boost.</p>
<p>A cybersecurity investigation prompted the Chinese government to temporarily remove Didi Global from Chinese app stores. As a result, Cao Cao, which is currently available in 62 cities in China, saw ride volume increase 32% in July.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accure</strong>, the Aachen, Germany-based battery safety software company <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/battery-analytics-startup-accure-banks-8-million/">raised $8 million</a> in a Series A round led by Blue Bear Capital. Capnamic Ventures and 42CAP also participated.</p>
<p><strong>BP Ventures</strong>, the investing arm of oil and gas giant BP, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/bp-ventures-invests-11-9m-in-in-car-payments-provider-ryd-to-support-expansion/">made a €10 million</a> ($11.9 million) investment in Ryd, a German in-car digital payments provider. The funds will be used to help Ryd expand its service into international markets and build out its offering.</p>
<p><strong>Delhivery</strong>, the Indian logistics firm, courted Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition as an investor before its expected IPO in the next two quarters: The Gurgaon-headquartered firm disclosed in a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/lee-fixels-addition-invests-over-75-million-in-delhivery/">Addition invested $76.4 million</a> in the startup as part of a Series I round. Delihivery hasn&#8217;t disclosed the total raise or other investors.</p>
<p><strong>Delimobil</strong>, the Russian car sharing company, has chosen banks to organize its IPO listing and is seeking to raise around $ 350 million, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-russian-car-sharing-firm-delimobil-eyes-350-mln-new-york-ipo-autumn-2021-09-07/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Skydweller Aero</strong>, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, received an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/solar-powered-aircraft-developer-skydweller-aero-adds-8m-to-series-a-partners-with-palantir/">additional $8 million</a> in oversubscribed funding led by Leonardo S.p.A, Marlinspike Capital and Advection Growth Capital. The funds were added to its Series A round, which had previously reached $32 million. The company said it has also partnered with Palantir Technologies to use its Foundry analytics platform to process information at-scale and onboard the aircraft designed for telecommunications, government operations and emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>Tritium Holdings</strong>, the Australian developer of DC fast-charging technology for electric vehicles, <a href="https://tritiumcharging.com/tritium-announces-aud40-million-private-placement-financing-by-cigna-investments-inc/">raised A$40 million</a>  ($29.4 million) from the investment arm of Cigna.</p>
<p><strong>WattE</strong>, a company trying to develop a network of truck stops and run a fleet of 12,000 electric trucks to share, will receive a $5 million grant from the California Energy Commission. The grant is for the construction of the state&#8217;s first electric truck stop. The company also recently closed a $6 million Series A round led by Canon Equity.</p>
<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear things. But I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share what the little birds are telling me.</p>
<p>You likely spotted the widespread coverage, including by TechCrunch, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/ford-hires-apple-executive-who-led-its-secret-car-project/"><strong>Ford Motor</strong> hired <strong>Doug Field</strong></a><strong>,</strong> the engineering executive who was VP of Apple&#8217;s special projects team and its secret, not-very-secret car program.</p>
<p>Field, who also once worked as senior vice president of engineering at Tesla, was named as Ford&#8217;s chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer. Soon after the news broke, reports came out that Kevin Lynch, who led development on the Apple Watch, had taken over Field&#8217;s role on the car project.</p>
<p>All of this had TC readers wondering (at least according to my DMs and emails) whether Apple&#8217;s car program was at risk. I reached out to some folks and one source told me that Apple employees were in Korea meeting with battery manufacturers as early as last week, which suggests that the game is on. You might recall, <a href="https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/313622.html?gosh">The Korea Times</a> reported back in early August a team from Apple was visiting battery manufacturers LG Chem, SK, and Hanwha as part of &#8220;early talks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! Big news out of the aviation industry this week, as major airlines pledged to make 3 billion gallons of &#8220;sustainable aviation fuel&#8221; available to aircraft carriers by 2030, in line with a federal goal of reducing aviation emissions by 20% by the start of the next decade.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by industry group <strong><a href="https://www.airlines.org/news/u-s-airlines-announce-3-billion-gallon-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-goal/">Airlines for America</a> </strong>(A4A), whose members include <strong>United Airlines</strong>, <strong>Delta</strong>, <strong>American Airlines</strong> and <strong>Southwest</strong>. The group had previously set a target of 2 billion gallons by 2030 back in March. (Also yesterday, United made a separate announcement that it would purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from startup Alder Fuels, pending certain conditions are met. Check out my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/sustainable-jet-fuel-company-alder-fuels-seals-investments-from-united-honeywell/">story on the deal here</a>.</p>
<p>A4A stressed the importance of federal action to support the development of SAF, including a &#8220;blender&#8221; tax credit for SAF mixed with conventional fuel and public-private research partnerships into SAF tech.</p>
<p>But this would be just the beginning, if <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> has his say; his administration wants a &#8220;fully zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/09/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-the-future-of-sustainable-fuels-in-american-aviation/">White House fact sheet</a> released Thursday. Aviation accounts for 11% of the country&#8217;s transportation-related emissions, the fact sheet says. Plus, while 3 billion gallons of fuel certainly sounds like a lot, a United spokesperson told TechCrunch that the airline consumes around 4 billion annually, and the White House says demand overall could be as high as 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.</p>
<p>To meet that demand, Biden said he is seeking that SAF incentives be included in the $3.5 trillion spending bill currently being debated by Congress, including a tax credit and $4.3 billion earmarked for funding SAF projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note two things: one, as it currently stands, SAF is more expensive than conventional jet fuel, itself a considerable cost for airlines. Two, the above goals on behalf of the airlines are non-binding, voluntary agreements. Taken together, that means (in my humble opinion) that a tax incentive or something like it will be necessary for SAF to achieve cost parity with conventional fuel &#8212; and for airlines to actually adopt it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The other policy items that caught my eye this week come from the great state of New York. The first is out of New York City, which set a target to install 40,000 public Level 2 chargers and 6,000 DC fast chargers by 2030. This buildout, outlined in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/electrifying-new-york-report.pdf">Department of Transportation&#8217;s EV plan</a>, will be necessary for the city to reach its target of being fully carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>Finally, the New York State House <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/571385-hochul-signs-law-requiring-zero-emission-passenger-vehicles-by-2035?rl=1">signed a bill</a> into law requiring all passenger vehicles sold in-state to be zero-emission by 2035, making it the second state (after California) to introduce a set deadline to phase out internal combustion engine cars. It&#8217;s hard to know whether this is the start of a sea change in state policy or whether NY and California are anomalies, but I can see this type of legislation becoming more popular in the coming years.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Anthony Levandowski</strong>, the controversial and presidentially pardoned autonomous vehicle technology engineer, sat down with The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/in-first-post-pardon-interview-anthony-levandowski-explains-startups-pivot-to-mining">for an interview</a> that included details about his company&#8217;s pivot from big rigs to dump trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> co-founder <strong>Sterling Anderson</strong> laid out the autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/the-aurora-driver-development-program-a-structured">development process</a> in a blog post this week. Aurora collaborated with half a dozen OEMs and has integrated its self-driving system into eight distinct vehicle platforms. Anderson wrote that the outcome &#8220;is a highly refined Driver-vehicle interface and a structured process for the design, development, and launch of vehicles designed for it that we call the Aurora Driver Development Program.&#8221; Side note: Aurora has made its Pittsburgh office its official headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> subsidiary <strong>Mobileye</strong> and rental car giant <strong>Sixt SE</strong> announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/intels-mobileye-rental-giant-sixt-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-germany-next-year/">launch a robotaxi service</a> in Munich next year. As I noted in my article, the robotaxi service will leverage all of Intel&#8217;s, and more specifically Mobileye&#8217;s, assets that have been in development or purchased in recent years, including the $900 million acquisition in 2020 of Moovit, an Israeli startup that analyzes urban traffic patterns and provides transportation recommendations with a focus on public transit.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, riders will be able to access the robotaxi service via the Moovit app. The service will also be offered through Sixt&#8217;s mobility ONE app, which gives customers the ability to hail a ride, rent, share or subscribe to vehicles. Caveat: this won&#8217;t be a large-scale service in the beginning; it will start small and operate similarly to other early rider programs first modeled by nuTonomy and Waymo.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, a Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company, unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/weride-jiangling-motors-and-zto-express-unveil-robovan-an-autonomous-cargo-van/">first cargo van</a>. The company said it will work with Chinese automobile manufacturer Jiangling Motors and Chinese express delivery company ZTO Express to commercialize its first self-driving van at scale. The &#8220;robovans&#8221; will be based on JMC&#8217;s battery electric vehicle model with a fully redundant vehicle platform, combined with WeRide&#8217;s full-stack software and hardware autonomous driving (AD) solutions.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles (and batteries)</h3>
<p><strong>GM </strong>extended a shutdown at its Orion Assembly Plant by another two weeks due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV safety recall. GM said the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-another-two-weeks/">extended downtime</a> at the Orion plant will last through September 20. Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan has been shut down since August 23.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> has hired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/ford-builds-leadership-team-of-commercial-vehicle-unit-ahead-of-e-transit-launch/">six senior-level executives</a> to its newly minted commercial vehicles and services business unit as the automaker prepares to bring to market the E-Transit cargo van and the F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck &#8212; two electric vehicles it&#8217;s betting will become commercial customers&#8217; new workhorses.</p>
<p><strong>Sila Nanotechnologies&#8217;</strong> next-generation battery technology made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sila-nanotechnologiess-first-next-gen-battery-will-launch-in-whoop-wearables/">commercial product debut</a> in the new Whoop fitness tracker, a milestone that caps a decade of research and development by the Silicon Valley startup. This matters because Sila Nano has joint battery ventures with BMW and Daimler to produce batteries containing the company&#8217;s silicon-anode technology, with the goal of going to market in the automotive industry by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Power</strong>, a battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/solid-power-expands-production-capacity-to-deliver-test-batteries-to-bmw-ford-in-2022/">preparing to start pilot production</a> of its solid state batteries early next year. A new production facility will be dedicated to manufacturing a sulfide-based solid electrolyte material and pilot production of its commercial-grade, 100 ampere battery cells. Those pouch cells are expected to go to Ford and BMW for automotive testing in early 2022.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>Squad Mobility</strong> and learn about its vision of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">perfect urban vehicle</a>. Here&#8217;s a hint: it&#8217;s small, cheap, electric and includes solar.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> set the <a href="https://www.nuerburgring.de/news/tesla-faehrt-offiziellen-rekord-fuer-elektrofahrzeuge">official record</a> for electric vehicles at Nürburgring with a Tesla &#8220;Model S Plaid,&#8221; that driven by Andreas Simonsen circumnavigated the 20.8-kilometre. (12.9-mile) Nordschleife loop in 7:35.579, <a href="https://www.nuerburgring.de/news/tesla-faehrt-offiziellen-rekord-fuer-elektrofahrzeuge">according to a statement</a> from the motorsports complex.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota Motor</strong> said it will oppose a proposal by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to give <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-says-it-will-fight-us-house-electric-vehicle-tax-plan-2021-09-11/">union-made electric vehicles</a> in the United States an additional $4,500 tax incentive, Reuters reported. The company said the proposal discriminates &#8220;against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Volta Trucks</strong>, a full-electric commercial vehicle manufacturer, said its first vehicles will be manufactured in Steyr, Austria, by Steyr Automotive, formerly MAN Truck and Bus Austria.</p>
<h3>Delivery and sharing</h3>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong>, <strong>Caviar</strong>, <strong>Grubhub</strong>, <strong>Seamless</strong>,<strong> Postmates</strong> and <strong>Uber Eats</strong> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uber-eats-grubhub-doordash-sue-nyc-for-limiting-fees-the-apps-can-charge-restaurants/">sued the City of New York</a> over a law that would permanently limit the amount of commissions the apps can charge restaurants to use their services. The companies are seeking an injunction that would prevent the city from enforcing the legislation, unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.</p>
<p><strong>Plentywaka</strong> co-founder and CEO Onyeka Akumah was interviewed by TechCrunch as part of its ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/">founders Q&amp;A series</a>.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong> laid out its hydrogen strategy, announcing it will provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/hyundai-motor-group-unveils-its-hydrogen-strategy-plans-to-offer-fuel-cell-versions-of-commercial-cars-by-2028/">hydrogen fuel cell versions</a> for all its commercial vehicles by 2028. Hyundai&#8217;s goal is to achieve cost competitiveness comparable to that of EV batteries by 2030. The company also shared details about its high-performance, rear-wheel drive hydrogen sports car, the Vision FK, with a targeted range of 373 miles. Hyundai did not share when the vehicle would go into production.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> unveiled the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, a full-sized pickup truck that received a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/the-2022-chevrolet-silverado-gets-a-tech-upgrade-hands-free-trailering-and-a-new-zr2-off-road-flagship/"> major technology upgrade</a>, including its hands-free Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system and an infotainment system with embedded Google services, as well as an overhauled interior.</p>
<p><strong>David Zipper</strong> wrote a piece for Slate examining the growing problem of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/09/infotainment-tesla-mercedes-ford-volvo-distraction.html">infotainment systems</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">E-commerce these days is now a major part of every retailer&#8217;s strategy, so technology builders and platforms that are helping them compete better on digital screens are seeing a huge boost in business. In the latest turn, <a href="https://commercetools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercetools</a> &#8212; a provider of e-commerce APIs that larger retailers can use to build customized payment, check-out, social commerce, marketplace and other services &#8212; has closed $140 million in funding, a Series C that CEO Dirk Hoerig has confirmed to me values the company at $1.9 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding is being led by Accel, with previous investors Insight Partners and REWE Group also participating. Munich, Germany-based Commercetools spun out of REWE &#8212; a giant German retailer, and also a customer &#8212; and announced $145 million in investment led by Insight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/commercetools-raises-145m-from-insight-for-shopify-style-e-commerce-apis-for-large-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2019</a>.</span></p>
<p>This latest round represents a huge hike on its valuation since then, when Commercetools was valued at around $300 million.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the big bump, of course, has been the wave of interest in digital transactions from shopping online. E-commerce was already growing at a steady pace before 2020, by some estimates representing more than half of all commerce transactions. The Covid-19 pandemic turbo-charged that proportion, with many retailers switching exclusively to internet sales, and consumers stuck at home happy to shop with a click.</p>
<p>While companies like Shopify have addressed the needs of smaller retailers, providing them with an alternative or complement to listing on third-party marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s, Commercetools has built its business around catering to larger retailers and the many specific, large-scale needs and investment budgets that they may have for building their digital commerce solutions.</p>
<p>It provides some 300 APIs today around some nine &#8220;buckets&#8221; of services, and a wide network of integration partners, Hoerig said, and powers some $10 billion of sales annually for its customers, which include the likes of Audi, AT&amp;T, Danone, Tiffany &amp; Co., John Lewis and <a href="https://commercetools.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many others</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main focus is the retailer with more than $100 million in gross merchandise value,&#8221; Hoerig said. &#8220;This is when it becomes interesting.&#8221; But he added that the force of market growth is such that Commercetools is also seeing a lot of business from smaller companies that are simply needing more functionality to address their fast growth. &#8220;So we also sometimes have customers that start at $5 million in GMV and quickly go to $50 million. With that scale, they also have specific requirements, so the lines get a bit blurry.&#8221; (And that also explains why investors are so interested: there is a lot of evidence of the market growing and growing; and by capturing smaller retailers on big trajectories, that represents a lot more scale for Commercetools.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hoerig is sometimes credited with being the person who first coined the term &#8220;headless commerce&#8221;, which basically means APIs that can be used by a company, or its team of strategists, developers and designers, to build their own customized check-out and other purchasing experiences, rather than fitting these into templates provided by the tech company powering the checkout.</p>
<p>But as the API economy has continued to grow, and the world of non-tech companies that use tech continues to mature, that has taking on a mass-market appeal, and so Commercetools is far from being the only one in this area. In addition to Shopify (which has its own version targeting larger businesses, Shopify Plus), others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chord</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun</a>.</p>
<p>Commercetools will be using the funding both to continue organically expanding its business, but also to make some acquisitions to bolt on new customers, and new technology, tapping into some of the scaling and consolidation that is taking place across e-commerce as a whole. What will be interesting to see is where consolidation will happen, and which startups will be raising money to scale on their own: right now there is a lot of enthusiasm around the space because it is so buoyant, and that will spell more money being funneled to more startups.</p>
<p>Case in point: when I first got wind of this funding round, Commercetools told me it was in the middle of a deal to acquire a company. In the end, that company decided to stay independent and take some more investment to try to grow on its own. Hoerig said it&#8217;s now pursuing another target.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is also the bigger force that has brought Commercetools to where it is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chance to invest in a fast-growing, innovative commerce platform was one we could not pass up,&#8221; said Ping Li, the partner at Accel who led on this deal, said in a statement. “Commercetools provides e-commerce enterprises the technology necessary to capture revenue in the rapidly growing global e-commerce market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">As Chinese tech companies come under regulatory scrutiny at home, concerns and pressures are escalating among investors and domestic tech companies including China’s four big cloud companies, BATH (Baidu AI, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and Huawei Cloud), according to <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-cloud-infrastructure-Q2-2021?ctid=2225-538c1eda5c0b2c22075c0fb990131ff0">an analyst report</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a series of antitrust and internet-related regulation crackdowns, the four leading cloud companies have been growing steadily. As the current scrutiny is not particularly focused on the cloud sector and the demand for digital transformation, artificial intelligence and smart industries remains firm, China’s cloud infrastructure market size mounted to $6.6 billion, which is an increase of 54% compared with the previous year, in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, share prices of three of them&#8211;Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent&#8211; have fallen between 18% and 30% over the last 6 month, which could make investors cautious on betting on the Chinese tech companies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Chinese tech companies could always rely on their local market, especially when access to lucrative Western markets was blocked. But increasing domestic regulatory pressures over the past nine months have been a frustrating headwind for those companies that have seen their cloud businesses grow significantly over the past years,” said Canalys Vice President Alex Smith.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The four big cloud titans dominate the Chinese cloud market, accounting for 80% of total cloud spending. Alibaba Cloud maintained its frontrunner status with a 33.8% market share, in the second quarter of this year. Huawei, which had 19.3% of China’s market size in 2Q21, is the one that has avoided regulatory measures so far.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Huawei is an infrastructure and device company that also happens to have developed a strong cloud business. When it comes to cloud infrastructure, we focus on the BATH companies, not just BAT. Huawei is in a strong position to drive growth, particularly in the public sector where it has a good standing and long-term relationship with the government,” Canalys Chief Analyst Matthew Ball said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Chinese regulators intensify scrutiny of its technology companies, the crackdowns wreak havoc on its own markets and the shares of China-based companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing passed the Data Security Law in June that started to <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/a-close-reading-of-chinas-data-security-law-in-effect-sept-1-2021/">go into effect early September for protecting critical data related to national security</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">issued draft guidelines on regulating the algorithms companies</a>, targeting ByteDance, Alibaba Group, Tencent and DiDi and others, in late August.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments made a huge shift to digital platforms during the Covid-19 pandemic &#8212; purchasing moved online for many consumers and businesses; and a large proportion of those continuing to buy and sell in-person went cash-free. Today a startup that has been focusing on one specific aspect of payments &#8212; recurring billing &#8212; is announcing a round of funding to capitalize on that growth with expansion of its own. <a href="https://billogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billogram</a>, which has built a platform for third parties to build and handle any kind of recurring payments (not one-off purchases), has closed a round of $45 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Partech, and will be used to help the Stockholm-based startup expand from its current base in Sweden to six more markets, Jonas Suijkerbuijk, Billogram&#8217;s CEO and founder, said in an interview, to cover more of Germany (where it&#8217;s already active now), Norway, Finland, Ireland, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>The company got its start working with SMBs in 2011 but pivoted some years later to working with larger enterprises, which make up the majority of its business today. Suijkerbuijk said that in 2020, signed deals went up by 300%, and the first half of 2021 grew 50% more on top of that. Its users include utilities like Skanska Energi and broadband company Ownit, and others like remote healthcare company Kry, businesses that take invoice and take monthly payments from their customers. (There are others that the company is under NDA with that it cannot disclose.)</p>
<p>While there has been a lot of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/08/implications_of_third-party_payment_processing_for_iap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a> around how companies like Apple and Google are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handling subscriptions</a> and payments in apps, what Billogram focuses on is a different beast, and much more complex: it&#8217;s more integrated into the business providing services, and it may involve different services, and the fees can vary over every billing period. It&#8217;s for this reason that, in fact, even big companies in the realm of digital payments, like Stripe, which might even already have products that can help manage subscriptions on their platforms, partner with companies like Billogram to build the experiences to manage their more involved kinds of payment services.</p>
<p>I should point out here that Suijkerbuijk told me that Stripe recently became a partner of Billograms, which is very interesting&#8230; but he also added that a number of the big payments companies have talked to Billogram. He also confirmed that currently Stripe is not an investor in the company. &#8220;We have a very good relationship,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see Stripe and others wanting to more in the area of more complex, recurring billing services. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210910005516/en/Insights-on-the-SubscriptionRecurring-Billing-Management-Global-Market-to-2025---Featuring-ActivePlatform-Amazon-and-FastSpring-Among-Others---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchers estimate</a> that the market size (revenues and services) for subscription and recurring billing will be close to $6 billion this year, with that number ballooning to well over $10 billion by 2025. And indeed, the effort to make a payment or any kind of transaction will continue to be a point of friction in the world of commerce, so any kinds of systems that bring technology to bear to make that easier and something that consumers or businesses will do without thinking about it, will be valuable, and will likely grow in dominance. (It&#8217;s why the more basic subscription services, such as Prime membership or a Netflix subscription, or a cloud storage account, are such winners.)</p>
<p>Within that very big pie, Suijkerbuijk noted that rather than the Apples and Googles of the world, the kinds of businesses that Billogram currently competes against are those that are addressing the same thornier end of the payments spectrum that Billogram is. These include a wide swathe of incumbent companies that do a lot of their business in areas like debt collection, and other specialists like Scaleworks-backed Chargify &#8212; which itself got a big investment injection earlier this year from Battery Ventures, which put <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2021/04/23/battery-ventures-invests-in-chargify.html?page=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million</a> into both it and another billing provider, SaaSOptics, in April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The former group of competitors are not currently a threat to Billogram, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Debt collecting agencies are big on invoicing, but no one &#8212; not their customers, nor their customers&#8217; customers &#8212; loves them, so they are great competitors to have,&#8221; Suijkerbuijk joked.</p>
<p>This also means that Billogram is not likely to move into debt collection itself as it continues to expand. Instead, he said, the focus will be on building out more tools to make the invoicing and payments experience better and less painful to customers. That will likely include more moves into customer service and generally improving the overall billing experience &#8212; something we have seen become a bigger area also during the pandemic, as companies realized that they needed to address non-payments in a different way from how their used to, given world events and the impact they were having on individuals.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Jonas and the team at Billogram.” says Omri Benayoun, General Partner at Partech, in a statement. “Having spotted a gap in the market, they have quietly built the most advanced platform for large B2C enterprises looking to integrate billing, payment, and collection in one single solution. In our discussion with leading utilities, telecom, e-health, and all other clients across Europe, we realized how valuable Billogram was for them in order to engage with their end-users through a top-notch billing and payment experience. The outstanding commercial traction demonstrated by Billogram has further cemented our conviction, and we can’t wait to support the team in bringing their solution to many more customers in Europe and beyond!”</p>

<p class="p3">Health insurance is the kind of thing people usually only think about only when they need it. Otherwise, their policies are just paperwork in their files or cards in their wallet. Indonesian insurtech <a href="https://rey.id/">Rey Assurance</a> is taking a new approach. Once someone becomes a member, they also get access to a platform of health services, including AI-based self-assessment tools, 24/7 telemedicine consultations for no added fee and pharmacy deliveries. The startup is launching out of stealth today, having already raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from the Trans-Pacific Technology Fund (TPTF).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rey was founded this year by Evan Tanotogono, former head of digital channel at Sequis, one of Indonesia largest insurers, and Bobby Siagian, who held lead engineering roles at companies including Tokopedia and Sea Group. They are joined by insurance industry veteran David Nugrho as their chief business officer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">They created Rey to address the low penetration of life and health insurance in Indonesia. “When you look at the root causes and pain points, you are looking at problems that are systemic here,” Tanotogono said. These include low awareness, expensive distribution channels like agents and telemarketing, high premiums and complicated policies.</p>
<p class="p3">“People feel like the product is really complex, the process is difficult and they don’t get the best value for the money. It’s been that way for many, many years,” he told TechCrunch. “We believe that we cannot just go into the market and digitize part of the value chain.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> Plans start from about $4 USD per month and</span> are available for individual or groups, like families, and small businesses. Rey’s wellness ecosystem was created to give customers more value for their money, and help differentiate it from other companies in Indonesia&#8217;s growing insurtech industry. Some other startups that have recently raised funding include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/indonesian-d2c-insurance-marketplace-lifepal-raises-9m-series-a/">Lifepal</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indonesian-insurtech-startup-pasarpolis-gets-54-million-series-b-from-investors-including-leapfrog-and-sbi/">PasarPolis </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/qoala-raises-13-5m-to-grow-its-insurance-platform-in-indonesia/">Qoala</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">“Right now, if you look at insurance in Indonesia, if the premium is high, maybe 80% or 90% of that is used for the distribution channel. Now if we optimize something for digital distribution, then we can reduce the price and use the rest for the wellness features,” Tanotogono added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p3">TPTF managing partner Glenn Kline told TechCrunch that Rey’s founding team was “really the driver” for its investment. “We felt these people really know where the pain points are and they understand clearly how not to try to change the legacy system, but create a whole new platform from the very beginning, where the core value proposition is an integrated solution that is simple and hassle-free.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Instead of doing the underwriting themselves, Rey works with insurance partners to design proprietary policies. The goal is to have an onboarding process that is completely online and only takes about five minutes, and a mostly cashless claim and reimbursement system through Rey’s payment cards. If its payment card can’t be used at healthcare provider, claims can be submitted by uploading receipt photos to the app.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Tanotogono said this is much faster than traditional insurance providers, which can take up to 14 working days to reimburse a claim, and made possible with Rey’s proprietary claim adjudication technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rey’s wellness ecosystem currently covers primary care services, including chats and video calls with medical providers. In the future, it plans to add specialists to the platforms.</p>
<p class="p3">Customers can also link their health wearables for incentives. For example, if they hit certain step or activity goals, they get rewards like discounts or shopping vouchers. Rey’s long-term plan is to link wearables more deeply to its insurance policies, using data to personalize policies and premiums.</p>

<p>The majority of its limited partners are returning from previous funds, and include Temasek Holdings, IFC (which put $25 million in Fund IV), DEG and Asian and global family offices. The firm says this makes Fund IV the largest fund across all early-stage funds in Southeast Asia this year.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Jungle Ventures launched with a $10 million debut fund. Then in 2016, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/jungle-ventures-100-million-fund-southeast-asia/">announced</a> a $100 million second fund, followed in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/jungle-ventures-third-fund-175-million-first-close/">by its $240 million third fund</a>.</p>
<p>Fund IV fits in with Jungle Ventures’ pace of raising a new fund every 2.5 to 3 years, founding partner Amit Anand told TechCrunch. It also happens to come at a time when the region is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/investors-are-doubling-down-on-southeast-asias-digital-economy/">getting more attention—and capital</a>.</p>
<p>“If you look at Southeast Asia, where we are today, the ecosystem has been in the works for a long time. We started the journey back in 2012. We’re one of the oldest funds in the region and we haven’t seen as good a time as today to be in the tech ecosystem in Southeast Asia,” he said.</p>
<p>“Opportunity and talent were always obvious in the region, and I think capital has followed. But the recent exit announcements, whether acquisitions or the domestic and global IPOs, in many ways has completed the picture of Southeast Asia and made it a lot more attractive to everyone,” Anand added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Jungle Ventures takes a concentrated approach and tends to invest in about 12 to 13 companies per fund. It’s relatively stage-agnostic, writing seed to Series B checks and builds long-term partnerships with many of its investments. The firm has invested in every round of several companies, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/"> buy now, pay later startup Kredivo</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kredivo raises $30M to build a digital credit card for Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/embed/#?secret=WPDnNXGd67" data-secret="WPDnNXGd67" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This approach has worked out well, said Anand. Companies from its 2016 Fund II include unicorns FinAccel and Moglix, and it is paying about 7x on the fund today. “A similar pattern is emerging out of the 2019 vintage,” he added, which includes investments like beauty e-commerce platform Sociolla and KiotViet, the largest point-of-sale and store management system for small retailers in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fund IV will write checks ranging from about $1 million, to $15 million for Series B funds, and participate in follow-on rounds, too.</p>
<p>“We typically invest in a company when it has a little bit of a product-market fit in its home market, and then we can help regionalize the business,” Anand said. “This could be at seed, it could be A, it could be at B, it doesn’t matter to us.”</p>
<p>Jungle Ventures’ limited partners also do a significant amount of co-investments; in the last three to four years, LPs have invested close to $400 million in its portfolio startups.</p>
<p>In terms of sectors, Anand is particularly excited about social commerce. “I think social commerce is going to eclipse e-commerce by a huge margin in a market like Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is not just a story about the metro cities, it’s a story about multiple Tier 2, Tier 3 cities across different islands, different geographies. It’s also a geography where the social fabric is deeply engrained within communities.”</p>
<p>Jungle Ventures’ social commerce investments include Evermos, which sells halal and Sharia-compliant goods through agents to their communities.</p>
<p>The firm focuses primarily on Southeast Asia, but it also makes investments in India.</p>
<p>“The cross pollination of talent and ideas, learning and capital between Southeast Asia and India is very strong,” Anand said. “Southeast Asia, even though the ecosystem is growing a lot, the tech talent here in the region is still emerging, whereas India is a great source of tech talent, and we’ve enabled a lot of our portfolio companies to leverage that by opening up tech hubs in India.”</p>
<p>He added that “the focus for Indian investments is to help them expand to Southeast Asia as well and capture this opportunity, too.” One example from Jungle Ventures’ portfolio is interior design platform Livspace, which was founded in India, expanded in Singapore and will enter other Southeast Asia markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Olympus said in a brief statement that it is &#8220;currently investigating a potential cybersecurity incident&#8221; affecting its European, Middle East and Africa computer network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon detection of suspicious activity, we immediately mobilized a specialized response team including forensics experts, and we are currently working with the highest priority to resolve this issue. As part of the investigation, we have suspended data transfers in the affected systems and have informed the relevant external partners,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.olympus-europa.com/company/en/news/press-releases/2021-09-11t03-00-00/investigating-potential-cybersecurity-incident-affecting-limited-areas-of-our-emea-it-system.html?2021-09-11t03-00-00.html">statement said</a>.</p>
<p>But according to a person with knowledge of the incident, Olympus is recovering from a ransomware attack that began in the early morning of September 8. The person shared details of the incident prior to Olympus acknowledging the incident on Saturday.</p>
<p>A ransom note left behind on infected computers claimed to be from the BlackMatter ransomware group. &#8220;Your network is encrypted, and not currently operational,&#8221; it reads. &#8220;If you pay, we will provide you the programs for decryption.&#8221; The ransom note also included a web address to a site accessible only through the Tor Browser that&#8217;s known to be used by BlackMatter to communicate with its victims.</p>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch that the site in the ransom note is associated with the BlackMatter group.</p>
<p>BlackMatter is a ransomware-as-a-service group that was founded as a successor to several ransomware groups, including DarkSide, which recently bounced from the criminal world after the high-profile ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, and REvil, which went silent for months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">after the Kaseya attack</a> flooded hundreds of companies with ransomware. Both attacks caught the attention of the U.S. government, which promised to take action if critical infrastructure was hit again. Only REvil reemerged, but has not yet claimed any further victims.</p>
<p>Groups like BlackMatter rent access to their infrastructure, which affiliates use to launch attacks, while BlackMatter takes a cut of whatever ransoms are paid. Emsisoft has also <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/fwosar/status/1421504819890634754">found technical links</a> and code overlaps between Darkside and BlackMatter.</p>
<p>Since the group emerged in June, Emsisoft has recorded more than 40 ransomware attacks attributed to BlackMatter, but that the total number of victims is likely to be significantly higher.</p>
<p>Ransomware groups like BlackMatter typically steal data from a company&#8217;s network before encrypting it, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">threaten to publish the files online</a> if the ransom to decrypt the files is not paid. Another site associated with BlackMatter, which the group uses to publicize its victims and touts stolen data, did not have an entry for Olympus at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Japan-headquartered Olympus manufactures optical and digital reprography technology for the medical and life sciences industries. Until recently, the company built digital cameras and other electronics until it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/olympus-plans-to-sell-its-struggling-camera-division/">sold its struggling camera division</a> in January.</p>
<p>Olympus said it was &#8220;currently working to determine the extent of the issue and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christian Pott, a spokesperson for Olympus, said that customer service was not affected, but declined to comment further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If Gutenberg were alive today, he’d be a very busy angel investor.</p>
<p>With book sales booming during the COVID-19 lockdowns last year, the humble written word has suddenly drawn the limelight from VCs and founders. We’ve seen a whole cavalcade of new products and fundings, including algorithmic recommendation engine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/can-ai-help-you-binge-books-bingebooks-is-a-new-service-to-do-exactly-that/">BingeBooks</a>, book club startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/literati-raises-40m-for-its-book-club-platform/">Literati</a> and the aptly named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/bookclub-checks-out-a-shiny-new-20-million-series-a/">BookClub</a>, as well as streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/litnerd-streams-live-actors-into-the-classroom-to-help-kids-better-connect-with-reading/">Litnerd</a>. There have also been exits and potential exits for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/medium-acquires-social-book-reading-app-glose/">Glose</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/course-hero-acquires-litcharts-founded-by-the-creators-of-sparknotes/">LitCharts</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/">Epic</a>.</p>
<p>But the one company that has captured the imagination of a lot of readers has been <a href="https://bookshop.org">Bookshop.org</a>, which has become the go-to platform for independent local bookstores to build an online storefront and compete with Amazon’s juggernaut. The company, which debuted just as the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading in January 2020, rapidly garnered headlines and profiles of its founder Andy Hunter, an industrious publisher with a deep love for the reading ecosystem.</p>
<p>After a year and a half, how is it all holding up? The good news for the company is that even as customers are returning to retail including bookstores, Bookshop hasn’t seen a downturn. Hunter said that August sales this year were 10% higher than July’s, and that the company is on track to do about as many sales in 2021 as in 2020. He contextualized those figures by pointing out that in May, bookstore sales increased 130% year over year. “That means our sales are additive,” he said.</p>
<p>Bookshop now hosts 1,100 stores on its platform, and it has more than 30,000 affiliates who curate book recommendations. Those lists have become central to Bookshop’s offering. “You get all these recommendation lists from not just bookstores, but also literary magazines, literary organizations, book lovers, and librarians,” Hunter said.</p>
<p>Bookshop, which is a public-benefit corporation, earns money as all ecommerce businesses do, by moving inventory. But what differentiates it is that it’s fairly liberal in paying money to affiliates and to bookstores who join its Platform Seller program. Affiliates are paid 10% for a sale, while bookstores themselves take 30% of the cover price of sales they generate through the platform. In addition, 10% of affiliate and direct sales on Bookshop are placed in a profit-sharing pool which is then shared with member bookstores. According to its website, Bookshop has disbursed $15.8 million to bookstores since launch.</p>
<p>The company has had a lot of developments in its first year and a half of business, but what happens next? For Hunter, the key is to build a product that continues to engage both customers and bookstores in as simple a manner as possible. “Keep the Occam’s razor,” he says of his product philosophy. For every feature, “it’s going to add to the experience and not confuse a customer.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s easier said than done, of course. “For me, the challenge now is to create a platform that is extremely compelling to customers, that does everything that booksellers want us to do, and to create the best online book buying and book selling experience,” Hunter said. What that often means in practice is keeping the product feeling “human” (like shopping in a bookstore) while also helping booksellers maximize their advantages online.</p>

<p>For instance, Hunter said the company has been working hard with bookstores to optimize their recommendation lists for search engine discovery. SEO isn’t exactly a skill you learn in the traditional retail industry, but it’s crucial online to stay competitive. “We now have stores that rank number one in Google for book recommendations from their book lists,” he said. “Whereas two years ago, all those links would have been Amazon links.” He noted that the company is also layering in best practices around email marketing, customer communications, and optimizing conversion rates onto its platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200892" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200892" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg 2158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=1536,985 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=2048,1313 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bookshop.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200892" class="wp-caption-text">Bookshop.org offers tens of thousands of lists, which provide a more &#8220;human&#8221; approach to finding books than algorithmic recommendations.</p></div></p>
<p>For customers, a huge emphasis for Bookshop going forward is eschewing the algorithmic recommendation model popular among top Silicon Valley companies in lieu of a far more human-curated experience. With tens of thousands of affiliates, “it does feel like a buzzing hive of … institutions and retailers who make up the diverse ecosystem around books,” Hunter said. “They all have their own personalities [and we want to] let those personalities show through.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot to do, but that doesn’t mean dark clouds aren’t menacing on the horizon.</p>
<p>Amazon, of course, is the biggest challenge for the company. Hunter noted that the company’s Kindle devices are extremely popular, and that gives the ecommerce giant an even stronger lock-in that it can’t attain with physical sales. “Because of DRM and publisher agreements, it’s really hard to sell an ebook and allow someone to read it on Kindle,” he said, likening the nexus to Microsoft bundling Internet Explorer on Windows. “There is going to have to be a court case.” It’s true that people love their Kindles, but even “if you love Amazon… then you have to acknowledge that it is not healthy.”</p>
<p>I asked about whether he was worried about the number of startups getting funded in the books space, and whether that funding could potentially crowd out Bookshop. “The book club startups — they are going to succeed by putting books — and conversations about books — in front of the largest audience,” Hunter believes. “So that is going to make everyone succeed.” He is concerned though with the focus on “disruption” and says that “I do hope they succeed in a way that partners with independent bookstores and members of the community that exist.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Hunter’s strategic concern isn’t directed to competitors or even the question of whether the book is dead (it’s not), but a more specific challenge: that today’s publishing ecosystem ensures that only the top handful of books succeed. Often dubbed “the midlist</p>
<p>problem,” Hunter is worried about the increasingly blockbuster nature of books these days. “One book will suck up most of the oxygen and most of the conversation or the top 20 books [while] great innovative works from young authors or diverse voices don’t get the attention they deserve,” he said. Bookshop is hoping that human curation through its lists can help to sustain a more vibrant book ecosystem than recommendation algorithms, which constantly push readers to the biggest winners.</p>
<p>As Bookshop heads into its third year of operations, Hunter just wants to keep the focus on humans and bringing the rich experience of browsing in a store to the online world. Ultimately, it’s about intentionality. “I really want people to understand that we are creating the future we live in with all of these small decisions about where we shop and how we shop and we should remain very conscious about how we deliberate about those,” he said. “I want Bookshop to be fun to shop at and not just a place to do your civil duty.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We live during a time of live, real-time culture. Telecasts, spontaneous tweetstorms, on-the-scene streams, rapid-response analysis, war rooms, Clubhouses, vlogging. We have to interact with the here and now, feel that frisson of action. It’s a compulsion: we’re enraptured by the dangers that are terrorizing whole segments of the planet.</p>
<p>Just this past month, we saw Hurricane Ida strike New Orleans and the Eastern Seaboard, with some of the fiercest winds in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Katrina. In Kabul, daily videos and streams show up-to-the-minute horrors of a country in the throes of chaos. Dangers are omnipresent. Intersect these pulses to the amygdala with the penchant for live coverage, and the alchemy is our modern media.</p>
<p>Yet, watching live events is not living, and it cannot substitute for introspection of both our own condition and the health of the world around us. The dangers that sprawl across today’s headlines and chyrons are often not the dangers we should be spending our time thinking about. That divergence between real-time risks and <i>real</i> risks has gotten wider over time — and arguably humanity has never been closer to the precipice of true disaster even as we are subsumed by disasters that will barely last a screen scroll on our phones.</p>
<p>Toby Ord, in his prophetic book <a href="https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/toby-ord/the-precipice/9780316484893/">The Precipice</a>, argues that we aren’t seeing the existential risks that can realistically extinguish human life and flourishing. So he has delivered a rigorous guide and compass to help irrational humans understand what risks truly matter — and which we need to accept and move on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2199347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Precipice.jpg?w=450" alt="" width="450" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Precipice.jpg 450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Precipice.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Precipice.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Precipice.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Ord’s canvas is cosmic, dating from the birth of the universe to tens of billions of years into the future. Humanity is but the smallest blip in the universal timeline, and the extreme wealth and advancement of our civilization dates to only a few decades of contemporary life. Yet, what progress we have made so quickly, and what progress we are on course to continue in the millennia ahead!</p>
<p>All that potential could be destroyed though if certain risks today aren’t considered and ameliorated. The same human progress that has delivered so much beauty and improvement has also democratized tools for immense destruction, including destructiveness that could eliminate humanity or “merely” lead to civilizational collapse. Among Ord’s top concerns are climate change, nuclear winter, designer pandemics, artificial general intelligence and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are plenty of books on existential risks. What makes The Precipice unique is its forging in the ardent rationality of the effective altruism movement, of which Ord is one of its many leaders. This is not a superlative dystopic analysis of everything that can go wrong in the coming centuries, but rather a coldly calculated comparison of risks and where society should invest its finite resources. Asteroids are horrific but at this point, well-studied and deeply unlikely. Generalized AI is much more open to terrifying outcomes, particularly when we extend our analysis into the decades and centuries.</p>
<p>While the book walks through various types of risks from natural to anthropogenic to future hypothetical ones, Ord’s main goal is to get humanity to take a step back and consider how we can incorporate the lives of billions — maybe even trillions — of future beings into our calculations on risk. The decisions we make today don’t just affect ourselves or our children, but potentially thousands of generations of our descendants as well, not to mention the other beings that call Earth home. In short, he’s asking the reader for a bold leap to see the world in geological and astronomical time, rather than in real-time.</p>
<p>It’s a mission that’s stunning, audacious, delirious and enervating at times, and occasionally all at the same time. Ord knows that objections will come from nearly every corner, and half the book’s heft is made up of appendices and footnotes to deflect arrows from critics while further deepening the understanding of the curious reader or specialist. If you allow yourself to be submerged in the philosophy and the rigorous mental architecture required to think through long-termism and existential risks, The Precipice really can lead to an awakening of just how precarious most of our lives are, and just how interwoven to the past and future we are.</p>
<p>Humanity is on The Precipice, but so are individuals. Each of us is on the edge of understanding, but can we make the leap? And should we?</p>
<p>Here the rigor and tenacity of the argument proves a bit more elusive. There isn’t much of a transition available from our live, reality-based daily philosophy to one predicated on seeing existential risks in all the work that we do. You either observe the existential risks and attempt to mitigate them, or you don’t (or worse, you see them and give up on protecting humanity’s fate). As Ord points out, that doesn’t always mean sacrifice — some technologies can lower our existential risk, which means that we should accelerate their development as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Yet, in a complicated world filled with the daily crises and trauma of people whose pained visages are etched into our smartphone displays, it’s challenging to set aside that emotional input for the deductive and reductive frameworks presented here. In this, the criticism isn’t so much on the book as on the wider field of effective altruism, which attempts to rationalize assistance even as it effaces often the single greatest compulsion for humans to help one another: the emotional connection they feel to another being. The Precipice delivers a logical ethical framework for the already converted, but only offers modest guidance to persuade anyone outside the tribe to join in its momentum.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, because the book’s message is indeed prophetic. Published on March 24, 2020, it discusses pandemics, gain-of-function research, and the risks of modern virology — issues that have migrated from obscure academic journals to the front pages. There really are existential risks, and we really do need to confront them.</p>
<p>As the last year has shown, however, even well-known and dangerous risks like pandemics are difficult for governments to build up capacity to handle. Few humans can spend their entire lives moored to phenomenon that happen once in 100,000 years, and few safety cultures can remain robust to the slow degradation of vigilance that accompanies any defense that never gets used.</p>
<p>The Precipice provides an important and deeply thought-provoking framework for thinking about the risks to our future. Yet, it’s lack of engagement with the social means that it will have little influence on how to slake our obsession for the risks right before us. Long-termism is hard, and TikTok is always a tap away.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sesiebonsi/">Sesie Bonsi</a> is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.bleuco.com/">Bleu</a>, a financial technology platform focused on enabling touchless payment experiences.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Funding for Black entrepreneurs in the U.S. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/">hit nearly $1.8 billion</a> in the first half of 2021 — a fourfold increase from the previous year. But most venture-backed startups are “still overwhelmingly white, male, Ivy-League-educated and based in Silicon Valley,” according to a <a href="https://ratemyinvestor.com/diversity_report">study</a> conducted by RateMyInvestor and Diversity VC.</p>
<p>With venture investors committing to funding Black and minority founders, alongside the growing availability of government-backed proposals, such as New Jersey allocating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/new-jersey-announces-10m-seed-fund-aimed-at-black-and-latinx-founders/">$10 million to a seed fund for Black and Latinx startups</a>, can we expect to see fundamental change? Or will we have to repeat the same conversations about representation failings within VC funds?</p>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/">Crunchbase examined</a> the access to capital in the venture-backed startup ecosystem and proved that many industry leaders still worry that nothing will drastically shift. As a Black fintech founder, I believe that venture investors are making safe bets and investing in late-stage founders instead of early or even pre-seed stages.</p>
<p>But what about those minority founders who don’t have family, friends or connections to lean on for the first $250,000? Venture funding does <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/black-founders-venture-funding-remains-elusive-despite-new-funds-2021-02-22/">remain elusive</a>, but here are some tricks for startup founders to hack the system.</p>
<h2>Realize you are up against an outdated system</h2>
<p>Getting your foot in the door with new venture capitalist partners is challenging, and it is often easy for minority founders to be naive at first. I thought that reading TechCrunch and analyzing other VC deals I saw in the news would help me land multiple responses and speak the language of those who managed to score million-dollar deals for their startups. However, I didn’t receive a single response while other founders received VC investment for basic ideas.</p>
<p>This is something I had to learn the hard way: What you hear in the media or read on a company blog post often simplifies the process, and sometimes fails to cover the trajectory that minority founders, in particular, must follow to secure funding.</p>
<p>I experienced hundreds of rejections before raising $2 million to start a mobile payment platform, Bleu, using beacon technology to drive simple and secure payments. It is a huge mountain to climb and a full-time job to continuously pitch your vision and <em>yourself</em> to reach the first meeting with a VC fund &#8212; and that’s still miles away from a funding discussion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These discussions then bring further biases to the surface. If you sat in the conference rooms or on those Zoom calls and heard the types of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/what-to-watch-for-in-a-vc-term-sheet/">deals proposed</a> to minority founders, you’d see how offensive they can be. Often, these founders are offered all the money they have requested — but don’t be fooled. It is usually not given all at once due to what I consider to be a lack of trust. Essentially, interval funding equates to being babysat.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a minority founder, you have to realize that it will be a long ride, and you will face rejections because you are at a disadvantage before even opening your mouth to pitch your idea. It is all possible, but patience is key.</p>
<h2>Think of the worst-case scenario</h2>
<p>Once I figured out how complicated the funding process was, my coping mechanism was to figure out how to capitalize on the business ideas I already had in place in case I never received any VC funding.</p>
<p>Think: How could you make money without an institutional investor, friends, family or internal networks? You’ll be surprised by your entrepreneurial thirst for success when you’ve <a href="https://chrishood.com/5-ways-embracing-failure-will-drive-innovation/">experienced 100 rejections</a>. This is why minority businesses caught in these testing situations can quickly gain the upper hand, whether through ancillary and side businesses or crowdfunding over GoFundMe and Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Although generally considered non-essential, ancillary companies do provide a regular flow of income and services to assist your core business idea. Most importantly, a recurring revenue stream outside your core business demonstrates to investors that you can create valuable products and acquire loyal customers.</p>
<p>Make sure to find a niche market and carry out surveys with potential clients to find out what specific needs they have. Then, build a product with their feedback in mind and launch it to beta clients. When you publicly release the product, find resellers to keep internal headcount low and generate recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Don’t take ancillaries lightly, though; they are not <em>just </em>a side business. There can be payment issues if you get hooked on them for revenue, distractions from clients or partners wanting custom requests, and supply chain problems.</p>
<p>In my case, I built a point-of-sale (POS) software platform to sell to merchants, which gave me a different revenue stream that could integrate with Bleu’s payment technology. These ancillary businesses can help fund your core business until you manage to plan how to launch fully or source further funding.</p>
<p>In 2019, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/start-ups-rejecting-venture-capital.html">published an article</a> headlined “More Start-Ups Have an Unfamiliar Message for Venture Capitalists: Get Lost.” It highlights how more and more entrepreneurs shunned by the VC funding route are turning to alternatives and forming counter-movements. There are always alternatives to look at if the fundraising process is proving to be too arduous.</p>
<h2>Make serious headway with accelerators</h2>
<p>Accelerators allow ventures to define their products or services, quickly build networks and, most importantly, sit at tables they wouldn’t be able to on their own. Applying to accelerators as a minority founder was the real turning point for me because I met a crucial investor who allowed us to build credibility and open up to new networks, investors and clients.</p>
<p>I would suggest looking out for accelerators explicitly searching for minority founders by using platforms such as <a href="https://www.f6s.com/">F6S</a>. They match you with accelerators and early growth programs committed to innovation in various global industries, like financial technology. That’s how I found the <a href="https://www.f6s.com/vcfintech1">VC FinTech Accelerator</a> in 2016, where one-third of founders were from minority backgrounds.</p>
<p>Then, Bleu <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/melissa-sassi1/2019/09/30/class-of-2020-ibm-hyper-protect-accelerator-powere?CommunityKey=53d759c6-31ad-4ebd-b518-0696ea821f14&amp;tab=">earned</a> a spot in the 2020 class of the IBM Hyper Protect Accelerator dedicated to supporting innovative startups in fintech and health tech industries. These types of accelerators offer startups workshops, technical and business mentorship, and access to a network of partners, customers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>You can impress accelerators by creating a pitch deck and a company video less than two minutes long that shows your founder and the product, and engaging with the fintech community to spread the news.</p>
<p>The other alternative to accelerators is government funds, but they have had little success investing in startups for myriad reasons. It tends to be a more hands-off approach as government funds are not under significant pressure from limited partners (LPs, either institutional or individual investors) to perform.</p>
<p>What you need as a minority founder is an investor who is an active partner but, with government-backed funds, there is less demand to return the capital. We have to ask ourselves whether governments are really searching for the best minority-owned startups to help them get sufficient returns.</p>
<h2>Tap into foreign markets</h2>
<p>There are many unconscious social stigmas, stereotypes and unseen biases that exist in the U.S. And you’ll find those cultural dynamics are radically different in other countries that don’t have the same history of discrimination, especially when looking at a team or assessing founders.</p>
<p>I also noticed that, as well as reduced bias, investors out of Southeast Asia, Nordic countries and Australia seemed far more likely to take risks on new contactless payment technology as cash use decreased across their regions. Take Klarna and Afterpay as examples of fintech success stories.</p>
<p>First, I engaged in market research and pored over annual reports to decide whether I should look abroad for funding, instead of applying to funds closer to home. I looked at Nielsen reports, payment publications, PaymentSource and numerous government documents or white papers to figure out the cash usage globally.</p>
<p>My investigations revealed that fintech in Australia was far ahead of the curve, with <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/snapshots/how-australians-pay-snapshot/">four-fifths of the population</a> using contactless payments. The financial services sector is also the largest contributor to the national economy, contributing around <a href="https://www.orbium.com/orbium-insights/the-impact-of-the-banking-royal-commission-on-australian-banks/">$140 billion to GDP</a> a year. Therefore, I spoke to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the U.S., and they recommended some regulatory payment groups.</p>
<p>I immediately flew to Australia to meet with the banking community, and I was able to find an Australian investor by word of mouth who was surrounded by the demand for mobile payment solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast, an investor in the U.S. still using cash and card had no interest in what I had to say. This highlights the importance of market research and seeking out investors rather than waiting for them to come to you. There is no science to it; leverage your network and reach out to people over LinkedIn, too.</p>
<h2>The need to diversify the VC industry internally</h2>
<p>VC funding needs to become more inclusive for women and minority groups by tackling the pipeline problem and addressing the level of diversity within VC funds. All of the networks that VCs reach out to first tend to come from university programs at Stanford, MIT and Harvard. These more privileged and wealthy students are able to easily leverage the traditional and outdated networks built to benefit them.</p>
<p>The number of venture dollars flowing to Black and Latinx founders is dismally low partly due to this knowledge gap; many female and minority founders don’t even know that VC funding is an option for them. Therefore, if you do receive seed funding, spread the news about it within your networks to help others.</p>
<p>Inclusion starts at the educational level but, when the percentage of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-harsh-truth-about-black-enrollment-at-americas-elite-colleges-2020-06-25">Black and minority students at these elite colleges are still low</a>, you can see why minority representation is needed in the VC ranks. Even if representation rises by a percent, that would be a significant change.</p>
<p>There are increasing numbers of VC funds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">announcing initiatives</a> and interest in investing in minority businesses, and I would recommend looking at these in-depth. But what about the demographics of the VC firms? How many ethnicities are present in the executive ranks?</p>
<p>To change the venture-backed startup ecosystem, we need to start at the top and diversify those signing the checks. Looking toward the future, it is Black-led funds, like Sequoia, or others that focus on diversity, like Women’s Venture Fund, BackStage Capital and Elevate Capital Inclusive Fund, that are lighting the way to solutions that will reflect the diversity of the U.S.</p>
<p>It’s up to the investor community at large to be intentional about building relationships with, and ultimately providing funding to, more women and minority-led startups.</p>
<p>Despite the barriers and hurdles minority founders face when searching for VC funding, more and more avenues for acquiring funding are appearing as the disparities are brought to the media&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>As the outdated system adjusts, the key is to continue preparing yourself for rejections and searching for appropriate accelerators to build vital networks. Then, if you aren’t having any luck, consider what you could do with your business idea without the VC funding or turn to foreign markets, which may have a different setup and varied opportunities.</p>

<p>The idea was that a well-networked, smart individual may be able to raise their first $10 million in a debut fund off of connections, but when it comes time to scale to a $50 million or $200 million fund, managers need to have a sophisticated understanding of how the LP world works.</p>
<p>Now, Mead claims that all 18 graduates within his first cohort, which include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/peter-boyce-stellation-capital/">Stellation capital,</a> Maple VC, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josephsartre_interlace-ventures-raises-14m-for-its-debut-activity-6810170557997428736-tgrU/">Interlace Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/19130-planting-seeds-for-a-modern-food-system">Supply Change Capital</a>, have successfully closed funds. Its second cohort is still in the fundraising process, but across both cohorts, over $500 million has been closed. Oper8r is launching its third cohort next week and soon will announce the launch of Cr8r, an early-stage program to help talented angel investors grow their investment cadence.</p>
<p>Oper8r’s expansion comes as the rate of first-time venture fundraising grows as well. The Wall Street Journal’s Yuliya Chernova wrote a story this week about how, after years of being on the decline, the rate of first-time venture fundraising in the United States is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-comeback-of-the-first-time-venture-fund-stay-tuned-11631012400">“on track to reverse course.&#8221;</a> The story, pulling analysis from advisory firm Different Funds, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-comeback-of-the-first-time-venture-fund-stay-tuned-11631012400">states</a> that “in the second quarter of this year, some 40% of venture-fund announcements, which includes funds just setting out to raise capital, were made by debut funds, whereas they represented between roughly 20% and 30% of fund announcements in each quarter over the past two years.”</p>
<p>This data screams that the rise of a solo GP, or an ambitious rolling-fund-turned-venture firm, isn’t a one-off, it’s an actual trend. This means there’s more pressure for venture firms to go beyond a scout program when it comes to supporting the next big investors — and there’s more of a market for formal efforts to scale operations.</p>
<p>Mead, meanwhile, is cooking up ways to add validation and signal to Oper8r. Many accelerators write checks to further validate their choices, but also to tap into the access they’re getting by helping budding entrepreneurs before top-tier LPs and VCs notice them. He hinted that Oper8r may pursue a similar strategy as it seeks to be the go-to for emerging managers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think capital speaks louder than educational programs,” he said. “If you’re putting money into the opportunities you’re engaged with, I think it serves as a greater signal than someone just coming through the program.”</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll discuss the creator economy’s latest dance, international BNPL week, and why I’m putting Reid Hoffman in the hot seat.

<h2>Edtech wants to have its creator economy moment, and it’s complicated</h2>

<p>Edtech and the creator economy certainly differ in the problems they try to solve: Finding a VR solution to make online STEM classes more realistic is a different nut to crack than streamlining all of a creator’s different monetization strategies into one platform. Still, the two sectors have found common ground in the past year — as encapsulated by the rise of cohort-based class platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> I wrote about how the overlap of both sectors is leading to some complications during the rise of cohort-based classes. Some fear that turning creators into educators could bring in a rush of unqualified teachers with no understanding of true pedagogy, while others think that the true democratization of education requires a disruption of who is considered a teacher.</p>

<p>This week on Equity, Mary Ann and I made sense of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/buy-now-pay-later-boom-bnpl/">what felt like international BNPL week</a>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">PayPal acquired Japan’s Paidy for $2.7</a> billion,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"> Zip bought Africa’s Payflex</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/">Addi raised $75 million to prove BNPL’s power</a> in LatAm.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The global boom is partly in response to e-commerce trends, partly in response to consumer demand for more flexibility when it comes to financing. The market isn’t a winner-takes-all, so expect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/buy-now-pay-later-boom-bnpl/">more well-capitalized startups buying their way into consumer markets</a> outside of their geography.</p>

<h2>Reid Hoffman on the hot seat</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2199683" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199683" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2199683" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg" alt="Reid Hoffman" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg 2863w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-838037008.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2199683" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kelly Sullivan/Getty Images for LinkedIn</p></div></p>
<p>I read Reid Hoffman’s podcast-turned-new-book “Masters of Scale” over the past few days. The entire time, I felt like a well-networked mentor was giving me a pep talk, with name-drops that turned into generalist advice and a behind-the-scenes look at humanity&#8217;s decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While the book gave me a needed boost of optimism, I still had some critiques. I felt like the book’s choice to not talk much about the ugly within startupland creates an imbalance of sorts. It would have benefitted from talking directly about divisive dynamics, ranging from how WeWork’s Adam Neumann impacted the way we talk about visionary founders, Brian Armstrong’s Coinbase memo and what it means for startup culture, or even the role of the tech press today.</p>
<p>So, I have an idea. Let’s balance out the cheerfulness with the cynical, and let’s do it live. I’m interviewing Hoffman at TechCrunch Disrupt this year, where I’ll put him on the hot seat and push him to explain some of the choices he made in the book. Other people I’m excited to see at the show include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/pelotons-ceo-and-chief-content-officer-are-coming-to-disrupt/">Peloton’s CEO and chief content officer</a> and Ryan Reynolds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>At the start of the day on Friday, it seemed like the week&#8217;s big App Store news would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-asks-apple-to-reinstate-fortnite-in-south-korea-after-new-law/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Epic Games&#8217; attempt to get back into the App Store</a> in South Korea, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">the passage of a law</a> that forced Apple and Google to permit apps to use third-party payment systems. But Friday turned out to have much bigger news in store.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That morning, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/"> issued a ruling in California’s Epic Games v. Apple antitrust case</a>, where the Fortnite maker had alleged Apple was abusing its market power by forcing developers to use its own in-app payment systems. The judge&#8217;s decision favored Apple on the larger matter of whether or not it was acting in a monopolistic fashion. The judge said both parties had defined Apple&#8217;s relevant market incorrectly &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t just the App Store or gaming, but specifically, the $100 billion market for digital mobile gaming transactions. And while Apple had a lot of financial success here, with a 55%+ market share and high profit margins, that success was &#8220;not illegal&#8221; under either federal or state antitrust law.</p>
<p>This decision also means Epic Games was in breach of its contract when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">implemented</a> its own payments system in its Fortnite iOS app (it now owes Apple $12 million for that), and Apple won&#8217;t be forced to host third-party app stores or allow apps to be sideloaded on its mobile devices. For Apple, this is a huge win.</p>
<p>However, the judge did find that Apple was engaging in anticompetitive behavior under California&#8217;s competition laws with regard to its anti-steering provisions, which Rogers said &#8220;illegally stifle consumer choice.&#8221; As a result, Apple may no longer prohibit developers from including links, buttons, or other calls to action in their apps that direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms besides Apple&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>This is a huge win for Apple&#8217;s developer community, many of whom have long since fought for the right to send customers over to their own websites to make purchases or subscribe, so they could save on fees by avoiding Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase commissions. As developer pushback has increased over the years, Apple tried to placate its community <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">by reducing commissions from 30% to 15%</a> for developers with under $1 million in revenues. But it had still blocked developers from telling consumers they could go elsewhere to make a payment from inside their apps.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, this particular guideline was starting to fall apart, as Apple made concessions related to other lawsuits and legislation,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"> including a settlement with a Japanese regulator</a> that saw the tech giant change its policies for “reader apps”– apps that provide access to purchased content — that would allow them to point users to their own website where users could sign up and manage their accounts.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/"> Another settlement gave developers permission</a> to use customer contact information collected inside their app to tell customers about other payment options. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">South Korea&#8217;s new law forced</a> Apple and Google to allow developers to use their own third-party payment systems if they chose.</p>
<p>The larger ramifications of how this policy change will play out remain to be seen. Apple will likely still require its in-app purchase mechanism to remain in place as an option, and it may enact new rules around how and where developers can add their links or other calls to action that direct customers to alternative purchasing mechanisms. The injunction&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting/status/1436397290680426498"> wording is vague enough</a> that we&#8217;ll also likely see some attempts to place payment buttons that load up alt purchasing screens inside the app, which may not agree with how Apple interprets the ruling. It&#8217;s most likely that Apple will simply allow any developer to steer users outside the app, as it does now for the &#8220;reader&#8221; apps &#8212; a system that still makes Apple&#8217;s own IAPs feel more seamless and consumer-friendly by comparison.</p>
<p>Then there is the matter of developer adoption. For smaller developers, it may not make sense to try to support two separate payment mechanisms if Apple&#8217;s is still required. And some may be concerned about other, less obvious potential punitive measures for avoiding IAPs &#8212; like reduced visibility in App Store searches, perhaps, or fewer App Store Editorial highlights.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, things could also become more difficult. Apple&#8217;s holes in App Review have allowed too many scam apps to thrive. If these apps now also start to route around IAPs, it could finally motivate Apple to expand its review team to crack down on apps that abuse subscriptions &#8212; particularly if there will be no easy way to toggle those external subscriptions off, as there is now for Apple&#8217;s IAPs. And while ultimately that&#8217;s an issue between the customer and developer, Apple could take the fall for hosting the scam apps in the first place &#8212; especially when a scam app developer becomes unreachable and the subscription keeps renewing.</p>
<p>There were a few other notable bits tucked inside the ruling, which paint a picture of an App Store where almost all the revenue is delivered by games and their &#8220;whales&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaming apps account for approximately 70% of all App Store revenues and is generated by less than 10% of App Store consumers.</li>
<li>Over 80% of consumer accounts generate virtually no revenue, as 80% of all apps on the App Store are free.</li>
<li>Apple enjoys a market share of over 55% in the market of digital mobile gaming transactions.</li>
<li>Over 98% of Apple&#8217;s IAP revenue came from games in 2018 to 2019.</li>
<li>Game transactions overall accounted for 76% of App Store revenue in 2017, 62.9% in 2018, and 68% in 2020.</li>

Now, for $0.18 per print (plus shipping), you can choose between the existing 4&#215;6, 5&#215;7, or 8&#215;10 prints, or four additional sizes: 11&#215;14, 12&#215;18, 16&#215;20, and 20&#215;30 prints. New canvas prints will be added in sizes 8&#215;10, 16&#215;16, 20&#215;30, 24&#215;36, 30&#215;40, and 36&#215;36.</li>

<h3>Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WhatsApp says users will now be able to encrypt their chat backups in the cloud</strong>. While the Facebook-owned app has allowed end-to-end encrypted chats for more than a decade, there was not yet an option to securely store their chat backup to the cloud, meaning iCloud on iOS or Google Drive on Android. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/whatsapp-encrypt-cloud-backup/">has now created a system</a> that will allow users to lock their backups with a 64-digit encryption key, which can be stored offline or in a password manager. Or they can create a password that backs up the key into a cloud-based &#8220;backup key vault&#8221; that WhatsApp has built.</li>

When a report is submitted, the playlist in question will have its metadata immediately removed, including its title, description, and custom image. There is no internal review process that verifies the report is legitimate before the metadata is removed, which has allowed bad actors (and sometimes their bots) to constantly report playlists that are gaining bigger followings than their own.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/apple-music-is-using-shazam-to-solve-the-streaming-industrys-problem-with-dj-mixes/">will now use Shazam</a> to address attribution and royalties issues around DJ mixes.</strong> Apple Music is working with major and independent labels to devise a fair way to divide streaming royalties among DJs, labels, and artists who appear in the mixes, it said.</li>

<p><a href="https://tape.it/">Tape It</a> launches an AI-powered music recording app designed to be a better alternative to using Apple&#8217;s built-in Voice Memos app for quick recordings. The app offers a variety of features, including higher-quality sound, automatic instrument detection, support for markers, notes and images, and more, and will later expand to include collaboration features. It also breaks longer recordings onto multiple lines, more like wrapped text, which it believes is easier to work with than one long, horizontal scroll. But the standout feature is its support for &#8220;Stereo HD&#8221; quality, which leverages two microphones on newer iPhone models to improve the recording&#8217;s sound quality. This feature is a $20 per year subscription, but the app is a free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tape-it-songwriting/id1576341885">download</a> on iOS.

<p>The Marvel Unlimited comics subscription app has been overhauled with the latest release. The updated version introduces 27 Infinity Comics, which are high-res vertical comics for phones and tablets. At launch, these include series like X-Men Unlimited, Captain America, Black Widow, Deadpool, Shang-Chi, and Venom/Carnage. By year-end, there will be 100 of these available. The app provides access to over 29,000 comics. The updated version of the app was rebuilt by DMED Technology, which worked closely with Marvel, to deliver a combination of new features and technology, which include enhanced curation, search, personalization, speed, and performance, as well as support for offline reading. DMED is the team within Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution that builds, manages, and maintains Disney&#8217;s apps and sites that reach 380 million users globally each month, including Marvel, ESPN, ABC News, ABC, Disney Now, Disney.com, National Geographic, FX, and more.

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Hello everyone – Anna here, covering for Alex who&#8217;s enjoying some well-deserved but soon-ending vacation time. The Exchange also went on pause for the week, but the news didn&#8217;t stop, so strap on!</em></p>
<p>The buy now, pay later space has been one of the hottest fintech verticals since at least last August, when Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">announced that it would spend a mind-blowing $29 billion</a> to acquire Australian company Afterpay. But things really caught fire this week, with newsworthy BNPL-related announcements all around. Let&#8217;s take a closer look:</p>
<p>While the biggest news was undoubtedly PayPal&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">acquire Japan&#8217;s Paidy for $2.7 billion</a>, Amazon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/business/amazon-affirm.html">closing a deal with Max Levchin&#8217;s Affirm</a> was also a major move. What clearer sign that BNPL is going mainstream than the ability for U.S.-based Amazon shoppers to defer payments on purchases of $50 or more?</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just about a handful of players in the world&#8217;s leading e-commerce markets: BNPL startups all over the world have been growing, as reflected in recent rounds. For instance, Europe-focused Scalapay raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/scalapay-raises-155m-at-a-700m-valuation-as-buy-now-pay-later-services-continue-to-boom/">$155 million at a $700 million valuation</a>, while Colombia&#8217;s Addi disclosed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/">$75 million extension to its Series B totaling $140 million</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy now, pay later is officially everywhere, and Latin America is no exception,&#8221; Mary Ann Azevedo wrote for TechCrunch. This isn&#8217;t a copy-and-paste of the same model, though. Different markets have different needs, leading to important tweaks. The main one? BNPL isn&#8217;t necessarily synonymous with e-commerce.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Addi&#8217;s partners also include brick-and-mortar stores. This is understandable in markets where e-commerce, although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/">fast growing</a>, doesn&#8217;t yet have the same levels of adoption as in the U.S., and where installments were already a thing; but it is also happening as a natural expansion of BNPL beyond e-commerce and retail.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based startup Wisetack is a good example of this trend: It brings buy now, pay later to in-person home services, from HVAC repairs to plumbing. A very fragmented space that Wisetack cleverly worked its way around by teaming up and accessing the professional customer base of vertical SaaS providers such as Housecall Pro and Jobber. Oh, and it just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/wisetack-closes-on-45m-to-bring-buy-now-pay-later-to-in-person-services/">raised $45 million</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly relevant with buy now, pay later expanding beyond retail is that it encompasses larger expenses. For example, according to Wisetack CEO Bobby Tzekin, purchases made to service-based businesses average $4,000 to $5,000. Exciting for BNPL companies … and also likely to increase scrutiny from regulators who already had this new segment under review.</p>
<p>Although BNPL is framed as interest-free and an alternative to credit card payments, public authorities and consumer protection bodies have expressed concerns that it may encourage overspending and underplay the risks that customers are taking.</p>
<p>This translated into a regulatory push <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/buy-now-pay-later-to-be-regulated-in-the-uk/">in the U.K,</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/klarna-payment-firm-scrutiny-buy-now-pay-later-business/">in the EU</a>, potentially casting a shadow over Klarna&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-18/klarna-says-listing-is-increasingly-plausible-but-not-imminent">&#8220;plausible but not imminent&#8221; listing</a>. Having raised $3.7 billion to date according to Crunchbase, it would be logical for the Swedish quadradecacorn to follow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">Affirm&#8217;s footsteps</a> and go public, but timing will matter.</p>
<p>With so much funding flowing into the sector and consolidation already happening, it will definitely be interesting to watch.</p>
<h2>Factorial, Wave and SPACs</h2>
<p>The Exchange may have been on hiatus this week, but there were plenty of stories to digest across TechCrunch and Extra Crunch. Here are the ones that most caught my attention:</p>
<p><strong>Factorial and betting on SMBs: </strong>Spanish HR startup Factorial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/05/spains-factorial-raises-80m-at-a-530m-valuation-on-the-back-of-strong-traction-for-its-workday-for-smbs/">raised an $80 million Series B round</a> at a $530 million valuation. This is noteworthy in itself, and also for being led by Tiger Global. However, my favorite part is that it puts the spotlight on the money to be made by serving SMBs.</p>
<p>Shameless plug: This was also a key point of my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">Expensify EC-1</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden pointed out, &#8220;Factorial’s rise is part of a much longer-term, bigger trend in which the enterprise technology world has at long last started to turn its attention to how to take the tools that originally were built for larger organizations, and right-size them for smaller customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right-sizing typically means avoiding unnecessary complexity in the product, and it is often done better by companies that only focus on this, rather than by enterprise incumbents. And it isn&#8217;t just a phase either: More and more, it is understood as a segment that companies can focus on forever.</p>
<p><strong>A Wave of funding</strong>: Earlier this week, Africa recorded its biggest Series A to date: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/">a $200 million round into mobile money startup Wave</a>. With a valuation of $1.7 billion, this also turned the U.S.- and Senegal-based company into French-speaking Africa&#8217;s first unicorn.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that a fintech company was the first one to reach this milestone, Tage Kene-Okafor noted: Fintech has been attracting the lion&#8217;s share of VC funding on the continent. Per <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/">The Big Deal</a>, a Substack newsletter on Africa&#8217;s startup scene, 48% of venture capital flowing into African startups in the first half of 2021 went to fintech — and this giant round may skew things even further when the time comes to check yearly tallies.</p>
<p>On a higher level, this seems to confirm that Africa&#8217;s tech sector is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">set to break records in 2021</a>, which would be nice to see — especially after a tough 2020, and more generally, in a context of underfunding.</p>

<p><strong>To SPAC or not to SPAC: </strong>According to Bloomberg, Traveloka is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-06/traveloka-is-said-to-halt-talks-with-thiel-s-bridgetown-spac">pulling back on its plans to go public via a SPAC</a> with Peter Thiel&#8217;s Bridgetown Holdings. The question, it seems, is <em>not</em> whether to list: Talking <a href="https://skift.com/2021/09/08/traveloka-taps-brakes-on-400-million-spac-deal-to-go-public/">to travel industry news site Skift</a>, a Traveloka spokesperson described going public as &#8220;a natural evolution given Traveloka’s position as a category leader [with] aspirations to grow the business further.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, the Indonesian travel heavyweight is debating which path to follow — and sources told Bloomberg that it now will likely choose a traditional U.S. IPO instead, as SPACs &#8220;have fallen out of favor.&#8221; These are Bloomberg&#8217;s words, not mine; because it might still be early to say.</p>
<p>Sure, tighter regulation is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/21/business/dealbook/spac-market-future.html">looming</a>, amid criticism that is well captured by this <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/when-it-comes-to-spac-investing-the-house-always-wins-the-public-not-so-much">February headline</a>: &#8220;When it comes to SPAC investing, the house always wins. The public, not so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my colleague Ryan Lawler brought a great counterpoint this week: Better.com is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511005602/en/Digital-Homeownership-Platform-Better-to-Become-a-Publicly-Listed-Company-via-Merger-with-Aurora-Acquisition-Corp.-Company-is-Redefining-the-Homeownership-Experience">set to merge</a> with blank-check company Aurora Acquisition Corp. at &#8220;a post-money equity value of approximately $7.7 billion.&#8221; According to its chief executives, a traditional IPO makes sense for companies that can easily be categorized. But a SPAC may be a better fit for a company like Better, which as Ryan reports, &#8220;has bigger ambitions than just being seen as a mortgage lender compared with other financial services companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this the exception to the rule? Maybe, but it could also be a sign that SPACs still have a card to play.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and have a great weekend, The Exchange will be back to its regular schedule from Monday onward!  — <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna</a></p>
