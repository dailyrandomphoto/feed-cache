										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant grocery and essentials delivery is already a very crowded field in Europe; but today competition was turned up another notch: <a href="https://gopuff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a> &#8212; the U.S. leader in the space with a service that delivers food and essentials for a flat fee of $1.95, 24 hours a day &#8212; launched officially in the U.K.. It plans to use London as a base to expand further into the region.</p>
<p>The launch is part branding, and part integration exercise: Gopuff, which was valued at $15 billion after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $1 billion in July earlier this year</a>, has been using its cash to make a stream of acquisitions. Two of those have been snapping up instant delivery players Fancy and most recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005811/en/Gopuff-Doubles-Down-on-European-Expansion-With-Acquisition-of-Dija" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dija</a> in the UK. Now, Gopuff is rebranding those two under its own name, and moving its services over to its main app and platform.</p>
<p>The company is live today in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield and the plan is to be in 33 markets by the middle of next year, led by SVP of Europe, Steven Harman (who had been COO at Revolut); execs poached from Amazon; and Alberto Menolascina, who was co-founder of Dija, as the UK GM. The pricing in the U.K. is £1.79 per order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When looking at expanding into Europe, we were extremely attracted to the similar models, infrastructure, loyal customer bases and talent we saw in both Dija and Fancy,” said Rafael IIishayev, co-founder and co-CEO of Gopuff, in a statement. “By combining Gopuff’s technology, scale and deep experience leveraging existing physical infrastructure, with the local market knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit of the Fancy and Dija teams, we can bring a game-changing and unparalleled experience to UK customers.” I&#8217;ll be meeting with his co-founder Yakir Gola later today and will see if he says more about those plans.</p>
<p>Indeed, the U.K. is Gopuff&#8217;s first international market, but not its last. The company reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/amazon-gopuff-are-said-to-explore-deal-for-german-startup-flink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its eye on</a> at least one startup out of Berlin, Flink. Germany has proven to be one of the hotter markets for instant grocery delivery. Gorillas, another well-capitalized player in the space &#8212; it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised close to $1 billion</a> earlier this year and is now valued at around $2.1 billion &#8212; is also based in the city.</p>
<p>Aside from Flink and Gorillas, another major player in Europe has been Getir out of Turkey. Backed by the likes of Tiger Global and Sequoia, it is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-is-streets-ahead-following-latest-funding-round-valuing-the-company-at-over-7-5bn-301305869.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $7.5 billion</a> and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off an acquisition spree in earnest</a>. There are many, many more players in the space, such as Zapp, Glovo, Cajoo, Weezy, Jiffy, Deliveroo, offerings from supermarkets, and much more. All of these have raised or invested collectively hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to carve out market share and grow, capitalizing on a consumer appetite for more on-demand services and &#8212; in a climate of the Covid-19 pandemic still very much hanging in the air &#8212; less of an inclination to go out physically themselves to get what they need.</p>
<p>As we have seen in other on-demand categories like transportation (hello, Uber) the strategic playbook here for the delivery businesses is to raise huge rounds of funding to make aggressive moves into new markets and to compete against others doing the same by offering deep discounts to win customers and potentially lock them into using your services more regularly. Gopuff, which has been around since 2013, believes that globally, the addressable market for instant food and essentials delivery is potentially worth $10 trillion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That will inevitably lead to more consolidation of smaller, regional players; but it also spells deep losses due to extremely negative unit economics that are hard to claw back once promotions have been doled out to the masses. In areas like transportation, that has led to major write-downs both for the companies and their investors.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether instant grocery is a mere repeat of that, or if entrepreneurs, startups and their investors have learned a lesson here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automakers, suppliers and startups aiming to roll out automated driving features, robotaxis and self-driving trucks are a little closer to accessing Nvidia&#8217;s newest compute and sensor toolkit.</p>
<p>Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang announced Tuesday at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event that Hyperion 8 — a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development — is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8 is the latest iteration of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use customize to their likening and needs. Hyperion 8 was first revealed in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren&#8217;t revealed until Tuesday. Notably, Luminar is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity here is that as Nvidia&#8217;s system gets designed in (to production vehicles), we also ultimately get designed in,&#8221; said Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell.</p>
<p>Hyperion is a reference platform that allows customers, like say an automaker, to access and tweak what its needs, including the core compute and middleware as well as AI functions inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>Hyperion 8&#8217;s availability was one of a string of automotive-related announcements made by Huang at the company&#8217;s fall GTC event. The key announcements included developments in mapping bolstered by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/nvidia-acquires-hi-def-mapping-startup-deepmap-to-bolster-av-technology/">acquisition of DeepMap</a> in June, a tool that can replicate realistic scenes through simulated cameras with data labeled automatically and a personal concierge product that acts as a digital assistant, provides important communication between the automated driving system and the passenger and can handle parking. Each new product announcement either fits into or complements Hyperion 8.</p>
<p>The upshot: Nvidia aims to capture larger slices of the automated driving market, a sector that includes the suppliers and automakers developing driver assistance systems for passenger vehicles and the companies working to deploy fully autonomous vehicles such as self-driving trucks and robotaxis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nvidia has scored a number of customers that are developing on the Nvidia&#8217;s Drive Orin computer system-on-chip, including Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, TuSimple, Volvo and Zoox. Nvidia touted several more design wins during the fall GTC event, including Lotus, Chinese self-driving startup <a href="https://www.qcraft.ai/en">Qcraft</a> and Weltmeister, the EV brand owned by China&#8217;s WM Motor Technology Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not expect to have a 100% market share, but we have a dominant portion of the market that&#8217;s developing on Nvidia Drive,&#8221; Danny Shapiro, vice president of automotive at Nvidia said in a briefing ahead of GTC. &#8220;And the reason that is, is because we have this entire end-to-end solution. It&#8217;s not just about one thing that goes in the car but it&#8217;s about the data center, it&#8217;s about the simulation, it&#8217;s about the vehicle and having that on the same architecture is a huge advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="http://tableau.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tableau</a> looks for ways to make data more accessible to a greater number of people across an organization, it will be announcing later today at the <a href="https://www.tableau.com/events/conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Data21 customer conference</a> the ability to query your data inside Slack by asking questions using natural language. The announcement builds on previous integrations with Slack.</p>
<p>Francois Ajenstat, chief product officer, speaking at a press event on Monday ahead of the conference, said that the new integration is about bringing the full power of Tableau data into Slack where people can collaborate on it in various ways. That means you can get an alert when data you care about changes, but you can also interact with it right in Slack without having to switch applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slack also becomes the place to be able to ask questions of data so users can find all of their content right here in one interface. They [don&#8217;t] have to leave Slack. They can search the entire Tableau repository &#8212; all the dashboards, all the data sources are available right there,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The key, though, is being able to query that data. &#8220;And if I find what I want, I can just jump in and start [typing] questions. So in this case, we&#8217;re using Ask Data, which is Tableau&#8217;s natural language query interface to ask questions using natural language, which is really easy and accessible to everyone,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In fact, this capability builds on some functionality the company announced earlier this summer, including Ask Data and Explain Data, says Hyoun Park, CEO and chief analyst at Amalgam Insights. He believes that these capabilities, especially the query feature, could open up data analysis to a group of people who weren&#8217;t capable of interacting deeply with data in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been other integrations between Slack and other analytic solutions that use natural language, <a href="https://www.thoughtspot.com/press-releases/thoughtspot-announces-searchiq-new-voice-driven-analytics-enterprise">such as ThoughtSpot</a>. However, the ability to quickly bring Slack and Tableau together and gain access to a breadth of analysis tools via natural language makes this one of the biggest announcements ever to open up analytic access for millions of users who would otherwise lack the data skills to dig deeply into Tableau analytic outputs,&#8221; Park told me.</p>
<p>He says that by taking this approach Tableau is not just making this kind of data more widely available, it essentially is making Slack the user interface for the core Tableau product. He points out that it also builds on Einstein Discovery for Tableau, which enables Tableau to take advantage of Salesforce&#8217;s AI engine.</p>
<p>The company says this Einstein capability &#8220;provides predictions in the flow of work. Business people can run AI predictions on their most important business data to get intelligent predictions that identify leading causes and produce actionable recommendations on next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">bought Tableau in 2019</a> for $15.7 billion. It acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Slack at the end of last year</a> for more than $27 billion. It&#8217;s no wonder, after spending that kind of money, the company wants to find ways to make its expensive purchases work well together, and these announcements are part of making Slack the interface to various pieces across the entire Salesforce platform.</p>
<p>Salesforce announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first Slack integrations</a> with the Salesforce family of products in August, and Slack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/slack-releases-clips-video-tool-announces-16-salesforce-integrations/">announced additional integrations</a> in September.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over a year ago, Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek pledged 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of his personal fortune towards funding deeptech “moonshot projects”, spread across the next 10 years. In particular, he was most interested in boosting European tech and European entrepreneurs as he said they were typically underfunded compared to US counterparts.</p>
<p>Today it looks like he’s also out to boost European (and other) liberal democratic societies with the news that Prima Materia, his investment company, will put €100m into <a href="https://helsing.ai/">Helsing</a>, a European defence AI company, which has raised €102.5m in total as part of its Series A financing. The new funding will be used to grow the team of over 70 (so far), and accelerate product and delivery. It also means Helsing is claiming a valuation north of €400 million.</p>
<p>Following a seed round with European investors earlier this year, Helsing plans to use it’s AI platform to boost defence and national security among the afore-mentioned democracies by making them more efficient, using live data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ek will join the company’s Board, alongside Helsing’s co-founders Torsten Reil, Gundbert Scherf and Niklas Köhler.</p>
<p>Helsing says its real-time software platform “processes data from multiple sensors directly on vehicles and systems, to provide an integrated view of the operational environment with the aim of faster and more accurate decision-making.” So, unlike some systems which seek to make longer-term organizational changes, this appears to be a highly “live scenario” platform. This would be crucial in scenarios like cyber attacks, as well as ‘kinetic’ scenarios.</p>
<p>Helsing says this will involve turning unstructured sensor data into “information advantage” for democratic governments, providing the clearest picture possible in any operating environment by using “AI on the edge”. This, quite obviously, would involve gathering data from multiple sensors directly on vehicles and systems.</p>
<p>Helsing also says it will “focus on serving countries which meet the highest democratic standards.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2021 and with offices in London, Munich and Berlin, Helsing plans to serve several countries, starting with teams in the UK, France and Germany. It recently appointed former senior UK MoD official Nick Elliott as CEO of Helsing UK, and Sir Chris Deverell (formerly head of the UK’s Joint Forces Command) as a senior advisor. A French entity will be a third home market in early 2022. Robert Fink joined as CTO from Palantir, where he was Chief Architect, earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a statement, Torsten Reil, Co-founder, and CEO, said: “We founded Helsing with the conviction that liberal democratic values are worth defending, and that artificial intelligence will be an essential capability to keep us safe. Unlike authoritarian regimes, democratically elected governments have a special responsibility to their citizens: the use of technology needs to be transparent and guided by ethical standards set by us all. We believe that the required control and accountability needs to be designed into the technology from the outset.”</p>
<p>Gundbert Scherf, Co-founder and COO/President, added: “Working like a software and tech company, we designed Helsing to overcome another key challenge all democratic governments face: Government works in linear processes that are inherently difficult to square with the exponential speed of technology. At Helsing we don’t wait for the specific requirement to come out of the process, but instead, invest our own resources into our platform to solve entire categories of problems.”</p>
<p>A word about the team: Reil previously built NaturalMotion, which exited to Zynga for $527m. Scherf (President/ COO) was previously Partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and Architect of the Bundeswehr’s Cyber and Information Domain Command and the digital directorate-general at the German Ministry of Defence. Koehler (CPO) is a Theoretical Physicist and has published AI contributions in Nature, Nature Communications, Nature Machine Intelligence. Fink (CTO) was a software engineer at Palantir Technologies. Elliott CBE MBE (CEO Helsing UK) was recently Director-General of the UK Vaccine Taskforce.</p>
<p>Daniel Ek commented: “We founded Prima Materia to advance ambitious science and technology to solve the world’s biggest challenges and help society progress towards a better future… Europe has a tremendous opportunity to lead in building dynamic AI systems in an ethical, transparent, and responsible manner. Torsten, Gundbert, Niklas, and the entire Helsing team take this responsibility seriously and are driven by the same values and ambition that led us to start Prima Materia.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Music users around the world will soon have access to more Chinese musicians. Tencent Music Entertainment, the online music subsidiary of Tencent, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tencent-music-entertainment-group-brings-incredible-catalog-of-chinese-music-to-apple-music-users-worldwide-301419065.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Tuesday that &#8220;record labels and artists&#8221; who are part of its &#8220;Music Cloud&#8221; program can now distribute their works through Apple Music.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Tencent has joined hands with a major online music giant from the West. In 2017, the Chinese internet firm entered a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share swapping agreement</a> with Spotify. The deal didn&#8217;t include content sharing.</p>
<p>TME&#8217;s announcement is vague and the partners are tight-lipped about the details of their arrangement. The weight of the deal hinges on what exactly TME&#8217;s &#8220;Music Cloud&#8221; is. This is what it means in the firm&#8217;s own words:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230352" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>As a new global music distribution platform launched by TME, TME Music Cloud will also adopt &#8216;content self-management,&#8217; &#8216;online distribution and promotion,&#8217; &#8216;settlement of royalties,&#8217; and “music data insights,&#8217; providing global level omni-channel distribution for a wide range of partner labels and creators. At the same time, TME’s industry resources and Tencent’s social ecology will offer comprehensive assistance to content creators in content production and promotion as well as commercial realization.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the sound of it, Music Cloud will serve small-time artists who lack distribution and marketing help from big record labels.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, TME has built a platform for independent musicians, where they can distribute their works, attract fans, host virtual concerts, and eventually generate income. In return, TME gets licensing rights to their works.</p>
<p>The real moneymaker for TME, however, is its rights to top pop musicians like Jay Chou. The Taiwanese singer is so valuable to its user loyalty that TME <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-wins-jay-chou-copyright-lawsuit-against-netease-report/">brought a case against NetEase Music</a> for infringing Chou&#8217;s copyrights in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the years, TME had splurged hundreds of millions of dollars securing exclusive music licenses from Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music Entertainment, collectively known as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/tencent-music-joint-labels-warner/">&#8220;big three&#8221; record labels</a>. But China&#8217;s antitrust crackdown on its tech industry has started to break down TME&#8217;s thick walls. In July, the country&#8217;s market regulator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tencent-terminates-all-exclusive-music-agreements-2021-08-31/">fined</a> TME for &#8220;unfair&#8221; market practices and told it to give up exclusive online music rights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that TME will share its expensive licensed music with Apple Music, otherwise, the partnership will come with a big price tag. We will know more when the partners decide to bring more details to light. For now, the prospects of reaching a global audience will certainly keep emerging Chinese musicians excited.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In her latest turn in front of a phalanx of lawmakers, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave a polished testimony to the European Parliament on Monday &#8212; following similar sessions in front of UK and US legislators in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Her core message was the same dire warning she&#8217;s sounded on both sides of the Atlantic: Facebook prioritizes profit over safety, choosing to ignore the amplification of toxic content that&#8217;s harmful to individuals, societies and democracy. And that regulatory oversight is thus essential to rein in and make such irresponsibly operated platform power accountable &#8212; with no time for lawmakers to lose in imposing rules on social media.</p>
<p>The (to date) highest profile Facebook whistleblower got a very warm reception from the European Parliament, where MEPs were universally effusive in thanking her for her time &#8212; and what they couched as her &#8220;bravery&#8221; in raising her concerns publicly &#8212; applauding Haugen before she spoke and again at the end of the nearly three hour presentation plus Q&amp;A session.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They questioned her on a range of issues &#8212; giving over the largest share of their attention to how incoming pan-EU digital regulations can best deliver effective transparency and accountability on slippery platform giants.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> (DSA) is front of mind for MEPs as they are considering and voting on amendments to the Commission&#8217;s proposal which could seriously reshape the legislation.</p>
<p>Such as a push by some MEPs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">to get an outright ban on behavioral advertising added to the legislation</a> in favor of privacy-safe alternatives like contextual ads. Or another amendment that&#8217;s recently gained some backing &#8212; <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/digital-services-act-a-media-exemption-would-open-a-loophole-for-disinformation/">pushing to exempt news media</a> from platform content takedowns.</p>
<p>Turns out Haugen isn&#8217;t a fan of either of those potential amendments. But she spoke up in favor of the regulation as a whole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out its plan to reboot digital rules and tame tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=TrAaybQONH" data-secret="TrAaybQONH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The general thrust of the DSA is aimed at achieving a trusted and safe online environment &#8212; and a number of MEPs speaking during today&#8217;s session spied a soapboxing opportunity to toot the EU&#8217;s horn for being so advanced as to have a digital regulation not just on the table but advancing rapidly toward adoption slap-bang in the midst of (yet) another Facebook publicity crisis &#8212; with the glare of the global spotlight on Haugen speaking to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Facebook whistleblower was happy to massage political egos, telling MEPs that she&#8217;s &#8220;grateful&#8221; the EU is taking platform regulation seriously &#8212; and suggesting there&#8217;s an opportunity for the bloc to set a &#8220;global gold standard&#8221; with the DSA.</p>
<p>Although she used a similar line <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">in the UK parliament during another evidence session last month</a>, where she talked up domestic online safety legislation in similarly glowing tones.</p>
<p>To MEPs, Haugen repeated her warning to UK lawmakers that Facebook is exceptionally adept at &#8220;dancing with data&#8221; &#8212; impressing on them that they too must not pass naive laws that simply require the tech giant to hand over data about what&#8217;s happening on its platform. Rather Facebook must be made to explain any data-sets it hands over, down to the detail of the queries it uses to pull data and generate oversight audits.</p>
<p>Without such a step in legislation, Haugen warned that shiny new EU digital rules will arrive with a massive loophole baked in for Facebook to dance through by serving up selectively self-serving data &#8212; running whatever queries it needs to paints the picture to get the tick in the box.</p>
<p>For regulation to be effective on platforms as untrustworthy as Facebook, she suggested it must be multi-tiered, dynamic and take continuous input from a broader ecosystem of civil society organizations and external researchers &#8212; to stay on top of emergent harms and ensure the law is actually doing the job intended.</p>
<p>It should also take a broad view of oversight, she urged &#8212; providing platform data to a wider circle of external experts than merely just the &#8216;vetted academics&#8217; of the current DSA proposal in order to really deliver the sought for accountability around AI-fuelled impacts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has shown that they will lie with data,&#8221; she told the European Parliament. &#8220;I encourage you to put in the DSA; if Facebook gives you data they should have to show you how they got it&#8230; It&#8217;s really, really important that they should have to disclose the process, the queries, the notebooks they used to pull this data because you can&#8217;t trust anything they give you unless you can confirm that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen didn&#8217;t just sound the alarm; she layered on the flattery, too &#8212; telling MEPs that she &#8220;strongly believe[s] that Europe has a critical role to play in regulating these platforms because you are a vibrant, linguistically diverse democracy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you get the DSA right for your linguistically and ethnically diverse, 450 million EU citizens you can create a game-changer for the world &#8212; you can force platforms to price in societal risk to their business operations so that the decisions about what products to build and how to build them is not purely based on profit maximization. You can establish systemic rules and standards that address risks while protecting free speech and you can show the world how transparency, oversight and enforcement should work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a deep, deep need to make sure that platforms must disclose what safety systems they have, what languages those safety systems are in and a performance per language &#8212; and that&#8217;s the kind of thing where you can put in the DSA,&#8221; she went on, fleshing out her case for comprehensive disclosure requirements in the DSA. &#8220;You can say: You need to be honest with us on is this actually dangerous for a large fraction of Europeans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such an approach would have benefits that scale beyond Europe, per Haugen &#8212; by forcing Facebook &#8220;towards language-neutral content-neutral solutions&#8221; which she argued are needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/facebook-on-the-spot-in-kenya-as-exploitation-of-minors-rife-on-its-platform/">tackle harms</a> across all the markets and languages where the platform operates.</p>
<p>The skew in how much of Facebook&#8217;s (limited) safety budget gets directed toward English-speaking markets &#8212; and/or to the handful of markets where it&#8217;s afraid of regulation &#8212; is one of the core issues amplified by her leaking of so many internal Facebook documents. And she suggested Europe could help tackle this lack of global equity around how powerful platforms operate (and what they choose to prioritize or de-prioritize) by enforcing context-specific transparency around Facebook&#8217;s AI models &#8212; requiring not just a general measure of performance but specifics per market; per language; per safety system; even per cohort of heavily targeted users.</p>
<p>Forcing Facebook to address safety as a systemic requirement would not only solve problems the platform causes in markets across Europe but it would &#8220;speak up for people who live in fragile places in the world that don&#8217;t have as much influence&#8221;, she argued, adding: &#8220;The places in the world that have the most linguistic diversity are often the most fragile places and they need Europe to step in &#8212; because you guys have influence and you can really help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>While many of Haugen&#8217;s talking points were familiar from her earlier testimony sessions and press interviews, during the Q&amp;A a number of EU lawmakers sought to engage her on whether Facebook&#8217;s problem with toxic content amplification might be tackled by an outright ban on microtargeted/behavioral advertising &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">an active debate in the parliament</a> &#8212; so that the adtech giant can no longer use people&#8217;s information against them to profit through data-driven manipulation.</p>
<p>On this, Haugen demurred &#8212; saying she supports people being able to choose ad targeting (or no ad targeting) themselves, rather than regulators deciding.</p>
<p>Instead of an outright ban she suggested that &#8220;specific things and ads&#8230; really need to be regulated&#8221; &#8212; pointing to ad rates as one area she would target for regulation. &#8220;Given the current system subsidizes hate &#8212; it&#8217;s 5x to 10x cheaper to run a political ad that&#8217;s hateful than a non-hateful ad &#8212; I think you need to have flat rates for ads,&#8221; she said on that. &#8220;But I also think there should be regulation on targeting ads to specific people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re aware of this but you can target specific ads to an audience of 100 people. And I&#8217;m pretty sure there is being misused because I did an analysis on who is hyper exposed to political ads and unsurprisingly the people who are most exposed are in Washington DC and they are radically overexposed &#8212; we&#8217;re talking thousands of political ads a month. So I do think having mechanisms to target specific people without their knowledge I think is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen also argued for a ban on Facebook being able to use third party data sources to enrich the profiles it holds on people for ad targeting purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to profiling and data retention I think you shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to take third party data sources &#8212; something Facebook does, they work with credit card companies, other forms &#8212; and it makes their ads radically more profitable,&#8221; she said, adding: &#8220;I think you should have to consent to every time you hook up more data sources. Because I think people would feel really uncomfortable if they knew that Facebook had some of the data they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on behavioral ad targeting she studiously avoided supporting an outright ban.</p>
<p>It was an interesting wrinkle during the session, given there is momentum on the issue within the EU &#8212; including as a result of her own whistleblowing amplifying regional lawmakers&#8217; concerns about Facebook &#8212; and Haugen could have helped stoked that (but opted not to).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=Zy4jradlYl" data-secret="Zy4jradlYl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;With regard to targeted ads, I&#8217;m a strong proponent that people should be allowed to make choices with regard to how they are targeted &#8212; and I encourage prohibiting dark patterns that force people into opting into those things,&#8221; she said during one response, without going into detail on exactly how regulators could draft a law that&#8217;s effective against something as cynically multifaceted as &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/01/wtf-is-dark-pattern-design/">dark pattern design</a>&#8216;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms should have to be transparent about how they use that data,&#8221; was all she offered, before falling back on reiterating: &#8220;I&#8217;m a big proponent that they should also have to publish policies like do they give flat ad rates for all political ads because you shouldn&#8217;t be subsidizing hate in political ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her argument against banning behavioral ads seemed to boil down to (or rather hinge on) regulators achieving fully comprehensive platform transparency &#8212; that&#8217;s able to provide an accurate picture of what Facebook (et al) actually does with people&#8217;s data &#8212; i.e. in order that users can then make a genuine choice over whether they want such targeting or not. So it hinges on full-picture accountability.</p>
<p>Yet during another point in the session &#8212; after she had been asked whether children can really consent to data processing by platforms like Facebook &#8212; Haugen argued it&#8217;s doubtful that adults can (currently) understand what Facebook is doing with their data, let alone kids.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to can children understand what they&#8217;re trading away, I think almost certainly we as adults &#8212; we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ve traded away,&#8221; she told MEPs.  &#8220;We don&#8217;t know what goes in the algorithms, we don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re targeted so the idea that children can given informed consent &#8212; I don&#8217;t think we give informed consent and they have less capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that, her faith that such comprehensive transparency is possible &#8212; and will paint a universally comprehensible picture of data-driven manipulation that allows all adults to make a truly informed decision to accept manipulative behavior ads (or not) &#8212; looks, well, rather tenuous.</p>
<p>If we follow Haugen&#8217;s logic, were the suggested cure of radical transparency to fail &#8212; including by regulator/s improperly/inaccurately communicating everything that&#8217;s been found to users and/or failing to ensure users are appropriately and universally educated regarding their risks and rights &#8212; well the risk is, surely, that data-drive exploitation will continue (just now with a free pass baked into legislation).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Her argument here felt like it lacked coherence. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As if her opposition to banning behavioral ads &#8212; and, therefore, to tackling one core incentive that&#8217;s fuelling social media&#8217;s manipulative toxicity &#8212; was rather more ideological than logical. </span></p>
<p>(Certainly it looks like quite the leap of faith in governments around the world being able to scramble into place the kind of high functioning, &#8216;full-fat&#8217; oversight Haugen suggests is needed &#8212; even as, simultaneously, she&#8217;s spent weeks impressing on lawmakers that platforms can only be understood as highly context-specific and devilishly data-detailed algorithm machines; Not to mention the sheer scale of the task at hand, even just given Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;amazing&#8221; amounts of data, as she put it in the Q&amp;A today, suggesting that if regulators were handed Facebook data in raw form it would be far too overwhelming for them&#8230;)</p>
<p>This is also perhaps exactly the perspective you&#8217;d expect from a data scientist, not a rights expert.</p>
<p>(Ditto her quick dismissal of banning behavioral ads is the sort of trigger reaction you&#8217;d expect from a platform insider whose expertise comes from having been privy to the blackboxes,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and focused on manipulating algorithms and data, vs being outside the machine where the harms flow and are felt.)</span></p>
<p>At another point during the session Haugen further complicated her advocacy for radical transparency as the sole panacea for social media&#8217;s ills &#8212; warning against the EU leaving enforcement of such complex matters up to 27 national agencies.</p>
<p>Were the EU to do that she suggested it would doom the DSA to fail. Instead she advised lawmakers to create a central EU bureaucracy to deal with enforcing the highly detailed, layered and dynamic rules she says are needed to wrap Facebook-level platforms &#8212; going so far as to suggest that ex-industry algorithm experts like herself might find a &#8220;home&#8221; there, chipping in to help with their specialist knowledge and &#8220;giv[ing] back by contributing to public accountability&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of formal experts in these things &#8212; how the algorithms really work and the consequences of them &#8212; there are very, very few in the world. Because you can&#8217;t get a Master degree in it, you can&#8217;t get a PhD in it, you have to go work for one of these companies and be trained up internally,&#8221; she suggested, adding: &#8220;I sincerely worry that if you delegate this functionality to 27 Member States you will not be able to get critical mass in any one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be very, very difficult to get enough experts and distribute them that broadly.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so many warnings to lawmakers about the need to nail down devilish details in self-serving data-sets and &#8220;fragile&#8221; AIs, in order to prevent platforms from simply carrying on pulling the wool over everyone&#8217;s eyes, it seems instructive that Haugen should be so opposed to regulators actually choosing to set some simple limits &#8212; such as no personal data for ads.</p>
<p>She was also asked directly by MEPs on whether regulators should put limits on what platforms can do with data and/or limits on the inputs it can use for algorithms. Again her preference in response to the questions was for transparency &#8212; not limits. (Although elsewhere, and as noted above, she did at least call for a ban on Facebook buying third party data-sets to enrich its ad profiling.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, then, the ideology of the algorithm expert may have a few blind spots when it comes to thinking outside the blackbox for ways to come up with effective regulation for data-driven software machines.</p>
<p>Some hard stops might actually be just what&#8217;s needed for democratic societies to wrest back control from data-mining tech giants.</p>
<p>Haugen&#8217;s best advocacy may therefore be her highly detailed warnings around the risk of loopholes fatally scuttling digital regulation. She is undoubtedly correct that here the risks are multitudinous.</p>
<p>Earlier in her presentation she raised another possible loophole &#8212; pushing lawmakers <em>not</em> to exempt news media content from the DSA (which is another potential amendment MEPs are mulling). &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to make content neutral rules rules, then they must really be neutral,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;Nothing is singled out and nothing is exempted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every modern disinformation campaign will exploit news media channels on digital platforms by gaming the system,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;If the DSA makes it illegal for platforms to address these issues we risk undermining the effectiveness of the law &#8212; indeed we may be worse off than today&#8217;s situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the Q&amp;A, Haugen also faced a couple of questions from MEPs on new challenges that will arise for regulators in light of Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">planned pivot to building the so-called &#8216;metaverse&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>On this she told lawmakers she&#8217;s &#8220;extremely concerned&#8221; &#8212; warning of the increased data gathering that could flow from the proliferation of metaverse-feeding sensors in homes and offices.</p>
<p>She also raised concerns that Facebook&#8217;s focus on building workplace tools might result in a situation in which opting out is not even an option, given that employees typically have little say over business tools &#8212; suggesting people may face a dystopic future choice between Facebook&#8217;s ad profiling or being able to earn a living.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s fresh focus on &#8220;the Metaverse&#8221; illustrates what Haugen dubbed a &#8220;meta problem&#8221; for Facebook &#8212; aka: That its preference is &#8220;to move on&#8221;, rather than stop and fix the problems created by its current technology.</p>
<p>Regulators must throw the levers that force the juggernaut to plot a new, safety-focused course, she added.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alphajwc.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha JWC</a>, the Jakarta-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its third fund at $433 million. The company says this makes it Southeast Asia’s largest VC fund for early-stage startups and that it was oversubscribed, with an initial target of $250 million to $300 million. The third fund’s investors include the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC). The majority of LPs from Alpha JWC’s first two funds also contributed.</p>
<p>Co-founder and general partner Jefrey Joe said he has started to see more interest in Southeast Asia from global investors, thanks to high-profile exits like Bukalapak and Sea Group’s IPOs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230385" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It shows there is enough value to be created compared to such a developed market as the U.S.,” he told TechCrunch. He added that the new wave of investor interest started over the last year, as more startups, including Alpha JWC portfolio companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/buy-now-pay-later-startup-kredivo-doubles-its-debt-facility-from-victory-park-capital-to-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kredivo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/automotive-marketplace-carro-hits-unicorn-status-with-360m-series-c-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carro</a> hit unicorn status in a relatively short amount of time (Ajaib, an investment app, became a unicorn <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ardianwibisono/2021/10/04/online-stock-brokerage-ajaib-becomes-indonesias--fastest-unicorn/?sh=777288923236" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two and a half years after it launched</a>). Alpha JWC was the first institutional investor in all three startups.</p>

<p>Alpha JWC now manages about $630 million in assets across its three funds. During this year, the company says its portfolio companies collectively raised more than a billion dollars so far, with the majority raising follow-on funding within a year of Alpha JWC’s initial investment.</p>
<p>The firm invests in early-stage — or pre-seed, seed and pre-Series A — and is often the first institutional investor on a startup’s cap table. Alpha JWC’s partners continue to work closely with their portfolio even as they reach later stages; for example, by connecting them to investors in the United States, said Joe, or helping build their management teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alpha JWC launched in 2016 with a first fund of $50 million, which it invested in 23 companies. Its second fund closed in 2019 at $143 million and was used to back 30 companies. The company said its first fund’s total-value-to-paid-in (TVPI) has reached 3.72x and its internal rate of return (IRR) is about 37%. Performance metrics for its second fund are even higher: TVPI of 3.45x and 87% of IRR.</p>
<p>Most of the third fund is earmarked for Indonesian startups, but it will also invest in other Southeast Asian markets, like Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, focusing on companies that want to enter Indonesia. Checks will range in size from hundreds of thousands of dollars to up to $60 million at multiple stages. Like Alpha JWC’s first funds, fund three is targeting about 25 to 30 early-stage startups, and is taking a sector-agnostic approach.</p>
<p>“We believe at this point in time, there’s no need to be sector-focused yet,” said co-founder and general partner Chandra Tjan. “The market is still early, very high potential and there are many industries where we can capture the local champion. But some of the sectors we really like are software services, fintech, O2O models and social commerce.”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Alpha JWC says that at least 11 of its portfolio companies are nearing unicorn status, including coffee chain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/kopi-kenangan-raises-20-million/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kopi Kenangan</a>, B2B marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/indonesian-b2b-marketplace-gudangada-raises-more-than-100m-in-new-funding/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GudangAda</a>, consumer goods producer Lemonilo and SME digital financing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/funding-societies-a-southeast-asian-lending-platform-gets-25m-series-b-led-by-softbank-ventures-korea/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Funding Societies</a>.</p>
<p>While digital adoption is still mainly driven by Tier 1 cities like Jakarta, Joe said Indonesia’s smaller cities and towns are quickly catching up. “The second and third tier cities are following strongly and when that happens, our potential will be unlocked and you will see a massive, massive growth in the digital ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Alpha JWC’s co-founders say that startups are beginning to demonstrate better monetization plans, strategies and stronger fundamentals early on, like Ajaib. This means clearer paths to exits, which in turn attracts more investors into the region.</p>
<p>“We were the first institutional investors in Ajaib and from the beginning the founders had built a very strong fundamental mindset, not just burning money to get users, but building strong fundamentals,” said Tjan.</p>
<p>In a statement on the IFC’s investment in Alpha JWC’s third fund, Kim-See Lim, its regional director for East Asia and the Pacific, said, “IFC’s partnership with Alpha JWC Ventures underscores our long-term commitment to Indonesia’s economic development and digital transformation.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nobody likes it when Big Tech changes its mind. It’s particularly frustrating when it involves a major course change on something so essential to technology infrastructure as a server operating system. But that’s exactly what happened in 2020 when Red Hat stopped supporting CentOS as a stable release.</p>
<p>It’s a sudden change, and, in theory, you can respond rapidly and switch to a new OS, but the practical realities of large-scale server environments complicate matters. Sometimes, the best alternative isn’t that obvious either, which means you need time to make a decision.</p>
<p>Red Hat left CentOS users in a difficult position when it said it wouldn&#8217;t support the stable release beyond December 2021. The challenge of choosing the right alternative means many CentOS users are faced with using an unsupported OS. With just a month to go, time is running out.</p>
<h2>Wait, what happened with CentOS?</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick recap: CentOS is a <em>really</em> popular free-to-use clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), sponsored and maintained by Red Hat. It’s more than just a clone — it’s a 1:1 binary compatible clone, and that matters because it ensures application compatibility.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You can’t really blame a profit-centered organization for focusing on its objectives, but a shift in objectives can have significant implications for some users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>RHEL is an enterprise-grade Linux-based OS that’s built for the toughest workloads, but it isn’t cheap. CentOS is such a close clone of RHEL, many organizations chose to rely on CentOS for their enterprise applications instead of RHEL because it saves thousands of dollars in licensing fees.</p>
<p>Besides, Red Hat promised that it would continue to support each CentOS release for about a decade. However, the company changed its mind and suddenly cut support for the latest CentOS release (version 8) with end-of-life now set to be in December 2021. In the same breath, the company also said there will be no future CentOS stable releases.</p>
<p>This sudden change of heart meant that CentOS 8 users had to respond quickly, but given the complexity of changing operating systems and the varying choices, many haven’t yet.</p>
<h2>You need to act now</h2>
<p>In some ways, using an &#8220;unsupported OS&#8221; doesn’t sound that serious. What could really happen if you wait a year or two? After all, CentOS 8 will still work just fine in January in 2022 … and probably in January 2025, too.</p>

<p>The word “treaties” doesn’t exactly conjure images of modernity so much as a dusty history book. But as with other aspects of business and society, technology is rapidly changing how treaties are monitored and enforced — with profound implications for global governance and international law.</p>
<p>Treaties are legally binding international agreements between countries. Pick any major issue affecting the planet or people and there is probably a treaty regulating the matter. Climate change, biodiversity, human rights, refugees, labor, shipping, transnational crime and fisheries are among the fields governed by global treaties, which count most countries &#8212; the U.S.-included &#8212; among their members. Treaties are central to global governance, underpinning most U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But for treaties to work — we need to be able to quickly and accurately discern compliance and results. This has been historically challenging — violators by nature are inclined to subterfuge. And even in areas of cooperation, like scientific measurement and assessments, imprecise, infrequent and inaccurate data can prevent signatories from understanding how a problem is evolving or if their solutions are helping.</p>

<h2>The era of big data</h2>
<p>To meet this challenge, across dozens of treaties, research communities are marshalling new technologies to produce fertile ecosystems delivering untold levels of data and knowledge on underlying conditions and results measurement.</p>
<p>Technology is generating orders of magnitude increases in data quantities. Vast ecosystems of instrumentation and computing hardware are being deployed. Increasingly today scientific communities and governments combine remote sensing and Earth observation (EO) satellites, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and modeling and visualization tools. As we get better at processing and analyzing these data, we are getting closer to delivering near real-time, global and more precise knowledge than ever before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While individual technologies have made important contributions, the real power behind these developments is their use in combination. Together these technologies enable what I call “intelligent treaty systems.”</p>
<h2>Anti-fishing technology</h2>
<p>Consider the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which protects biodiversity of flora and fauna, promotes its sustainable use, and ensures fair and equitable access to benefits from its use. To determine species’ ranges and populations, biodiversity researchers deploy camera traps and microphones in remote locations that transmit data on animal movements via cellular connections to the cloud. With a single camera generating up to 50 TB of data per year, deep learning techniques are used to analyze the massive data and create maps of species’ habitats and numbers. Similarly, drones with video cameras survey sea turtle migration lanes in Costa Rica, with footage analyzed through deep learning algorithms trained to identify individual turtles. Meanwhile thousands of smartphone-wielding citizen scientists record and upload animal sightings to mobile web platforms such as Merlin.</p>
<p>Data from all of these sources are shared with the Global Biodiversity Informatics Facility in Copenhagen, an intergovernmental global biodiversity data repository. Its records have increased tenfold since 2007, now exceeding two billion records. Together this data and research informs the work of the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the dedicated scientific platform for the CBD.</p>
<p>Meanwhile conservationists have harnessed Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders used for ship safety to combat illegal fishing AIS signals to provide comprehensive global data on vessel activity. Groups such as Global Fishing Watch analyze AIS satellite data captured by private firms like ORBCOMM with deep learning to pinpoint and map illegal fishing worldwide. Researchers even use AI and ML to identify vessels that illegally turn off their AIS systems to evade detection.</p>
<p>It’s not just the environment. Satellites are helping fulfill the promise of the Anti-Personnel Landmine Ban Convention. At the outset of the process, Earth observation data are fed into a dedicated geospatial database and mapping platform operated by ESRI, the Information Management System for Mine Action to create maps of mine-contaminated lands. Web platforms also enable individuals to upload information on mine-affected areas. Mine remediation experts on the ground upload more detailed data obtained through diverse sources including drones equipped with ground penetrating radar (GPR) and even trained rats with RFID collars to build precise maps of landmine-contaminated areas. Technicians then use machinery combining GPR and robotics to identify (often using AI and ML) and destroy individual mines.</p>
<p>Recent government attacks on vulnerable Rohingya communities in Myanmar show how technology is also increasingly exposing and documenting otherwise hidden violations of human rights and refugee treaties. Human rights researchers have used Earth observation data to track troop movements, evidence of expulsions, razing of villages and mass killings. Meanwhile photos and video that individuals supplied through mobile phones were channeled through secure cloud platforms such as the Eyewitness to Atrocities portal. ML and AI were used to automate EO data and video imagery analysis. Groups like Amnesty International and SITU Research aggregated the data to generate virtual reality visualizations of settings where violations occurred. EO data was cited in the Gambia v. Myanmar case before the International Court of Justice. Voluminous records of hate speech on Facebook that fueled attacks on Rohingya are being collected and analyzed using ML for the case as well.</p>
<h2>Risks and rewards</h2>
<p>Despite evident progress, intelligent treaty systems are still emerging and experimental. Yet indications are that the value of technology is gaining recognition and will prove transformative. Certainly, numerous challenges must be overcome to realize technology’s full potential. At a basic level, all the scientific knowledge in the world won’t matter if governments don’t act on it and live up to their treaty obligations.</p>
<p>One drawback is the regulatory risk around data protection and privacy, especially when it concerns human rights and already vulnerable populations. Protections must be implemented to ensure data are used discreetly and anonymously where possible. AI is a further concern. The EU draft regulation on AI seeks to outlaw the use of certain technologies such as biometric identification systems in public settings, and similar to its General Data Protection Regulation would affect activities outside of Europe. Likewise, although the public sector geospatial community has made open data a global norm, efforts must be made to integrate the expansion of private sector geospatial data into global governance efforts.</p>
<p>Although treaties are creatures of diplomacy and typically considered rigid in nature, the story of technology’s application shows a dynamic process of bottom-up self-organization by diverse communities across public, private, nonprofit and academic sectors. These activities are likely to make major contributions that offer hope for our ability to overcome many significant planetary challenges.<br />

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 8, 2021! Sure, Elon Musk kicked up a Twitter dust storm by tweeting a poll regarding whether he should sell stock for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/elon-musk-stock-twitter-poll-taxes/">reasons that are a bit less than <em>purely</em> charitable</a>, but it’s Monday now, which means more serious news. Kinda. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/how-chinas-regulatory-crackdown-whomped-vision-fund-1s-returns/"><strong>Chinese regulation dings SoftBank returns:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In our very connected world, if one country shakes up its regulatory regime, folks all over the world can get hit in the wallet. Today we learned that SoftBank’s Vision Fund 1 saw its returns fall sharply in part due to Didi’s falling valuation &#8212; a decline that is directly linked to the Chinese government’s actions against the company following its U.S. IPO. That <em>another</em> continent’s investors may be paying the most as a result of China’s crackdown is merely further irony. (Equity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/equity-monday-elon-musk-reinvents-corporate-governance/">riffed on this earlier today</a>, if you want more.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/"><strong>Corporations love the metaverse:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The metaverse is just VR with more social, it appears, but that isn’t stopping companies from hopping aboard the Facebook bandwagon. Today it was Niantic, which has some notes on where it sees the metaverse going. Care about that or not, Facebook’s pivot is drawing notable commentary, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/07/facebooks-meta-existential-pivot-for-survival/">including from Shasta Ventures’ Jacob Mullins</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/investor-consortium-to-acquire-mcafee-for-14-billion/"><strong>McAfee sells to investor consortium:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, you no longer pay for antivirus protection on your Windows PC, but that doesn’t mean that the company you may have once cut checks to is not worth anything. It’s worth $14 billion, it turns out. Yes, McAfee, around since 1987, has a new corporate home to the tune of $26 per share.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the hurly-burly of discrete startup news items, as a followup to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">dive into the Latin American fintech market</a> last week, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/why-qed-hot-on-nubank-is-bullish-about-latam-fintech/">caught up with LatAm-focused QED partner Lauren Morton</a> to dig in even more deeply. Enjoy!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/fidelity-visa-and-kingsway-back-south-african-fintech-jumo-in-120m-round/"><strong>Fidelity invests in Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>South Africa’s Jumo just raised $120 million from the investing powerhouse, along with Visa and Kingsway Capital. The fintech company raised $55 million in its preceding round. What does it do? Financial services for businesses in emerging markets!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/hawkeye-360-raises-145m-to-scale-space-based-radio-frequency-data-and-analytics/"><strong>Radio-spying satellites are big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That is the lesson from HawkEye 360 raising $145 million in new capital. The company, TechCrunch reports, “monitors radio frequency (RF) signals, like those emitted by marine radios or emergency beacons, on the premise that invisible electromagnetic spectrum is as ripe for information as the visible world.” As a 100% sucker for all things space and space-related, I view this particular news item as very cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/zoomcar-raises-92-million-to-expand-its-car-rental-marketplace-to-new-markets/"><strong>Car rentals boom in India:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Zoomcar, based in Bangalore, just raised $92 million in new capital to expand its car rental business not only in its home market, but also in markets afield. SternAegis Ventures led the Series E.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/berlins-razor-group-raises-125m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-a-platform-to-buy-and-scale-third-party-amazon-merchants/"><strong>Here’s today’s mega-round for an e-commerce rollup play:</strong></a> Tired of these yet? Investors aren’t. Berlin-based Razor recently announced a $125 million round at a valuation north of $1 billion to keep buying up e-commerce brands. It’s a big play around the world that has raised roughly eleventy-seven kajillion dollars. (That these investments are also a wager on Amazon not building products for all verticals in time is notable; perhaps they are effective wagers on antitrust legislation around the world?)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/matter-labs-scores-50m-from-a16z-to-bring-zero-knowledge-rollup-scaling-to-ethereum/"><strong>Matter Labs raises $50M to make Ethereum faster:</strong></a> The Ethereum blockchain is a neat thing. Many apps and services have been built atop it. And it’s pretty jammed with traffic, leading to high fees. Sometimes stupidly high fees. So, Matter Labs wants to remove some of that traffic to a side chain to make the whole experience faster. Why not just use a different chain? Well, because folks dig Ethereum, and where the developers go, so goes the progress of tech.</li>
<li>And, to close out our startup coverage, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/07/h2o-ai-raises-100m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-tools-to-make-ai-usable-by-any-kind-of-enterprise/"><strong>H20.ai raised $100 million at a $1.6 billion pre-money valuation</strong></a> to help companies get up and running with AI tech.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-11-08-PayPal-and-Amazon-to-Enable-Customers-to-Pay-with-Venmo-at-Checkout">PayPal today announced</a> that Amazon.com will be adding a Venmo option to checkout for users in the U.S., starting next year. The news arrived as the online payment giant announced solid third quarter results, with a 13% year-over-year revenue increase.</p>
<p>Beginning at some point in 2022, Amazon shoppers will be able to link their accounts to popular mobile payment services for purchases made through both Amazon.com and the company’s mobile shopping app.</p>
<p>“We understand our customers want options and flexibility in how they make purchases on Amazon,” Amazon’s Director of Global Payment Acceptance Ben Volk said in a statement. “We’re excited to team up with Venmo and give our customers the ability to pay by using their Venmo accounts, providing new ways to pay on Amazon.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230924" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The deal is no doubt mutually beneficial for both parties. As PayPal notes, it currently counts north of 80 million users in the U.S. alone. The company also cites a recent<a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/7rifqg28wcbd/4DC89wMGRB4C9HNF5rAbgi/640e409ce7e1dea74700ac4418913613/FINAL_VENMO_STUDY_Jan.pdf"> in-house &#8220;behavior study&#8221;</a> that notes, &#8220;65% of Venmo users said they increased their online purchasing behaviors amidst the pandemic and 47% are interested in paying with Venmo when checking out with merchants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The broader question is how widely the service will be utilized for Amazon users who have thus far had little problem relying on credit payment. Its current slate of payment options includes credit or debit cards, store cards, checking accounts, HSAs or FSAs or EBT cards. It bears mentioning, however, that PayPal is not currently natively supported as a payment option on the service, so the addition of Venmo is a nice win for the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Broadly speaking, </span>PayPal’s impending integration with Amazon could bring a much awaited crypto edge to the multinational e-commerce company. Maybe.</p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">announced in March that</a> U.S. consumers would be allowed to check out at millions of businesses using cryptocurrencies, while Venmo recently expanded its support for cryptocurrency through new features that allow users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/venmo-to-allow-credit-cardholders-to-automatically-buy-cryptocurrency-with-their-cash-back/">to buy cryptocurrency using cash-back from Venmo credit card purchases. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But that may be more of a vision than a reality at this point. While Amazon is <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/head-of-digital-currency-and-blockchain">hiring for a head of digital currency and blockchain technology</a>, it also recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-30/amazon-has-1-55-trillion-reasons-to-start-accepting-crypto">shut down rumors</a> about plans that it may start accepting crypto as payments. In a statement to TechCrunch, PayPal hinted that the upcoming partnership does not yet include crypto, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">owing Venmo&#8217;s currently limited integration with the currencies. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s announcement is solely about enabling Venmo customers in the U.S. to pay with Venmo at checkout. We look forward to continuing to grow this relationship but have nothing more to share at this time,” the company said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram earlier this year said it <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund?rc=ajsw4d">would explore</a> the idea of creator subscriptions and was later spotted developing a feature that would offer exclusive Stories that were only visible to a creator&#8217;s subscriptions. Now, it seems, the company is poised to launch creator subscriptions into broader testing. According to two third-party app intelligence services, Instagram has recently added in-app purchase options <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252">to its U.S. app</a> that are intended for &#8220;Instagram Subscriptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Sensor Tower</a> and <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a> track the mobile app ecosystem, which includes monitoring chart movements, app engagement and gathering app marketing intelligence data, among other things. But they also track the other less noticeable changes that apps tend to make &#8212; like rewriting their App Store descriptions, swapping out their screenshots, or — as in this case — adding new in-app purchases to their App Store listings.</p>
<p>These changes can help point to upcoming features, at times. For example, by tracking newly added in-app purchase options, App Store observers <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/02/premium-twitter-blue-subscription-launch-looks-imminent/">were able to spot</a> the upcoming launch of Twitter&#8217;s premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/">just ahead of</a> its arrival. Similarly, the addition of the new &#8220;Instagram Subscriptions&#8221; in-app purchase options likely signals the coming wider launch of Instagram&#8217;s subscription-based creator platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sensor Tower confirms the first &#8220;Instagram Subscriptions&#8221; in-app purchase was added to its U.S. App Store listing on November 1 at the price point of $4.99. The $0.99 in-app purchase was added a couple of days later, on November 3.</p>
<p>Before this, the firm says the only available in-app purchases were the various options for &#8220;Instagram Badges.&#8221; (Those are the <a href="https://business.instagram.com/creators/earn-money/badges">virtual items that fans can buy</a> to support their favorite creators during their livestreams at price points that range from $0.99 to $4.99.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2230774" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2230774" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2230774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="428" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg 744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-2.58.54-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2230774" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</em></p></div></p>
<p>Some Instagram users have spotted the additions as well &#8212; social media consultants <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnavarra/status/1456353211896508418">Matt Navarra</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thebkh/status/1456602910482120713">Brian Kofi Hollingsworth</a> in the U.K. both recently tweeted about the new listings for subscriptions, for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typically, Instagram tests new features with a smaller group of creators before making them publicly available. So if it&#8217;s launching Instagram Subscriptions to the U.S. in the near future, as these new in-app purchases suggest, you still may not immediately see the option among the creators you follow.</p>
<p>Instagram has been open about its plans to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund?rc=ajsw4d">expand</a> its set of creator tools to include things like subscriptions and even NFTs as it works to make its platform more creator-friendly. With subscriptions, the idea is that fans could pay a small, ongoing fee for exclusive access to content from their favorite creators.</p>
<p>The company this summer also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/">was spotted building</a> one potential feature for this coming service, &#8220;Exclusive Stories.&#8221; This feature would offer paying fans access to Stories that weren&#8217;t available to the general public and couldn&#8217;t be screenshot, but could be featured as &#8220;Highlights&#8221; that appeared once a member was subscribed, according to reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1410911179451650054">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who discovered the work in progress. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1430837084189822976">revealed</a> that subscribers would get a special member badge and would gain access to <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1448179572961423367">exclusive live videos</a>, based on internal developments he uncovered in the Instagram app.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Though Instagram hasn&#8217;t yet fully detailed its plans for subscriptions, Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CP9DDRyhJvj/">spoke</a> in general terms about the company&#8217;s monetization strategy during its Creator Week this June. He referenced three types of creator monetization tools for the platform. One was commerce, which included things like branded content, merchandise and affiliate marketing. Another was ad revenue share. And a third was payment products, including direct payments like tips and badges as well as &#8220;gated content or subscriptions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love those because those give creators a direct relationship with their fans — which I think is probably more sustainable and more predictable over the long run,&#8221; Mosseri said, referring to the company&#8217;s plans for payment products.</p>
<p>Instagram is not alone in competing for creator talent. In addition to a growing number of startups, crowdfunding platforms and competition from social rivals like TikTok, Snap, Pinterest and YouTube, Twitter in September <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">also launched</a> its own creator subscription platform called Super Follows.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the new in-app purchase options, Instagram declined to share more about its plans.</p>

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Rivian is expanding a fleet business that appeared to be exclusively tied to Amazon.</p>
<p>The company, in which Amazon holds a 20% stake, will start taking orders for its electric delivery vans in 2022, with plans to deliver them to customers by early 2023, according to a <a href="https://rivian.com/fleet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new section of Rivian&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>Rivian has been working to fulfill a contract to produce 100,000 electric vehicle delivery vans for Amazon through 2024. (Rivian has said it plans to deliver the first 10 of Amazon&#8217;s order by the end of this year.) That deal <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared exclusive</a>, according to information contained in the S-1 document announcing its plans to go public. However, this new information that shows Rivian is selling to other fleet customers prior to 2024 suggests that its contract with Amazon has some wiggle room.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230763" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Neither Amazon nor Rivian could be reached to clarify the terms of the exclusivity.</p>
<p>The new section of the site, which went live Friday and was tweeted out by a few Rivian employees, says customers will be able to use Rivian&#8217;s online fleet configurator to plan and place fleet orders beginning early next year. Deliveries wouldn&#8217;t begin until the following year.</p>
<p>The company said it will also sell fleet versions of its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/"> R1T electric pickup</a> and R1S electric SUV, which widens the customer base beyond the consumer adventurer that Rivian has been targeting. This move potentially puts Rivian in more direct competition with a variant of Ford&#8217;s all-electric pickup truck, which is being directly marketed to commercial customers.</p>
<p>The updated website outlines several other products related to the fleet business, including a management platform called FleetOS and charging infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rivian, and Amazon, stand to gain from casting a wider commercial net.</p>
<p>&#8220;The success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers,&#8221; reads Rivian&#8217;s S-1 filing. &#8220;If we are unable to do so, we will not be able to achieve profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, there are risks and unknowns to how many other customers Rivian, which is just starting production of its R1T, can even take on.</p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois has current capacity to produce up to 150,000 vehicles annually — about 65,000 of which would be for the R1 pickup and SUV and 85,000 for the commercial delivery vans called RCV.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean Rivian will hit that capacity overnight. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rivian has said in an amendment to its S-1 that based on its current production forecast, it expects to fill a preorder backlog of about 55,400 R1 vehicles by the end of 2023. </span></p>
<p>Rivian&#8217;s push into the fleet business comes just days before it makes its debut as a publicly traded company. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ev-startup-rivian-targets-6311-billion-valuation-ipo-2021-11-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rivian&#8217;s valuation at IPO is expected to be as high as $65 billion</a>, but some investors have had their doubts. A report from New Constructs, an investment research software company, released just a few days before Rivian updated its website, finds that Rivian&#8217;s stock is overvalued and urges investors not to buy when the company goes public this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rivian has yet to manufacture a meaningful number of vehicles and competes with well-capitalized electric vehicle upstarts as well as incumbents like General Motors (GM) and BMW, which both have decades of experience and multi-billion dollar plans to expand EV production,&#8221; the<a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/even-at-a-lowered-valuation-dont-buy-rivians-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> report reads</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, many investors are bullish on the startup and its future. This latest update could sway previously skeptical investors that Rivian has more flexibility and power than previously thought.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">From imbalanced creator economics and poor security, to centralized control and disgruntled communities — Web 2.0’s flaws have been on full display these past couple of months.</p>
<p>First, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen testified to Congress last month that the social media giant &#8220;chooses profits over safety.&#8221; Then, as if on cue, Facebook’s centralized services went down worldwide. The outage was so widespread that Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-outage-cause.html">couldn’t even access the servers itself</a>.</p>
<p>Then, a disgruntled anonymous hacker released a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">massive trove of internal data</a> from Twitch, the popular streaming service owned by Amazon. Alongside source code and payout information for top creators, the hacker urged improvements, calling the community a &#8220;disgusting toxic cesspool&#8221; in an attempt to &#8220;foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s never been more evident that the old guard has gotten many things wrong despite these platforms’ growth, reach and profitability. The centralized version of Web 2.0, which was all about network effects, massive scale and winner-takes-all economics, is no longer working for society.</p>
<p>It’s time to make a change. As Web 3.0 entrepreneurs building an open infrastructure that fosters a more collaborative, creative and user-centric internet, it’s on us to solve the fundamental flaws of the last generation of technology.</p>
<p>Here’s how Web 3.0 fixes some of the most glaring problems of our current digital economy.</p>
<h2>Poor security and data controls</h2>
<p>Twitch continues to be plagued with pranks, such as <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/game-streaming-twitch-gets-defaced-145130945.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACRO-MNOvuTTr9A4F7j-Zu29yOt2vzy-yEqd65Sk6c77gHepV47Z4UiVcmUb6el8bsP_F8w2-z2Unl4SX6pFfs4mho-5y9lCj5fh6DUfNCGXSS5vLgWioHZgFt6O4WuJ0AvQ46WSn0QPl_iBgkU_a4jVtzsg7s9Ssko2AOVDA7r5">this one</a>, which replaced backgrounds with photos of Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon. Apparently, these security issues were endemic, as former employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714160/twitch-hack-security-data-breach-problems">reported</a> poor security practices at the streaming giant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’ve all come to realize that any data we share with a centralized entity is at risk. Years of private information leaks from banks, retailers and social platforms show that you shouldn’t expect anything on the internet to remain truly private.</p>
<p>Since Web 3.0 is built on cryptographic primitives and often features open source code, anyone can contribute to the project by reviewing code. This boosts security for users and turns transparency into a competitive advantage. The gains are not simply privacy-based but actually result in user value being protected. Security researcher <a href="https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Samczsun">@samczsun</a> has identified potential exploits across protocols like 0x, Livepeer, Kyber, Nexus Mutual, Aragon, Curve and more, saving billions of dollars in potentially lost value.</p>
<p>Interoperable standards mean that ERC-721-based NFTs can trade and be viewed on a litany of different front-end applications, and ERC-20 tokens can access an entire ecosystem of competitive financial products competing for attention and value. This agency increases the stakes for platforms, which may trigger a user exodus after security breaches.</p>
<h2>Toxicity and platform accountability</h2>
<p>The Twitch hackers, despite acting illegally and immorally, were right in one respect: Streaming platforms are increasingly toxic, and large tech companies have struggled to respond in a way that meets the enormity of the problem. Yet, in the Web 2.0 world, streamers don&#8217;t have viable alternatives. They could move to YouTube or Facebook Live, but they would be trading one toxic, attention-economy platform for another.</p>
<p>These realities exist amidst an environment where creators have more power than ever before. Fans will follow their favorite creators to whichever platform they choose, which gives them tremendous leverage. To escape toxicity, creators need Web 3.0 tools to step outside the walled gardens and control their destiny via direct relationships with their communities.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 also re-balances power dynamics between users and platforms, putting users in control of their data. With interoperability and portability provided by data management platforms like <a href="http://spruceid.com">Spruce</a>, Web 3.0 platforms can make it easier for users to &#8220;vote with their feet&#8221; and move from one platform to another.</p>
<p>As companies like <a href="https://confluxnetwork.org/">Conflux</a> and <a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a> make it easier to scale across blockchains and standards, competitors can take swift action whenever an opportunity arises. For instance, when users discovered that NFT trading platform OpenSea may have been insider trading based on knowledge of which NFTs would be featured, alternative platforms such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/24/andre-cronjes-new-nft-marketplace-is-a-vampire-attack-suicide-pact/">Artion</a> emerged to rectify some of the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/24/andre-cronjes-new-nft-marketplace-is-a-vampire-attack-suicide-pact/">perceived grievances</a> of the NFT market. Such rapid reactions to market dynamics just don’t exist in the traditional Web 2.0 ecosystem, which relies on scale and closed access to suffocate new entrants.</p>
<p>However, Web 3.0 goes well beyond direct user relationships. These platforms are user owned and community-driven, so the incentives are aligned for the communities to moderate themselves. In the video streaming case, surely no community wants hate raids to force its valued members elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the Web 2.0 world, users need to wait for the platform to take action. In the Web 3.0 world, they can act via in-built governance and moderation mechanisms. On the Mirror blogging platform, users vote on who can write and publish each week. On the Web 3.0 index, listed projects have control over the addition and removal of subsequent projects, ensuring healthy growth of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Facebook whistleblower also revealed that Facebook has a two-tier justice system, which treats celebrities differently than everyday users. While a regular account may be penalized for violating the terms of service, one with many followers could get away with the same behavior.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 fixes this, too, with greater transparency and censorship resistance thanks to the blockchain’s immutability. Decisions are made in the open via tools like <a href="http://snapshot.org">Snapshot</a> and are driven by the broader community. Governance happens on-chain, for everyone to see. There are no backroom deals or two-tiered justice systems (unless voted on, of course). It’s all community-driven, so participants can simply move on if they disagree with the direction or level of transparency.</p>
<h2>Imbalanced creator economics</h2>
<p>The Twitch leak revealed a wide disparity between the economics of the top performers and the everyday creator. These dynamics align incentives between the platform and just a sliver of its creators. When a few creators make most of the money, the platform will push attention toward the most significant influencers.</p>
<p>The Web 3.0 paradigm addresses these misaligned incentives by democratizing access and dissolving silos between creators and fans. Web 3.0’s monetization mechanisms for creators, like NFTs, digital payments, tokens and crowdfunding level the playing field in a creator-friendly way. Artists using platforms like <a href="http://glass.xyz">glass.xyz</a> have found that they can monetize their content through NFTs accompanied by an engaging live stream far better than they can by simply selling via a Web 2.0 model.</p>
<p>In Web 3.0, users can also own their platforms, often coordinated through tokens. As they benefit directly through the growth of the platforms, they have the incentive to provide critical services like moderation, for example.</p>
<p>Users can also purchase fan tokens, further committing to their favorite creators and building a positive feedback loop that nurtures healthy fan communities built around a shared passion. Platforms like Rally, <a href="http://socios.com">Socios</a> (built on <a href="https://www.chiliz.com/en/">Chiliz</a>) and <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a> give creators the tools to directly monetize their reputation, authority and creativity without intermediaries. This further aligns incentives, as the creator <em>is </em>the platform. The creator can define the rules of engagement and do what needs to be done to maintain a healthy community, without interference by a disinterested third party.</p>
<h2>An internet upgrade is good for society</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, it’s damaging to have so much of society’s social fabric and economic structures reliant on infrastructure controlled by a few private companies. The damage is further compounded when those companies avoid accountability, offering promises to change that seem to fall by the wayside once attention fades.</p>
<p>But it’s less about doing away with Web 2.0 completely and more about giving society the internet upgrade it needs so badly. The Web 2.0 tools themselves have enormous positive impact, but there are tradeoffs, too: Web 2.0’s structural incentives have led to unaccountable and inflexible Big Tech monopolies. Web 3.0 evolves the internet to take the good from its predecessor and improve upon it through aligning economics and incentives amongst all users — and thus avoid the negative effects of ad-supported models.</p>
<p>When it comes down to culture and control, decentralized services have a significant advantage over centralized gatekeepers. Web 3.0 proposes an entirely new way to nurture community, empowering users with data portability and interoperability, and re-centering incentives that support self-moderating communities.</p>
<p>Haugen has it right: &#8220;It’s not about breaking up Facebook. The path forward is about transparency and governance.&#8221; We all deserve better, and the services, platforms and products that prioritize transparency and community governance will be the ones to thrive in the next era of the digital economy.</p>

		Roey Mechrez is the co-founder and CTO of <a href="https://beyondminds.ai/">BeyondMinds</a>, an Israeli startup that develops production-grade AI platforms for enterprises.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Most enterprises that implement AI solutions have learned a bitter lesson along the way: The path to organizationwide AI adoption is far from simple, intuitive or easy.</p>
<p>Arguably, the hardest thing about it is the lack of clear guidance. There’s no “how-to” handbook for enterprisewide AI adoption. The absence of a simple, best practice guide has deeply frustrated companies all over the world over for the last decade, resulting in billions of dollars (in both direct investment and in people hours) going down the drain.</p>
<p>The &#8220;AI guidebook&#8221; wasn’t written yet, because it simply doesn’t exist. These two letters, &#8220;AI,&#8221; can mean natural language processing or computer vision or time series analysis — each of which can be useful across a broad range of use cases. Combine this with the diversity of organizations that wish to deploy AI, each having their specific data, business needs and pain points, and you get an immensely diverse universe of AI solutions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Besides shortening the lab-to-field path, a production-centric approach enables a constantly scaling AI implementation with evergreen solutions that yield sustainable value.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So, instead of trying to come up with a universal guidebook for enterprise AI adoption, it’s probably more beneficial to define and tackle the critical elements in deploying these solutions.</p>
<h2>The three barriers for enterprisewide AI adoption</h2>
<p>AI’s potential business value is immense. It can be used to automate processes, streamline operations and improve product quality. In fact, the promise of AI stands apart from almost all other technology we’ve seen in the past. However, realizing this value requires overcoming three serious barriers: time to value, profitability (and costs) and scale.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the industry benchmark for the duration of an AI project, from initiation to production, is between 12 and 18 months, and requires employing a large team of researchers, ML engineers, software and data engineers, DevOps, QA, data scientists and product/project managers. Having this team onboard entails a huge TCO (total cost of ownership).</p>
<p>The obstacles don’t end there: Once the AI application is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance to keep the solution “on the rails” and handle the inevitable data drifts, which can easily throw off the trained model. Even once the maintenance costs are accounted for, all this investment covers a single AI application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse hosts and moderators will have a fresh tool in their kit today. The company is pushing a new feature live on both its iOS and Android apps that will let creators record an audio room so that anyone who misses the action live can check it out later. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/"> first announced</a> that the feature was on the way at the end of September.</p>
<p>With the feature, called Replay, public rooms can optionally be recorded as they happen and then saved to a club or user profile. Replays will also be downloadable so that anyone hosting a room can share it externally, beyond Clubhouse, &#8220;as a podcast, a clip on YouTube, an Instagram story, a TikTok video, or anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Replays are here and they&#39;re so much more than just a recording. Creators can download audio, and when you listen on Clubhouse, you&#39;ll see all the dynamics of the stage, PTRs, *and* hop from speaker to speaker.</p>
<p>live now on iOS &amp; Android <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f496.png" alt="💖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/zDtenNy60c">pic.twitter.com/zDtenNy60c</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1457798431175430149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Replay&#8217;s rollout will also support pinned links, a feature that Clubhouse previously introduced to let moderators feature a relevant link at the top of a room. Anyone listening to a recorded room will also be able to skip to the next speaker, listen to it at 1.5 or 2x speed, pause and make 30-second clips of the recording.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse creators can see who is listening to a room&#8217;s Replay after the live room ends, allowing them to connect with other users who didn&#8217;t listen to the experience in real time. Replays will pop up in Clubhouse&#8217;s existing discovery features, including search, beginning next week. The company is also introducing a &#8220;total room count&#8221; feature to give hosts more useful analytics on how many cumulative people listened to a given room.</p>

<p>The ability to replay audio rooms expands Clubhouse&#8217;s appeal considerably for people who don&#8217;t often catch live audio events, letting anyone use the app more like a podcast discovery engine if that&#8217;s what works for them. Creators will likely also be happy to have the option for their best content to have a chance to find a broader audience well after a live room wraps up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet-based sexual exploitation of minors in Kenya was found to be more rampant on</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than on any other site, according to the newly released </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupting Harm</span><a href="https://www.end-violence.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/DH%20Kenya%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; making the tech giant’s platform exceedingly unsafe for children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report by Interpol, UNICEF’s Office of Research-Innocenti and</span><a href="https://www.end-violence.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">End Violence against Children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, found that Facebook accounted for more than 90% of all the instances of online sexual exploitation and abuse of minors in the East African country last year. The report was informed by data from the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), interviews with minors, their parents, policing agencies and legal representatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube made up other platforms where child sex abuse imagery and videos were commonly “possessed, manufactured and distributed”. This report comes in the wake of</span><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/gethelp/2020-reports-by-esp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from NCMEC showing that globally, Facebook reported more than 20 million child-sex abuse images last year, 37 times more than those reported by Google, which ranked second. It also succeeds investigations showing that</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instagram seriously affects the mental health of teenage girls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; even as Meta</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram’s parent company,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mulled plans to launch the </span><a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently paused </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram Kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for minors under 13 years. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230376" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to get a comment from Meta on how it is working to rid its platform of the exploitation of minors were unsuccessful by the time of publishing this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, incidents of online child sexual abuse in Kenya also increased by six percentage points, to 14,434 occurrences, according to CyberTipline reports from the NCMEC. The CyberTipline is a centralized system for reporting incidents of sexual exploitation of minors. Kenya is the only country in East Africa that is connected directly to NCMEC&#8217;s reporting system through its Directorate of Criminal Investigation&#8217;s (DCI) Anti-Human Trafficking &amp; Child Protection Unit (AHTCPU) and Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation Database.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WhatsApp and Facebook or Facebook Messenger were the social media and instant messaging apps via which children were most commonly targeted. This is probably because Facebook and WhatsApp – the two most popular social media platforms in Kenya – are where children spend much of their time online,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mueni Mutisya, the AHTCPU in-charge, told TechCrunch that the authority receives about 22 cybertip reports daily. She said the country has experienced a spike in cases recorded since the start of the COVID pandemic, a situation that has also been fueled by the use of social sites.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Social media has enhanced sharing, production and distribution of online sexual exploitation and abuse (OCSEA). It has become much easier for predators to trick young people into sharing explicit images of themselves and falling prey to an overly sexualized culture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WhatsApp is the most popular social app in Kenya followed by Facebook and YouTube according to </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346967208_The_Kenyan_Social_Media_Landscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social media landscape report. To date,</span><a href="https://www.ca.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sector-Statistics-Report-Q4-2020-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than three quarters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Kenya’s population is connected to the internet, making sites like Facebook and WhatsApp easily accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what looks like a shift in how offenders’ prey on children, more than half of the victims interviewed for the report said the request for sexual materials were made online rather than offline &#8212; as one in five minors said they were approached in person. Minors aged 12 to 17 were most at risk of facing online sexual exploitation, according to the study which also reported that both girls and boys faced the same level of risk online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The offenders were found to be often known to the victims and used gifts or money (sexual extortion) to sway the minors to meet with them or to share imagery or videos. The offers were commonly done through “Facebook or Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and through YouTube”. A few cited Instagram and ByteDance’s platform TikTok. However, others were blackmailed or threatened into sharing or taking part in obscenities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further indicated that foreign law enforcement agencies found Kenya to be a source of commercial forms of livestreaming of child sexual abuse.</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> search engine trends showed that sex offenders in the country were in search of images and videos “depicting sexual activity with and between teenagers, with children and babies. Reports of security agencies identified Kenya as a hotspot for foreign traveling child-sex offenders too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online grooming of children for sexual purposes with the intent of manipulating them into generating and sharing abuse material, without any intention of meeting or abusing them in person, was also rife on social sites. The report said that this is one of the forms of OCSEA (together with livestreaming) that is not treated as a criminal offense in Kenya currently. Offenders can only be charged based on the Computer Misuse Act, which penalizes the perpetrators for exposing a child to sexualized content and the Sexual Offences Act that criminalizes child pornography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Kenya, the provision of the upcoming Children Bill 2021 addressing online grooming will only cover online grooming with the intent of meeting the child and may not therefore apply to situations where, for example, a child is asked to send sexual content to an offender via online platforms,” the report noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, which is currently going through legislative approval, was submitted in 2020. A fortnight ago, lawmakers invited the public to make recommendations for the new law &#8212; providing an opportunity for this gap to be plugged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hoped that a provision outlawing grooming where the sexual abuse occurs online could still be included,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owing to the cross-border nature of these crimes, Kenya works closely with international and local authorities to track the activities of the offenders and to make arrests. Kenya’s DCI AHTCPU also works with the country’s communications regulator to alert the public of the nature of these crimes and to encourage them to make reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of the Global nature of internet crimes, the DCI AHTCPU has partnered with other national and international strategic partners to help in the fight against OCSEA. We use Interpol to issue notices in case of cross border OCSEA cases,” said Mutisya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also work closely with the International Liaison Officer at the British High commission and the FBI legal attaché at the U.S. Embassy (in Kenya) as well as our international counterparts to seek justice for victims of online abuse and follow up on offenders. This is in addition to public outreach and school visits to educate, create awareness and sensitize,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupting Harm authors hope the findings made in the report will offer a road map for the adoption of strategies for dealing with the online sexual abuse of children. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AR technology company Niantic, best known for Pokémon GO, announced today that it will launch <a href="https://lightship.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lightship</a>, an AR Developer Kit (ARDK) that will make building augmented reality experiences more accessible. This free, openly available technology will help Niantic lay the foundation for its vision of the &#8220;real-world metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the program&#8217;s launch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLI-Ka_pmiw">livestream</a>, Niantic CEO John Hanke referenced his blog post where he called the metaverse a &#8220;<a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/real-world-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dystopian nightmare</a>.&#8221; But even as Facebook changes its name to Meta and advertises a future dominated by VR headsets, Niantic is imagining an alternative: a metaverse that brings people together in person, rather than in a virtual world.</p>
<p>Niantic&#8217;s existing games emphasize outdoor activity and meeting new people. Before making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/how-niantic-evolved-pokemon-go-for-the-year-no-one-could-go-anywhere/">pandemic-era adjustments</a> to play remotely, certain aspects of Pokémon GO &#8212; such as legendary raid battles &#8212; were only playable if enough players worked together simultaneously. Local Discord communities sprung up around the release of legendary raid battles in 2017, helping people coordinate real-world meet-ups to try to catch a Lugia or an Articuno together.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230663" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWHAr_TSDWk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">By releasing the Lightship ARDK, developers can use the foundation of games like Ingress, Pokémon GO, and Pikmin Bloom to create new projects. The company is also opening a $20 million Niantic Ventures fund, which will invest in companies that align with Niantic&#8217;s vision. At launch, Niantic has already partnered with brands like Coachella, Historic Royal Palaces, Universal Pictures, the PGA of America and more, which have used its ARDK. </span></p>
<p>The software development kit will help developers build experiences for iOS and Android by integrating with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/how-unity-built-a-gaming-engine-for-the-future/">Unity</a>, a software that is used to make 3D, 2D, VR and AR experiences. It offers Niantic&#8217;s top <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/lightshiplaunch/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three AR features</a> &#8212; real-time mapping, semantic segmentation and multiplayer capability &#8212; making tools that Niantic has developed for years available to any budding creative.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You just need a little bit of Unity experience, and it is actually easy to pick up,&#8221; said Amanda Whitt, a product manager at Niantic, in a Q&amp;A today.</p>
<p>The new Lightship ARDK is live today for any interested developers from the <a href="https://lightship.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Niantic Lightship website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=y4fgrhhe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> it won&#8217;t be closing down the App Store to developer submissions over the holidays, as it has in previous years. The policy change will be welcomed by developers who often fear that they&#8217;ll be blocked from being able to issue emergency bug fixes or other critical updates during one of the busiest seasons for apps. As customers unwrap new iPhones and other Apple devices given as gifts, they look for new apps to install and to redownload their favorites. Coupled with the extended downtime from work, consumers go in search of new apps and games to try during the final months of the year. This, in turn, drives App Store usage upwards in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Typically, Apple&#8217;s App Store Connect service would close down fully for the holiday season, meaning developers would have to rush to get in their most important app updates before the year-end shutdown. This year, however, Apple says it will continue to operate through the holidays, but hints toward reducing staffing levels by noting that reviews &#8220;may take longer to complete&#8221; from November 24 to 28 and from December 23 to 27.</p>
<p>The change comes at a time when Apple is under increased <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">regulatory</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">scrutiny</a> worldwide over its App Store business model, which requires developers to pay Apple a commission on their paid app downloads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. Apple may not want to give lawmakers and critics any further ammunition by closing down its App Store submission platform, which is powered by those developer fees, given that part of its argument is that it collects fees to serve its developer community.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, the company may have also simply realized the increased traffic during the holiday period makes for the worst time of the year to actually close up shop, and has finally addressed the problem.</p>
<p>Apple has not detailed to what extent it may be reducing staffing during the holiday break, if it&#8217;s leaning more on contractors during this period or explained any other aspects related to its internal business operations decisions that accompany this new change. The company was asked for comment, but has not responded at this time.</p>
