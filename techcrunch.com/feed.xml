					<description><![CDATA[BrainCheck has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world’s population ages, more is being learned about brain health as startups leverage technology to find a way to slow down cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.braincheck.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrainCheck</a>, a Houston- and Austin-based company developing cognitive healthcare software to aid physicians in detecting and managing this type of care, raised $10 million in Series B funding to expand its R&amp;D and go-to-market capabilities as it works on new digital therapeutics for Alzheimer’s and related dementias.</p>
<p>The round was led by Next Coast Ventures and S3 Ventures, which were joined by Nueterra Capital, Tensility Ventures and True Wealth Ventures. In addition, UPMC Enterprises and SelectQuote came on as strategic investors. The latest funding gives the company roughly $21 million in total funding raised to date, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/braincheck-raises-3-million-for-app-to-monitor-brain-health/">$3 million seed round</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/">$8 million in Series A funding</a> from 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227732" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This startup just raised $8 million to help busy doctors assess the cognitive health of 50 million seniors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/this-startup-just-raised-8-million-to-help-busy-doctors-assess-the-cognitive-health-of-50-million-seniors/embed/#?secret=kAZlWi7q4O" data-secret="kAZlWi7q4O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BrainCheck’s technology acts as a bridge between patients and the limited number of neurologists, about 12,000, in the U.S. Through 10- to 15-minute tests, performed in-person or remote (via a smartphone, tablet or computer), cognitive function can be detected early and more accurately.</p>
<p>Based on the test, patients are assigned a Cognitive Quotient (CQ) score, which is then used to produce a personalized cognitive care plan within minutes. Over 400 neurology, primary care and geriatrics practices use the technology currently, including Mount Sinai clinicians, which are using it to track and manage cognitive impairment resulting from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The pandemic has changed everything across the healthcare ecosystem, Yael Katz, PhD, co-founder and CEO of BrainCheck, told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company always had it in mind to raise another round two years after its Series A, but Katz said the global pandemic gave them pause to see how it would impact that decision. However, due to COVID shining a light on how people perceive healthcare and became more comfortable with remote care, they saw an opportunity to continue.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to continue to grow its team and invest in R&amp;D. It already has several new initiatives in the works to close the loop with the patient journey that will be brought to market soon, she added.</p>
<p>Over the last year, BrainCheck experienced year over year revenue growth increase three times, and Katz expects the same trajectory for next year. With the Series B, the goal remains the same as it was two years ago — double down on growth.</p>
<p>“From the shift to remote work and an increased prioritization of mental health, to investing in preventive medicine and supporting the aging population, all of these factors have come together to make the case that what we’re doing matters, and will continue to matter,” she said. “It’s never been more important for physicians to invest in a tool like BrainCheck and improve treatment across the patient journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for grocery delivery across Africa and the Middle East is worth over $50 billion. And Egypt, buoyed by a young and growing population, is a big market across both regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors are beginning to back their picks to capture a large chunk of the nascent but fast-growing sector, mirroring how things have played out in Europe and the U.S. this past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, <a href="https://www.breadfast.com/">Breadfast</a>, an online grocery delivery company that wants to become a regional leader in the sector has raised $26 million in Series A financing from an impressive group of investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include lead investors <a href="https://www.vostoknewventures.com/">Vostok New Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.endurecap.com/">Endure Capital</a> and participating investors JAM Fund (led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen), YC Continuity Fund, a large unnamed Saudi-based fund, Shorooq Partners, 4DX Ventures and logistics giant Flexport.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228096" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment is coming two years after Breadfast raised a $2 million pre-Series A round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the Egyptian on-demand delivery company has secured more than $30 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of Breadfast started in 2017 with bread and bakery when <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mostafaaminway">Mostafa Amin</a>, <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/muhammadhabib">Muhammad Habib</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/nofal">Abdallah Nofal</a> conceived the idea for an on-demand bakery service that delivers freshly made bread and pastries to customers. Now, the company has evolved into a full-on online grocery store with more than 2,500 SKUs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a call with TechCrunch, CEO Amin said the founders started with bread because it was the “most basic food unit in an Egyptian household</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They called it Breadfast Tomorrow and it was the company’s first model, delivering bread the next morning after customers made their orders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breadfast employed a mix of improved customer experience (from what customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from traditional players) and a native supply chain process to gain entry into the market, said Amin. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noted that the company was one of the early adopters of operating a native supply chain globally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before the arrival of rapid online grocery delivery companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/londons-jiffy-scoops-28m-for-speedy-grocery-delivery/">Jiffy</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink</a>. </span>In 2017 when Breadfast launched, the more prominent companies <span style="font-weight: 400;">either used marketplace or aggregator models: think Instacart and Postmates.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we started pitching to investors in 2017, they thought we were crazy and were like ‘We’re not going to invest in your company because you guys are doing an asset-heavy model. Why not do a marketplace model and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">go and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the bakery shops all over Cairo?” the CEO recounted.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228273" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228273" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?w=680" alt="Breadfast" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg 1773w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Breadfast-supplies.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228273" class="wp-caption-text">Breadfast supplies</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-forward four years and rapid on-demand delivery is one of the hottest startup sectors in the world. It has changed how people consume their daily essentials with companies using micro-fulfilment points and asset-heavy models to make quick deliveries under 10-30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Breadfast, the journey to reach the point where it could facilitate fast deliveries took some meticulous planning. After providing next-day delivery for bread, the company began to add more products (supermarket items such as coffee, dairy, meat, fruits, vegetables, personal hygiene products and some electronics, turning into an online supermarket).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then upon graduating from Y Combinator’s summer batch in 2019, Breadfast finally built its micro-fulfilment points and switched its delivery time to 60 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Breadfast oversees every part of its supply chain. The company owns some of the products it distributes (like bread and coffee), sources other goods from FMCGs such as Unilever, Pepsi and Coca-Cola while distributing them across its web of dark stores and operates last-mile delivery to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all it needs in place, Amin said the company is looking to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its delivery time to 20 minutes in a couple of months after the company upgrades its infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to build Gopuff for Africa and the Middle East in a nutshell,” he remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breadfast currently serves 170,000 households in Egypt with more than 2,500 supermarket items</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims to have more than a 65% customer retention rate month-on-month; revenue has also grown 4x from 2019 to 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin said the company is targeting to deliver 6 million orders in Egypt in the next 12 months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of what will drive that is using the investment to expand across eight cities in Egypt, scale its technology and grow the team</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a couple of months, the total number of dark stores Breadfast is going to operate will be between 40 and 50 in Egypt,” the chief executive continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amin, the more than 1,500-strong company (including riders) is also looking southward on the continent into sub-Saharan Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO said Breadfast might enter one of the region’s markets in the next two months; however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he didn’t mention which country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, though, the Egyptian company plans to go all out across Africa and the Middle East and is expecting to close a Series B round to that effect</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In two years, Amin projects that Breadfast will have almost 500 dark stores across both regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reference to the company’s plan to expand its on-demand grocery delivery across Africa and the Middle East, the investment manager at VNV Global, Björn von Sivers said, “Over the past few years, Breadfast fueled its growth by offering something that’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scarce in emerging markets; an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good customer experience and solid operational excellence. We see Breadfast becoming one of the most successful companies to come out of Africa and the Middle East.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Breadfast is the most-funded local company in the sector, both in Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amin knows competition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what markets such as the U.S. and Europe have will take place on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Already, local newcomers such as Appetito, GoodsMart, Rabbit are pulling their weight despite the presence of more established regional players like InstaShop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Egypt now is one of the hotspots for Africa and the Middle East, so everyone is taking a deep look into the market,” said the CEO. “But we’re very excited about the competition because, at the end of the day, it’s something good for the customers and also keeps all the companies trying to be innovative, competitive, and better every day.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The illumigyn Gynescope can be handled by a trained caregiver such as obstetrician-gynecologist, general practice, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant so that women of all individual sensitivities can be assessed in a safe space. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant solution automatically uploads and securely stores images to the cloud. It enables a doctor or specialist to view the images remotely and provides women access to their scans and doctors’ recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company said its high-quality resolution and magnification enhance details to enable more accurate smear tests than the traditional cervix exams. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“illumigyn is made available to medical professionals to serve women across the world better who do not have access to affordable, documented, and quality gynecological care,” said Ran Poliakine, founder of illumigyn, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Women can be examined in the comfort of their home by a midwife or a trusted general practitioner at a clinic as long as a specialist can review the exam and make the diagnosis, Poliakine said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">illumigyn’s global target market is the worldwide population of women above the age of 15, Poliakine added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Whether for religious, cultural, or historical reasons, women find cervical exams to be invasive and anxiety-inducing. Many women do not have access to obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) due to their living in rural areas or the OB GYNs shortage,” said Poliakine. In the United States, there is a ratio of 1 OB/GYN for nearly every 3,000 women over 15, Poliakine noted. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are proud to introduce to the world a cutting-edge innovation that will ensure that women all over the world will feel safe during gynecological exams and will have access to all of their medical information,” Ludomirski said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital healthcare continues to thrive globally following the effects of the pandemic last year, but venture capital inflows differ regionally with Africa lagging behind the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owever, investors have paid attention to a few innovative health tech startups, putting over $77 million across 56 deals last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt is one of the continent’s bright spots and an integral contributor to health tech market value in MENA, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://www.global.vc/perspectives/healthtech-in-egypt-a-growing-opportunity-for-vc-investments">reach up to $2 billion</a> by 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As companies such as Vezeeta, Chefaa and Yodawy thrive while offering telemedicine, diagnostics and pharmaceutical products, newer companies are looking to make names for themselves in entirely different segments. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of such is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bypa-ss.com/home">Bypa-ss</a>, a healthtech company dealing with health information exchange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from investors such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/magic-fund-raises-30m-to-scale-its-global-founders-backing-founders-fund/">Magic Fund</a>, Acuity Ventures, Launch Africa, Plug and Play, and other regional and foreign VCs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by chief executive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/andrew-saad-26480495"> Andrew Saad</a> in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his days as a medical student, Saad met an older woman who was ill and needed treatment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hospitals would administer drugs after running some tests and referencing the patient’s medical history. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, neither the hospital nor the woman had her medical history at that point. Because of that, they were conflicted on whether to give her </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">medicine or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saad told TechCrunch that he encountered similar situations with other patients as well. He went on to do some academic research </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerning</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> patients’ data and electronic health records, which formed the foundation for starting Bypa-ss.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228266" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228266" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228266" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?w=680" alt="Bypa-ss" width="680" height="445" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20A0C878-BB75-40E6-BC63-D8DAF253A7A0.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228266" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Saad (CEO Bypa-ss)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started in Shebin El Kom, Menofia, before scaling to five other cities across Egypt last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bypa-ss’ flagship product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://htag.health/en/home">HealthTag</a> and it services an ecosystem of hospitals, physicians and patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hospitals and physicians, HealthTag provides an integrated system for clinic management to track patients’ cases stored by Bypa-ss after collating medical records from different healthcare providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For users, HealthTag works as a mobile application and physical card. With the app and card, patients have ownership of their health records in one place and pay for their medical services online. They can receive prescriptions, labs scans and access a 70% discount from healthcare providers in Egypt when paying out of pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are aggregating and giving patients ownership of their health records while giving doctors and healthcare providers visibility on the patient’s full history, allowing people-centric digital health information exchange as first of its kind in Egypt and North Africa,” the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-seed round equips Bypa-ss with an arsenal to expand its network of more than 3,000 healthcare providers. And also its customer base, which Saad says has increased by 150% since the start of the year. Also, while Bypa-ss started 2021 with six employees, the company has grown fivefold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this pre-seed round of $1 million, Bypa-ss raised $150,000 in an angel round, bringing the company’s total investment to $1.15 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We are beyond excited to invest in Bypa-ss! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are confident that Andrew and his team will build the future of health information infrastructure in Egypt, and we are glad to be part of it,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Plug and Play said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bypa-ss will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its growth in Egypt, the CEO says. “With this investment coming in, we will be able to avail more features to our customers while maintaining our service level and growth momentum. Additionally, the company intends to use the funds to fuel expansion, perfect a high-end tech mobile app for patients to engulf and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the information exchange between the  stakeholders from different levels and sizes and capitalize on the company’s rapid growth.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egyptian grocery delivery startup <a href="https://www.appetito.com/">Appetito</a> has raised $2 million in pre-Series A funding, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which comes after the <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/04/19/egyptian-grocery-delivery-startup-appetito-raises-450k-seed-round/">company’s $450,000 seed round</a> in April, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. and MENA-focused venture capital firm <a href="https://www.jedarcapital.co/">Jedar Capital</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African VC Golden Palm Investments, DFS Lab, some angel investors and family offices also put money into the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito wants to tackle the inefficiencies in the FMCG supply chain in Egypt, CEO <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shehabmokhtar">Shehab Mokhtar</a> told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227831" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Egypt, home to more than 100 million people, has a retail <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/consumer-business/Deloitte-African-powers-of-retailing-Feb16.pdf">FMCG market size</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of about $50 billion and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to other African countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is highly fragmented</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inefficient</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When products move from suppliers to distributors to wholesalers to retailers before the end consumer, a lot of value is missing in the supply chain, especially for the consumers and suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the manufacturers and selling them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to them,” Mokhtar said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we can provide a convenient and affordable experience as well solving the inefficiencies in the supply chain of the retail industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito’s first line of products when launching in 2017 was groceries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company now offers non-food items such as personal care items, detergents and stationery products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mokhtar says Appetito sources all its products from top FMCG companies — Procter &amp; Gamble, Hankin, Reckitt, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Kellogg’s — strike deals with them and receives all their goods and products in its warehouses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goods are then shipped to the company’s dark stores, of which there are currently seven in Cairo, Egypt’s capital city</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there is one takeaway this past year from the rise of rapid on-demand grocery and delivery startups globally, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/">Gopuff</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a> (apart from their fundraising spree), it is how they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prioritize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speed and convenience over quality and affordability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appetito doesn’t want to take that direction; instead, it is keen on providing quality and affordable items to its users. In the words of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CEO, Appetito isn’t trying to become a copycat of those models because Egypt is a different market with a unique set of requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variation in models can also be seen in their delivery times. While GoPuff and the likes ensure that deliveries </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are completed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in less than 10-20 minutes, Appetito’s deliveries can take up to an hour, the next day or weekly, if scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to mix between affordability and convenience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we’re going to go only for the convenience, which is 10 or 15 minutes, that’s going to be at the expense of affordability,” Mokhtar said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And this is something we do not seek or even try to get scale in Egypt or the countries that we are trying to penetrate going forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive home how it prioritizes quality, Appetito has some private-label products under its name, a move that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">affords the company some exclusivity in the eyes of customers and delivers higher margins</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mokhtar sees it, alongside its newly launched meal kits option similar to Blue Apron’s model, as essential verticals for the company in the next couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about how Appetito makes money, Mokhtar says the company gets discounts from suppliers and runs promotions for FMCG companies on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any company wants to promote their brands; they can promote it through us because we have more than 100,000 downloads on our app on Google Store and Play Store. We have a wide consumer base and this is an opportunity for brands to market themselves on our platform,” the CEO remarked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about revenue, traction and plans, Mokhtar said the company, which has grown its revenue 6x since April, wants to expand its dark stores to 150 in the next three years. In a statement, the general partner at Jedar Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snessim">Sherif Nessim</a>, said the company’s orders grew 10x in the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Quick commerce and fast grocery delivery business model has been gaining grounds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and globally and I look forward to Appetito’s next phase as they expand to cover more areas in Egypt and start planning for regional growth,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Appetito expands, it will face competition from companies offering comparable services such as Rabbit, GoodsMart and Breadfast. These startups, representing a fast-growing Egyptian grocery and convenience delivery space,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collectively lead the way across Africa and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have raised more money than their counterparts in other countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should they keep raising money to accommodate the growing needs of consumers whose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> habits and shopping patterns have evolved since last year, Egypt will continue to dominate this space in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just the way Nigerian</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> startups have been the most sought after when it comes to fintech across the continent.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the days immediately following revelations that Kenya’s president Uhuru Kenyatta held<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/14/biden-meets-kenyatta-as-pandora-papers-leak-swirls-around-world-leaders"> secret wealth in offshore tax havens</a>, Odanga Madung noticed something odd on Twitter. In spite of the damning information <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/kenya-uhuru-kenyatta-family-offshore-wealth/">implicating Kenyatta in a hypocritical tax shelter scheme</a>, the prevailing conversation on Kenyan Twitter focused on defending the country’s beleaguered leader.</p>
<p>The Kenyan president&#8217;s concealed accounts were just one secret revealed in the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/">Pandora Papers</a>, a trove of nearly 12 million leaked files detailing the hidden fortunes of a number of global leaders, celebrities and billionaires all hoarding their wealth in places like Panama and the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://assets.mofoprod.net/network/documents/Pandora_Disinfo_Report_2__hcc.pdf">new research</a>, <a href="https://www.mozillapulse.org/profile/4178">Madung</a> and supporting researcher <a href="https://www.mozillapulse.org/profile/1427">Brian Obilo</a>, both Mozilla Tech and Society Fellows, reveal how online political propaganda filled the information vacuum in the country in the immediate wake of the Pandora Papers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is a very pervasive problem with Twitter&#8217;s platform here in Kenya,” Madung told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Using Twitter’s Firehose API, the researchers analyzed 8,331 tweets sent between October 3 and October 10 in the following the publication of the Pandora Papers. They discovered two hashtags, #offshoreaccountfacts and #phonyleaks — both seeking to undermine the legitimate revelations held in the leaked financial files — that vaulted into Kenya’s trending topics during the period.</p>
<p>“With the government and the president under pressure, due to soaring online outrage, a counternarrative operation was mounted — and found a strong ally in Twitter,” Madung wrote. “&#8230; As a result, a distorted perspective began to gain momentum — one where Kenyans appeared outraged not by the Pandora Paper’s damning findings, but by their implication that Uhuru Kenyatta is guilty of wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>From their analysis, those trends were far from organic. The researchers unearthed a number of accounts promoting related hashtags in repeated tweets and nothing else. The content specifically sought to exonerate Kenyatta, playing down revelations around his hidden wealth, arguing that the practice did not violate any laws and defending the offshore holdings as a savvy financial move.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By cross-referencing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-in-kenya-influencers-are-hired-to-spread-disinformation/">previous research</a>, Madung also found that some accounts boosting the inauthentic content were previously identified spreading adjacent pro-government propaganda in Kenya.</p>
<p>“Of key importance here was that many of these narratives were not explicitly lies,” Madung wrote. “This was political astroturfing that used a mix of propaganda and mal-information. It was designed to fabricate consensus — specifically, the consensus that most Kenyans support Uhuru Kenyatta and distrust the Pandora Papers.”</p>
<p>The campaign’s methods weren’t sophisticated, but they were organized and efficient. While the accounts could be easily identified through their repeated imagery, wording and frequent use of celebrity names, their degree of coordination did enable them to break through the noise to reach Twitter’s high visibility collection of trending topics.</p>
<p>While much of the astroturfing campaign relied on bending the truth, its organizers weren&#8217;t afraid to outright fabricate information either. In one example, an image depicts Nairobi-based economist Reginald Kadzutu defending Kenyatta in an interview with the BBC, but the interview never happened — the image is fake.</p>
<p>After Madung alerted the company to the coordinated campaigns, Twitter took action against more than 230 accounts for violating its platform manipulation and spam policies.</p>
<p>“Twitter’s uniquely open nature empowers research such as this,” a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch, noting that the company relies on a blend of AI and human moderators to detect efforts to manipulate conversation on the platform.</p>
<p>According to Madung, Kenya’s information ecosystem suffers from a well-established disinformation industry that continues to game Twitter. &#8220;Disinformation is an industry like any other — it&#8217;s about money, it’s about clear outcomes,” Madung told TechCrunch. “In many ways&#8230; [these campaigns] are very much like any normal agency.”</p>
<p>Within that industry, there’s a well established formula that gets results, amplifying content all the way to Twitter’s trending module. In an interview, one Twitter user the team spoke to explained that he had been paid to push various kinds of content onto Twitter’s trends for the past five years, including talking points from Kenyan political parties.</p>
<p>Through interviews, Madung also learned that some of those campaigns recruited and paid verified users to promote their messaging, lending them an extra boost under Twitter’s trending algorithm.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for the work can find it in WhatsApp groups recruiting for various political campaigns in the country. Those groups serve as command centers for the disinformation efforts, communicating messaging and coordinating timing to make those messages as potent as possible.</p>
<p>“As one of the influencers we spoke to put it, ‘Twitter is easy.’&#8221; Madung wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shares in Kakao Pay, the fintech unit of South Korea’s largest messaging app operator Kakao Corp, closed up 114% in its market debut on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/ant-financial-kakao-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ant Financial-backed company</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ended day one of trading at $163.3 (193,000 won), securing a market capitalization of $21.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay’s shares surged as high as $194.6 (230,000 won) on the KOSPI, up 155.6% from the issue price of $76.2 (90,000 won), the upper end of its IPO range. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay raised $1.3 billion (1.53 trillion won) at a $9.9 billion valuation, offering 17 million new shares in its initial public offering last week. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The gains for Kakao Bank came amid a crackdown on the country’s tech companies by South Korean regulators and politicians. In September, local lawmakers accused the country’s big tech companies, including Kakao Pay’s parent company Kakao Corp, of monopoly issues. The lawmakers also have expressed concerns regarding the growing power and valuation of tech companies in Korea. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay had to delay its listing twice this summer as the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) asked Kakao Pay to cut its share price and valuation. The company lowered about 6% of its targeted IPO to $1.3 billion from $1.63 billion in July. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay will use its IPO proceeds to speed up its global expansion, including in Southeast Asia, Europe and China, said CEO Alex Ryu at an online press conference last week. Southeast Asia and Middle East-based companies have been reaching out to the fintech company to seek strategic partnerships, Ryu mentioned. It will invest in AI, cloud, robo-advisors and blockchain-powered fintech companies in South Korea and overseas countries after the listing, Ryu added.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Kakao Pay is fundamentally a financial platform, and we seek to maintain symbiotic relationships of mutual growth with other financial institutions,” said Ryu. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company also plans to expand its offline payment infrastructure, operate a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) service, set up a digital non-life insurance subsidiary, and launch a mobile trading system (MTS).  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay, founded in 2014, claims a total of 36.5 million users, with monthly active users at 20 million. The company&#8217;s total transaction volume recorded $72.4 billion for twelve months as of June, while its revenue increased more than 102% over the past two years during the pandemic. Kakao Pay recorded $6.9 million (8.2 billion won) in EBITDA in the first half of 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Pay said one of its differentiators is creating synergies with its sister companies like Kakao messaging app, Kakao Bank, Kakao Mobility, and Kakao Games. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Mobility and Kako Entertainment are also set to go public in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kakao Corp’s digital lender subsidiary Kakao Bank, which raised $2.3 billion via IPO in August, had a market cap of $23.9 billion (28 trillion won) as of today. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s lending startup</span><a href="https://payhippo.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $3 million in a seed round, funding the company plans to use in sourcing the talent needed to optimize its technology as it ramps up effort to extend speedy credit to more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the West African country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by an array of angel investors, including Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, the co-founders of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African cross-border payments company</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chipper-cash-gets-2b-valuation-with-150m-extension-round-led-by-ftx/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipper Cash</span></a>;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Olugbenga Agboola of the San-Francisco based payments firm</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave</span></a>;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bolaji Balogun, the CEO of  investment banking firm Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, the founder of Metis Capital Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the largest amount Payhippo has raised to date after receiving $1 million in pre-seed funding earlier this year.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s co-founder and chief operations officer, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okotcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chioma Okotcha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said they are looking to hire more engineers and data scientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We capture our data from the loans we issue, and more talent in the team would allow us to optimize our technology to serve our customers better,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo says it disburses short-term loans in less than three hours, a record that remains unmatched by traditional banking institutions in the country, which often require borrowers to meet stringent </span><a href="https://nairametrics.com/2020/09/06/what-nigerian-banks-consider-before-granting-personal-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like regular account activity and the maintenance of minimum operating balances. A bank loan application also requires a visit to physical branches and extensive paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really focus on keeping this under three hours, and making sure that businesses can get the money they need when they need it. Ours is also a product that works for the SMEs in terms of a flexible repayment structure,” Okotcha said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMEs are the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/events/nigeria-sme-survey.html">force behind Nigeria’s economy</a> accounting for 96% of businesses and 84% of employment in the country. However, a lack of access to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> credit continues to hinder their growth and limit their contribution to the country’s GDP,</span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benneth-Eze/publication/334050044_Bank_Loans_and_Small_Medium_Enterprises'_SMES_Performance_in_Lagos_Nigeria_52_BANK_LOANS_AND_SMALL_MEDIUM_ENTERPRISES'_SMES_PERFORMANCE_IN_LAGOS_NIGERIA/links/5d145ffca6fdcc2462a922f7/Bank-Loans-and-Small-Medium-Enterprises-SMES-Performance-in-Lagos-Nigeria-52-BANK-LOANS-AND-SMALL-MEDIUM-ENTERPRISES-SMES-PERFORMANCE-IN-LAGOS-NIGERIA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about bank loans and SMEs in Nigeria, published by the Ilorin Journal of Human Resource Management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is this financing gap that Payhippo was designed to bridge since it was founded in August 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had seen that traditional banks and lenders wouldn&#8217;t loan small businesses mainly because there were no credit scores, or the collateral requirements were too high. We decided to come into the market and create an instant financing option, where we create a credit score that allows small businesses to get the liquidity they need to buy inventory for business continuity,” Okotcha </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told TechCrunch.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We use data from historical records that borrowers have built with us, but we also check their banking history to see the actual performance of their businesses,” said Okotcha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo applies its own credit scoring formula that uses different SME data to determine the value of loans to give out. The loans are disbursed through mobile phones. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average loan disbursed by Payhippo is about $1,300, with the minimum loan being about $200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which is part of the 2021 Y Combinator summer cohort, was founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okotcha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Okotcha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbijesse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach Bijesse,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chief executive officer, and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nnadi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uche Nnadi,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the chief technical officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo says it is banking on its fast turnaround time for loan applications to grow its customer base within Nigeria before venturing to other countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has so far disbursed about 5,000 loans since inception, valued at $1 million and with a repayment rate of 97%, earning them $64,000 in revenues. It added that the demand for credit is high, fueling its current 25% month-on-month growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the company targets to tap the credit needs of the nearly </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/03/08/deepening-access-to-capital-for-nigerian-msmes-during-a-pandemic/#:~:text=Over%2040%20million%20MSMEs%20exist,percent%20of%20the%20country's%20GDP." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40 million SMEs in Nigeria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow its business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that just 1% of the Nigerian market is about 40,000 businesses, and we want to be in a position where we disburse 40,000 loans in a day,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payhippo is one among many digital lenders in Nigeria offering short-term loans to SMEs. Others include Carbon and FairMoney. Last year, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FairMoney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disbursed a total loan volume of $93 million, representing a 128 percentage point increase from 2019. Carbon also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disclosed in an earlier interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it had hit 659,000 customers last year and had disbursed $63 million in loans, an increase of 9.1 percentage points from the 2019 financial year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice-first social media platform Clubhouse has gone back to school to learn itself a baker&#8217;s dozen worth of new languages. The company has announced in a press conference in India the addition of 13 new languages to its app, making it more accessible to people who want to see the platform available in their native languages. The app update bakes in localizations for the millions of people who don&#8217;t speak English, or who simply prefer a local-language alternative.</p>
<p>The 13 languages are French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil and Telugu. It&#8217;s an interesting line-up, which notably misses <a href="https://www.berlitz.com/en-uy/blog/most-spoken-languages-world">four of the top 10</a> most-spoken languages in the world (Chinese, Arabic, Bengali and Russian).</p>
<p>The languages will be shipped in the Android version of the app first, which makes sense. According to Statcounter, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/india">more than 96% of Indian mobile users are on Android</a>, with iOS lagging behind with a market share of around 3%. Its Android-first approach with this update is encouraging for an app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">took an embarrassingly long time to make an Android version available at all</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It has honestly amazed us that people in so many countries have managed to come together to do this on an app that only supports English,&#8221; a PR representative for Clubhouse mentioned in an email to TechCrunch earlier today. Well&#8230; quite.</p>
<p>In addition to the company&#8217;s newly discovered love for multiple languages, Clubhouse also announced a brand-new app icon, featuring musician, singer and songwriter <a href="https://anirudhdeshmukh.com/">Anirudh Deshmukh</a> (pictured above). Based in Mumbai, Anirudh joined Clubhouse at the start of the year and by the spring, had launched his now 72K-member club, Anirudh, where he hosts his nightly show <em>Late Night Jam</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.una-brands.com/">Una Brands</a>, the e-commerce aggregator focused on Asia-Pacific brands, announced today it has raised $15 million for its Series A. The full-equity round was co-led by White Star Capital and Alpha JWC, along with participation from returning investors and Ninjavan co-founder Alvin Teo.</p>
<p>This news comes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/">only five months after Una launched with a $40 million equity and debt seed round</a>. The startup has not disclosed the ratio of debt and equity (like many other e-commerce aggregators, Una uses debt funding to buy brands because it is non-dilutive). Co-founder and chief executive officer Kiren Tanna told TechCrunch the Series A is a priced round with a valuation more than five times Una’s last funding. Besides raising equity, Una also extended its debt facility size from Claret Capital.</p>
<p>“We have a very strong pipeline of brands across APAC that we are working on, and as we have done some deals already, we are seeing larger and larger brands that are approaching us,” said Tanna. The Series A was raised to accelerate the growth of its brand portfolio and Una’s operations, and it plans to raise further debt and equity, he added. The company now has 90 team members in seven offices across the Asia-Pacific: Singapore, Australia, India, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227622" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Una Brands launches with $40M to roll up brands on multiple Asia-Pacific e-commerce platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/embed/#?secret=4iemSMDuvY" data-secret="4iemSMDuvY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike many other e-commerce aggregators that focus on Amazon sellers, Una describes itself as “sector agnostic” because of the number of marketplaces used across APAC, including Tokopedia, Lazada, Shopee, Rakuten and eBay. Una looks for profitable brands that make between $1 million and $50 million in revenue per year. After acquisitions, Una grows brands by adding new distribution channels or expanding them into new countries.</p>
<p>Since launching, Una has bought more than 15 brands, and says the first ones it acquired have seen a 50% increase in sales and profits. The average EBITDA of its acquired brands are about 26%, putting the company on a path toward profitability, said Tanna.</p>
<p>He added that Una is building technology to help its brands scale. Since most aren’t on Amazon and many are seller-fulfilled, sometimes from their homes, Una transitions them to its professional warehouse fulfillment infrastructure. Tanna said the company is building its own technology to get transaction-level data from multiple channels to integrate it into its ERP system and track operational performance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Alpha JWC managing partner Jefrey Joe said, “Digitally native brands in APAC is a secular trend growing at 4x the rate of those in the West. We believe Una’s value proposition will resonate with brands across the region and further propel the growth of D2C in countries such as Indonesia.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After Nubank filed its F-1, Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">dissected the document</a> to learn more about the operations of one of the world&#8217;s largest startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;With over 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia,&#8221; the fintech company&#8217;s LTV/CAC ratio is central to its success, they found. Notably, as many as 90% of Nubank customers were acquired organically.</p>

<hr />
<p>Even with more competitors entering their markets, Nubank&#8217;s sticky customers generate a relatively high monthly average revenue.</p>
<p>As a direct result, its CAC payback periods are relatively short and its &#8220;losses do not appear even close to lethal,&#8221; report Natasha and Alex. &#8220;Indeed, they are more modest than we anticipated.&#8221;</p>
<p>More neobanks are waiting to get on deck and take their turn at bat in an IPO: PicPay, Chime and Monzo are likely the next few to enter the public markets, but these &#8220;fresh metrics could prove that neobanks are finally moving off their investing phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+. I hope you have a great week!</p>

<p>Some analysts predict that Netflix will spend as much as $19 billion on original and acquired content in 2025, but that figure omits a new frontier for the global media platform: gaming.</p>
<p>Netflix hired a lead for its gaming division in July and purchased Night School Studio in September, giving it access to more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world,&#8221; writes Sendbird CEO John S. Kim.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?&#8221;</p>

<p>As of today, TechCrunch is no longer available to readers inside China.</p>
<p>Citing an “increasingly challenging business and legal environment,&#8221; Yahoo (our parent company) became the latest global internet brand to exit the country. Microsoft recently decided to make LinkedIn unavailable there, and Epic Games decided to shut down its Fortnite servers in China last month.</p>
<p>The move is directly related to the November 1 start date of the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Given its strengths in areas like 5G, payments, e-commerce and related tech, China may have a strategic advantage when it comes to building the metaverse.</p>
<p>Announced in 2017, many of China&#8217;s AI initiatives are starting to bear fruit. Other trump cards, such as access to vast data sets for AI training and its robust manufacturing infrastructure, could tip the balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not hard to imagine — at least in the near term — that China’s version of the metaverse may be the richer experience for consumers and for those who sell to them,&#8221; says Catherine D. Henry, SVP Growth at Media.Monks.</p>

<p>Many entrepreneurs say fortune favors the brave, but French microbiologist Louis Pasteur got it right: luck favors the prepared mind.</p>
<p>Bold is good, but smart is better, especially when it comes to expanding the range of a B2C startup. Introducing yourself to customers (not to mention regulators) in a foreign market comes with a lot of known unknowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that through luck or ingenuity, your business has thrived in your home country with minimal marketing spend, but there is absolutely no guarantee this will happen abroad,&#8221; says Jim Mann, director of acquisitions at Thrasio, a consumer goods company.</p>

<p>After shareholders of Switchback II Corporation approved its merger with scooter company Bird this morning, its stock fell as much as 20%.</p>
<p>When the deal was announced in June, the company was expected to reach a valuation of $2.3 billion after the merger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s precisely what the company will be worth in light of Switchback II’s share price declines, but the number could be lower than the headline figure from early merger disclosures,&#8221; reports Alex Wilhelm.</p>

<p>In an overview that includes suggestions specifically for app developers, Ilia Kukharev, head of ASO at AppFollow, reviews several features that have been released and previews upcoming changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There hasn’t been this big of a change since iOS 11 was released over four years ago,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>Cloud storage company Backblaze tentatively priced its upcoming IPO between $15 and $17 per share, which values it at $684.3 million at the higher end of the price range.</p>
<p>That pricing makes it unique, writes Alex Wilhelm, because if smaller companies can go public at multiples similar to that of bigger firms, “one more startup excuse for avoiding IPOs goes poof.”</p>

<p>Buy now, pay later activity is exploding. According to one estimate, BNPL now accounts for $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>But the companies providing BNPL loans face risks, as outdated banking infrastructure leaves loan providers with little visibility into their end-customer&#8217;s ability to repay, writes Matt Bivons, CEO and co-founder of Canopy Servicing.</p>
<p>Switching to more modern loan servicing infrastructure can help providers minimize third-party and merchant risk, while being insured against &#8220;unfair practices and the ability to do business with the transparency customers need to borrow responsibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Udemy went public at $29 and raised a significant amount of capital, but the unicorn&#8217;s stock tumbled 6% the same day it debuted.</p>
<p>The sell-down indicates that Udemy may have to prove that its new focus on enterprise business will generate steady revenue growth, write Alex Wilhelm and Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>Until that happens, &#8220;the company’s valuation appears ready to hold fast in second gear.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The SaaS revolution began in 1999 when Marc Benioff founded Salesforce.com. Salesforce went public in 2004 after achieving $96 million in annual sales. Sixteen years later, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average after reporting revenues of $17.1 billion in fiscal 2020. SaaS is no longer a revolutionary concept. It’s been embraced as a foundational IT building block within companies of all sizes, industries and geographies.</p>
<p>SaaS sprawl is a natural consequence of the SaaS revolution. <a href="https://www.okta.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/Businesses-at-Work-2021.pdf">An analysis of Okta’s 2020 customer database</a> revealed that companies employing 2,000 or more individuals maintained an inventory of 175 SaaS apps on average. <a href="https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/">A similar survey conducted by Blissfully in 2019</a> indicated that firms employing more than 1,000 individuals used 288 SaaS apps on average. And finally, two-thirds of the companies included in Productiv’s <a href="https://productiv.com/blog/saas-statistics-that-every-it-manager-should-see/">2021 SaaS Management</a> survey employed 100 or more SaaS apps.</p>
<p>By any measure, SaaS apps have become a conspicuous and pervasive component of every company’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>The numbers quoted above fail to convey the true sprawl created by widespread SaaS adoption. SaaS definitions vary from one company to the next and may include a combination of personal productivity tools, business applications, data services, collaboration tools, security services, AI/ML modeling platforms, etc.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Users with the greatest exposure to IT resources should be subjected to the strongest authentication procedures upon initial login and additionally be required to respond to step-up or continuous authentication requests during extended work sessions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Multiple user accounts are established for each SaaS service. User identities are not limited to full-time employees but will inevitably include a wide variety of temporary employees, external contractors and service providers, and even robots or devices. Authorization policies are instituted to control the actions that users can perform within their accounts on specific IT assets. Consequently, the number of SaaS apps employed within an enterprise is just the tip of a bigger administrative iceberg created by the multiplicative sprawl of user identities, accounts and asset-specific policies.</p>
<p>This article reports the results of a study performed earlier this year to illustrate the multiple dimensions of SaaS sprawl. The data employed in this study was provided by <a href="https://www.authomize.com/">Authomize</a>, a security company that employs AI technology to profile relationships between user identities, IT assets and authorization policies across an enterprise. All of the data employed in this study was provided and handled on an anonymized basis.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The implications of SaaS sprawl were initially evaluated in over a dozen enterprises. Four were ultimately selected to illustrate the knock-on effects of SaaS adoption. The companies discussed in this article ranged in size from 700 to 3,000 paid employees (subsequently referred to as PEs, which includes both full-time and part-time employees on a company’s payroll).</p>
<p>These companies are based in the U.S. and Europe and were founded five to 25 years ago. They’ve experienced the SaaS revolution firsthand. Although they may not be purely cloud native firms, SaaS services play a dominant role in supporting their daily business operations. These companies operate in four distinctively different industries: oil and gas, edtech, financial services and enterprise software. Throughout the remainder of this article these four firms will be referred to as &#8220;the study companies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The knock-on effects of SaaS sprawl</h2>
<p>SaaS sprawl is commonly conceived to be a reference to the number of cloud-based SaaS services being employed by an enterprise. In reality, it is a much broader phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Service sprawl</h3>
<p>The number of unique SaaS services being accessed by the identity provider (IdP) databases within the study companies ranged from 310 to 994. This is significantly higher than the SaaS counts reported in the studies cited above and likely includes cloud-based services that would not be strictly classified as business applications. This study was based on the broadest possible definition of SaaS services, excluding only IaaS vendors.</p>
<p>The ratio of unique SaaS services to employees ranged from 1:1 in the smallest (700 PE) company to 1:3 in the largest (3,000 PE) company. However, these ratios were not correlated with company size. The 2,500 PE firm included in this study had a 1:8 ratio of services to employees.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 2, 2021. Today has been a fun one, namely because your humble TechCrunch was in the news. Not for reasons that we’re stoked about, but the larger China-world digital decoupling is real, and we got caught in it. Let’s talk about it. — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/as-yahoo-leaves-china-an-accelerating-stream-of-exits/">Yahoo leaves China:</a></strong> TechCrunch parent company Yahoo is leaving the Chinese market, pulling what was left of its services lineup from the market. TechCrunch, and its sister publication Engadget, are no longer accessible in the country. The news comes after Epic Games announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/epic-pulls-plug-on-fortnite-in-china/">end of its project to bring Fortnite to the Chinese market</a>, and Microsoft decided that it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">time for LinkedIn to leave the country</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">Bird is going public:</a> </strong>Well-known scooter unicorn Bird’s planned merger with a blank-check company has been approved and should consummate later this week. Public-market investors responded by selling stock in Bird’s SPAC partner, a somewhat embarrassing result. Precisely how much capital will be raised is not clear. For more on Bird’s changing economics, TechCrunch has your back.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-teams-gets-3d-animated-avatars-because-metaverse/">Microsoft goes metaverse:</a></strong> Amidst a wave of news items today — see our Big Tech section for more — Microsoft announced that its Teams product is heading to the metaverse. But unlike what <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Facebook</span> Meta has planned, Microsoft’s “Mesh for Teams” service will power “shared experiences in virtual reality, augmented reality and elsewhere, with Teams and its built-in productivity tools,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/step-aside-nfts-aqua-thinks-modern-investors-should-dive-into-private-equity/"><strong>Not into NFTs? How about PE?</strong></a> The acronym soup that is the modern finance world may have your head spinning. But don’t worry, startups are here to help. Aqua, for example, wants to help mom-and-pop investors gain exposure to private equity investments. Which, as you may know, tend to require more advanced net worths. As Natasha Mascarenhas points out, however, interest in alternative investing products has risen, which could provide a nice boost to what Aqua has on offer.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/backblazes-ipo-a-test-for-smaller-tech-concerns/"><strong>Backblaze sets IPO price range:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Amidst a wave of unicorn IPOs, the Backblaze public offering is notable for its modest size. That’s not a diss. It’s <em>good</em> to see smaller tech companies go public. If Backblaze trades well, it could help more companies pull the trigger. We hope.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lumigo-raises-29m-for-its-cloud-native-application-monitoring-platform/"><strong>App monitoring is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson from Lumigo’s $29 million Series A that TechCrunch wrote about today. The company’s product is also expanding from serverless platforms (DynamoDB, S3 and others) to now also include containers and virtual machines as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tim-draper-leads-6m-series-a-in-pee-testing-wellness-tracker-vivoo/"><strong>Tim Draper backs startup that wants your piss:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yep, no shit. Well-known investor Tim Draper has led a Series A round worth $6 million into Vivoo. TechCrunch writes that the “personalized nutrition and lifestyle startup sells subscription-based at-home urine test kits that work in conjunction with an app.” I for one do not need an app to tell me that I need to drink more water. I already know. But perhaps more of us could use a reminder.</li>
<li><strong>Firefox </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/firefoxs-updated-mobile-browser-promises-less-clutter-easier-access-to-recent-tasks/"><strong>updated its mobile browser to limit clutter</strong></a>, if you are the type of person who doesn’t merely use default mobile software.</li>
<li>To close out our startup news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/"><strong>Nuro has raised a $600 million round from Google and Tiger Global</strong></a> for its autonomous delivery vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Netflix’s move into gaming means for developers</h2>
<p>Some analysts predict that Netflix will spend as much as $19 billion on original and acquired content in 2025, but that figure leaves out a new frontier for the global media platform: gaming.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227926" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix hired a lead for its gaming division in July and purchased Night School Studio in September, giving it access to more developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes one wonder how Netflix’s plans will influence game developers and studios around the world,&#8221; says Sendbird CEO John S. Kim. &#8220;More importantly, how will developers respond to Netflix’s entry into the space?&#8221;</p>

<p>It’s a Microsoft day, so here’s the rest of our coverage from the company’s event:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-announces-new-tools-to-modernize-supply-chain-and-manufacturing/">Microsoft announces new tools to modernize supply chain and manufacturing</a></li>

<li>And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/microsoft-launches-google-wave/">Microsoft is building a product called Loop</a> that we feel shares more than a little heritage with Google’s long-dead, if yet-beloved Wave service. Frankly I cannot wait to play with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>From elsewhere in Big Tech-land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-are-coming-to-all-members-on-android-starting-this-week/"><strong>Netflix’s gaming ambitions continue:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Just as Spotify wants to be a serious player in podcasting, Netflix really does appear to think that games are part of its future. The company’s titles are coming to all Android-using members starting this week. Enjoy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/roblox-outage-helped-boost-games-like-among-us-and-minecraft-report-finds/"><strong>Roblox’s outage Not Good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not only did Roblox suffer a multiday outage, but the public gaming company’s downtime provided a boost to rival games. Because just as shooters shoot, gamers game, and if your platform goes down, Steam is just a few clicks away.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/zoom-is-piloting-ads-for-free-users/"><strong>Zoom is looking to cash in on the advertising boom</strong></a>, fueled in part by rising tech wealth, with an ad-supported version of its video chat service.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic&#8217;s augmented reality game about the boy who lived is about to die. The company that brought us Pokémon GO debuted Harry Potter: Wizards Unite two years ago, following a similar formula to their initial smash hit. But it turns out that popular franchise plus augmented reality game doesn&#8217;t always equal success.</p>
<p>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will officially become unplayable on January 31, 2022, but after December 6, the game will be removed from all app stores. Players won&#8217;t be able to make in-app purchases after December 6 either, but existing in-app purchases like Gold can be redeemed in the game until January 31. No refunds will be available &#8220;except where otherwise required by law,&#8221; the game wrote in <a href="https://www.harrypotterwizardsunite.com/en/">its announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the fantasy game posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/harry-potter-wizards-unite-reaches-400k-downloads-300k-in-consumer-spend-in-u-k-and-u-s/">decent numbers</a> after its initial release, it was clear from the get-go that it wasn&#8217;t reaching the same levels of success as Pokémon GO. Despite the pandemic, Pokémon GO had its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/after-community-backlash-pokemon-go-reinstates-a-covid-safety-and-accessibility-feature/">highest-earning year</a> in 2020, grossing over $1 billion, and the app is already earning even more than that this year, with $1.1 billion so far.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228050" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nV93RMvlcO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">The Niantic EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Niantic EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/embed/#?secret=nV93RMvlcO" data-secret="nV93RMvlcO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Not all games are meant to last forever,&#8221; Niantic <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/blog/wizardsunite-finale/?hl=en">wrote</a> in a blog post. &#8220;We accomplished [our goals] together, delivering a two-year narrative story arc that will soon complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Niantic&#8217;s Harry Potter game is far more narrative-driven than Pokémon Go, which only vaguely gestures at a plot. But the numbers behind these games speak to another potential reason behind the game&#8217;s closure.</p>
<p>According to app analytics firm <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite saw approximately 739,000 installs globally in the first 10 months of 2021, down 57% year over year from the same period in 2020, when it saw approximately 1.7 million installs. Similarly, in-app consumer spending was also down 57% so far this year compared to the same time period last year. To date, the game was downloaded an estimated 20.3 million times, generating $39.4 million from consumer spending. Meanwhile, Pokémon GO has generated over $1.1 billion in revenue so far this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sunsetting of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite comes after Niantic debuted a new game last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/pikmin-bloom-an-ar-mobile-game-is-niantics-next-collaboration-with-nintendo/">Pikmin Bloom</a>, developed in collaboration with Nintendo. Niantic is also working on <a href="https://transformersheavymetal.com/">Transformers: Heavy Metal</a>, a game that will let users battle giant robots in AR. In a blog post today, Niantic said it had nine games and apps in its development pipeline, including some that will soft launch next year. Niantic told TechCrunch that employees working on Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will be redirected to other projects.</p>
<p>Niantic CEO John Hanke noted in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/a-chat-with-niantic-ceo-john-hanke-on-the-launch-of-harry-potter-wizards-unite/">an interview</a> with TechCrunch upon the release of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite that the system the game used was built for Pokémon GO and Ingress.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we built things, particularly for Pokémon GO, we tried deliberately to make them part of a platform that could be re-used in other games,&#8221; Hanke told TechCrunch at the time. &#8220;The social features are a great example of that; those were built to support Pokémon GO, but were built to be easily adopted by other games.&#8221;</p>
<p>So perhaps the shutdown of Harry Potter: Wizards Unite reveals that while walking around and interacting with digital objects might work in the Pokémon universe, it can&#8217;t be applied seamlessly to any other franchise.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Most climate change misinformation comes from only a handful of sources. That’s according to a new <a href="https://f4d9b9d3-3d32-4f3a-afa6-49f8bf05279a.usrfiles.com/ugd/f4d9b9_16ccca9c25a04445a69dcd0298fd530d.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">report</a> from the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a>(CCDH). The organization found that ten publishers are responsible for 69 percent of all interactions with climate change denial content on Facebook. Included in the group, which the CCDH titled “The Toxic Ten,” are <em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Russia Today</em> and <em>Media Research Center</em>, which has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/how-fossil-fuel-industry-got-media-think-climate-change-was-debatable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">ties to the fossil fuel industry</a>.</p>
<p>The findings broadly mirror that of another report the CCDH published earlier in the year, which found that as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">73 percent of vaccine misinformation</a>on Facebook can be linked to only 12 individuals dubbed the “disinformation dozen.” That study has been widely cited by US lawmakers who have called on social media platforms to do more to address the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">urgent threat</a>” misinformation represents to public health.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As it did with the earlier disinformation dozen report, </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Meta</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Facebook’s parent company, disputed the methodology the CCDH used to compile its latest study. “The 700,000 interactions this report says were on climate denial represent 0.3 percent of the over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period,” a spokesperson for the company said. It also pointed to the recently announced expansion of features like the </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Climate Change Information Center</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> as evidence of its commitment to tackling misinformation on the topic.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/02/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-breitbart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said the organization looked at approximately 7,000 articles published between October 2020 and October 2021. He called the sample “robust” and said there was enough data “to derive representative finds of trends.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Additionally, the report examined the financial incentives involved in publishing climate change denial content. The CCDH estimates eight of the companies included in the Toxic Ten made $5.3 million in Google ad revenue over the last six months, with $1.7 million going to the search giant. &#8220;We recently <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">announced a new policy</a> that explicitly prohibits publishers and YouTube Creators from monetizing content that promotes climate change denial. This policy will go into effect on <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9336650?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">November 8</a> and our enforcement will be as targeted as removing ads from individual pages with violating content,&#8221; a spokesperson for Google told Engadget.</p>
<p>“When you put it all together, you’ve got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species,” Ahmed told <em>The Post</em>.</p>
<p>The timing of The Toxic Ten report comes as delegates from around the world meet at the UN’s COP26 climate summit in Scotland in what’s been described as “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-government-and-politics-china-climate-environment-and-nature-01317e4c6f5630f29024753209b48aef" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">the world’s last best chance</a>” to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Without dramatic reductions, the planet is currently on track for a “catastrophic” 2.7 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. With every additional degree of warming beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">1.5-degree target</a> put forward by the Paris Agreement, there’s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even more dramatic changes to the climate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft reported Tuesday its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/lyft-reaches-adjusted-profitability-milestone-despite-continuing-net-losses/">second consecutive quarter</a> of adjusted profitability as riders returned to the U.S. ride-hailing company&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing service, which competes with Uber in the ride-hailing business, reported revenues of $864.4 million in the third quarter, a 73% pop from the $499.7 million in the same year-ago period. Analysts expected revenue of $862.68, per Yahoo Finance data. If that Q3 revenue growth seems high, remember where the world — and ride-hailing companies — were this time last year. Lest you forget, last year Lyft and Uber were grappling with a business heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, business is getting back to normal-ish.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that revenue also grew 13% from the $765 million reported in the sequentially preceding quarter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lyft&#8217;s second-quarter results beat analyst expectations for earnings and revenue, pushing shares up 14% in after-market trading.</p>
<h2>Key numbers</h2>
<p>Two items stand out in the third-quarter results: p<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ositive adjusted EBITDA, one metric of profitability, and an increase in average revenue per rider. Let&#8217;s break it down. </span></p>
<p>Lyft reported a net loss of $71.5 million in the third quarter, a narrowing (meaning improvement) from the $459.5 million it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/lyft-sees-ride-revenues-recover-by-nearly-50-in-just-three-months/">reported in the same period last year</a>.</p>
<p>On an adjusted EBITDA basis, Lyft reported $67.3 million worth of profit. Adjusted EBITDA strips out a number of costs. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that this is the second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA for Lyft, a metric that it has long promised to push into positive territory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has shown it continues to improve on that metric. Its EBITDA was a positive $23.8 million in the second quarter. And, for comparison, in the same quarter a year ago, Lyft reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $239.7 million.</p>
<p>The tl;dr? Lyft&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA is improving.</p>
<p>Moving on to what drove (ahem) those revenues, let&#8217;s turn to the company&#8217;s active riders. Lyft reported 18.9 million riders in the third quarter, a 51% increase from the same period last year and 11% more than the second quarter. That third quarter number is actually lower than what was expected and it&#8217;s still off from the peak of 22.9 million riders in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>However, the average revenue per rider hit a record $45.63, a 14% increase year over year. That figure was spurred by a 6% sequential increase in ride frequency and. of course. prices for those rides.</p>
<p>Another interesting nugget is that new rider activations increased 47% year over year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space is vast, but the part where humans can operate productively and sustainably, especially when it comes to for-profit commercial enterprises, is actually relatively small — and increasingly crowded. We&#8217;re thrilled to have three experts at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=112221speaker&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> who are leading the charge in new initiatives that seek to make in-space operations even more attainable, cost-effective and safe to help us untangle some of the ways we can handle booming business in low Earth orbit (LEO).</p>
<p>LeoLabs CEO and co-founder Daniel Ceperley, Astroscale CEO and founder Nobu Okada, and Maxar&#8217;s GM of Robotics Lucy Condakchian will be at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=112221speaker&amp;display=">the event</a> for a discussion of on-orbit operations, and what it&#8217;s going to take to make LEO an effective and sustainable location for commercial space companies to cooperate, especially as the number of satellites surrounding Earth is set to explode in growth over the next few years.</p>
<p>Ceperley&#8217;s LeoLabs has established itself as the leading private company currently tracking low Earth objects, including debris from past launches, active satellites and more. LeoLabs is the leading provider of commercial collision warning services and real-time Space Domain Awareness (SDA) for low Earth orbit (LEO). These services are powered by LeoLabs’ worldwide network of radars and its cloud-based software system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227942" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Okada&#8217;s Astroscale was founded specifically to solve the issues around the growing thread of space debris. The startup is working on technologies for end-of-life management of satellites, removal of existing orbital debris and life extension programs for active satellites in order to make them useful beyond their originally scheduled service life.</p>
<p>Maxar is working on in-space robotic technologies designed to service satellites and other spacecraft on orbit, including NASA&#8217;s OSAM-1 program, which will refuel and reposition an active orbital satellite, and also on SPIDER, a program that will show how robots can perform on-orbit assembly of satellites, which will make it much easier and more affordable to launch future operational spacecraft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German medical device maker Ottobock today announced that it has entered into a deal to acquire Bay Area-based exoskeleton startup SuitX. The deal is one that makes sense for Ottobock, which builds its own exoskeletons, along with prosthetics and orthotics.</p>
<p>SuitX is a spinout from UC Berkeley’s Robotics and Human Engineering Lab, founded by mechanical engineering professor Homayoon Kazerooni. Prior to launching the company and serving as CEO in 2012, Kazerooni founded Ekso Bionics in 2005. That company went public back in 2014.</p>
<p>Both effectively operate in the same category, producing robotic exoskeletons designed for two distinct purposes: work assistance and healthcare. SuitX currently produces three work exoskeletons (back, shoulder and leg) and two health-related systems: the Phoenix for walking assistance and the ShieldX, which is designed to take the stress off of carrying heavy lead aprons. More recently, it has begun trials for a robotic knee brace called Boost Knee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“I feel fortunate that I am now put in a position to deliver our life-enhancing medical and industrial exoskeleton products globally,” Kazerooni said in a release tied to today’s announcement. “This step is a success not only for SuitX but also for the University of California, Berkeley, where entrepreneurial endeavors are fostered to their greatest extent for the good of humans worldwide. I&#8217;m looking forward to bringing our technologies to communities internationally with Ottobock for better quality of life.”</p>
<p>Ottobock produces its own exoskeletons, including the Paexo Shoulder, which is designed to support the neck, back and shoulders during overhead work. Exoskeletons have been a hot topic of late, including those from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/robotic-exoskeleton-maker-sarcos-announces-spac-plans/">Sarcos</a>, which went public via SPAC earlier this year.</p>
<p>This deal finds Ottobock acquiring 100% of SuitX’s shares. Financial details were not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With its latest acquisition Walmart is further investing in technology that will enable shopping via voice and chat. The retail giant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it&#8217;s acquiring &#8220;select technology assets&#8221; from a startup called <a href="https://www.botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botmock</a>, which had developed a set of tools for designing, prototyping, testing and deploying conversational applications across platforms.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Botmock got off the ground just when conversational experiences were starting to be developed. At this time, there was a lack of resources available for design teams. The company says most of its early customers were working directly within platforms like DialogFlow or IBM Watson, for example, which made it harder for them to rapidly test their ideas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, non-developers were using tools like Visio or LucidCharts to create their conversation flows. Botmock promised a better toolset that would allow teams to avoid blind spots in their design and build better overall conversational experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2227916" style="width: 1343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227916" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2227916 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg" alt="" width="1333" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=267,300 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=768,864 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=604,680 604w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1635806853735.jpeg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Botmock&#8217;s solution offers a drag-and-drop editor for designing a chatbot&#8217;s (or voice bot&#8217;s) conversations. The system automatically develops the code in the background as users design their conversation flows. It also helps to handle the specific complexities that were involved with the project &#8212; like platform-specific restrictions &#8212; while facilitating team collaboration.</p>
<p>Ahead of Walmart&#8217;s acquisition, the Botmock system worked with a company&#8217;s existing tools, like Atlassian JIRA, RASA, DialogFlow, Atlassian Confluence, Slack, Zapier, Alexa Skills Kit or IBM Watson. The conversations developed within Botmock could then be output to text-based or voice platforms, including Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Messenger, Microsoft Office Teams, Slack, Alexa or Google Assistant.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210914233413/https://botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a recent version of Botmock&#8217;s website</a>, its tools were being used by more than 50,000 people. It also touted customers across verticals, including large businesses like Nationwide, Accenture, Delta, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Oracle, Viasat, Mercury.ai, Liveperson, BlueRobot, BT, Avanade and Enbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Walmart, however, intends to use Botmock for what it calls &#8220;conversational commerce&#8221; &#8212; an area of increased investment in recent months.</p>
<p>The company in October <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the beta test of a &#8220;Walmart Text to Shop&#8221; experience that allows customers to text to make purchases. It follows years of investment in voice-based shopping, which culminated in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/walmart-partners-with-google-on-voice-enabled-grocery-shopping/">2019 partnership</a> with Google for voice-enabled grocery shopping. Today, Walmart offers voice-based shopping through both Google and Siri, and allows customers to check-in for contactless pickup using their voice.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, text-based shopping is only now getting warmed up, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/14/the-future-is-conversational-how-voice-and-text-are-transforming-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart says</a>.</p>
<p>With Botmock, the company says it will be able to build out natural voice and chat interfaces for both its customers and its associates &#8212; the latter through the internally used &#8220;Ask Sam&#8221; app which can answer questions or direct store staff to the location of products, among other things.</p>
<p>&#8220;With such a tool we can build natural voice and chat interfaces for our customers and associates faster and deploy them more rapidly,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accelerating-our-conversational-platform-through-botmocks-ainoa/">shared</a> Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart SVP of Core Retail Services &amp; Emerging Technology. &#8220;Building seamless interactions for voice or chat is a fairly difficult design problem that requires us to consider all possible conversational flows, which depend on customers’ unique situation and needs,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, when a customer is building their weekly grocery cart using their voice, they might say, &#8216;add milk to my cart.&#8217; The right action and the response to the customer depends on various factors, including if the customer has bought milk in the past, what their preferred type of milk is (e.g. 2% or non-fat, etc.), do they already have some type of milk in their cart, and if so, should we ask whether they want to change the quantity or let them know they already have it in their cart,&#8221; Ainoa noted.</p>
<p>In the past, these types of experiences could take months to develop and deploy, but Botmock&#8217;s technology will allow it to deploy in days, she added. This, in turn, will help to speed time to market and lower its costs.</p>
<p>Walmart did not detail the terms of the deal, noting only it was acquiring select technology assets.</p>
<p>According to Botmock&#8217;s <a href="https://www.botmock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, however, the team will also be joining Walmart and working to transition its existing customers by helping migrate their data. Its customers will have access to Botmock through December 1, 2021 and pro-rated refunds on subscriptions are being issued, the website said.</p>
