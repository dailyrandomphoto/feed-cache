										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the famous phrase goes, &#8216;software is eating the world&#8217; and now software is eating dentistry. Or, perhaps more accurately, the arena of orthodontics — the specialty of dentistry that deals with things like braces  — is slowly but surely being digitalized.</p>
<p>To whit, <a href="https://smile2impress.com/">Impress</a>, a Southern European player in direct-to-consumer orthodontics, has raised a $50 million Series A funding round led by CareCapital (a dental division of Hillhouse Capital in Asia), along with Nickleby capital, UNIQA Ventures, and investors including Michael Linse, Valentin Pitarque, Peter Schiff, Elliot Dornbusch, and others. All existing shareholders, such as TA Ventures and Bynd VC, also participated. </p>
<p>Impress is an homage to the direct-to-consumer startups in this area in the US such as SmileDirect&lt; and now plans to scale across Europe from its existing bases in Spain, Italy, Portugal, UK, and France.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in 2019 in Barcelona by orthodontist Dr. Khaled Kasem and serial entrepreneurs Diliara and Vladimir Lupenko.</p>
<p>Speaking from Barclenoa, Lupenko told me that the idea was to “combine the best orthodontic tradition with the most innovative technology in the sector.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bdpOQfTdL5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/27/tech-startups-want-to-go-inside-your-mouth/">Tech startups want to go inside your mouth</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech startups want to go inside your mouth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/27/tech-startups-want-to-go-inside-your-mouth/embed/#?secret=bdpOQfTdL5" data-secret="bdpOQfTdL5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As things stand, most of the time, consumers can usually only access cosmetic teeth alignment treatments or orthodontic medical treatments in conventional clinics. The new wave of clinics employs 3D scans and panoramic X-rays to check nerve and bone health.</p>
<p>Impress’s model is to offer these high-quality medical treatments directly to consumers, by developing its own chain of orthodontic clinics, which also put an emphasis on design and a ‘modern’ patient experience, it says.</p>
<p>As Diliara Lupenko says: “We didn’t copy what other companies in the space were doing and approached the market from a different angle from the get-go. We doubled down on the doctor-led digital model which brought us way better conversion rates and treatment quality even though on paper it looked complex in the beginning. It&#8217;s still very complex but we were able to crack it and scale exponentially.”</p>
<p>Impress now has 75 clinics in Spain, Italy, the UK, France, and Portugal which optimize costs and automate key parts of the value chain.</p>
<p>It now says it&#8217;s approaching €50m in annual run-rate and is projected to grow to €150m of revenue in 12 months. </p>
<p>Andreas Nemeth, managing partner of UNIQA Ventures GmbH commented: “Impress&#8217;s customer-centric focus, as well as its demonstrated ability to blitzscale, attracted us to the business. Vladimir and his team leverage technology to create a seamless customer journey for invisible orthodontics and optimized their cost structure in a unique way using software.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What drove the company's hugely unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses? Unit economics that were nearly comically destructive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scooter unicorn <a href="https://www.bird.co/">Bird Rides</a> is going public, <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/bird-to-go-public-on-nyse-to-further-mission-of-clean-mobility-access/">per an agreement</a> to merge with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. After rumors and reports circulated for months about an imminent deal, it has finally arrived.</p>
<p>First, a quick overview of the agreement and the players involved: Bird is merging with Switchback II at an implied valuation of $2.3 billion. Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company will lead the deal&#8217;s $106 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Apollo Investment Corp. and MidCap Financial Trust provided an additional $40 million in asset financing. (Disclosure: Apollo is buying TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company.)</p>
<p>Historically &#8212; and based on what we&#8217;re seeing in this fantastical filing &#8212; Bird proved to be a simply awful business. Its results from 2019 and 2020 describe a company with a huge cost structure and unprofitable revenue, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829730/000119312521158297/d469014dex994.htm">per filings</a>. After posting negative gross profit in both of the most recent full-year periods, Bird&#8217;s initial model appears to have been defeated by the market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What drove the company&#8217;s hugely unprofitable revenues and resulting net losses? Unit economics that were nearly comically destructive.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some of the numbers Bird shared in its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829730/000119312521158297/d469014dex993.htm">investor deck</a> show a business that is growing, in terms of users and geographic footprint. Bird is in 200 cities globally and reports more than 95 million rides to date, and 3 million new riders added during the pandemic. The investor deck also touts year-round positive economics during the COVID-19 era. That all looks positive. But looking into the line-item financials, a different story emerges.</p>
<p>The scooter shop managed to convert a $135.7 million gross loss in 2019 to a smaller gross deficit of $23.5 million in 2020, but it did not manage to shake up its upside-down economics during its full fiscal 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition with tech giants heats up, TikTok is rolling out a series of new features to help keep its short-form video app ahead of rivals. The company today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/green-screen-duet">announced</a> the launch of a new Green Screen Duet feature, which combines two of TikTok&#8217;s most popular editing tools to allow creators to use another video from TikTok as the background in their new video. It also confirmed the test of a new way to discover videos called &#8220;Topics.&#8221; These are dedicated interest-based feeds featuring the top, trending videos in a given category.</p>
<p>Green Screen Duet joins an existing set of Duet tools that let creators lay out two videos side-by-side. Today, Duet layouts include &#8220;Left &amp; Right,&#8221; &#8220;React,&#8221; and &#8220;Top &amp; Bottom.&#8221; Creators currently use Duets to sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user’s video, react to a video&#8217;s content, or even just watch a video from another, sometimes smaller, creator to raise awareness or call attention to its content.</p>
<p>Editing tools like Duet and Stitch are key to what makes TikTok not just a passive video viewing app but, rather, a new type of video-first social network. It&#8217;s also proven so popular, it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/instagram-officially-launches-remix-on-reels-a-tiktok-duets-like-feature/">since been adopted</a> by Facebook&#8217;s TikTok clone, Instagram Reels, where its known as Remix. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/snapchat-is-developing-its-own-take-on-tiktok-duets-with-a-new-remix-feature/"> Snapchat has been developing a Remix feature</a> of its own, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2151161" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151161" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2151161" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="285" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?resize=300,126 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?resize=768,322 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?resize=680,285 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/unnamed-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151161" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s new Green Screen Duet will now appear as another option alongside the existing layouts, offering users a way to more easily use another video in the background as they record their own video overlaid on top.</p>
<p>This sort of video experience is something TikTok creators already do in a variety of ways. For example, they may capture images or screen recordings, then use other editing tools to create a green screen effect like this. Or they may react to a video using a Stitch instead, as that can be easier. A built-in Green Screen Duet feature simply offers another way to record new videos that include existing videos.</p>
<p>When the feature is used, the Duetted video plays in the background over the new video being recorded. TikTok believes the launch will inspire new formats for creativity and expression, as a result.</p>
<p>TikTok has been busy upgrading its interface to improve recording and discovering new video content in its app in recent weeks, as Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat have tried to reproduce TikTok&#8217;s feature set in their own apps. For instance, TikTok just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">launched</a> interactive music features last month in an effort to get ahead.</p>
<p>In another leap, TikTok is also now testing a new Discover page in the app, where instead of only featuring the current trends, as before, it now organizes videos into categories.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2151165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9253.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>These categories represent the many areas of interest on TikTok, like gaming, beauty, dance, TV &amp; movies, sports, family, learning, and much more. When you tap into any given category, you&#8217;re taken to a feed that includes the community&#8217;s top, trending content. The feeds will be affected by factors like relevance, timeliness, and interest, and can help users find new content and creators outside of what their personalized For You page shows.</p>
<p>TikTok confirmed the test has been rolling out in the U.S. over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>The company also currently testing e-commerce shopping features, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook?sref=gni836kR">where some brands like Hype</a> and Walmart have been given a new &#8220;Shopping&#8221; tab on their TikTok profile where users can shop items, add to cart and then check out without leaving the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151168" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151168" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2151168" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9252-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151168" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>The integration is less elegant than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">Instagram&#8217;s Shops</a>, as there&#8217;s not a native, universal cart or integrated payment mechanism. Instead, users are visiting the retailer&#8217;s website directly.</p>
<p>The advances TikTok is making, however, has been paying off in terms of capturing a large Gen Z user base.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/more-us-gen-zers-now-use-tiktok-than-instagram">eMarketer</a>, more Gen Z users in the U.S. now use TikTok than Instagram, or 37.3 million monthly active users compared with 33.3 million users, respectively. And by 2023, the firm predicts TikTok will surpass Snapchat in terms of total U.S. users, as well.</p>
<p>But TikTok&#8217;s global ambitions are impacted not only by its ban in India but also the possibility that creators will find more monetization opportunities on established platforms.</p>
<p>Yesterday, for example, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">a $100 million fund for top YouTube Shorts creators</a>, and said it will soon testing ads on Shorts. That could help creators generate revenue from short-form content, while also converting casual viewers to channel subscribers where there are even more opportunities to monetize. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">Instagram</a> have also been wooing creators with cash, and ultimately, if creators find they can make more money elsewhere they could shift some of their attention away from TikTok, no matter how many creative new features it adds.</p>

<p><a href="https://planckdata.com/">Planck</a>, the AI-based data platform for commercial insurance underwriting, announced today it has raised a $20 million growth round. The funding came from 3L Capital and Greenfield Partners, along with returning investors Team8, Viola Fintech, Arbor Ventures and Eight Roads.</p>
<p>This brings the New York-based startup’s total raised to $48 million, including a $16 million Series B it announced in June 2020. Planck said it currently works with “dozens of commercial insurance companies in the U.S.,” including more than half of the top-30 insurers. It will use its new funding to build its U.S. team, expand into global markets, and add products for new business segments. Ernie Feirer has also joined Planck as its head of U.S. business. He previously held leadership roles at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, building data analytics solutions for property and casualty insurance carriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Planck’s database, which includes online images, text, videos, reviews and public records, allows it to give insurance providers real-time information that helps them determine premiums, process claims and give SMEs faster quotes. It covers more than 50 business segments, including restaurants, construction, retail and manufacturing, and can deliver analytics by simply entering a business’ name and address.</p>
<p>For example, if a healthcare business is seeking to buy or renew an insurance policy, Planck can give underwriters information such as the type of equipment used, what kind of drugs it prescribes and the type of surgeries it performs.</p>
<p>In a statement, 3L Capital principal Paige Thacher said, “Commercial carriers and brokers can no longer afford to rely upon traditional data sources as they prospect, assess risk and monitor a small business insured’s changing exposure during the policy life cycle. The new imperative is to leverage AI and machine learning technologies to dynamically harvest business insights from the insured’s digital footprint.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You can't dismiss no- and low-code services as a fountain of technical debt and lukewarm dev projects. If you do, the market is kinda saying that you're just elitist and obstinate.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As far as I can tell, low-code and no-code services are rapidly proving that prior models for products as broad as enterprise app creation and AI-powered data analytics were lackluster. My evidence? A mix of public- and private-market low- and no-code companies are putting up impressive results.</p>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcalkins/">Appian CEO Matt Calkins</a> after his enterprise app software company reported its <a href="https://investors.appian.com/news-releases/news-release-details/appian-announces-first-quarter-2021-financial-results">first-quarter performance</a> to discuss the low-code market and what he&#8217;s hearing in customer meetings. To round out our general thesis &#8212; and shore up our somewhat bratty headline &#8212; we&#8217;ve compiled a list of recent low-code and no-code venture capital rounds, of which there are many.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ll show, the pace at which venture capitalists are putting funds into companies that fall into our two categories is pretty damn rapid, which implies that they are doing well as a cohort. We can infer as much because it has become clear in recent quarters that while today&#8217;s private capital market is stupendous for <em>some</em> startups, it&#8217;s harder than you&#8217;d think for others.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The dividing factor? Signs of impressive present-day traction: Startups that are growing very fast have nearly unlimited access to capital, while those that are growing at merely fast rates are often finding it difficult to find a dance partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So if we can show that a huge, diverse set of no-code and low-code startups are raising oodles of capital, we can infer something relatively sturdy about market demand for their products. (It also doesn&#8217;t hurt that no-code automation service Zapier is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/zapier-buys-no-code-focused-makerpad-in-its-first-acquisition/">growing like a weed</a> and has reached IPO scale. In other news, Appian just dropped a <a href="https://investors.appian.com/news-releases/news-release-details/appian-unveils-latest-version-appian-low-code-automation">new version of its low-code automation platform</a>, for whatever that is worth.)</p>
<p>First Appian&#8217;s CEO, then a venture capital roundup. This should be fun.</p>
<h2>Public performance</h2>
<p>Briefly, Appian reported $88.9 million in Q1 2021 revenue, of which $39.1 million came from its cloud subscription business. The latter figure rose 38% in the quarter compared to the year-ago period. Appian also swung to adjusted EBITDA profit in the period. Investors responded by hammering the company&#8217;s stock in the wake of the results. From an April share-price range in the mid-$130s, Appian is now trading in the mid-$80s, though only some of those declines came post-earnings.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s stock price is only so important. Precisely how conservative any one public company&#8217;s guidance is for the current year and how those forecasts play with investor expectations during a period of generally excessive valuations is not our game. What does matter is what the company&#8217;s CEO had to say about the low-code space itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India&#8217;s cabinet on Wednesday approved Department of Heavy Industry&#8217;s proposal to provide incentives to boost domestic production of batteries with advanced energy storage, the latest in a series of efforts by New Delhi to make the world’s second largest internet market less reliant on other nations for various electronics goods and shrink its trade deficit.</p>
<p>The government’s new $2.46 billion plan, dubbed “National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage,” is aimed at cutting the nation’s import volume, said Prakash Javadekar, India’s Minister of Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises, in a news conference.</p>
<p>“All the demand of the ACCs is currently being met through imports in India. The National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery Storage will reduce import dependence,” the ministry <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1717938">said in a statement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The government, which said it will conduct a transparent competitive bidding process and disburse incentives over a course of five years, aims to achieve the manufacturing capacity of 50GWh of ACC and 5GWh of “Niche” ACC, it said.</p>
<p>The ministry said the firms that are granted the incentives will be expected to set up manufacturing facilities in India, conduct research and development to achieve high energy sensitive and cycles, invest around $6.1 billion in ACC battery storage manufacturing projects, and facilitate demand creation for battery storage in the country.</p>
<p>The initiative will also help bring down the &#8220;oil import bill and help in earning green energy credentials. Besides powering electric vehicles, it will also generate clean energy for domestic consumption,&#8221; said Manish Sharma, Chair FICCI Energy Storage Committee and CEO of Panasonic India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The manufacturing of ACCs will facilitate demand for EVs [Electric Vehicles], which are proven to be significantly less polluting. As India pursues an ambitious renewable energy agenda, the ACC program will be a key contributing factor to reduce India&#8217;s GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions which will be in line with India&#8217;s commitment to combat climate change,” the ministry said.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s announcement follows similar incentives New Delhi has approved in recent quarters. In February, India <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210224/p13#a210224p13">approved $1 billion plan</a> to boost local manufacturing and exports of laptops, tablets, and PCs. In October, India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/india-approves-apple-partners-and-samsung-for-143-billion-smartphone-manufacturing-plan/">offered smartphone manufacturers incentives of 4% to 6%</a> over five years on sales of some products made in India. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-semiconductor-exclusive-idUSKBN2BN12J">reported</a> earlier this year that India was also considering giving cash incentives of more than $1 billion to each firm that sets up chip fabrication unit in the country.</p>
<p>The nation, whose economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, has in recent years tried a combination of tariffs and perks to persuade companies to produce more in India, which also creates local jobs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months after it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Pal Gelsinger would be stepping down as CEO of VMware to take the top job at Intel, the virtualization giant has finally appointed a permanent successor. Raghu Raghuram &#8212; a longtime employee of the company &#8212; has been <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005362/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed the new CEO.</a> He will be taking on the new role on June 1. Until then, CFO Zane Rowe will continue in the role in the interim.</p>
<p>Raghuram has been with the company for 17 years in a variety of roles, most recently COO of products and cloud services. He&#8217;s also held positions at the company overseeing areas like datacenters and VMware&#8217;s server business. Putting a veteran in at the helm sends a clear message that VMware has picked someone clearly dedicated to the company and its culture. No drama here.</p>
<p>Indeed, the move is coming at a time when there is already a lot of other change underway and speaks to the company looking for stability and continuity to lead it through that. About a month ago, Dell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> long-anticipated news that it would be spinning out its stake in VMware in a deal that&#8217;s expected to bring Dell at least $9 billion &#8212; putting to an end a financial partnership that initially kicked off with an eye-watering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition of EMC in 2016</a>. That partnership will not end the strategic relationship, however, which is set to continue and now Raghuram will be in charge of building and leading.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>For that reason, you might look at this as a deal nodded through significantly by Dell.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to have Raghu step into the role of CEO at VMware. Throughout his career, he has led with integrity and conviction, playing an instrumental role in the success of VMware,” said Michael Dell, chairman of the VMware Board of Directors, in a statement. “Raghu is now in position to architect VMware’s future, helping customers and partners accelerate their digital businesses in this multi-cloud world.”</p>
<p>Raghuram has not only been the person overseeing some of VMware&#8217;s biggest divisions and newer areas like software-defined networking and cloud computing, but he&#8217;s had a central role in building and driving strategy for the company&#8217;s core virtualization business, been involved with M&amp;A and, as VMware points out, &#8220;key in driving partnerships with Dell Technologies,&#8221; among other partners.</p>
<p>“VMware is uniquely poised to lead the multi-cloud computing era with an end-to-end software platform spanning clouds, the data center and the edge, helping to accelerate our customers’ digital transformations,” said Raghuram in a statement. “I am honored, humbled and excited to have been chosen to lead this company to a new phase of growth. We have enormous opportunity, we have the right solutions, the right team, and we will continue to execute with focus, passion, and agility.”</p>
<p>The company also took the moment to update on guidance for its Q1 results, which will be coming out on May 27. Revenues are expected to come in at $2.994 billion, up 9.5% versus the same quarter a year ago. Subscription and SaaS and license revenue, meanwhile, is expected to be $1.387 billion, up 12.5%. GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be $1.01 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is expected to be $1.76 per diluted share, it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> announced this morning that it intends to acquire Indianapolis-based startup <a href="https://socio.events/">Socio</a>, which helps plan hybrid in-person and virtual events. The two companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>Socio provides a missing hybrid event management component for the company to add to its Webex platform. The goal appears to be to combine this with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cisco-acquires-slido-to-improve-qa-polls-and-engagement-in-webex-videoconferencing/">the recent purchase of Slido</a> and transform Webex from an application mostly for video meetings into a more comprehensive event platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of Cisco Webex’s vision to deliver inclusive, engaging and intelligent meeting and event experiences, the acquisition of Socio Labs complements Cisco’s recent acquisition of Slido, an industry-leading audience engagement tool, which together will create a comprehensive, cost-effective and easy-to-use event management solution [&#8230;],&#8221; the company explained in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The impact of the pandemic was not lost on Cisco, and it&#8217;s clear that as we can foresee going back to go back to live events, having the ability to combine it with a virtual experience means that you can open up your event to a much wider audience beyond those who can attend in person. That&#8217;s likely not something that&#8217;s going away, even after we get past COVID.</p>
<p>Jeetu Patel, SVP and GM for security and collaboration at Cisco says that the future of work is going to be hybrid, whether it&#8217;s for work meetings or larger events and Cisco is making this acquisition to expand the use cases for the Webex platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it’s a 1:1 call, a small team huddle, a group meeting or a large external event, we want to remove friction and help people engage with each other in an inclusive manner. Slido allows for every voice to be heard — even when you’re not talking. Socio allows for getting your voice heard by a large number of people,&#8221; Patel said.</p>

<p>And the company believes that Webex provides the platform to make it all happen. &#8220;It’s a really potent combination of technology to make human interactions more engaging, no matter the type of conversation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that it&#8217;s a smart move to take advantage of the changing events landscape and that this acquisition helps make Cisco a serious player in this space.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we get closer to a post-pandemic world, the need to create hybrid event experiences is going to quickly accelerate as people start venturing out to attend physical events. So having an event stack that combines local event support/participation with tools to integrate a broader virtual audience will be the future of event management,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>Socio was founded in 2016 and raised around $7 million in investment capital, according to Crunchbase data. It has a prestigious list of enterprise customers that includes Microsoft, Google, Jet Blue, Greenpeace, PepsiCo and Hyundai</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q4 of FY2021. When it does close, Socio&#8217;s 135 employees will be joining Cisco. The plan is to incorporate Socio&#8217;s tooling into the Webex platform while allowing it to continue as a stand-alone product, according to a Cisco spokesperson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fiveable.me/">Fiveable</a>, an online learning community for high school students, made its first-ever acquisition earlier this week: Hours, a virtual study platform built by a 16-year old. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Fiveable is a free, online learning community for high school students with the focus of helping them pass Advanced Placement (AP) exams. It livestreams 5-hour “cram shops” focused on a specific subject, creates study guides, and manages a Discord with thousands of students.</p>
<p>“Students have Discord servers, they have subreddits, they have group chats and it&#8217;s happening informally on some of these different platforms,” founder<a href="https://twitter.com/AmandaDoAmanda"> Amanda DoAmaral</a> said in March. “But we need a central place where social learning happens, where students get support, where they can find each other, where they can build towards their goals.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She estimates that half a million students use Fiveable on a monthly basis &#8211; and it’s just so fitting that her company’s first acquisition came from paying attention to those same users.</p>
<p>She noticed students within the Fiveable community were using Hours a few months ago to host group study sessions. Hours allows students to create study sessions where each person has a task list and shared timer and playlist, which she describes as “a multiplayer experience “ that can increase motivation and accountability. There’s also a single-player experience version where students can pick “focus mode” and remove chat and highlight task lists.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151084" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151084" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2151084" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png" alt="" width="1024" height="418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png 1883w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=768,313 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=680,277 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=1536,626 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hours-tasks.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151084" class="wp-caption-text">Task display via Hours.</p></div></p>
<p>Put simply, Fiveable will be able to expand its community feel from an active Discord to a study-specific tool. In its 6 months as a product, Hours has been used by more than 17,000 students from schools including Stanford University, MIT, NYU, and over 120 countries.</p>
<p>“The experience of studying in Discord text or audio chats is similar to the Hours multi-player mode, but there isn&#8217;t a way in Discord to keep track of tasks or see everyone&#8217;s progress,” she said. “Hours is a better experience because it allows more flexibility within the group version of a study session and has the ability for students to study solo,” she said.</p>
<p>The startup decided to buy the platform rather than try to build the technology itself for two reasons: students already love the product, and it was built by a “very impressive 16-year old,” Calix Huang.</p>
<p>Huang, a high school junior in the Bay Area with previous tech acquisitions and startups under his belt, founded Hours in October 2020 in response to the siloed experience of studying during a pandemic. As part of Fiveable&#8217;s acquisition, Huang will join its team as a Lead Product Manager to work on Hours part-time.</p>
<p>“Calix will be a senior next year, so he will come on part-time until he graduates. Then he&#8217;ll have big decisions like the rest of his peers about what he will do next, which includes an offer to come on full-time,” DoAmaral said. Employing young talent isn’t new for the startup: Over 118 paid students work on Fiveable staff right now across all teams, from social to product to content. Every student works 5-10 hours per week as a part-time job and Fiveable pays them $15-23 per hour.</p>
<p>Fiveable plans to keep Hours as a free service along with its guides, trivia, and Discord. The company makes money in two ways right now: $25 for a cram-pass or $5 for live events, such as a 5-hour review the night before an exam. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup has raised more than $3.5 million in known venture capital to date, from investors including Matchstick Ventures, Cream City Venture Capital, Spero Ventures, and most recently, Tennis legend Serena Williams. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another major name in mobile has confirmed that it won’t be exhibiting at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Chip giant Qualcomm is joining a list that already includes Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle, Ericsson and, most recently, Samsung and Lenovo.</p>
<p>In a statement offered to TechCrunch, a spokesperson for the company confirmed that it will be a taking a similar approach as many of the others, opting to “attend” virtually.</p>
<p>“While we appreciate the health and safety measures being put into place by the GSMA for MWC Barcelona, we have decided that it is in the best interest of our employees and customers for Qualcomm’s participation to be virtual this year,” the company said. “We look forward to engaging with the ecosystem through Cristiano Amon’s virtual keynote on June 28th and through our latest announcements and 5G demonstrations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Samsung withdraws from in-person MWC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/samsung-withdraws-from-in-person-mwc/embed/#?secret=ohlD5ZUCeb" data-secret="ohlD5ZUCeb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are shades of the lead up to last year’s event, which similarly found companies opting out, one by one. Ultimately the show’s governing body, the GSMA, pulled the plug. Of course, things are different in 2021. After nearly a year and a half, there are fewer unknowns and a vaccination roll out has begun in much of the world.</p>
<p>But there are still plenty of reasons for people and companies to take a cautious approach when it comes to flying around the world and attending an event in a potentially packed room. Ultimately, it&#8217;s probably not worth the perceived risk or discomfort of staff.</p>
<p>For these reasons and more, it’s hard to blame companies like Qualcomm. Given what we know, it seems unlikely that the organization would pull the plug entirely at this late stage, but things look increasingly dependent on the virtual aspect of the show’s hybrid approach. It also seems possible that the in-person trade will be forever changed after the events of the past two years.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The digital media industry often talks about how much influence, dominance and power entities like Google and Facebook have. Generally, the focus is on the vast troves of data and audience reach these companies tout. However, there’s more beneath the surface that strengthens the grip these companies have on both app developers and publishers alike.</p>
<p>In reality, software development kit (SDK) integrations are a critical component of why these monolith companies have such a prominent presence. For reference, an SDK is a set of software development tools, libraries, code samples, processes and guides that help developers create or enhance the apps they’re building.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Through a digital marketing lens, SDKs provide in-app analytics, insights on campaign testing, attribution information, location details, monetization capabilities and more.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Through a digital marketing lens, SDKs provide in-app analytics, insights on campaign testing, attribution information, location details, monetization capabilities and more. In the case of companies like Google and Facebook, their ability to provide these insights dovetails with their data and reach.</p>
<p>While that does deliver useful capabilities to developers and publishers alike, it also perpetuates the factors contributing to their perceived monopolistic status &#8212; and the detriments a lack of competition fosters.</p>
<p>Almost all (90%) ad-monetized Android apps have Google’s Admob SDK integrated, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1035623/leading-mobile-app-ad-network-sdks-android/">data from Statista showed</a>. Additionally, the Facebook Audience Network SDK is present in 19% of all global Android apps utilizing mobile ads. It’s worth noting that the large majority of alternative “leading” advertising SDKs outside these two players are used less than 13% of the time in Android apps.</p>
<p>As the app ecosystem rapidly expands beyond the borders of mobile, app developers and publishers would benefit immensely from identifying economical and secure ways of adopting more SDKs.</p>
<h2>The state of SDK adoption</h2>
<p>While there are many SDKs available in the market today, a few key factors contribute to Google and Facebook’s overall dominance. The most basic is around the respective organizations’ reach and industry notoriety. However, a larger component here is the lack of resources and time app developers have.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://atomizedhq.com/">Atomized</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to create a modern tool to help developers deploy infrastructure faster, announced the first step of its funding journey today, a $500,000 pre-seed round from Zing Capital, Y Combinator and several unnamed angels.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Nik Kotov says developers are spending over 20% of their time on setting up the necessary infrastructure just to run their applications, and he and his co-founder and CTO Eddie Herbert believed there had to be a better way, so like all good entrepreneurs, they built one.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Atomized our goal is to provide a platform that allows developers to deploy their applications really quickly. And the way it literally works is that we plug into where your code lives in GitHub, and also plug into your cloud provider, so currently it&#8217;s AWS, and we automatically spin up all the necessary infrastructure for you,&#8221; Kotov told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For now, that means spinning up containers, databases and static sites on AWS, but there are plans to expand that to work across multiple clouds over time as the company develops. &#8220;Our [goal] is actually to abstract away all those choices, all those nitty gritty details of Amazon, Azure and GCP and essentially provide you the easiest most straightforward solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kotov actually went through Y Combinator last summer as a solo founder, but he was trying to build a different product at that time dealing with compliance infrastructure. He ended up pivoting to this solution and joining forces with Herbert after Demo Day, but says the experience was well worth his time, even if he ended up with a different approach after all was said and done.</p>
<p>&#8220;YC opened up a huge door for me as someone who does not have any connections to Silicon Valley whatsoever. [&#8230;] Being an immigrant and not coming from a rich family [&#8230;] all of a sudden I got access to a bunch of people that I previously had no access to,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Both founders are immigrants, with Kotov hailing from Russia and Herbert from Estonia. They are both based in Charlotte, North Carolina, which Kotov says is a hidden gem for diverse technical talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Charlotte is kind of the best place to [build a startup] because in general Charlotte is very diverse, which a lot of people don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s 50% white and the rest are Black or Latino. It&#8217;s kind of awesome because we can hire the best people and then have diversity also built into into the company as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The product is in beta right now with 60 customers running on the platform. The plan is to use the money judiciously to begin to hire some more people. Right now in addition to the two founders, they have two full-time engineers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drue Kataoka’s art has made it to collections in 30 countries &#8212; and even the International Space Station. Now the artist, activist and<a href="https://nextshark.com/drue-kataoka-clubhouse-app-icon/"> current face of Clubhouse’s app icon</a> is releasing her first NFT to support Asian American causes. The auction will begin on digital art marketplace <a href="https://niftygateway.com/">Nifty Gateway</a> at 1:30 p.m. EST, May 13, along <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/PYlRYkW3">with a launch party on Clubhouse</a>, and run for 24 hours. Nifty Gateway is waiving its auction fees, and all proceeds will go to the Catalyst Fund for Justice (CFJ), the grant-making arm of <a href="https://standwithasianamericans.com">Stand with Asian Americans</a>, a coalition of business leaders and activists partnered with the <a href="https://asianpacificfund.org/">Asian Pacific Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Kataoka is known for commissioned artworks like mirror-polished steel sculptures and art that uses virtual reality, EEG and mobile technology. One of her pieces, “Up!,” created with Sumi-e ink on mounted rice paper, was <a href="https://www.drue.net/art-space-exhibit">part of the first zero-gravity art exhibit at the International Space Station</a>. She is also an activist and organizer, and has raised a total of almost $300,000 through Clubhouse for<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/stopasianhate"> #StopAsianHate</a>, <a href="https://hopefoundationusa.com/covid-19-emergency-response">#Clubhouse4India</a> and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/martin-luther-king-center-fundraiser">#24HoursofLove</a> for <a href="https://thekingcenter.org">The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change</a>, the nonprofit started in 1968 by Coretta Scott King.</p>
<p>Called “In the Club: #StopAsianHate,” Kataoka’s NFT was inspired by activist communities on Clubhouse, where Kataoka leads the Art Club, one of the app’s biggest art groups with 102,000 followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’ve been passionate about leveraging Clubhouse as a medium for social change,” Kataoka said. For this project, “we want to fire on all cylinders, not just only philanthropy or not just only art, but both of those at the highest level to really serve a goal and create the most impact that we possibly can for the Asian American community.”</p>

<p>Kataoka is the founder and chief executive officer of <a href="https://www.drue.net/">Drue Kataoka Studios</a>, which creates pieces that bring together influences from Zen Buddhism, her training in Sumi-e ink painting and Silicon Valley. Instead of art school, Kataoka went to Stanford University because she wanted to learn about tech, like virtual and augmented reality, how to code and business fundamentals.</p>
<p>“My mantra for the past 20 years has been that art is technology and technology is art,” she told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For her “genesis drop,” or first NFT release, Kataoka wanted “to be very thoughtful about the first project I did, and I’m excited that it will be this one. I’ve been watching the space very carefully and I am very bullish on crypto and NFTs. I know there’s a lot of volatility and many things that will fall away and not stand the test of time, but ultimately as a mechanism for creativity and so many important things, this will be the way of the future.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Eric Kim, co-chair of Stand with Asian Americans&#8217; Catalyst Fund for Justice, said “the fact that Drue is willing to donate 100% of the proceeds to go towards the AAPI community is really, really meaningful. I think it’s also a beautiful expression of blockchain technology.”</p>
<p>Kim, who is also co-founder and managing partner of venture firm Goodwater Capital, added, “I’ve been searching for the best product market fit of the blockchain and through this project &#8212; digital art being captured, codified, securitized in non-fungible tokens, and then being utilized for the community, launched on Clubhouse even, and auctioned through a platform like Nifty Gateway &#8212; it is one of the best applications of blockchain I’ve ever seen and an amazing coordination of multiple consumer tech platforms.”</p>
<p>About one-minute long, “In the Club: #StopAsianHate” features an image of a Clubhouse room superimposed over a gold-colored background. User photos have been removed and a series of shifting shapes, sculpted by Kataoka in virtual reality, can be seen through the remaining spaces. At the same time, chanting from a recent street protest is played, overlaid on a recording of Kataoka’s own heartbeat. At the end, the sounds fade into wind, symbolizing air, or qi, chi, ki or prana, a vital force in many Asian cultures.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/beqxlfYyk1Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>“It’s a tribute to all of the activists and community members who have really put a lot of belief and faith into this movement and who were speaking out about these issues very early on. One of the things that I feel is disturbing is that mainstream media has either turned a blind eye or sugarcoated a lot of the hate crimes going on in our community and a lot of big issues for the Asian American community,” said Kataoka. “With Clubhouse, it’s completely unfiltered and uncensored, and very early on, last year in 2020, I was hosting and listening to those conversations. We were having serious conversations that really started to take off and gather momentum synergistically with Twitter, that some of the mainstream news outlets were not interested in at the time.”</p>
<p>Kim said the Catalyst Fund for Justice will use a data-driven approach to finding grant recipients. Initially, it will focus on reducing hate crimes and supporting victims; workplace discrimination; the lack of Asian American representation in politics; and supporting underfunded nonprofits. Some goals include introducing more Asian American history into educational curriculums, understanding how workplace bias prevents more Asian Americans from being promoted into leadership roles and increasing the number of Asian Americans in civic organizations.</p>

<p>After the Atlanta shootings, Kim began working with venture capitalists, including his co-founder at Goodwater Chi-Hua Chien, GGV managing partner Hans Tung and Lightspeed Venture partner Jeremy Liew, raising $5 million from a collective of leading VCs to donate to AAPI organizations.</p>
<p>“Coming out of that heightened awareness and activation, business leaders, entrepreneurs and investors started thinking, how can we do this more systematically and apply our professional skill sets to this movement,” Kim said.</p>
<p>Stand with Asian Americans was the result of these types of discussions, and at the end of March, the coalition <a href="https://standwithasianamericans.com/static/pledge.pdf">outlined its mission in a full-page Wall Street Journal ad</a> co-signed by business and political leaders including Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Wang, Stitch Fix co-founder and CEO Katrina Lake and former governor of Washington and United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke. Stand with Asian Americans is partnered with the Asian Pacific Fund, one of the Bay Area’s most tenured AAPI nonprofits, and launched the Catalyst Fund for Justice as its grant-making arm to harness the power of what is now nearly 8,000 signatories and over 100 dedicated volunteers.</p>
<p>In a statement, Asian Pacific Fund president and executive director Audrey Yamamoto said, “Drue Kataoka’s generous donation of her Genesis NFT drop means the world to the AAPI community as we continue to live in fear of violence and hate every time we leave our homes. The Catalyst Fund for Justice will tap into new sources of funding and use a data-driven approach to make grants that truly move the needle on addressing the greatest injustices faced by our AAPI community.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Pomelo, a startup building a fintech-as-a-service platform for Latin America, has raised $9 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Buenos Aires-based startup’s new infrastructure aims to allow fintechs and embedded finance players to launch virtual accounts and issue prepaid and credit cards via “compliant” onboarding processes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital payments all over the world, and Latin America is no exception. While the majority of transactions are still done in cash, there are still over a billion cards in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Cards have an estimated payments volume of $900 billion per year, and yet 95% of these transactions are being processed by local incumbents, asserts Pomelo. This is a problem the company&#8217;s founders experienced firsthand in previous roles, and are eager to solve by creating a new payments infrastructure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We know from previous experiences&#8230;that building a fintech, and particularly issuing cards, in Latin America is a real nightmare,” said Pomelo co-founder and CEO Gaston Irigoyen. “It takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months to launch a simple prepaid card, and unfortunately companies have to go through the painful experience of repeating the process in every market where they operate.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pomelo’s goal is to solve the problem by creating a new generation of financial services infrastructure that allows companies to build a fintech business and launch cards “much faster” throughout Latin America. For now, the three-month-old company is in its infancy &#8212; the pre-product phase, which makes it even more notable that the company managed to raise such a large seed round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clocktower Technology Ventures makes $25M bet on Latin American fintechs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/clocktower-technology-ventures-makes-25m-bet-on-latin-american-fintechs/embed/#?secret=oUsTCR5KYD" data-secret="oUsTCR5KYD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">This round caught our eye for a few other reasons. For one, the three co-founders of the Buenos Aires-based startup were former executives at Mastercard, Google LatAm, Mercado Pago and Naranja X. CEO Irigoyen was an early employee at Google LatAm. He is also a third-time founder with two exits (one to TripAdvisor) and former CEO of Naranja X, Argentina&#8217;s largest neobank, with millions of customers. Juan Fantoni was the former director of fintech at Mastercard, where he signed issuing deals with a number of large companies. And Hernan Corral was the CPO of Naranja X and previously head of digital accounts &amp; cards at Mercado Pago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next, the caliber of Pomelo’s investors. U.S.-based Index Ventures and Brazil’s monashees co-led the funding round, which also included participation from QED’s Fontes, Max Levchin&#8217;s SciFi, Latitud, Biz Stone&#8217;s Future Positive, 20VC, Addition, FJ Labs and a16z’s Angela Strange, as well as the founders of Marqeta, Rappi, Auth0, Kavak, Loft and RecargaPay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re looking for comparisons to U.S.-based fintechs, Irigoyen said it’s got a little bit of Galileo, Marqeta and Stripe in what it’s building out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Caio Bolognesi, partner at monashees, said his firm has been very bullish on the financial infrastructure space as a whole. They were drawn to Pomelo in part because its founders had been senior tech executives at leading fintech companies in the region and because many of its portfolio companies had already manifested the need for a better solution in this space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Index Ventures’ Mark Fiorentino agrees that the company’s founder-market fit was crucial in his firm’s decision to invest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They have the DNA of the most well-known payments companies within the LATAM fintech ecosystem&#8230; and have lived through the pain points and keyed in on this opportunity through firsthand experience,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In general, Fiorentino believes that while the need for embedded financial products is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the Latin American market, it’s important to note that the region “is far from a carbon copy” of the U.S. market with different dynamics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For one, he said, existing solutions in the Latin American market are either “outdated” offerings from legacy financial institutions or “subpar” iterations from U.S. incumbents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It takes over 12 months for a business to spin up a plastic or digital card for itself. And because most legacy processors are owned by banks or large financial institutions that have been around for decades, pricing is inflexible and expensive,” Fiorentino told TechCrunch. “And if that wasn’t enough of a headache, stable reliability has been a huge pain point with these issuer processors. Pomelo is building the dev-first, self-serve API solution to address this clear market need.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Pomelo plans to use its new capital in part to open offices in São Paulo, Brazil and Mexico City, and hire dozens of people in those cities as well as in its home base of Argentina. The company currently has about 15 employees, 11 of which are engineers. It of course plans to continue building out its offering.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Boston Dynamics’ robot “dogs,” or similar versions thereof, are already being employed by police departments in Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York. Partly through the veil of experimentation, few answers are being given by these police forces about the benefits and costs of using these powerful surveillance devices.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, in a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/community-control-over-police-surveillance-ccops-model-bill">position paper on CCOPS</a> (community control over police surveillance), proposes an act to promote transparency and protect civil rights and liberties with respect to surveillance technology. To date, 19 U.S. cities in have passed CCOPS laws, which means, in practical terms, that virtually all other communities don’t have a requirement that police are transparent about their use of surveillance technologies.</p>
<p>For many, this ability to use new, unproven technologies in a broad range of ways presents a real danger. Stuart Watt, a world-renowned expert in artificial intelligence and the CTO of <a href="https://turalt.com/">Turalt</a>, is not amused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Even seemingly fun and harmless “toys” have all the necessary functions and features to be weaponized.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“I am appalled both by the principle and the dogbots and of them in practice. It&#8217;s a big waste of money and a distraction from actual police work,” he said. “Definitely communities need to be engaged with. I am honestly not even sure what the police forces think the whole point is. Is it to discourage through a physical surveillance system, or is it to actually prepare people for some kind of enforcement down the line?</p>
<p>“Chunks of law enforcement have forgotten the whole ‘protect and serve’ thing, and do neither,” Watts added. “If they could use artificial intelligence to actually protect and actually serve vulnerable people, the homeless, folks addicted to drugs, sex workers, those in poverty and maligned minorities, it&#8217;d be tons better. If they <em>have to</em> spend the money on AI, spend it to help people.”</p>
<p>The ACLU is advocating exactly what Watt suggests. In proposed language to city councils across the nation, the ACLU makes it clear that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The City Council shall only approve a request to fund, acquire, or use a surveillance technology if it determines the benefits of the surveillance technology outweigh its costs, that the proposal will safeguard civil liberties and civil rights, and that the uses and deployment of the surveillance technology will not be based upon discriminatory or viewpoint-based factors or have a disparate impact on any community or group.</p></blockquote>
<p>From a legal perspective, Anthony Gualano, a lawyer and special counsel at <a href="https://www.teamlaw.com/">Team Law</a>, believes that CCOPS legislation makes sense on many levels.</p>
<p>“As police increase their use of surveillance technologies in communities around the nation, and the technologies they use become more powerful and effective to protect people, legislation requiring transparency becomes necessary to check what technologies are being used and how they are being used.”</p>

<p>For those not only worried about this Boston Dynamics dog, but all future incarnations of this supertech canine, the current legal climate is problematic because it essentially allows our communities to be testing grounds for Big Tech and Big Government to find new ways to engage.</p>
<p>Just last month, public pressure forced the New York Police Department to suspend use of a robotic dog, quite unassumingly named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog.html?searchResultPosition=2">Digidog</a>. After the tech hound was placed on temporary leave due to public pushback, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/nyregion/robot-dog-nypd.html">the NYPD used it at a public housing building</a> in March. This went over about as well as you could expect, leading to discussions as to the immediate fate of this technology in New York.</p>
<p>The New York Times phrased it perfectly, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/nyregion/nypd-robot-dog-backlash.html">observing</a> that “the NYPD will return the device earlier than planned after critics seized on it as a dystopian example of overly aggressive policing.”</p>
<p>While these bionic dogs are powerful enough to take a bite out of crime, the police forces seeking to use them have a lot of public relations work to do first. A great place to begin would be for the police to actively and positively participate in CCOPS discussions, explaining what the technology involves, and how it (and these robots) will be used tomorrow, next month and potentially years from now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bird Rides, the shared electric scooter startup that operates in more than 200 cities across three continents, said Wednesday it is going public by merging with special purpose acquisition company Switchback II with an implied valuation of $2.3 billion. The announcement confirms earlier reports, including one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/bird-reportedly-prepares-to-go-public-via-spac-aims-for-2023-profitability/">this week from dot.LA</a>, that Bird intended to go public via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Bird said it was able to raise $160 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, by institutional investor Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, and others. Apollo Investment Corp. and MidCap Financial Trust provided an additional $40 million asset financing. (Disclaimer: Apollo is buying Verizon Media Group, which owns TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>The transaction will enable the combined entity to retain net proceeds of up to $428 million of cash, according to Switchback, which brings <span class="xn-money">$316 million</span> cash-in-trust to the table. The announcement also provided new information about a previously undisclosed <span class="xn-money">$208 million, which Bird raised privately</span> as part of an <span class="xn-chron">April 2021</span> Senior Preferred Convertible equity offering led by Bracket Capital, Sequoia Capital and Valor Equity Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When and how Bird would go public has been an item of speculation after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/scooter-startup-bird-is-said-to-discuss-going-public-via-spac?sref=ExbtjcSG">Bloomberg reported</a> last November that the company received “inbound interest” from SPACs.</p>
<p>Bird’s ride has been bumpy at times. In 2020, revenue dropped to $95 million, or 37% from the previous year. That year the company also laid off around 30% of its workforce &#8212; 406 people &#8212; for cost-saving reasons. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/bird-reportedly-prepares-to-go-public-via-spac-aims-for-2023-profitability/">The company may use this new access to cash</a> to expand its European operations and pay off debt.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the new injection of cash may help the company finally achieve profitability. It&#8217;s a rarity amongst scooter startups, which face notoriously high overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;We plan to scale our platform to provide our low carbon transportation services to more people in more cities around the world, as well as create further operational efficiencies across our network,&#8221; a Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re also planning to introduce additional form factors such as bikes to help replace more gas-powered car trips, which will open up another new revenue stream for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, have become a popular route for going public amongst transportation startups. Already this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/">scooter company Helbiz</a>, which is based in Europe and the U.S., went public via SPAC in a merger with GreenVision Acquisition Corp. SPAC shell corporations allow companies to list on the Nasdaq without doing a traditional initial public offering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think when money's chasing money, you don't want to be the last guy holding the money. You want to be the chase."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recent episode of TechCrunch&#8217;s Equity podcast, hosts Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm invited Yext CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevecakebread/">Steve Cakebread</a> and Latch CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garth-mitchell-34837511/">Garth Mitchell</a> on to discuss when companies should go public, the costs and benefits of the process, and when a SPAC can make sense. <a href="https://www.yext.com/">Yext</a> pursued a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">traditional IPO a few years back</a>; Latch is now going public via a blank-check company combination.</p>
<p>The chat was more than illustrative, as we got to hear two CFOs share their views on delayed public offerings and when different types of debuts can make the most sense. While the TechCrunch crew has, at times, made light of certain SPAC-led deals, the pair argued that the transactions can make good sense.</p>
<p>Undergirding the conversation was Cakebread&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IPO-Playbook-Insiders-Perspective-Company/dp/1733959122">recent IPO-focused book</a>, which not only posited that companies going public earlier rather than later is good for their internal operations but also because it can provide the public with a chance to participate in a company&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s hypercharged private markets and frothy public domain, his argument is worth considering.</p>
<p>What follows is the recap for those who prefer the written word, but we&#8217;ve also embedded the entire episode below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/4007687c-0c98-483c-b742-e7fc1df3c375?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<h2>What the CFOs say</h2>
<p>Cakebread said he began shaping his ideas around IPOs while working at Salesforce alongside CEO Mark Benioff while they were mulling whether to take the company public.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we started to realize was [that] it makes you more efficient; it forces you to put systems in place; it makes you run a business as opposed to just keep getting money from people to keep growing the business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so from the business angle … it was always about discipline and running a business and getting going.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Cakebread examined other companies and served on boards, his ideas evolved. He noted that the number of listed companies on the exchanges has dropped by 50% over the last decade or so. That&#8217;s a problem.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/stampli/">Stampli</a>, a software platform that optimizes corporate invoice management, announced a $50 million Series C financing round, led by Insight Partners with participation from Signal Fire and Nextworld Capital.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2015 with the goal of simplifying the process of invoice management. Why is that needed? Services and software are purchased by employees of companies across a variety of departments. The resulting invoices then land in the finance department, a part of companies that can be a bit siloed. Finance is then left to determine a number of factors, like why something was purchased, whether it delivered and if the invoice should it be paid at all.</p>
<p>Stampli turns each bill into a communications hub, connecting the folks in finance to other stakeholders on the purchase, including the vendor. Its system uses machine learning to recognize patterns around how the organization allocates cost, manage approval workflows and determine what data can be extracted from invoices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stampli has been historically payment-platform agnostic, meaning that its customers could use whatever payment method or provider they wanted. However, in early 2020, Stampli launched Direct Pay, its own payments product that solves some of the stickier problems for the accounting department. This fits into the general trend of seeing modern software companies bake a payments option into their services, adding a revenue stream to their books in the process.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wkkIzRn1fV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/stampli-an-invoice-management-software-startup-launches-a-payments-product/">Stampli, an invoice management software startup, launches a payments product</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stampli, an invoice management software startup, launches a payments product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/stampli-an-invoice-management-software-startup-launches-a-payments-product/embed/#?secret=wkkIzRn1fV" data-secret="wkkIzRn1fV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Because Stampli&#8217;s core product focused on the context of individual transactions, it plays well with its payments product. For example, folks who pay through ACH (which comes at a low, flat cost) usually suffer from the fact that the payment method likes to group multiple transactions into a single sum, which removes context. That issue can make it a huge headache for accounts payable to reconcile individual purchases. But because Stampli already understands the context of individual transactions, it can fill in the blanks for accounting while still allowing them to use ACH for payments.</p>
<p>Of course, Stampli remains payments agnostic, letting organizations use whatever provider they&#8217;d like. Still, co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/feldman_eyal?lang=en">Eyal Feldman</a> says that between 20-25% of Stampli&#8217;s customers use Direct Pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are all these payment providers that monetize on the payments themselves,&#8221; said Feldman. &#8220;We provide payments as a service to our customers to give them the easiest way to manage that part of the process. There is a revenue stream coming from Direct Pay but that isn&#8217;t the reason we do it. We want to turn payments into a commodity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stampli will use the new funding to sprint into scaling, aiming to double the size of the business in the next year. Thus far, Stampli has about 1,000 customers, and has managed $20 billion in transactions.</p>
<p>The latest round brings Stampli&#8217;s total amount of funding to $87 million, which has come from investors such as Signal Fire and UpWest.</p>
