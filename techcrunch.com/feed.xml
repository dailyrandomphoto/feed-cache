										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Full-size pickup trucks are the meat of the U.S. automotive business; it&#8217;s a red-hot category with the Ford F-150 leading the pack in sales and the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickups fast followers.</p>
<p>But the air is thin at the top. What&#8217;s often lost in truck coverage is how fiercely automakers compete to woo discerning customers with packaged bundles of optional and standard features. And now, more than ever, those packaged bundles rely heavily on in-car tech.</p>
<p>Ford, as the top seller, must add bells and whistles without alienating its most discerning clientele. The 2021 F-150 &#8212; as I was reminded during a recent test drive &#8212; epitomizes this effort and hints at what is to come with the upcoming all-electric Lightning pickup truck.</p>
<p>I tested the 2021 4&#215;4 SuperCrew Lariat equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 PowerBoost Full Hybrid engine in its native suburban Detroit, 20 miles from where it was developed and manufactured.</p>
<p>Getting the details right on pickup trucks is an art of custom packaging for car companies. It&#8217;s one of the reasons that options packages are dizzying; the F-150 I tested was no exception. The F-150 offers six different powertrains, three bed lengths and three cab options, and then there&#8217;s eight trim levels, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive options.</p>
<p>This options-heavy strategy has paid off for automakers like Ford. However, as these companies add more tech and software, there is a risk of causing confusion among its most loyal customers.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2188748" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188748" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2188748 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg" alt="2021 Ford F-150 interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188748" class="wp-caption-text">2021 Ford F-150 interior. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford Motor Company</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What sets the F-150 apart from other vehicles in its lineup is how much functional tech matters to its core customers. On the new model I tested, a 12-inch display that houses the standard Sync4 infotainment system is the center of the dashboard &#8212; and the customer experience.</p>
<p>Sync4 was introduced on the Mustang Mach-E and on the new Ford Bronco. Sync has been steadily improving for a simpler user experience since its 2007 introduction. Sync4 doubles computational power and introduced over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/inrix-expands-its-digital-rule-book-beyond-self-driving-cars-to-help-cities-with-scooters-bikes-and-delivery-bots/">system sources data</a> from INRIX on traffic, construction (always in a Michigan summer), weather and parking space availability from data in 20,000 cities and 150 countries.</p>
<p>Natural language processing used in the system provided more accurate responses to my voice-based queries and incoming SMS messages. One caveat worth noting: It was difficult to judge the machine learning algorithm because my test vehicle had been used by multiple drivers in recent weeks.</p>
<p>For infotainment, I generally defer to Apple CarPlay, which along with Android Auto, is easy to call up, because it connects wirelessly in the F-150 and minimizes distracted driving. Ever since they debuted in production vehicles &#8212; 2014 for CarPlay and 2015 for Android Auto &#8212; it seemed inevitable that Apple and Google were going to dominate the middleware infotainment system game.</p>
<p>Sync also tees up supported apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-bets-on-google-cloud-for-its-digital-transformation/">Waze and Ford+Alexa</a>.</p>
<h2>Driving tech</h2>
<p>Driving a full-size truck for the first time can be intimidating, and Ford uses camera tech to make the big rig easier to maneuver. The split screen helps a timid driver feel confident navigating through tight spaces.</p>
<p>Five onboard cameras act as guides that assist with steering and parking. The vivid graphics incorporated into the 360-degree view from above helps to establish bearings where mirrors won&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>Behind the steering wheel is a 12-inch digital cluster. There&#8217;s part of me that misses the old-fashioned gauges of a classic pickup, but that&#8217;s not the direction Ford is heading. Ford is striving for future-forward vibes, encapsulated by Mustang Mach-E&#8217;s Apple-design-inspired aesthetic.</p>
<p>Through its in-car design, Ford is trying to make the case it&#8217;s a tech company first, and a 120-year-old automaker second. These earnest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">aesthetic cues</a> may be a bit too on the nose as products age over time.</p>
<p>Ford is due to introduce Blue Cruise, an advanced driver assistance system it once called Active Drive Assist, on vehicles later this year by an automatic software update, which was not yet active on the model I drove in June, though the hardware was included.</p>
<p>The company claims the system allows for hands-free driving in zones that span 100,000 miles of North American road and will be standard on the F-150 Limited vehicles in the Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Prep Package. It will be sold as an option on Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum models. The system uses a driver-facing camera to track eye gaze and head position to monitor concentration as an answer to GM&#8217;s Super Cruise.</p>
<h2>The doodads that matter most</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188756" style="width: 6010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188756" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2188756 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg" alt="2021 Ford F-150" width="6000" height="4000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_041.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6000px) 100vw, 6000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188756" class="wp-caption-text">2021 Ford F-150&#8217;s interior work surface. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford Motor Company</p></div></p>
<p>Under the foot-long screen are the old-school knobs and switches that show Ford knows its customers still favor a manual cue here and there. Below that is a shift lever that folds down and flat into a 15-inch workstation, which I used for some in-car laptop time.</p>
<p>There are ample charging stations and wireless charging throughout the cabin. While the F-150 interior is spacious, every inch of real estate is carefully thought through. Seats fold to 180-degrees for proper roadside naps or to add extra cargo space.</p>
<p>The dark grey leather seats felt more utilitarian than luxurious, especially for a fully loaded vehicle. (Crosstown competitor Ram tends to outdo Ford on driving joy and interior design aesthetics.) The exterior and interior design emphasizes functionality, pure and simple. I hauled two kayaks in the back and found thoughtful hooks to connect to my bungee cords in the truck bed.</p>
<p>A bevy of 240-volt outlets are in the rear of the truck bed and two more are onboard in the cabin. The truck bed also has a convenient ruler built in on the tailgate with both metric and imperial calculations. A 2.4 kilowatt generator is standard on the hybrid model, while the optional 7.2 kW generator functions for 32 hours on a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t test out the F-150&#8217;s towing capacity, but for truck folks these numbers are essential. It has a payload of 2,120 pounds and can tow up 12,700 pounds (those numbers vary a bit depending on bed length and drivetrain). It also offers a backup towing assist function, which helps align the connection to a trailer. The model I drove was priced at $68,095, a significant leap from the $50,980 base price. In contrast, Ford produces an even higher-end F-150 trim called the Limited, which starts at $73,000.</p>
<h2>Function in form</h2>
<p>Before it goes all electric, the hybrid powertrain gives Ford a much needed boost to compete with Ram and Chevrolet, which already sell hybrid variants. The hybrid option is a logical compromise for customers who aren&#8217;t ready for the full Lightning EV that will go on sale in 2022, a launch that&#8217;s already generated buzz and 120,000 pre-orders. I clocked about 24 miles per gallon, an improvement over all-gasoline and best in its class for non-diesel. It&#8217;s still not enough to get Ford anywhere close to a stellar emissions report card, which is why the Lightning matters so much.</p>

<p>In order to court new EV customers, Ford must appease its current buyers who buy all those trucks we see on the road today. There&#8217;s two kinds of pickup truck customers: Those who rely on the functionality for their daily vocation or the weekend warriors and those who seek out the capability in case they might need it in a disaster scenario. The truck that I drove does the job of appealing to both.</p>
<p>The F-150 has always been suited to buyers who use it for home improvement projects, outdoorsy hobbies and towing. Pickup trucks also support laborers that require a rugged, functional vehicle. When Ford introduces anything new to this model, it creates hype and high stakes on how these customers feel about tweaks.</p>

<p>The buyer who seeks security came to mind while I had the F-150 on loan in late June, which is why I&#8217;ve saved the part about how it drives for last. My test drive period coincided with a summer storm that pummeled Michigan and shut down major highways and left vehicles stranded for days.</p>
<p>Before the storm, I zoomed around town, adjusting to the big loose steering and wide turns and the rhythm of stillness that occurs as the hybrid engine regenerates.</p>
<p>Once the storm came, I eased off the throttle and into a steady and sure pace, hands at 10 and two. Passenger cars and lesser capable crossover SUVs floated by me in two feet of water on the Lodge Freeway. The F-150 plowed through the muck, unbothered. I didn&#8217;t experience any skidding or stalling, in contrast to one friend who was forced to walk home because her Uber driver got stuck. The F-150 feels like a test case for a survivalist in an environmental catastrophe. The backup generator is the added security blanket.</p>
<p>Full-size trucks have an innate quality to make a driver feel invincible, which at the end of day is why people love their F-150s, and why the company has gotten so much mileage off that &#8220;Ford tough&#8221; tagline. It&#8217;s a delicate balance, keeping an unfussy truck at a price point that delivers power, substance and peace of mind.</p>

<p>We can understand the successes and challenges of several valuable companies today based on their combustion with the regulatory landscape, and perhaps also use it as an optic to see what areas represent unique opportunities for new companies to start and scale.</p>
<h2>Looking back: The value in regulatory gray areas</h2>
<p>“The tech comes in and moves faster than regulatory regimes do, or can control it,” Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick said at The Aspen Institute in 2013.</p>
<p>The brash statement downplayed that the regulatory landscape had, in fact, driven a number of pivotal outcomes for the company up to that event. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/ubercab-ordered-to-cease-and-desist/">changed its name</a> from UberCab to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist order in its first market, California. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300244/uber-taxi-new-york-travis-kalanick-rogue">Several early employees left</a> because of the startup’s regulatory challenges and iconoclastic ethos. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3451108/uber-taxi-pulls-out-new-york-tlc">shut down</a> its taxi service in New York after just a month of operations, and then in early 2013 received its lifeline in the city after being approved through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4271490/uber-becomes-first-taxi-app-to-get-approved-in-new-york-city">pilot program</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present, and Uber has a market cap of about $82 billion, with the ousted Kalanick having a personal net worth in the neighborhood of $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Still, even at its scale, many of its most important questions on growth centered around how favorably the regulatory landscape would treat its category. Most recently, this came with the U.K. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html#:~:text=Uber%20now%20treats%20all%2070%2C000,were%20workers%2C%20not%20independent%20contractors.">ruling</a> that Uber drivers could not be classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>The regulatory fabric has had similar leverage over other sharing-economy companies. In October 2014, for example, Airbnb’s business model became viable in San Francisco when Mayor Ed Lee <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/10/27/mayor-lee-approves-short-term-rentals-in-san-francisco-homeaway-vbro-renting-housing-tech-cost-of-living-affordable-hotel-tax/">legalized</a> short-term rentals. In November 2015, Proposition F in the city aimed to restrict short-term rentals like Airbnb, and the startup spent millions in advertisements to mobilize voters in opposition.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s current market cap stands at $92 billion, and its CEO, Brian Chesky, has an estimated net worth over $11 billion. Like Uber, its regulatory tribulations continue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">most recently being fined</a> and judged to owe $9.6 million to the city of Paris.</p>
<p>The stories of these two companies and others in the sharing economy space demonstrate the value that the regulatory fabric can add or subtract from a company’s wealth, but also underscore the value  —  for founding teams, early employees, investors and customers  —  of navigating the gray areas.</p>
<h2>Looking around: The data economy</h2>
<p>The present regulatory fabric has precipitated market timing for ideas in a number of categories. Solutions that enable data privacy, like <a href="https://bigid.com/">BigID</a>, and ones that embed data privacy into larger customer value propositions, like <a href="https://blotout.io/">Blotout</a>, are on streamlined growth tailwinds from the GDPR in Europe and their inspired analogs in the U.S.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a year of <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">editorial pivots</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">employee exits</a>, Medium announced today that it will make significant changes to its <a href="https://medium.com/earn">Medium Partner Program</a>, which allows writers on the platform to monetize their content.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Medium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/medium-opens-up-its-partner-program-allowing-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-paywall/">launched</a> its Partner Program in 2017. Since then, the platform has paid out $28 million to over <a href="https://digiday.com/media/exclusive-medium-will-begin-offering-writers-a-50-cut-of-the-subscriber-revenue-their-content-generates/">200,000 contributors</a>. Initially, it offered payouts based on how much time Medium members spent reading a writer&#8217;s content. For $5 per month or $50 per year, Medium members could read all posts on the platform without hitting a paywall. Plus, part of each member&#8217;s subscription was split among the writers they read; so, if a Medium member spent 10% of their time reading one writer&#8217;s work, for example, that writer would get 10% of the subscriber&#8217;s revenue share.</p>
<p>Medium said that earnings based on read time will remain the same. But now, Medium will offer a new way to make money with the launch of a referral program.</p>
<p>Previously, if a reader converted to a paying member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210401002027/https://medium.com/earn">within 30 days</a> of reading a writer&#8217;s story, that writer would get credit for the amount of time the reader spent reading their work. Under the <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">new model</a>, Partner Program writers will now have a personalized referral landing page &#8212; for any reader who purchases a Medium subscription via their page, the writer will get half of that member&#8217;s subscription fee for as long as they remain a paying member, minus the standard 2.9% + $0.30 in payment processing fees. So, if a writer got 100 readers to sign up for a monthly Medium membership through their referral, that would net the writer $227 per month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188675" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188675" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188675" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188675" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405927192215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>However, now it&#8217;s more difficult for a writer to join the Partner Program &#8212; writers must have 100 subscribers, at least one published Medium story, and they must live within <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187">specific geographic regions</a>. Even if a Partner meets the new eligibility requirements, they might lose their status if they don&#8217;t publish anything new in a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">six-month period</a>. Still, under the previous structure, just becoming a Partner didn&#8217;t guarantee financial rewards &#8212; some Partners with smaller followings would make <a href="https://medium.com/menlo-office/writing-stories-on-medium-for-pennies-a5eec97dbeb7">pennies</a> each month. Existing Partners will retain their status through the end of 2021, and if they haven&#8217;t reached 100 subscribers by then, they will be removed.</p>
<p>Also, Medium will soon institute a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">minimum payout threshold</a> of $10, meaning that if a writer makes less than $10 in a month, that pay will roll over to the next month until they amass at least $10.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Medium has been reticent about its subscriber numbers in the past, but CEO Ev Williams told TechCrunch in November that its subscriber numbers were in the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">high hundreds of thousands</a>.&#8221; In March 2021, Medium had <a href="https://www.axios.com/medium-subscribers-buyout-ev-williams-88549883-dd36-4bb6-88cf-089cf174648d.html?stream=technology&amp;utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_technology">725,000 subscribers</a> per Axios, but <a href="https://digiday.com/media/medium-eyes-media-partnerships-pursuit-1-million-subscribers/">Digiday previously reported</a> that Medium had hoped to reach 1 million subscribers by 2020. As of September, its competitor Substack, founded in 2017, had <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html">250,000 paid subscribers</a> and raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">$65 million series B round</a> two months later.

<p>Platforms like Substack and the newer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/ghost-cms-adds-open-source-subscription-and-membership-options/">Ghost</a> pay writers based on how many paying subscribers they have. Medium&#8217;s new revenue sharing model similarly incentivizes writers to corral readers to the platform, but Medium takes about 50%. For direct subscriptions to a writer&#8217;s individual newsletter, Substack <a href="https://substack.com/going-paid">takes 10%</a>, and Ghost takes <a href="https://ghost.org/vs/substack/">$9 per month</a>. While Substack or Ghost readers might subscribe to multiple individual newsletters, Medium subscribers pay just one $5 monthly or $50 yearly fee to access all of the website&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The newsletter business is competitive &#8212; in June, Facebook launched a newsletter platform called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a> with hand-picked contributors, and Twitter acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> earlier this year.

Similar to Medium, Quora+ subscribers get access to all content any writer chooses to put behind a paywall, and writers are paid based on engagement with their content. But writers can also write paywalled posts on <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a>, which are like user-created publications on Quora &#8212; Quora takes a 5% cut of those payments.</span></p>

<p>Did you hear it? FEMA just ran its first nationwide test of the U.S. emergency alert system since the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, tested both the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which broadcasts an emergency tone and message on televisions and radios, and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a newer system that sends emergency notifications to smartphones. This was the second nationwide test of the WEA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">after its debut in 2018</a>, and the first test for all U.S. cell phones of users who chose to opt-in to receive test alerts.</p>
<p>The test began around 2:20 p.m. ET. If you opted-in to the test, you likely got a message on your phone that said: &#8220;THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.&#8221; (The FCC explains <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to opt-in</a> to test alerts.)</p>
<p>For the first time, the WEA test sent the same test message in Spanish to phones that have Spanish set as the default language.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188804" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188804" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg" alt="" width="650" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188804" class="wp-caption-text">This is what the test WEA emergency alert looks like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/waEMD/status/1425523462613856261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WA Emergency Management <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/fema-national-emergency-test/">last nationwide test</a> in 2019, FEMA <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts#enhancements">said it has improved</a> WEA to send longer, detailed messages to the majority of phones that support it. The update also allows authorities to include tappable links, like web addresses.</p>
<p>FEMA runs these tests every year or two to ensure the system is working properly. It&#8217;s no small task: A national emergency alert system designed to broadcast the same message to potentially hundreds of millions of people at any given time is fraught with technological hurdles that require close co-operation from the cell carriers and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>The EAS system has been around since the late 1990s, but WEA was developed more recently as more Americans rely on their phones. WEA alerts, like EAS alerts, are designed to be sent by local and state authorities for public safety alerts, missing children and imminent threats, such as severe weather. More recently, FEMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">rolled out &#8220;presidential alerts,&#8221;</a> which are supposed to be sent to every phone in the U.S. in the event of a national emergency. Presidential alerts, unlike other alerts, can be issued by the sitting president for any reason, and Americans cannot opt out.</p>
<p>WEA broadcasts emergency notifications through the cell towers of an affected area — such as an area about to be hit by a storm — rather than sending tens of millions of text messages, which would grind the cell networks to a halt. The alerts are created by local, state or federal authorities and are authenticated by FEMA through the Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System, or IPAWS, and then passed to cell carriers to deliver the emergency alert.</p>
<p>The emergency alert system, though, is far from perfect. In 2018, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/13/inexcusable-false-ballistic-missile-alert-in-hawaii-was-caused-by-human-error/">erroneous alert</a> sent to Hawaii residents warned of an imminent ballistic missile threat,&#8221; and that &#8220;this is not a drill.&#8221; Minutes later, the alert was canceled. The false warning came as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were at an all-time high, during which Pyongyang was regularly test-firing rockets used for its nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Security experts have also long warned that the EAS systems pose security risks. Last year, researchers found <a href="https://securityledger.com/2020/01/seven-years-later-scores-of-eas-systems-sit-un-patched-vulnerable/">dozens of internet-connected, special-purpose servers</a> used by television and radio stations to interrupt their broadcasts to relay an emergency alert, which they said could allow a hacker to break in and compromise the servers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital manufacturing startup Varda Space Industries is moving fast. Only a few weeks after announcing a $42 million Series A, Varda has signed a deal with launch company Rocket Lab for three Photon spacecraft to support the startup’s initial missions.</p>
<p>The first spacecraft will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023, with the second to follow later that year and the third in 2024. It’s an aggressive schedule for the eight-month-old Varda and would mark the company’s first three manufacturing missions to space. The contract includes an option for Varda to purchase a fourth Photon.</p>
<p>Partnering with a more established company makes sense &#8212; especially considering the Photon’s bona fides, which includes a NASA-funded mission to the moon at the end of the year. Rocket Lab was also awarded a subcontract by the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory to design two Photon spacecraft for a one-year mission to Mars.</p>

<p>Varda, which was founded by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov, is banking big on a manufacturing condition that you can only find in space: microgravity. They think that the potential market for bioprinted organs, specialized semiconductors, fiber-optic cables or pharmaceuticals &#8212; products that you can’t make in Earthbound-conditions &#8212; is high enough to make the costs of building a spacecraft and launching to space more than worth it.</p>

<p>Under this most recent deal, each Photon will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: The first will be a microgravity manufacturing module, where the space production will actually take place, and the second will be a reentry capsule designed to bring those finished products back to Earth. Asparouhov told TechCrunch that the are designing the reentry modules to bring back “on the order of 40-60 kilograms of materials” for the first couple of missions, with the aim of quickly scaling up for subsequent launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Varda says this approach is low-risk and incremental. “That’s why we&#8217;re seeing so much interest from the investment community, [the Department of Defense], NASA, et cetera, it’s this very pragmatic, one-step-at-a-time approach,” Asparouhov said. “We’ll prove this first space factory. And yes, as we start to scale it allows us to send a larger space factory and then eventually, yes, we might have something the size of the [International Space Station], 10 times the size of the ISS. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re starting with. We&#8217;re starting with a very small, near-term pragmatic approach.”</p>
<p>Each mission will last roughly three months from launch to landing, Rocket Lab said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is <a href="https://twitter.com/twitterdesign/status/1425505308563099650?s=21">introducing</a> a revamped version of its website, which the company says will make the site more accessible, less cluttered and easier to use. Among the changes, the site is implementing Twitter&#8217;s new font, &#8220;Chirp,&#8221; and it&#8217;s changing various elements to become more high-contrast, among other things. Soon, it will roll out new color palettes as well, to allow users to personalize their Twitter experience further.</p>
<p>Chirp was first introduced in January as Twitter&#8217;s first proprietary typeface. In the past, the company had relied on fonts like SF Pro, Roboto and Helvetica Neue for its brand. The goal with Chirp &#8212; beyond giving Twitter its own form of visual expression &#8212; was to offer a typeface that&#8217;s sharp and legible for everyday use, but also one that would allow for more personality, including when put into motion or used for brand advertising.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want to give a bit more depth to Chirp, our new typeface.</p>
<p>Type, in 280 character doses, is the foundation of Twitter. In the history of the company we’ve either relied on someone else’s typeface, from SF Pro and Roboto, to Helvetica Neue in our brand. <a href="https://t.co/OrvlYsxF9g">pic.twitter.com/OrvlYsxF9g</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Derrit DeRouen (@DerritDeRouen) <a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time of its debut, however, Twitter had not yet committed to making Chirp the typeface for its wider product, though the creative director for Twitter&#8217;s global brand, Derrit DeRouen, said it was his &#8220;personal desire&#8221; to do so.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter is making Chirp a core part of the new Twitter website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also making all Western-language text align left, which the company says will make it easier to read as you scroll. (Non-Western text is unchanged.)</p>
<p>The colors on Twitter.com have been updated to be more high-contrast, too, as have the buttons. One notable change is that there&#8217;s a lot less of Twitter&#8217;s blue on the site. For example, the tweets and the navigation have now shifted to black when using the default Twitter theme with the white background. And the changes to buttons &#8212; like Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;Follow&#8221; buttons, for instance &#8212; are aimed at making the most important actions stand out, notes Twitter.</p>
<p>These tweaks may seem minor for now, but they could become more important as Twitter rolls out its expanded feature set &#8212; like the Super Follow and other features &#8212; as they give the company a way to emphasize particular actions it wanted the user to take.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ai5rdoUTH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter Spaces will be available for the web, including accessibility features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter Spaces will be available for the web, including accessibility features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/embed/#?secret=9ai5rdoUTH" data-secret="9ai5rdoUTH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The redesign has removed some of the visual clutter on the screen, too, like what Twitter refers to as &#8220;unnecessary divider lines.&#8221; There are fewer gray backgrounds, as well as increased space to make text easier to read.</p>
<p>The changes prepare Twitter to make room for a different type of online experience that goes beyond just sharing text-based posts with the occasional photo or other media attached.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">Super Follow</a>, Twitter is aiming to bring more creators onto the platform, and the company is also rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/">e-commerce shopping features</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">subscription service</a> for power users, live audio with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Spaces</a>, redesigned bookmark collections and more.</p>
<p>But adding features could lead to a more confusing experience, particularly for newcomers, as the new options could begin to crowd the screen. That&#8217;s why it makes sense that Twitter is redesigning its website now. However, whether Twitter users will appreciate the update remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The company says today&#8217;s changes are just the start of more visual updates to come, though it didn&#8217;t hint at what those future tweaks may include. It only noted that it would roll out more color palettes &#8220;soon.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The technology industry is often thought of as being the domain of the young and the new. We see an emphasis on young founders (“40 Under 40”), innovative ideas and disruptive challenges to legacy brands, incumbent companies and “old” ways of thinking.</p>
<p>But one of the things I’ve learned on my journey in co-founding my latest startup is that technology should be enabling and accessible to all, and nowhere is this more critical than for empowering our older adults.</p>
<p>Older adults are one of the most underrepresented audiences for new technology products and platforms. There is a massive opportunity to provide products and services that will make life better for today’s seniors and future generations of older adults to come. Founders in every space, from edtech to healthcare, from financial services to robotics, can make a bigger impact if we recognize the opportunity of being of service to older adults.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the best strategies for tech companies that want to serve the older adult market is to focus your value proposition on empowering older adults.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Don’t make a product &#8220;for old people&#8221;</h2>
<p>Older adults often get overlooked by tech companies. In fairness, it can be hard (and insensitive and uninspiring) to market products and services as being “for old people,” because people in this group don’t tend to think of themselves as “old.”</p>
<p>One of the best strategies for tech companies that want to serve the older adult market is to focus your value proposition on empowering older adults. Don’t make a product “for old people” &#8212; make a product that helps older adults lead a healthier, more active, more connected life.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the education tech space, financial services, health tech, consumer products or other innovative digital services for seniors, tech companies have big opportunities to empower older adults.</p>
<p>We are seeing some great examples, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://agebold.com/">AgeBold</a> is doing interesting work with at-home exercise programs for older adults to improve their balance, strength and mobility. The value proposition: Exercise for better aging. It’s a product “for” older adults, but the message is focused on empowerment and building strength, helping people live healthier, more active lives as they age.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eldera.ai/">Eldera.ai</a> connects children with vetted older adult mentors, for one-on-one or group conversations and remote learning activities. This concept is powerful because it helps older adults share their life experience and build relationships with other families.</li>
</ul>
<p>Older adults have so much to offer. Instead of approaching this market as a “problem” to be solved, startups should engage with older adults as an active, curious, ready-to-learn group of people who are eager to be empowered.</p>
<h2>Recognize the size of the opportunity of the older adult market</h2>
<p>It often seems like so many consumer-facing apps today are created for younger people. But there’s a big disconnect between where so much of the tech industry’s attention and investment is going and the spending power and lifestyle preferences of today’s older adults.</p>
<p>Older adults are the most underserved demographic for the tech world. They’re also one of the fastest-growing age cohorts. The number of people worldwide who are 65 and older is <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2017-06/global_health_aging.pdf">expected to grow</a> from 524 million in 2010 to 1.5 billion in 2050.</p>
<p>The “silver economy,” driven by the spending power of older adults, is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2021/01/14/the-silver-economy-is-coming-of-age-a-look-at-the-growing-spending-power-of-seniors/">expected to grow into the 2030s</a> because the senior population is the wealthiest age group and their numbers are growing 3.2% per year (compared with 0.8% for the overall population).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has now taken another step toward the public release of the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 12. The company today released the fourth beta of Android 12, whose most notable new feature is that it has achieved the <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/overview#timeline">Platform Stability</a> milestone &#8212; meaning the changes impacting Android app developers are now finalized, allowing them to test their apps without worrying about breaking changes in subsequent releases.</p>
<p>While the updated version of Android brings a number of new <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview/features">capabilities</a> for developers to tap into, Google urges its developers to first focus on releasing an Android-12-compatible update. If users find their app doesn&#8217;t work properly when they upgrade to the new version of Android, they may stop using the app entirely or even uninstall it, the company warns.</p>
<p>Among the flagship consumer-facing features in Android 12 is the new and more adaptive design system called &#8220;<a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a>,&#8221; which lets users apply themes that span across the OS to personalize their Android experience. It also brings new privacy tools, like microphone and camera <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mic-camera-indicators">indicators</a> that show if an app is using those features, as well as a <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#clipboard-access-notifications">clipboard read notification</a>, similar to iOS, which alerts to apps that read the user&#8217;s clipboard history. In addition, Android 12 lets users play games as soon as they download them, through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/android-12-will-let-you-play-games-before-they-finish-downloading/">a Google Play Instant feature.</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-offers-the-best-look-yet-at-android-12/">Other key Android features and tools</a>, like Quick Settings, Google Pay, Home Controls and Android widgets, among others, have been improved, too.</p>
<p>Google has continued to roll out smaller consumer-facing updates in previous Android 12 beta releases, but beta 4 is focused on developers getting their apps ready for the public release of Android, which is expected in the fall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If there&#8217;s one thing that the ongoing COVID-19 crisis has proven, it&#8217;s that the healthcare system in the U.S. is in drastic need of major transformation. One of the biggest issues to be highlighted by the pandemic in particular is the iniquity in access to care, but there are signs that one of the effects of COVID-19 will be a stepping up of accessibility reform driven in particular by technology.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt 2021</a>, we&#8217;re thrilled to have three guests onstage for a panel discussion all about how tech companies are working to address access gaps in healthcare. From Cityblock Health, we&#8217;ll host co-founder and Chief Health Officer Toyin Ajayi; from Carbon Health, co-founder and CEO Eren Bali; and from Forward, CEO and co-founder Adrian Aoun.</p>
<p>Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex health and social needs &#8212; bringing better care to neighborhoods where it’s needed most. Cityblock&#8217;s goal is to foster a model of care that meets individuals where they are, delivering highly personalized primary care, behavioral healthcare and social services to its members, with a focus on those who access Medicaid, are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, and others living in lower-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Carbon Health has a goal of making good healthcare accessible to all, with same-day appointment booking, telehealth services and prescription delivery, facilitated through partnerships with some of the leading insurers and payers in the U.S. The company has taken a central role in vaccine administration in California, and continues to evolve its model of modular healthcare delivery to reach communities where primary care hasn&#8217;t traditionally been readily available.</p>
<p>Forward is an AI-based healthcare system combining world-class private doctors with new technology to enable proactive, data-driven primary care. Starting with cutting edge in-clinic and at-home biometric data measurement, Forward aims to tailor its primary care to individuals in a combination that delivers both scalability and personalization. The company also espouses a direct-to-consumer, subscription-based model of care that it argues avoids some of the traditional pitfalls of insurance-backed care.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to be able to dig in to these very different approaches to healthcare, that still all share the fundamental goal of making a higher-quality standard of care available to more people.</p>
<p>During the three-day event, writer, director, actor and Houseplant co-founder Seth Rogen will be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr to talk about the business of weed, BioNTech co-founder and CEO Uğur Şahin will dive into what&#8217;s next for mRNA technologies after COVID, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will dig into the volatile world of cryptocurrency and his company’s massive direct listing earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it was one of the less-hyped gadget debuts in recent memory, Samsung blasted out a series of announcements at an Unpacked event bright and early this morning.</p>
<p>Too busy to tune in? Still asleep when it all went down? Here&#8217;s the slimmed-down version of everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Galaxy Watch 4</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2188130" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188130" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188130" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9846.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188130" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Samsung is back with another set of smartwatches, this time with a twist: After years of focusing on their own operating system with Tizen, these latest watches are back on Google&#8217;s Wear OS. Or, at least, Samsung&#8217;s take on it — this software build will be called &#8220;Wear OS Powered by Samsung&#8221;, and will borrow some of the best bits of Tizen while being Wear OS at its core.</p>
<p>Samsung went deep on health metrics this time around, focusing much of the announcement on the Watch&#8217;s ability to constantly monitor things like blood pressure, blood oxygen and body composition.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s watch comes in two forms: Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The standard Watch 4 is a bit thinner and lighter, with a touch-sensitive bezel for controlling the interface; Watch 4 Classic bulks things up a bit, with a bezel that physically spins. Watch 4 starts at $250 and comes in 40mm or 44mm, while Watch 4 Classic bumps the base price to $350 and comes in 42mm or 46mm.</p>

<p>Pricey and with plenty of problems to work out of the earliest versions, folding smartphones haven&#8217;t exactly taken over the world. Hell, most people probably still haven&#8217;t seen a folding phone in person. But Samsung isn&#8217;t done in this space just yet!</p>
<p>This morning the company announced the Galaxy Z Fold 3, its third iteration on the hotdog-style folding phone approach. They&#8217;ve managed to drop the price tag a bit (from $2,000 to $1,800), while bumping up the overall build quality — it has a stronger aluminum frame, a more durable folding display and it&#8217;s waterproofed (a first for the Samsung foldables!) up to an IPX8 rating. (One catch: That &#8220;x&#8221; means it&#8217;ll survive an accidental dunk in the tub, but you still want to keep it away from dust/debris.)</p>
<p>The Fold 3 will be the first Samsung device with an under-display camera — an awesome trick, albeit one that generally comes at the expense of picture quality. The back of the device brings in three more (more standard, less hidden) lenses — ultra wide, wide-angle and telephoto, all coming in at 12 megapixels each. Oh, and it supports the S Pen stylus now!</p>
<p>Expect this one to start shipping on the 26th of this month.</p>

<h2>Galaxy Z Flip 3</h2>

<p>While the flagship Fold 3 took up most of the folding spotlight today, Samsung&#8217;s relatively entry-level (clamshell!) foldable gets an update too with the announcement of the Galaxy Z Flip 3.</p>
<p>The Flip 3 will get many of the same durability improvements coming to the aforementioned Fold 3, including the improved aluminum body, more durable display and IPX8 water resistance. It&#8217;s got a 10MP selfie cam on the inside, with two 12MP cameras (ultra wide and wide Angle) on the outside. At $999 — nearly $400 less than the last one — it&#8217;s the first time Samsung has managed to drag its foldable line into the sub-$1K price range. It&#8217;s got a bigger cover screen (the screen that shows whenever the device is folded shut) this time around, at 1.9&#8243; versus last-gen&#8217;s 1.1&#8243;.</p>
<p>As with everything else announced today, it starts shipping on August 26th. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsung-latest-galaxy-z-flip-starts-at-1000/">Find our full post on the Flip 3 here.</a></p>

<p>Samsung also debuted a new generation of its entry-level wireless earbuds today, and everything you need to know could fit in a tweet: they&#8217;re smaller and lighter and have active noise cancellation, and will ship on August 26th for $149.</p>

<h2>Less plastic!</h2>
<p>They kinda snuck this one in at the end, but it&#8217;s worth a highlight: Samsung is committing to eliminating all single-use plastic <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/phones-from-ocean-plastic-samsungs-plan-to-green-by-2025-will-apple-and-others-follow/">from its phone packaging by 2025</a>, with plans to dramatically increase its use of recycled material across its mobile products by the same year. Given that Samsung ships more phones per quarter than any other company on the planet, that&#8217;s huge — and, hopefully, an example others will follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck company Hyzon Motors said Wednesday it is ramping up operations in the wake of its merger with blank-check firm Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp., including shipping its first trucks to European customers.</p>
<p>The company, which reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday, said it is also preparing to start its first customer trials in the United States.</p>
<p>Like other transportation companies that have gone public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition fund, Hyzon doesn’t yet have any revenue to speak of. Instead, Hyzon is banking on the huge injection of capital from the transaction &#8212; more than $500 million &#8212; and growing customer orders to take it to positive cash flow.</p>
<p>As of now, the company reported a net loss for the quarter of $9.4 million, including $3.5 million in R&amp;D expenses. It had a negative adjusted EBITDA of $9.1 million. The company has $517 million in cash on hand, enough to reach free cash flow by 2024 without having to sell additional equity, Hyzon CFO Mark Gordon said during a second-quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing hydrogen fuel cell powertrains, Hyzon is also investing in hydrogen fuel production hubs, a key piece of infrastructure for technology uptake. In April, the company signed an MOU for a joint venture with renewable fuels company Raven SR for up to 100 hydrogen production hubs. Gordon confirmed the first two will be in the Bay Area.</p>

<p>He also said that the company is on track to deliver 85 fuel cell vehicles by the end of this year, with the company’s first revenue coming next quarter. Orders and memoranda of understanding under contract has grown to $83 million from $55 million as of April, but many of the MOUs are non-binding. An agreement with Austrian grocer MRPEIS for 70 trucks next year is one such example. Similarly, Hyzon faces a slightly uphill battle in terms of technological adoption, as many of their customers have never seen or used a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Many customers are getting their hands on the first fuel cell vehicles they’ve ever seen in the next six to 12 months,” CEO Craig Knight said during the call. That is a genuine kind of technology validation process and the customers need to feel comfortable the vehicles function well in their use case.”</p>
<p>While many of Hyzon’s sales are for a small number of trucks, Knight said he sees the purchasing timeline from initial sale to fleet conversion growing shorter &#8212; at least in Europe, where there is significantly more hydrogen availability. “Whereas, earlier I would have said, it&#8217;s a 12-to-18 month process to go from getting your first fuel cell truck and trying it out and then maybe getting a few more and figuring out what fleet conversion would look like over time, and then kicking off that fleet conversion process &#8212; I actually think that&#8217;s compressing,” Knight said.</p>
<p>The company is focused mostly on back-to-base operations rather than long-haul freight haulage, as the latter requires a more extensively built-out hydrogen refueling network. The U.S. customer trial with logistics company Total Transport Services Inc. is a high-utilization (trucks can run up to 18-20 hours per day) use case, but the truck will only ever need to access the single refueling station in Wilmington, California. “It&#8217;s a good application for hydrogen, and we&#8217;re not introducing the complication of having to find hydrogen stations across the country,” Knight said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin has made headlines over the past year for a number of reasons: It’s home to Oracle’s new headquarters. Tesla is building a </span><a href="https://austin.culturemap.com/news/innovation/07-27-21-new-photos-show-construction-of-teslas-austin-factory-is-in-high-gear/#slide=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive gigafactory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Texas capital. And people, mostly tech workers, are leaving the Bay Area in droves to settle in the city, driving up home prices in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just tech workers. A number of venture capitalists have set up shop in Austin, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-investor-jim-breyer-picks-austin-as-breyer-capitals-second-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, who said last year he was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/palantir-co-founder-joe-lonsdale-leaving-silicon-valley.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving his venture capital firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 8VC, from Silicon Valley to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest VC to call Austin home is </span><a href="https://www.bedrockcap.com/geoff-lewis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geoff Lewis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ounder &amp; managing partner of Bedrock Capital, a four-year-old early-stage venture capital firm with $1 billion in assets under management. Lewis started his investing career at Founders Fund, where he was a partner for several years. He either serves or has served on the board of companies such as Lyft, Nubank, Vercel and Workrise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis also led early investments in Wish, Upstart, Tilray, Canva, Rippling, ClearCo, Flock Safety and a number of other unicorns. He’s largely credited with popularizing the phrase “narrative violation” to des</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cribe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">promising companies that are overlooked or underestimated because they are incongruent with popular narratives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In making the move to Austin, the investor said he had grown disillusioned with Silicon Valley and the region’s continued lack of focus on solving what he described as real-world problems. In a recent Medium </span><a href="https://medium.com/bedrock/why-im-bullish-on-texas-81ef231c2de4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lewis said he was first introduced to Austin after backing Workrise (formerly called RigUp), a marketplace for skilled trade workers. In fact, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was the company’s first seed investor eight years ago, and has gone on to invest in the company eight subsequent times. Today, Workrise is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/workrise-once-known-as-rigup-raises-300m-at-a-2-9b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at nearly $3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis said he was drawn to the company, not just because it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“going to be huge” but also because it was “much more concerned with real people and real places than today’s Silicon Valley behemoths.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Put simply,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is a more humane technology company,” Lewis writes. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s my search for this more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> humane genre of technological innovation that brought me to Texas. I’ve lived on the coasts and built my career as a Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur and investor, but I’ve never felt</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the coasts or as an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insider </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Silicon Valley &#8212; I didn’t go to Stanford nor grow up rich.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Lewis to get more details around his decision to move his firm to Austin, learn more of his views on why Silicon Valley is too much of “a bubble” (spoiler alert: they may not be popular with many of you!) and how he plans to invest in more of Texas’ nexus of startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: I understand that you grew up in Canada. How did you first get involved in the tech industry to begin with?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I started off as an entrepreneur myself, building a SaaS company in the travel space [Topguest]. I founded that business in New York City and in 2009, ended up moving my team to San Francisco. I spent most of my career from 2009 to 2021 mostly bouncing between New York and SF. We ended up selling that company in 2011 and it was a reasonably okay outcome. I joined Founders Fund in 2012, where I just fell in love with investing. I ended up really having a special trajectory there and 2012 was a great time to be a young VC in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. I ended up specializing in marketplaces, both consumer and enterprise, backing companies like Lyft and Canva early. I also did the firm’s first fintech investment in Latin America, backing Nubank, and now that company has a $30 billion valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up with pretty modest means and by 2017, I figured I had done well enough as a VC and I should strike out on trying to get back to what I wanted to do, which was more entrepreneurial. So we founded Bedrock in late 2017. We’re on Fund III now and really it&#8217;s been consistent with the investment philosophy I pursued &#8212; trying to find what we call narrative violations, or these counter narrative companies that are being overlooked or underestimated. We were very early investors in Cameo, which is now obviously a pretty well-known business, for example.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: You initially chose to base Bedrock in New York. Why?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: When I was at Founders Fund I had a home in both cities (SF and NYC) so I was the kid who grew up in Calgary, Canada, and wanted to live on the coasts and be in the center of the action. But we decided to actually headquarter Bedrock in New York in 2017 because we had an inclination that Silicon Valley was becoming a little bit overly self-referential and wanted to be a bit outside of the noise. New York is less of a one-horse town, so we decided to base the firm there, but really invested in, and continue to invest, everywhere across the country, and quite honestly around the world. We invested in Workrise in the early days, and more recently in Argyle and Lambda School.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Tell me about this migration to Austin. At what point did you decide this is where you want to be and what drew you here? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: My first visit was in 2012 when I invested in Workrise, so I came to Austin quarterly for board meetings for years. And then a family member of mine actually got a position at UT (University of Texas). So that made me more excited about spending more time here. And then the real impetus I&#8217;d say happened, as I think it did for many people, during the pandemic. I remember in February, my partner Eric [Stromberg] and I had this conversation where we were like, “OK, COVID is going to have a deeper impact on New York City.” We saw it coming and decided we should get out of New York. At first, I moved to Hawaii and it was just a bit too isolated to live year-round, so I was like, “What’s a place that combines access to nature that’s not being in a big city but still has a nexus of smart, interesting people. I also was looking for a place where it would be easy to hop on a plane and get to either coast. Austin was the obvious choice. So many of my friends from the Bay Area were moving there, one after another, and loving it. So by January 2021, we had made the decision to move our firm here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t believe everyone should move to Austin. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s right for everyone, but I do think it&#8217;s right for us.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Having myself lived in both the Bay Area and Austin, I actually see a number of growing similarities between the two. What do you say to that? Do you also feel like the culture is spilling over here?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I have friends who are locals and have been here in some cases for like a generation-plus, and in other cases, have lived here since they were kids. They are really alarmed by how the city is changing, certainly like the real estate crisis, especially if you&#8217;re anywhere close to the core, is just absolutely insane. They’re definitely not used to the California and New York transplants. I definitely think it&#8217;s a problem that the city somehow does not quite have the infrastructure from a housing standpoint and from a transportation standpoint to support the growth on that; it&#8217;s a very big problem. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a healthy long-term dynamic where you&#8217;ve got locals that really don&#8217;t like the newcomers coming in. So I think that is a big problem and I don&#8217;t quite know what the solution is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think the wealth inequality is far less of a problem here than it is in the Bay Area. To me, that’s the number one thing that&#8217;s much better about Austin. Yes, there’s a homeless problem and yes there are people struggling here, but we&#8217;re not anywhere near the wealth inequality situation that exists in the Bay Area, which is like the most unequal &#8212; from a wealth standpoint &#8212; place in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can still get by here. And then I think the fact that it&#8217;s a blue city in a red state is actually really important. I&#8217;m pretty much an apolitical person and not that engaged in American politics but I do think there&#8217;s a dynamic where you&#8217;ve got a diversity of views and a diversity of opinions. There’s a natural tension that doesn&#8217;t exist in San Francisco and I think that leads to a more healthy set of policies over time.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: I know you&#8217;re planning to invest in more startups in Austin and Texas but not exclusively, right? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: Yes, we will invest anywhere and everywhere but already we have four investments in companies we met here in Austin, three of which we have made just since April. One is a Dallas-based company, Leadr, that has built a leadership development platform for enterprises. Another is a stealth company based here in Austin and we’ve also put money in a cryptocurrency analytics company that is not technically based here but has an office in Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I definitely expect we’ll be making more investments in Texas than we used to now that we’re on the ground here.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: In your blog post, you made the statement that “innovators in Texas seem to care about real people and real problems more than the abstractions from reality that animate too much of Silicon Valley.” And I thought that was interesting and probably could stir up some controversy and backlash. Can you elaborate on that?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: I think there&#8217;s sort of this cultural dynamic where you have people that truly do live in these bubbles and so when you&#8217;re in the technology industry in San Francisco or quite honestly the entertainment industry in Los Angeles, I think folks just live entirely in this sort of self-referential bubble. And you only communicate and only ever interact with people that are in the same industry as you, and I think that leads to just a very, quite honestly parochial sort of inward looking worldview. There is something about a place that is less dominated by technology. When you think about Texas as a state &#8212; yes, tech is a major employer in Austin, but tech does not dominate the state of Texas by any means. It&#8217;s a huge state, there are lots of people here. There is a much smaller tech community. So definitionally, I think people tend to be friends with people from different walks of life. And I think people are just much more keyed into practical problems and issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a Houston company that I&#8217;m not an investor in but that I&#8217;m really excited about the business, Solugen. It’s innovating chemical manufacturing in more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective ways, which to me is very much more of a real-world, practical problem type company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got Leadr, which is trying to do leadership development for churches and faith organizations, using software. It feels like a company that just would never get started out of San Francisco where nobody is religious, and no one goes to church. So I do just think it&#8217;s a much different vibe here where you&#8217;ve got people that are less siphoned off from the real world versus living in this bubble, which is quite unhealthy. I don’t want to spend my time on another widget. I want to invest in things that are gonna actually have an impact on the world.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: This will likely be an unpopular opinion with many, and your comments might provoke some defensiveness. What would you say to any counterarguments?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis: It’s not zero sum. The vibe here is I think a healthier one for me but I realize it’s not for everyone. Obviously there are many companies that have dramatically improved the world that have come out of the Bay Area. There are also companies that arguably have been net negative for society. These things are always open to debate. Whether something&#8217;s good for the world or bad is fundamentally subjective. I think at the very least Texas is a place where there&#8217;s a little bit more freedom to debate those opinions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://airtable.com">Airtable</a>, the makers of the no-code relational database, announced its first acquisition today, acquiring <a href="https://bayes.com/">Bayes</a>, an early-stage visualization startup. The purpose of the purchase is to enhance the data visualizations on the Airtable platform. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>Much like Airtable, Bayes focuses on a no-code approach, and the two companies have a shared vision about simplifying activities that once required engineering talent to pull off. Airtable CEO and co-founder Howie Liu says that while he hasn&#8217;t really been thinking about acquisitions, this opportunity came along and he liked how the team and product fit in with the Airtable no-code philosophy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fell in love with the team and the product that they had built insofar as it showed us their vision for doing data visualization in a really interesting and user-friendly way that we thought would be applicable&#8230;and in spirit to be able to apply that kind of design thinking to Airtable&#8217;s product and enable our customers to basically better visualize their data,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Bayes&#8217;s four employees have joined Airtable and the plan is to shut down the product and incorporate the functionality into Airtable in the coming months.</p>

<p>Will Strimling, company co-founder, says his startup matched up well with Airtable, which he said was a huge inspiration for his company since it launched in 2019. He said that it seemed like they could be better together after the two companies began talking. &#8220;After comparing our respective roadmaps and future plans, it became clear that by working together we could build something that is greater than the sum of its parts &#8212; an Airtable with even more insights, visualizations and reporting features that will continue to improve the way teams manage workflows,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Airtable does provide some basic visualization in the current product, Liu says that with Bayes it will really take that capability to a different level, allowing customers to create a custom interface on top of Airtable. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to provide much more advanced ways of graphing and reporting on your data. We&#8217;re also going to invest into giving our customers the ability to create truly a custom interface on top of the product,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Liu said up until now the company really lacked the scale to think about acquisitions, but with 500 employees in the fold he feels that they are sufficiently large, and also they have the talent on the executive team to execute on acquisitions now. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s harder to absorb acquisitions when you&#8217;re a very small company yourself, whereas now I think we&#8217;re at the scale where it starts to make sense to accelerate our roadmap by acquiring talent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Airtable was founded in 2013 and has raised more than $600 million. The most recent round was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/"> a $270 million Series E</a> at a fat $5.77 billion valuation, so from that perspective they have some financial flexibility to make these kinds of moves, and may consider additional purchases moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.doxel.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed software that uses computer vision to help track and monitor progress on construction job sites, announced today that it has raised $40 million in Series B funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners led the round, which included participation from existing backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Amplo and brings the startup’s total raised to $56.5 million since its December 2015 inception. A16z has participated in each of Doxel’s rounds &#8212; from seed to Series B. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its institutional investors, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev also put money in Doxel’s Series A round as an angel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Saurabh Ladha said he could not disclose the valuation at which the capital was raised, but that it was “over a 4x multiple” from its $12 million Series A in early 2020. He described the Series B as an &#8220;opportunistic raise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We raised because we could, at a phenomenal valuation. The full</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> series A is still in the bank. We didn’t touch it even,” he told TechCrunch. “Our growth and bookings traction has actually been so high that we’ve been cash flow neutral in that period of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladha was inspired to start Doxel after his family nearly suffered from financial catastrophe after a two-year delay on a major construction project in India in which his father was involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I almost thought we’d lose our house. It was the first time I was made aware of the impact construction can have on livelihoods,” Ladha told TechCrunch. “Even as a child, I realized that predictability is what keeps projects on time and on budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty years later, when Ladha graduated from Stanford University, he learned that 90% of projects are delayed and delivered over budget.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladha then teamed up with Robin Singh, Doxel’s CTO, in 2015 to found Doxel to build a “computer-vision-powered predictive analytics platform” designed to help owners and contractors “navigate problems before they happen.” Or put more simply, Doxel is building what it describes as the “Waze for Construction” platform.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/embed/#?secret=bNDwYcD1kY" data-secret="bNDwYcD1kY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s biggest differentiator from competitors, according to Ladha, is that it provides forward-looking insight on the construction field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of companies offer backward-looking analytics,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re the only player offering a forward-looking solution that’s predictive&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In much the same way drivers have come to rely on satellite technology to avoid traffic accidents and slow-downs ahead of them, Doxel’s customers have come to rely on our AI-powered Project Controls platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel, Ladha added, does monitoring for project teams, so they can focus on solving problems rather than on finding them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our predictive analytics gives building owners and general contractors a way to identify critical risk factors that threaten to derail their project before they even know the risks exist,” he said. “So they are not finding out about problems when it’s too late to actually solve them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The premise is that by the time potential risk factors are discovered, it’s too late and cost overruns and project delays are unavoidable. Over the years, with all the data it has gathered, Doxel has built out what it describes as a “Construction Encyclopedia” that helps it in identifying those potential risk factors.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188450" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188450" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188450 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Saurabh-Robin-e1628634629479.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188450" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Co-founders Saurabh Ladha (CEO) and Robin Singh (CTO) / Doxel</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that its technology has helped its customers come in up to 11% below budget on projects and see an average 38% increase in productivity, according to Ladha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doxel’s platform works by tapping into multiple real-time data sources on a project, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 360-degree images, Building Information Models (BIM) &#8212; also known as 3D designs &#8212; as well as budget and schedule in an effort to provide both predictability and control to building owners and contractors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The goal is to help prevent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a domino effect of delays and heightened costs, so that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building owners and contractors are better able to stay on time and on budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other companies don’t bridge all silos across field, accounting and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">schedule management,” Ladha said. “These are three disparate entities that operate separately and without the knowledge silos being bridged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides cost overruns, the loss of revenue associated with projects not being available for use per plan is exponentially disastrous, Ladha noted. For example, a multifamily developer expecting to make money by selling or renting condo units will lose income the longer it takes for project completion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Doxel says it has tracked tens of billions of capital expenditures for “a diverse group” of Fortune 500 companies, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaiser Permanente and Royal Dutch Shell. Doxel claims to have saved companies “tens of millions” of dollars with its predictive technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our users are senior execs tasked with making multibillion-dollar decisions with little information on a week to week basis,” Ladha said. “They need to know if they are on cost and on time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikhil Sachdev, managing director at Insight Partners, said his firm was really excited about the size of the problem Doxel is going after in addition to the traction the company has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with some of the world’s largest enterprises, and their highly defensible AI-first software.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations with customers revealed that prior to using Doxel’s technology, they did not have a way to accurately predict the future state of their construction projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most construction management software tools are still dependent on manual data entry or photos tagged to blueprints, which requires weeks of manual mining to extract insights on a project’s cost &amp; schedule performance,” Sachdev wrote via email. “Doxel is the only tool we&#8217;ve found that can ingest all of the relevant data, process it using their AI, and make the leap to what the project will look like in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Redwood City, California-based Doxel plans to use its new capital to scale its platform and hire across its engineering, sales, marketing and product staff. Currently, Doxel has 75 employees across offices in the U.S. and Bangalore. It’s looking to roughly double the size of its team over the next year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The link-in-bio business is heating up as more mobile website builders compete for a coveted slice of real estate on a creator&#8217;s TikTok, Instagram or Twitter. <a href="http://linktr.ee">Linktree</a> leads the space, securing a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">$45 million Series B raise</a> to build out e-commerce features, but <a href="http://beacons.ai">Beacons</a> boasts competitive creator monetization tools with just a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/beacons-seed-round-creator-profiles/">$6 million seed round</a> in May. Now, <a href="http://snipfeed.co">Snipfeed</a> enters the ring with its own $5.5 million seed round, including investments from CRV, Abstract Ventures, Crossbeam (Ali Hamed), id8, Michael Ovitz (founder of CAA), Michael Bosstick, Diaspora Ventures and others.</p>
<p>Linktree has been around since 2016 and has more funding than its up-and-coming competitors. But for creators seeking to monetize their following, these newer platforms may be more attractive to some creators, since they already have built-in tools to help them monetize their followings. Linktree currently supports tipping on the platform for users subscribed to its $6 Linktree Pro platform, but Snipfeed offers a wider range of monetization options; some creators are making more than $20,000 per month on the platform, according to CEO and co-founder Rédouane Ramdani.</p>
<p>Snipfeed started as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/20-startups-take-center-stage-at-berkeley-skydecks-demo-day/">content discovery platform</a> with 44,000 weekly active users &#8212; but when Snipfeed added a creator monetization tool to its platform, it became its most popular feature. So, in February 2020, with little to no funding left, the company completely pivoted to its current link-in-bio business. Since then, Snipfeed has amassed 50,000 registered users, with the user base growing 500% in the last six months (Linktree, for comparison, has more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">12 million users</a>).</p>
<p>Based in Paris and Los Angeles, Snipfeed&#8217;s 15-person staff is particularly interested in the &#8220;long tail&#8221; of creators, which it says encompasses more than 46 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Content creator</em> doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;re going to be the next Addison Rae or a TikTok star,&#8221; explained Ramdani. &#8220;It means that you might be a doctor or lawyer, and on top of that, you&#8217;re going to have a TikTok where you explain how to file your taxes and that kind of stuff. They have this expertise, and they’re wondering, &#8216;How can I turn that into a side-hustle?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188271" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188271" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188271" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="415" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png 2828w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=680,415 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=2048,1248 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-09-at-9.41.40-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188271" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snipfeed</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to a standard tipping tool, Snipfeed allows users to sell digital goods, like on-demand video, e-books, access to livestreams and one-on-one consultations. But Snipfeed&#8217;s biggest differentiator is its Cameo-like system for selling personalized content. For example, TikToker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maylikethemonthh?lang=en">maylikethemonthh</a> uses <a href="https://link.snipfeed.co/maylikethemonthh">Snipfeed</a> to sell asynchronous, video-recorded tarot readings. While asking a single, personalized astrology question costs $5, a more in-depth reading can cost up to $20 or $40.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snipfeed is free to set up, but if you make sales, the company takes 15% &#8212; this percentage is inclusive of any transaction fees. Through Snipfeed&#8217;s referral program, creators can make 5% of sales from anyone they onboard to the platform (this comes out of Snipfeed&#8217;s commission).</p>
<p>“We decided to go with this model because we really want to have a relationship where we help the creators really make money. We only make money if they make money,&#8221; Ramdani said.</p>
<p>If a creator or celebrity were to sell personalized videos on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">Cameo</a>, they&#8217;d lose <a href="https://help.cameo.com/what-percentage-do-i-earn-from-each-completed-cameo-video--BkMyCbLlu#:~:text=For%20Cameo%20Videos%20requested%20through,our%20Talent%20Terms%20of%20Service).">25% to the platform</a>.

<p>Still, depending on the type of creator, the features that each link-in-bio startup offers might matter more than the cost. Beacons allows users to share a shopping-enabled TikTok feed, which could be a huge money-maker for creators that often share product recommendations with affiliate links, which give them a commission from sales. Ramdani said that astrologers have been particularly successful on Snipfeed, since fans can book a variety of asynchronous services at a wide range of prices. But these features could benefit any creator who can profit from answering followers&#8217; specific questions &#8212; a chef could offer recipe ideas based on what&#8217;s in a fan&#8217;s fridge, or a life coach could make a personalized video if a follower requests advice.</p>
<p>With its $5.5 million in seed funding, Snipfeed plans to build out its e-commerce tools so that creators can sell physical products on their link-in-bio (Beacons and Linktree are also working on this with their recent funding rounds &#8212; but Beacons&#8217; and Snipfeed&#8217;s seed rounds are small compared to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/link-in-bio-company-linktree-raises-45m-series-b-for-its-social-commerce-features/">Linktree&#8217;s Series B</a>). The company also wants to develop educational content to show its users how to best monetize their platform &#8212; if Snipfeed can help its creators make money, then it&#8217;ll make more money too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s $1.5 billion air cargo hub in Northern Kentucky opened Wednesday, the latest effort by the e-commerce giant to connect a network of 40 sites and control all aspects of delivery as demand for speed and convenience accelerates.</p>
<p>The Amazon Air Hub operations, located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, will be the center of its U.S. cargo network. The hub opened after more than four years of planning and construction. Amazon said the U.S. hub will eventually <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/welcome-to-the-amazon-air-hub">operate a dozen flights per day</a> and process millions of packages every week.</p>
<p>The hub is comprised of an 800,000-square-foot sortation building located on a 600-acre campus that includes seven buildings, a new ramp for aircraft parking and a multistory vehicle parking structure.</p>
<p>Amazon said that eventually more than 2,000 people will be employed there. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The air hub will also rely on robotics technology, specifically robotic arms to move and sort packages and mobile drive units to transport packages across the building.</span></p>
<p>Amazon Air launched in 2016 and has grown into a network of more than 40 locations. Last year, Amazon Air launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/amazon-launches-its-first-amazon-air-regional-hub-in-europe/"> European air hub</a> at Germany&#8217;s Leipzig/Halle Airport, a 215,000-square-foot facility that hosts two Amazon-branded Boeing 737-800 aircraft.</p>
<p>Amazon Air also has regional air hubs at airports in Texas, Puerto Rico and Florida in the U.S., and plans to expand to San Bernardino International Airport in California in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp users will finally be able to move their entire chat history between mobile operating systems &#8212; something that&#8217;s been one of users&#8217; biggest requests to date. The company today introduced a feature that will soon become available to users of both iOS and Android devices, allowing them to move their WhatsApp voice notes, photos and conversations securely between devices when they switch between mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>The company had been <a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1410974816216227847">rumored</a> to be working on such functionality for some time, but the details of which devices would be initially supported or when it would be released weren&#8217;t yet known.</p>
<p>In product leaks, WhatsApp had <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/26/whatsapp-chat-android-ios-data-transfer-tool/">appeared to be working on</a> an integration into Android&#8217;s built-in transfer app, the Google Data Transfer Tool, which lets users move their files from one Android device to another, or switch from iOS to Android.</p>
<p>The feature WhatsApp introduced today, however, works with Samsung devices and Samsung&#8217;s own transfer tool, known as <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smart-switch">Smart Switch</a>. Today, Smart Switch helps users transfer contacts, photos, music, messages, notes, calendars and more to Samsung Galaxy devices. Now, it will transfer WhatsApp chat history, too.</p>
<p>WhatsApp showed off the new tool at Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Unpacked event, and announced Samsung&#8217;s newest Galaxy foldable devices would get the feature first in the weeks to come. The feature will later roll out to Android more broadly. WhatsApp didn&#8217;t say when iOS users would gain access, but a spokesperson for WhatsApp told TechCrunch the team is working to bring the feature to users worldwide.</p>
<p>To use the feature, WhatsApp users will connect their old and new device via a USB-C to Lightning cable, and launch Smart Switch. The new phone will then prompt you to scan a QR code using your old phone and export your WhatsApp history. To complete the transfer, you&#8217;ll sign into WhatsApp on the new device and import the messages.</p>
<p>Building such a feature was non-trivial, the company also explained, as messages across its service are end-to-end encrypted by default and stored on users&#8217; devices. That meant the creation of a tool to move chat history between operating systems required additional work from both WhatsApp as well as operating system and device manufacturers in order to build it in a secure way, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Your WhatsApp messages belong to you. That&#8217;s why they are stored on your phone by default, and not accessible in the cloud like many other messaging services,&#8221; noted Sandeep Paruchuri, product manager at WhatsApp, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;We’re excited for the first time to make it easy for people to securely transfer their WhatsApp history from one operating system to another. This has been one of our most requested features from users for years and we worked together with operating systems and device manufacturers to solve it,&#8221; he added.</p>

		Jamil Wyne is a co-author of the World Bank report “The Evolution and State of Singapore’s Start-up Ecosystem: Lessons for Emerging Market Economies.” He is an adviser and investor focusing on high-impact entrepreneurship in emerging markets and has worked with the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, as well as numerous funds and startups focusing on developing countries.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Singapore is home to fewer than six million people, making it one of the smallest ASEAN countries, in terms of population. It is a young country as well — having gained independence in 1963 — and resides in a neighborhood with far larger economies, including China, Indonesia, and Vietnam. When the country first became independent, its mandate was to simply survive rather than thrive.</p>
<p>So how does a country evolve from a position of relative uncertainty, with comparatively few resources, to one that leads the ASEAN region in venture capital investment and has been home to 10 unicorns?</p>
<p>Countries around the world examine Singapore’s ecosystem from a distance, hoping to learn from, and emulate, its story. The World Bank Group recently published a report, <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35328">The Evolution and State of Singapore’s Start-up Ecosystem</a>, documenting the country’s experience in building its startup ecosystem and the challenges facing it.</p>
<p>This article presents an overview of the report’s key findings and offers a few key recommendations on what other countries can learn from Singapore’s experience, as well as what Singapore itself can do to maintain progress.</p>
<h2>A glimpse into Singapore’s current startup ecosystem</h2>
<p>As of 2019, Singapore had over <a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/preqin-markets-in-focus-private-equity-venture-capital-in-southeast-asia">$19 billion</a> in PE and VC assets under management, more than twice that of neighboring Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand combined. In that same year, the country was home to an estimated 3,600 tech startups and nearly 200 different intermediary and supporting organizations (accelerators, co-working spaces, coding academies, etc.) &#8211; some which have a multinational presence, such as Blk71, whose Singapore headquarters has been referred to as “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2014/01/16/all-together-now">the world’s most tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystem</a>.”</p>
<p>While assessing the size and strength of startup ecosystems is an evolving method, Start-up Genome priced Singapore’s ecosystem at over <a href="https://startupgenome.com/reports/global-startup-ecosystem-report-2019">$25 billion</a>, five times the global median.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most eye-catching hallmark of this ecosystem is its population of current and former unicorns. Collectively, Singapore has been home to ten unicorns, three of which have offered an IPO (Nanofilm, Razer and Sea) and two of which have been acquired &#8211; one by giant Alibaba (Lazada) and one by Chinese streaming powerhouse YY (Bigo Live). The remaining five are Trax, Acronis, JustCo, PatSnap, and Grab &#8211; the ASEAN region’s largest unicorn to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The education sector is also prominent in Singapore’s ecosystem. Universities like the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are deeply embedded into this ecosystem, helping with R&amp;D commercialization linkages, incubation, talent/knowledge transfer, and other areas.</p>
<h2>So, how did Singapore’s startup ecosystem come to be?</h2>
<p>Numerous factors have contributed to building Singapore’s startup ecosystem, with government intervention and leadership being the dominant driving forces. The government has spent more than <a href="https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/preqin-markets-in-focus-private-equity-venture-capital-in-southeast-asia">USD60 billion</a> over the past several decades to enhance the country’s R&amp;D infrastructure, create VC funds, and launch accelerators and other support organizations.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TechCrunch sponsors don’t just write a check; they bring their deep knowledge and expertise to the party to help early-stage founders move their business to the next level and beyond. Michael McCarthy, the CEO of Repositax, attended Disrupt 2020 and shared his thoughts on the breakout sessions with us:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was always something interesting going on in one of the breakout sessions, and I was impressed by the quality of the people participating. Partners in well-known VC firms spoke, they were accessible, and they shared smart, insightful nuggets. You will not find this level of people accessible and in one place anywhere else.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">Apple loosening App Store restrictions</a>, <a href="https://weedmaps.com">Weedmaps</a> users can now purchase cannabis within the popular app. This means Weedmaps users can browse, select and purchase cannabis and have it set for pick-up or delivery — all within the app. Previously, users could only locate and browse menus of local retailers thanks in part to restrictions by Apple and local and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>The updated app is now available.</p>
<p>The change comes after Apple opened up the App Store for some cannabis apps. Under the new guidance, licensed cannabis operators fall under the same restrictions (to Apple) as licensed pharmacies, allowing apps like Weedmaps, which lists licensed cannabis operators, to offer such services.</p>
<p>“Our ability to enable ordering functionality through our mobile iOS app is a game-changer that will improve accessibility for both our customers and business partners alike,” said Justin Dean, chief technology officer at WM Technology, Inc. “We commend companies like Apple that work with industry leaders to find solutions that drive innovation in our space. It’s encouraging to see policies and attitudes toward cannabis shift in a way that promises remarkable growth, and we look forward to introducing an even simpler way to order cannabis from retailers through our platform.”</p>
<p>Weedmaps sits at a unique position in the marketplace. As one of the leading cannabis apps, it&#8217;s already used throughout the country. Unlike competing delivery services, like Eaze, Weedmaps is not facilitating delivery. It’s only providing a platform for licensed delivery dispensaries to list their goods and services.</p>

<p>Under the new App Store restrictions, apps like Weedmaps must limit users to ordering within a geo-restricted area where cannabis sales are legal. This means if a user is living in a place where cannabis sales are illegal, they cannot order from a dispensary in a legal area.</p>
<p>Here’s the previous Apple App Store policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies), marijuana, or tobacco is not allowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s the updated policy as of June 7, with the changes highlighted in bold:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies and <strong>licensed or otherwise legal cannabis dispensaries</strong>), or tobacco is not allowed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Apps that provide services in highly-regulated fields (such as banking and financial services, healthcare, gambling, <strong>legal cannabis use</strong>, and air travel) or that require sensitive user information should be submitted by a legal entity that provides the services, and not by an individual developer. <strong>Apps that facilitate the legal sale of cannabis must be geo-restricted to the corresponding legal jurisdiction.</strong></p></blockquote>
