										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors has hired Daniel A. Ninivaggi, a longtime automotive executive and former head of Carl C. Icahn&#8217;s holding company, as CEO and a board member. The appointment follows months of tumult at Lordstown, which became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>In June, founder and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez resigned</a> following a disappointing first-quarter earnings that revealed the company was consuming more capital than expected and unable to reach previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">forecasted production numbers</a> for its electric Endurance pickup truck. The resignations were also tied to a board committee investigation that found inaccuracies in some of the company&#8217;s disclosures on its truck preorders.</p>
<p>The resignations were just one of several problems, including allegations of fraud and separate investigations by the Department of Justice and the SEC, that has put the two-year-old company at risk of failing. Lordstown did receive a lifeline in August when hedge fund YA II PN purchased 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares. The sale provided much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>Ninivaggi has the background to bring order to Lordstown&#8217;s business. He is also bullish on the company&#8217;s product, noting in a statement that the demand for full-size electric pickup trucks will be strong and that Lordstown&#8217;s Endurance truck has the opportunity to capture a meaningful share of the market.</p>
<p>The former CEO of Icahn Enterprises, has served in a variety of senior leadership positions in the automotive and transportation industries, beginning at Lear Corporation, where he eventually became executive vice president. He was later coo-chairman and co-CEO of automotive components supplier Federal Mogul Holdings Corporation ahead of its sale to Tenneco.</p>
<p>While with Icahn Enterprises, Ninivaggi also oversaw the company&#8217;s automotive aftermarket service network and parts distribution businesses. He also has a long history directing public companies, including Motorola Mobility (prior to its sale to Google), Navistar International, Hertz Global Holdings and CVR Energy.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Thiel&#8217;s AI company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palantir" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="11" data-v9y="1">Palantir</a>, whose clients have included the CIA and US immigration agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-03-feds-are-using-palantirs-tech-to-root-out-immigrants.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="12" data-v9y="1">ICE</a>, is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A new report claims a glitch in its secretive software program used by the FBI allowed unauthorized personnel to access private data for more than a year. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Post</em></a>, the mishap was revealed in a letter by prosecutors in the Manhattan federal court case against accused hacker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-01-crypto-expert-arrested-over-north-korea-sanctions.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Virgil Griffith</a>. Palantir denied the claims in a statement and said the fault was caused by the FBI&#8217;s incorrect use of the software.</p>
<p>Griffith was arrested in 2019 for allegedly providing North Korea with information on how cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could help it to evade US sanctions. The incident in question revolves around the alleged hacker&#8217;s social media data, obtained through a federal search warrant in March 2020. According to the letter, the Twitter and Facebook information was uploaded to Palantir&#8217;s program through the default settings, effectively allowing unauthorized FBI employees to access it</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Between May 2020 to August 2021, the material was accessed four times by three analysts and an agent. The FBI case agent assigned to Griffith&#8217;s case was alerted to the issue by a colleague earlier this month, according to the letter. Those who accessed the info reportedly told prosecutors that they did not recall using it in their investigations.</p>
<p>“An FBI analyst, in the course of conducting a separate investigation, had identified communications between the defendant and the subject of that other investigation by means of searches on the Platform that accessed the Search Warrant Returns,” the letter noted.</p>
<p>Palantir is trying to distance itself from the issue. &#8220;There was no glitch in the software,&#8221; it told <em>The New York Post</em> in a statement, adding that the &#8220;customer&#8221; did not follow the &#8220;rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amid increasing growth, the last thing Palantir needs is a major PR crisis involving flaws in its software. Since going public last fall, the company has seen its revenues <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2021/Palantir-Reports-49-Revenue-Growth-US-Commercial-Revenue-Up-90-YY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">surge</a>, though it&#8217;s operational losses are also increasing. Palantir&#8217;s customers now span government agencies, tech stalwarts like<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-08-IBM-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Help-Businesses-Easily-Deploy-Powerful-and-Open-AI-Applications-Unlock-Valuable-Data-Across-Hybrid-Cloud-Environments" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"> IBM</a>and even mining group <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005373/en/Palantir-Technologies-and-Rio-Tinto-Sign-Multi-Year-Enterprise-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Rio Tinto</a>. Plus, it&#8217;s working with commercial space companies to manage a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg1dQjtN5jM&amp;ab_channel=Palantir" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">meta-constellation</a> of 237 satellites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Porsche Cars North America has added its entire U.S. inventory of new cars to its online marketplace as the company seeks to keep up with customer demands and the industry&#8217;s shift to digital commerce.</p>
<p>When the online marketplace Porsche Finder launched in May 2020, customers were only able to search for pre-owned and certified pre-owned vehicles using the tool. That platform, which lets customers search by vehicle model and generation as well as price, equipment, packages and colors, now includes all new vehicle inventory from its 193 U.S. dealerships.</p>
<p>The platform, which was developed by automaker&#8217;s Porsche Digital subsidiary and PCNA, also includes features that let customers estimate a trade-in value and a payment calculator to compare leasing and financing options from Porsche Financial Services.</p>
<p>Online platforms that allow customers to search for products are not new. As customers shift their shopping to online — a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic — digital platforms have become a critical tool for companies.</p>
<p>Established automakers like Porsche, however, have had to balance the demand of its customers and dealership network. Porsche doesn&#8217;t have a direct sales model like Tesla and new entrants Lucid Group and Rivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dealership is still at the center of everything we do,&#8221; PCNA President and CEO Kjell Gruner said in a recent interview. &#8220;At the dealership, we believe very much in personal interaction — in looking somebody in the eye, reading their body language. And, of course, our products are very physical.&#8221;</p>
<p>While all 193 dealers are participating in the Porsche Finder tool, Gruner acknowledged that this large group includes those who have been more cautious about the move toward digital commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You always have some more innovative people, some more cautious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;COVID &#8230; really prompted a willingness to go digital and to use those tools for their own advantage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a> has been on a mission to make environmental health hazards accessible to as many people as possible. Through its <a href="https://blog.breezometer.com/breezometers-air-quality-index">air quality index (AQI) calculations</a>, the Israel-based company can now identify the quality of air down to a few meters in dozens of countries. A partnership with Apple to include its data into the iOS Weather app along with its own popular apps delivers those metrics to hundreds of millions of users, and an API product allows companies to tap into its dataset for their own purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/breezometer-the-iphone-tool-that-measures-air-quality-raises-a-30m-series-c/">Right on the heels of a $30 million Series C round a few weeks ago</a>, the company is radially expanding its product from air quality into the real-time detection of wildfire perimeters with its new product, Wildfire Tracker.</p>
<p>The new product will take advantage of the company’s fusion of sensor data, satellite imagery, and local eyewitness reports to be able to identify the edges of wildfires in real-time. “People expect accurate wildfire information just as they expect accurate weather or humidity data,” Ran Korber, CEO and co-founder, said. “It has an immediate effect on their life.” He added further that BreezoMeter wants to “try to connect the dots between climate tech and human health.”</p>
<p>Fire danger zones will be indicated with polygonal boundaries marked in red, and as always, air quality data will be viewable in these zones and in surrounding areas.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192952" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192952" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/smoke-travel-US_BreezoMeter.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="337" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192952" class="wp-caption-text">BreezoMeter&#8217;s air quality maps can show the spread of wildfire pollution easily. Image Credits: BreezoMeter.</p></div></p>
<p>Korber emphasized that getting these perimeters accurate across dozens of countries was no easy feat. Sensors can be sparse, particularly in the forests where wildfires ignite. Meanwhile, satellite data that focuses on thermal imaging can be fooled. “We’re looking for abnormalities … many of the times you have these false positives,” Korber said. He gave an example of a large solar panel array which can look very hot with thermal sensors but obviously isn’t a fire.</p>
<p>The identified fire perimeters will be available for free to consumers on <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/air-quality-map/air-quality/">BreezoMeter’s air quality map website</a>, and will shortly come to the company’s apps as well. Later this year, these perimeters will be available from the company’s APIs for commercial customers. Korber hopes the API endpoints will give companies like car manufacturers the ability to forewarn drivers that they are approaching a conflagration.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature is just a continuation of BreezoMeter’s long-time expansion of its product. “When we started, it was just air quality … and only forecasting air pollution in Israel,” Korber said. “Almost every year since then, we expanded the product portfolio to new environmental hazards.” He pointed to the addition of pollen in 2018 and the increasingly global nature of the app.</p>
<p>Wildfire detection is an, ahem, hot area these days for VC investors. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">Cornea is a startup focused on helping firefighters identify and mitigate blazes</a>, while Perimeter wants to help identify boundaries of wildfires and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">give explicit evacuation instructions complete with maps</a>. As Silicon Valley’s home state of California and much of the world increasingly become a tinderbox for fires, expect more investment and products to enter this area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finding the right learning platform can be difficult, especially as companies look to upskill and reskill their talent to meet demand for certain technological capabilities, like data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence roles.</p>
<p><a href="http://workera.ai/">Workera.ai</a>’s approach is to personalize learning plans with targeted resources — both technical and nontechnical roles — based on the current level of a person’s proficiency, thereby closing the skills gap.</p>
<p>The Palo Alto-based company secured $16 million in Series A funding, led by New Enterprise Associates, and including existing investors Owl Ventures and AI Fund, as well as individual investors in the AI field like Richard Socher, Pieter Abbeel, Lake Dai and Mehran Sahami.</p>
<p>Kian Katanforoosh, Workera’s co-founder and CEO, says not every team is structured or feels supported in their learning journey, so the company comes at the solution from several angles with an assessment on mentorship, where the employee wants to go in their career and what skills they need for that, and then Workera will connect those dots from where the employee is in their skillset to where they want to go. Its library has more than 3,000 micro-skills and personalized learning plans.</p>
<p>“It is what we call precision upskilling,” he told TechCrunch. “The skills data then can go to the organization to determine who are the people that can work together best and have a complementary skill set.”</p>

<p>Workera was founded in 2020 by Katanforoosh and James Lee, COO, after working with Andrew Ng, Coursera co-founder and Workera’s chairman. When Lee first connected with Katanforoosh, he knew the company would be able to solve the problem around content and basic fundamentals of upskilling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It raised a $5 million seed round last October to give the company a total of $21 million raised to date. This latest round was driven by the company’s go-to-market strategy and customer traction after having acquired over 30 customers in 12 countries.</p>
<p>Over the past few quarters, the company began working with Fortune 500 companies, including Accenture and Siemens Energy, across industries like professional services, medical devices and energy, Lee said. As <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/are-we-losing-jobs-effect-of-artificial-intelligence-in-workforce/">spending on AI skills</a> is expected to exceed $79 billion by 2022, he says Workera will assist in closing the gap.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a need to measure skills,” he added. “The size of the engagements are a sign as is the interest for tech and non-tech teams to develop AI literacy, which is a more pressing need.”</p>

<p>As a result, it was time to increase the engineering and science teams, Katanforoosh said. He plans to use the new funding to invest in more talent in those areas and to build out new products. In addition, there are a lot of natural language processes going on behind the scenes, and he wants the company to better understand it at a granular level so that the company can assess people more precisely.</p>
<p>Carmen Chang, general partner and head of Asia at NEA, said she is a limited partner in Ng’s AI fund and in Coursera, and has looked at a lot of his companies.</p>
<p>She said she is “very excited” to lead the round and about Workera’s concept. The company has a good understanding of the employee skill set, and with the tailored learning program, will be able to grow with company needs, Chang added.</p>
<p>“You can go out and hire anyone, but investing in the people that you have, educating and training them, will give you a look at the totality of your employees,” Chang said. “Workera is able to go in and test with AI and machine learning and map out the skill sets within a company so they will be able to know what they have, and that is valuable, especially in this environment.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tuna is on a mission to "fine tune" the payments space in Latin America.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tuna is on a mission to &#8220;fine tune&#8221; the payments space in Latin America and has raised two seed rounds totaling $3 million, led by Canary and by Atlantico.</p>
<p>Alex Tabor, Paul Ascher and Juan Pascual met each other on the engineering team of Peixe Urbano, a company Tabor co-founded and he referred to as a “Groupon for Brazil.” While there, they came up with a way to use A/B testing to create a way of dealing with payments in different markets.</p>
<p>They eventually left Peixe Urbano and started Tuna in 2019 to make their own payment product which enables merchants to use A/B testing of credit card processors and anti-fraud providers to optimize their payments processing with one integration and a no-code interface.</p>
<p>Tabor explained that the e-commerce landscape in Latin America was consolidated, meaning few banks controlled more of the market. The address verification system merchants use to verify a purchaser is who they say they are, involves sending information to a bank that is returned to the merchant with a score of whether that match is legitimate.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., that score is used to determine if the purchaser is legit, but they didn’t implement that in Latin America,” he added. “Instead, merchants in Latam have to tap into other organizations that have that data.”</p>
<p>That process involves manual analysis and constant adjusting due to fraud. Instead, Tuna’s A/B tests between processors and anti-fraud providers in real time and provides a guarantee that a decision to swap providers is based on objective data that considers all components of performance, like approval rates, and not just fees.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the company added 12 customers and saw its revenue increase 15%. It boasts a customer list that includes the large Brazilian fashion chain Riachuelo, and its platform integrates with others including VTEX, Magento and WooCommerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445865/e-commerce-share-of-retail-sales-in-latam/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20e%2Dcommerce%20sales,surpassing%20seven%20percent%20by%202023.">share of e-commerce in overall retail</a> is less than 10 percent in Latin America. Marcos Toledo, Canary’s managing partner, said via email that e-commerce in Latam is currently at an inflexion point: not only has the global pandemic driven more online purchases, but also fintech innovation that has occurred in recent years.</p>
<p>In Brazil alone, e-commerce sales grew 73.88% in 2020, but Toledo said there was much room for improvement. What Tuna is building will help companies navigate the situation and make it easier for more customers to buy online.</p>
<p>Toledo met the Tuna team from his partner, Julio Vasconcellos, who was one of the co-founders of Peixe Urbano. When the firm heard that the other Tuna co-founders were starting a business that was applying some of the optimization methods they had created at Peixe Urbano, but for every company, they saw it as an opportunity to get involved.</p>
<p>“The vast tech expertise that Alex, Paul and Juan bring to a very technical business is something that we really admire, as well as their vision to create a solution that can impact companies throughout Latin America,” Toledo said. “The no-code solution that Tuna is building is exciting because it is scalable and can help companies not only get better margins, but also drive their developers to other efforts — and developers have been a very scarce workforce in the region.”</p>
<p>To meet demand for an <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">e-commerce industry that surpassed $200 billion in 2020</a>, Tuna plans to use the new funding to build out its team and grow outbound customer success and R&amp;D, Tabor said.</p>
<p>Up next, he wants to be able to show traction in payments optimization and facilitators in Brazil before moving on to other countries. He has identified Mexico, Colombia and Argentina as potential new markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wildfires are burning in countries all around the world. California is dealing with some of the worst wildfires in its history (a superlative that I use essentially every year now) with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/us/caldor-fire-updates.html">Caldor fire</a> and others blazing in the state’s north. Meanwhile, Greece and other Mediterranean nations have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-fires-environment-and-nature-greece-45f2b0b79269afdc65d5e1ed43b9df80">fighting fires for weeks to bring a number of massive blazes under control</a>.</p>
<p>With the climate increasingly warming, millions of home just in the United States alone are sitting in zones at high risk for wildfires. Insurance companies and governments are putting acute pressure on homeowners to invest more in defending their homes in what is typically dubbed “hardening,” or ensuring that if fires do arrive, a home has the best chance to survive and not spread the disaster further.</p>
<p>SF-based <a href="https://www.firemaps.co">Firemaps</a> has a bold vision for rapidly scaling up and solving the problem of home hardening by making a complicated and time-consuming process as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded just a few months ago in March, sends out a crew with a drone to survey a homeowner’s house and property if it is in a high-risk fire zone. Within 20 minutes, the team will have generated a high-resolution 3D model of the property down to the centimeter. From there, hardening options are identified and bids are sent out to trade contractors to perform the work on the company’s marketplace.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192981" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192981" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="314" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=1536,710 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=2048,946 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-CAD-Ortho.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192981" class="wp-caption-text">Once the drone scans a house, Firemaps can create a full CAD model of the structure and the nearby property. Image Credits: Firemaps.</p></div></p>
<p>While early, it’s already gotten traction. In addition to hundreds of homeowners who have signed up on its website and a few dozen that have been scanned, Andrew Chen of A16Z has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1861156/000186115621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">led a $5.5 million seed round</a> into the business (the Form D <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1861156/000186115621000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">places the round sometime around April</a>). Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Addition’s Lee Fixel also participated.</p>
<p>Firemaps is led by Jahan Khanna, who co-founded it along with his brother, who has a long-time background in civil engineering, and Rob Moran. Khanna was co-founder and CTO of early ride-sharing startup Sidecar, where Moran joined as one of the company’s first employees. The trio spent cycles exploring how to work on climate problems, while staying focused on helping people in the here and now. “We have crossed certain thresholds [with the climate] and we need to get this problem under control,” Khanna said. “We are one part of the solution.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past few years Khanna and his brother explored opening a solar farm or a solar-powered home in California. “What was wild, whenever we talked to someone, is they said you cannot build anything in California since it will burn down,” Khanna said. “What is kind of the endgame of this?” As they explored fire hardening, they realized that millions of homeowners needed faster and cheaper options, and they needed them sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>While there are dozens of options to harden a home to fire, some popular options include constructing an ember-free zone within a few feet of a home, often by placing gravel made of granite on the ground, as well as ensuring that attic vents, gutters, and siding are fireproof and can withstand high temperatures. These options can vary widely in cost, although some local and state governments have created reimbursement programs to allow homeowners to recoup at least some of the expenses of these improvements.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192983" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192983" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192983" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Rendering-Front-with-Labels.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192983" class="wp-caption-text">A Firemaps house in 3D model form with typical hardening options and associated prices. Image Credits: Firemaps.</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s business model is simple: vetted contractors pay Firemaps to be listed as an option on its platform. Khanna believes that because its drone offers a comprehensive model of a home, contractors will be able to bid for contracts without doing their own site visits. “These contractors are getting these shovel-ready projects, and their acquisition costs are basically zero,” Khanna said.</p>
<p>Long-term, “our operating hypothesis is that building a platform and building these models of homes is inherently valuable,” Khanna said. Right now, the company is launched in California, and the goal for the next year is to “get this model repeatable and scalable and that means doing hundreds of homes per week,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud security startup Monad, which offers a platform for extracting and connecting data from various security tools, has launched from stealth with $17 million in Series A funding led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/index-ventures/">Index Ventures</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Monad was founded on the belief that enterprise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> is a growing data management challenge, as organizations try to understand and interpret the masses of information that&#8217;s siloed within disconnected logs and databases. Once an organization has extracted data from their security tools, Monad&#8217;s <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Security Data Platform </span>enables them to centralize that data within a data warehouse of choice, and normalize and enrich the data so that security teams have the insights they need to secure their systems and data effectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security is fundamentally a big data problem,” said Christian Almenar, CEO and co-founder of Monad. “Customers are often unable to access their security data in the streamlined manner that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/devops/">DevOps</a> and cloud engineering teams need to build their apps quickly while also addressing their most pressing security and compliance challenges. We founded Monad to solve this security data challenge and liberate customers’ security data from siloed tools to make it accessible via any data warehouse of choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup’s Series A funding round, which was also backed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sequoia-capital/">Sequoia Capital</a>, brings its total amount of investment raised to  $19 million and comes 12 months after its Sequoia-led seed round. The funds will enable Monad to scale its development efforts for its security data cloud platform, the startup said.</p>
<p>Monad was founded in May 2020 by security veterans Christian Almenar and Jacolon Walker. Almenar previously co-founded serverless security startup Intrinsic which was acquired by VMware in 2019, while Walker served as CISO and security engineer at OpenDoor, Collective Health, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/palantir/">Palantir</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The idea for the company was driven by Missouri almost closing its one abortion clinic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more states pass some type of abortion ban, <a href="https://www.heyjane.co/">Hey Jane</a>, a virtual clinic startup offering telemedicine abortion care, announced Thursday that it raised $2.2 million in an oversubscribed round from a group of investors, including Koa Lab, Gaingels and Foursight Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The idea for the remote-first company stemmed from a conversation in 2019 that founder and CEO Kiki Freedman had with some friends regarding Missouri being one of six states that has one abortion clinic left. Freedman, who goes by a nickname to avoid violence against abortion providers, explained that, in fact, the clinic was slated for closure that summer, which would have meant Missouri was the first state to not have any abortion care. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/29/ruling-saves-missouri-abortion-clinic/">The clinic was ultimately able to stay open</a>.</p>
<p>“At the time, many of the emerging telemedicine clinics I saw were focused on men’s wellness and didn’t talk about women’s health,” Freedman told TechCrunch. “I thought this virtual model could be used for safe and discreet abortion care.”</p>
<p>One of Hey Jane’s investors, who wished to remain publicly anonymous, &#8220;was excited to invest in Freedman and Hey Jane&#8221; because he agreed — women&#8217;s health was an underserved category. Unlike men&#8217;s healthcare, abortion care is segregated from women&#8217;s health care. This stemmed from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/30/us/reagan-bars-mention-of-abortion-at-clinics-receiving-us-money.html">Reagan&#8217;s mandates separating abortion care from hospitals</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-pacific-southwest/blog/1-in-4-american-women-will-have-an-abortion-by-age-45">One in four women will have an abortion</a> by age 45, according to Planned Parenthood. However, just in 2021, over 90 abortion restrictions were enacted in the United States, and there are 1,320 restrictions in total, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/07/state-policy-trends-midyear-2021-already-worst-legislative-year-ever-us-abortion">according to The Guttmacher Institute</a>, a nonprofit research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. Currently, Arkansas and Oklahoma have near-total abortion bans except when a patient’s life is endangered. Meanwhile, Idaho, South Carolina and Texas ban abortion at either six weeks or with very limited exceptions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What top VCs look for in women&#8217;s fertility startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/what-top-vcs-look-for-in-womens-fertility-startups/embed/#?secret=TtXJMojzuz" data-secret="TtXJMojzuz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In July 2020, a federal judge <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/federal-judge-rules-women-can-get-abortion-pill-without-doctor-visits">granted approval</a> for women to obtain abortion medication without having to see a doctor, which opened the door for companies, like Hey Jane and others, to begin offering “no touch” services for people who were less than 10 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>The $249 treatment includes screening by a medical doctor, FDA-approved medication prescribed and shipped overnight to the person’s house, follow-up virtual visits and the ability to chat with a doctor during the entire process. The Hey Jane team also checks in frequently with the patient via text message.</p>
<p>The company said removing financial barriers is “a huge priority for us.” Though the company does not accept insurance yet, it is offering financial assistance through a nonprofit abortion fund partner, Reprocare. This organization subsidizes up to $110 of the $249 treatment so that patients can pay as little as $139 for treatment.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Hey Jane to expand into new states and add to its team of seven to build out the product and automated process and for legal research so the company can stay abreast of telemedicine laws and telemedicine abortion laws for each state.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are several regulatory requirements Hey Jane must follow in each state, including ensuring that clinicians only provide care to patients in states in which they’re licensed. For this reason, the company has clinicians licensed in each state in which it operates who are ready to prescribe medication when appropriate. It also has on-demand experts for emotional relief.</p>
<p>Hey Jane just launched across California this week and is also in New York and Washington. This means that Hey Jane’s service areas now cover up to 34% of all abortions performed annually in the United States, Freedman said. Those states were chosen first because California and New York have the<a href="https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?topics=66+65&amp;dataset=data&amp;state=AL+AK+AZ+AR+CA+CO+CT+DE+DC+FL+GA+HI+ID+IL+IN+IA+KS+KY+LA+ME+MD+MA+MI+MN+MS+MO+MT+NE+NV+NH+NJ+NM+NY+NC+ND+OH+OK+OR+PA+RI+SC+SD+TN+TX+UT+VT+VA+WA+WV+WI+WY"> highest number of abortions performed annually</a>, she added.</p>
<p>“Although people in those states may have easier access to clinics, they could still strongly benefit from treatment with Hey Jane since it’s as safe and effective and half the price of in-clinic care,” Freedman said. “It doesn’t require costs, or time for travel or child care, ensures privacy and discretion and provides additional layers of emotional support.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It&#8217;s a new era for fertility tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/its-a-new-era-for-fertility-tech/embed/#?secret=EZgKaBIIJE" data-secret="EZgKaBIIJE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Freedman expects to be in 10 states by the end of the year and plans to be able to offer treatment in all 50 states in coming years. However, there are regulatory barriers <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion">limiting access to telemedicine abortion in 19 states</a>. Hey Jane is partnering with the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health research group out of the University of California at San Francisco to gather information to this end.</p>
<p>“We are working with leading researchers to expand the ample existing evidence that this modality of care is safe, effective and preferred by patients,” she added. “We hope this research can further advance discussions in more restrictive states, ultimately leading to much needed, patient-centric updates to outdated regulations. Existing data on the safety and effectiveness of telemedicine abortion paints a very clear picture that this is the future of abortion care.”</p>
<p>The company is currently seeing 250% quarterly growth in the number of patients using the service. As it has grown, it is focusing more on additional tools for coordinated care and new products.</p>
<p>Abortions are often kept secret due to<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226417"> worries of judgment and discrimination</a>, and Hey Jane will provide a much-needed outlet for patients to discreetly share their experiences and emotion, Freedman said.</p>
<p>“We are focusing on convenience and privacy,” she added. “Two-thirds of women don’t want to talk about their experience, so we want to provide a space for them.”</p>
<p><em>Matters of women&#8217;s health are highly personal. If you or someone you know is struggling with a private women&#8217;s health concern, please contact your primary care physician or secular community health clinic for more information.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sugarliving.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that aims to turn apartment buildings into “interactive communities,” has closed on $2.5 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slew of investors participated in the financing, including MetaProp, Agya Ventures, Concrete Rose, Debut Capital, The Community Fund, Consonance Capital, Lightspeed Scout Fund and Jason Calacanis&#8217; LAUNCH syndicate. Also participating were angel investors such as SquareFoot CEO Jonathan Wasserstrum, Ben Zises, Diran Otegbade, Oleksiy Ignatyev and Zillow board member Claire Cormier Thielke, also of Sequoia Scout Fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mali-born Fatima Dicko founded Los Angeles-based Sugar in March 2020. As people began quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dicko saw an opportunity to help make it easier for people living in apartments and residential communities to “engage with one another in a safe and efficient way.” So she partnered with real estate investment groups and property management companies to build an app for residents of apartments and those communities who might be feeling isolated and disconnected from their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most residential apps are clunky, outdated and a pain to use. Tasks as simple as paying rent, communicating with your property manager or unlocking doors are cumbersome and tedious,” Dicko said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194197" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194197" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194197 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?w=228" alt="" width="249" height="328" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=114,150 114w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=228,300 228w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=768,1010 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=517,680 517w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FatimaHeadshot-1.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO and founder Fatima Dicko / Sugar</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, feeling isolated and disconnected from neighbors can also contribute to resident turnover, negative online reviews and, ultimately, decreased revenue for building owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Dicko set about creating an app that not only gives residents a way to interact with other residents, but also do things like unlock doors without keys, submit maintenance requests and pay their rent. The platform has since grown beyond a pandemic-related use case. Today, the startup has clients globally, including residential communities of varying sizes, real estate investment groups, Airbnb rentals, hotels and other types of residential properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar&#8217;s product has two components. One is a mobile app for residents and the other is a web-based dashboard for building owners and managers. The mobile app is sold directly to building owners and/or managers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property managers also have access to the management dashboard to monitor resident engagement metrics and track online ratings and reviews of properties within their portfolios.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to closing the seed round, Sugar achieved “consistent” month-over-month growth resulting in six-figure ARR (annual recurring revenue) just four months after launch, according to Dicko. As of now, Sugar has begun rollout to certain properties within the portfolios of early customers, such as Equilibrium Real Estate Investment Group, CGI Investment group and Apartment Management Consultants (AMC). Combined, the firms manage over 655 properties and 150,000 active doors in 22 states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar has also secured 90-day pilots with major property management companies such as Bozzuto, which manages over 78,000 residences and is seeking to boost resident engagement, Dicko said.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Leading VCs discuss how COVID-19 is impacting real estate &#038; proptech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/leading-vcs-discuss-how-covid-19-is-impacting-real-estate-proptech/embed/#?secret=FasIbUXOuR" data-secret="FasIbUXOuR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its ability to integrate keyless entry hardware products into a community engagement dashboard is a point of differentiation for Sugar, according to Dicko. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our consumer app is sticky, which benefits users and owners. Sugar believes that access control is the most important feature in order to increase usage of the platform,” she said. “Because the product can plug into hardware and enable users to unlock doors and share digital keys from inside the app, this will enable increased product adoption leading to more engagement inside the community portal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said another big differentiator is the ability to integrate into a building’s current hardware or software stack. Prior to attending Stanford Business School, Dicko spent several years as a senior product engineer at Procter &amp; Gamble. It was there that she says she got excited about the idea of creating new solutions to solve old problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sugar currently has nine full-time employees compared to two employees last year. It plans to make key hires in both engineering and sales with its new capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kunal Lunawat of Agya Ventures said his firm was impressed with Dicko’s “tenacity, drive and ability to attract and assess good talent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone talks about community in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">residential buildings but no one is building a product that specifically solves for it,” he said. “The focus on community rests central to Sugar&#8217;s ethos, and that is why several of the world&#8217;s leading property managers are flocking to their software.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michael Chernow is already known as a restaurateur, chef, television host and entrepreneur, but now he can also add lifestyle and wellness guru to that list.</p>
<p>Chernow raised $2.2 million to launch <a href="https://kreaturesofhabit.com">Kreatures of Habit</a>, a lifestyle and wellness brand, with the goal of helping people establish healthy habits.</p>
<p>Seasoned entrepreneur and investor Gary Vaynerchuk led the funding round and was joined by a group of entrepreneurs, media executives and professional sports figures, including Sports 1 Marketing co-founder David Meltzer, Elevator Studio founder Dan Fleyshman, author Dean Graziosi, angel investor Josh Bezoni, author Joel Marion, “Entrepreneurs on Fire” host John Lee Dumas, LA Dodgers player Justin Turner, Philadelphia Eagles general manager Howie Roseman and Evan Yurman.</p>
<p>The idea for Kreatures of Habit stemmed from Chernow’s own life, celebrating 17 years of sobriety. He said he adopted positive habits that enabled him to replace alcohol with nutrition and fitness.</p>
<p>It is the latest venture for Chermow, who also founded The Meatball Shop and Seamore’s in New York. The brand originally started out as a café concept, but Chermow pivoted to the consumer goods space when the global pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“I had put a plan together in 2019, was away for a few weeks when the news of COVID hit,” he told TechCrunch. “I called up my investors and said ‘I am not going to invest in this and neither should you. I’m going to reassess and get back to you.’ However, through my journey of scaling restaurants, I didn’t love doing it because I went from being a culture entrepreneur to a project manager. It was a far cry from connecting to human beings around a brand.”</p>
<p>He started with breakfast — his favorite meal of the day — and began looking at his sustenance of choice: oatmeal, protein and vitamins. Now he is targeting the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/02/17/1985687/0/en/Oatmeal-Market-to-Reach-USD-3-32-Billion-by-2026-Launch-of-Innovative-and-Flavorful-Variants-of-Breakfast-Cereals-to-Contribute-Positive-Revenue-says-Fortune-Business-Insights.html">$3.3 billion pre-packed oats market</a> with his first product, a direct-to-consumer instant oatmeal called The PrOATagonist.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194139" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194139" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194139" class="wp-caption-text">Kreatures of Habit oatmeal. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kreatures of Habit</p></div></p>
<p>It is a plant-based, gluten and allergen-free meal that has his three favorite breakfast go-tos — oats, protein and vitamins, plus minerals and Omega-3 fatty acids. Chernow spent over a year testing the formula, which comes in three flavors, including chocolate, blueberry-banana and vanilla.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To help Chernow tap into the industry, he brought on former RX Bar chief marketing officer Victor Lee to lead the brand’s go-to-market strategy. The PrOATagonist comes in a box of seven for $34, and can be obtained via a monthly subscription of $33.</p>

<p>He is also working with one of his investors, Elevator Studios’ Fleyshman, who Chernow referred to as “the best marketer today.”</p>
<p>Fleyshman said he was eager to invest after getting off of a Zoom call with Vaynerchuk.</p>
<p>“The combination of Michael’s resume and passion to build a business with Gary’s passion for building a brand had its advantages as did the cool factor of making a brand with a physical product,” he added. “Gary got 30 people together on the call and almost half had committed within the week.”</p>
<p>In addition to funneling much of the new funding into marketing, it will also be used on product development.</p>
<p>“We have a pipeline of products that will live in the beginning of the day and snack space, several that are in development right now,” Chernow added. “We will always have a capsule collection drop three times a year, a seasonal line and full suite of SKUs over the next three to five years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">It isn’t only tech giants that are struggling to fill open roles with talented individuals</a>, it’s your local Jamba Juice, too.</p>
<p>Since 2017, San Francisco-based<a href="https://www.workstream.us/"> Workstream</a> has been working on an answer to recruitment for the hourly worker. The subset of employees are in high demand right now by employers <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/hire-hourly-workers-turnover-rises.aspx#:~:text=Respondents%20reported%20the%20annual%20turnover,increase%20in%20turnover%20for%20managers.">managing high turnover, </a>as the labor market evolves amid the pandemic. These tailwinds in mind, Workstream announced today that it has landed a new round of financing to scale its recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Workstream has raised $48 million in a Series B round co-led by Mary Meeker’s BOND and Coatue, with notable investors including Zoom CEO Eric Yuan and DoorDash CEO Tony Xu. Jay Simons, a GP at BOND and former president of Atlassian, joined Workstream’s board of directors. The raise comes a little over one year since<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/workstream-a-platform-for-deskless-work-raises-10-million-to-serve-local-businesses/"> Workstream raised $10 million in a Series A </a>led by Founders Fund.</p>
<p>Per CEO and co-founder Desmond Lim, Workstream landed 12 term sheets in 9 days. He chalked up the interest to investors appreciating his startup&#8217;s differentiation among the flurries of other recruiting tools out there.</p>
<p>Even in the crowded world of recruitment software, Workstream has been able to carve out some attention for itself by focusing on text-based recruiting. Front-line and deskless workers are often the most disconnected members of the global job force due to a lack of access to company-issued e-mail addresses. Thus, by Workstream communicating with candidates over text, it is able to give workers on the go some real-time updates. This differentiation of mobile-based recruitment has helped bring down the time to hire for employers too, by bringing candidates in by going to where they already are.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2194277 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg" alt="" width="494" height="879" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mobile.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>Lim, who grew up in Singapore with parents who both spent their days as hourly workers, sees this strategy working. In July, his company filled more than 18,000 jobs. Down the road, Workstream wants to serve hourly workers in healthcare and retail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s a football field [of software] for hiring software engineers,” Lim said. “But if you think about hiring for this space, there’s very few of us &#8211; and I think that has really helped us to go far from a team point of view, client sales, and even trying to raise funding.</p>
<p>While Workstream didn’t disclose specifics on revenue, it said that it has experienced “10X” ARR in the past year. One signal that it’s doing ok? The company has 1,500 customers across 10,000 different stores, which include the likes of McDonalds, Subway, and of course, Jamba Juice. Lim claims that Workstream has 20% market share in the top 20 brands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194276 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg 1559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,377 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,755 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Workstream views itself as an end-to-end recruitment tool for the hourly worker, but its distribution is still tied to the some 25,000 job boards that it partners with to post listings. Lim said that his company is more focused on the “recruitment and engagement” bit of hiring, “helping to push people through the funnel very fast” versus trying to get them in the funnel in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data is the new oil, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Humby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying goes</a>, and today a startup that is helping companies mine for it is announcing a major funding round to expand its business on the back of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atheneum.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atheneum</a>, which provides a platform for companies to conduct and analyze research sourced through virtual interviews and surveys with stakeholders (that is, research solutions that include qualitative expert consultations, quantitative surveys, and big data products to parse the results), has closed $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>CEO Mathias Wengeler said it plans to use the funds to continue expanding geographically, hiring more people for its teams, and building out its technology. Today Atheneum is used by some 500 large enterprises &#8212; with customers spanning verticals like life sciences, strategic consulting firms, investment services, and telecoms, media and tech firms &#8212; covering a network of some 680,000 experts and so-called opinion leaders and hundreds of thousands of surveys and interviews.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in Berlin a little over a decade ago and now has a second base in New York, and notably, it is already profitable. This funding &#8212; led by <a href="https://guidepostgrowth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://guidepostgrowth.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFbBDJDIBna40bE4TMWHu2pStcDLw">Guidepost Growth Equity</a> with participation from unnamed limited partners; existing investors <a href="https://www.crosslantic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.crosslantic.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPX3wFp8uM-Bn72Gw5tk8JG8At0w">Crosslantic Capital Management</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbrehm/?originalSubdomain=de" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelbrehm/?originalSubdomain%3Dde&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo_AgVTkoiw_7xCz5cvvpU8eL_CA">Michael Brehm</a>, <a href="https://www.vogel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vogel.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630047588848000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEensiF2cdSb0M6XoAb0TBuGdBlEg">Vogel Communications Group</a>; and Atheneum&#8217;s founding management team &#8212; thus is coming opportunistically to jump on what has been strong growth for the startup, especially in the last year: in 2020 the company grew nearly 50%, Wengeler said, and this year growth has bumped up to 80%.</p>
<p>Atheneum&#8217;s growth is coming on the back of two trends in the world of enterprise.</p>
<p>The first is a bigger shift to digital transformation that we&#8217;ve been witnessing, spurred by the enforced remote working practices that came out of Covid-19. Specifically, companies need tools to let them continue carrying out work in more virtualised formats, and Atheneum has created a framework for those that have typically sourced data through live interactions to keep doing that using tools like Zoom, online surveys, and cloud-based analytics to &#8220;read&#8221; and better understand all the resulting data.</p>
<p>The second trend is that companies making strategic decisions based on data and feedback from the field are increasingly wanting to tap into innovations in data science and technology overall to increase their access to more data and insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This second trend has been growing for years and predates the pandemic, which is also one of the reasons investors have been knocking: these are trends that go beyond circumstantial ones that might evolve when/if we return back to our more traditional work patterns). Wengeler and his co-founders Ammad Ahmad and Marta Margolis (pictured above) all previously worked in management consulting, and Wengeler said that he was moved to start Atheneum to more directly address that opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Primary and raw data were out there already,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but their importance is increasing. What a doctor sees [firsthand] has a major impact on how a pharmaceutical company plans its strategy for commercialization and more, and that is different in every country. I felt that the world was getting more internationalized and we needed more raw data, we needed more market research. We see Atheneum as a platform for knowledge, based on being a one-stop-shop for primary research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roshen Menon, who led the investment for Guidepost, also notes that is also a reflection of how companies themselves have evolved to build more specialized products.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the fundamental shift has been from a reliance on secondary to primary research,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Companies want to do their research directly. The second shift in the broader research tech space has the long and broad research approach. Things have gotten more specialized. &#8216;Let&#8217;s take a survey and understand this specific problem.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In life sciences, we have seen a shift from blockbuster drugs to specialized research and medicine and treatments for so-called orphan diseases. And there is much more of that across all industries. Services like Atheneum&#8217;s really allow customers to get access and insights from a sea of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of this, presenting this platform as a SaaS-style cloud service, which combines both technology and human interaction to better tailor it to the needs of the clients as needed &#8212; and of course alongside the humans who are providing the raw data in the first place &#8212; fits in with how a lot of businesses want to engage with technology and IT services these days.</p>
<p>That will mean an increasing number of competitors to Atheneum that will be looking to leverage their own reach and tools to dive deeper into the &#8216;research as a service&#8217; space. That could include more activity from survey and direct marketing companies like SurveyMonkey or MailChimp, or even companies like Saleforce or Microsoft&#8217;s LinkedIn that want to build an ever-bigger set of tools to help people do business more efficiently.</p>
<p>Or even companies like Google, which up to now have focused surveys more on consumer responses that are sold as advertising units (you may have come across these on sites like YouTube), but obviously have a big opportunity to build more cloud-based services to cater to their growing roster of business customers that might better leverage their in-house big data and AI capabilities. Wengeler said that up to now, LinkedIn has been one of the more active and interesting players in building new tools that might most directly compete with what it builds.</p>
<p>It is nonetheless a big opportunity: Atheneum cites figures from Deloitte that estimate the data and intelligence market is worth some $22 billion currently.</p>
<p>Atheneum, partly as a result of raising relatively little money previously and partly a result of focusing just on its growth and client business, has been somewhat under the radar until now. To that end, it is not disclosing its valuation today. But as an indicator of where it might be, Wengeler confirmed that the startup had raised less than $20 million previously, and that this latest investment gives new backers a minority stake with the founders remaining the biggest shareholders in the company.</p>
<p>Menon, who is taking a board seat with this round, added in an interview that Atheneum is making &#8220;well north&#8221; of $50 million in revenue annually.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The acquisition of GrocerKey, which brings on board the company’s front-end consumer-facing sales engine and predictive analytics, puts the data and brand recognition back in the retailer’s hands. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point Pickup Technologies, a last-mile delivery service, has acquired white label e-commerce platform GrocerKey for $42 million, according to the company. With the acquisition, Point Pickup now allows retailers to offer same-day delivery, from purchase to fulfillment to delivery, under their own brand name, rather than under third parties like Instacart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instacart made a killing delivering groceries and goods for retailers during the coronavirus pandemic, with a</span><a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/instacart-statistics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated revenue of $1.5 billion in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and $35 billion worth of sales. The company has an estimated 9.6 million active users and over 500,000 “shoppers” who pick up and deliver goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New entrants to the same-day delivery space are cropping up, which aligns with the expected growth of the industry to $20.36 billion by 2027, </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/07/2242542/0/en/Same-Day-Delivery-Market-to-Garner-20-36-Billion-by-2027-Says-Allied-Market-Research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Allied Market Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But companies like Amazon and Instacart that perform this service and host a delivery marketplace get far more than sales revenues – they also get all the customer data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Fiorita, founder and CEO of Point Pickup, says retailers should have a right to own that data themselves. The acquisition of GrocerKey, which brings on board the company’s front-end consumer-facing sales engine and predictive analytics, puts the data and brand recognition back in the retailer’s hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you are a customer of Instacart, you pay them a subscription, they own your buying habits, your credit cards, your data,” Fiorita told TechCrunch. “Instacart was a big thing during COVID because no one had delivery. So now retailers woke up and said, ‘Oh my god, I can’t just have an Instacart-like marketplace be selling my goods. I don’t know who my customers are, I don’t have their credit cards or data.’ And you know data runs the world now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recent, if not smaller, entrant to the space is Canadian startup <a href="https://www.tyltgo.com/">Tyltgo</a>, which operates under a similar model to what Point Pickup is now offering via GrocerKey’s technology. In both cases, the buyer goes directly onto the merchant’s platform and places the order through them, so it feels like they’re interacting with the brand they purchased from. And on Tuesday,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/walmart-announces-golocal-a-last-mile-delivery-service-for-other-retailers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Walmart also announced a new white-label delivery service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow other merchants to tap into its own delivery platform to get orders to their customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiorita founded Point Pickup in 2015 as a reaction to Amazon’s increased omnipotence with the noble, if not naive, mission to “save local America.” Walmart and Kroger, two of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., are Point Pickup’s top customers, alongside other nationwide retailers like Albertsons, Giant Eagle and more. But Fiorita believes the service his company is offering will be even more impactful when it starts to work its way down to the mid-sized and small- to medium-sized businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We built this not only to survive against Amazon or Instacart, but because these small businesses need this for their survival,” Fiorita said. “These companies will no longer survive if they continue to allow other companies to sell their merchandise and to own their customer, including the data, the advertising, the CPG dollars and everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point Pickup offers deliveries of everything from grocery to general merchandise, pharmacy and oversized delivery. It has a network of 350,000 gig economy drivers across 25,000 ZIP codes in all 50 states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company’s network of drivers, who often pick and pack the products for the customer as well as deliver the goods, comprises all gig workers with their own vehicles, Point Pickup doesn’t have a clear picture of the percentage of its fleet that’s electric or hybrid. Fiorita speculates it’s probably on par with nationwide rates, if not higher. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/03/electric-vehicles-get-mixed-reception-from-american-consumers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Pew Research report found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 7% of Americans say they own an EV or hybrid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiorita said that the type of car drivers own is taken into account during recruitment and that the company is looking for ways to incentivize drivers to buy less polluting vehicles. He also said Point Pickup is a vehicle-agnostic platform, meaning it’s piloting other delivery vessels like drones and autonomous robots.</span></p>
<p>To compete with the big dogs in the space like Amazon and Walmart, both of which are either testing or already have in place electric delivery vans, Point Pickup will have to also make efforts to beef up its strategy in the carbon emissions space.</p>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s last launch was its landmark first human flight, carrying Jeff Bezos, his brother, Wally Funk and Oliver Daemen to suborbital space. Today, it&#8217;s flying New Shepard again — without any people on board, this time, but with a key payload from NASA that will test technologies the agency is using to develop a human landing system for future missions to the Moon.</p>
<p>The NS-17 launch (which stands for New Shepard 17, since it&#8217;s the 17th time Blue Origin&#8217;s fully reusable suborbital rocket will be taking off) is set to take place at 9:35 AM EDT (6:35 AM PDT) from the company&#8217;s launch site in West Texas. The NASA payload on board will test technologies including a Doppler Lidar sensor array that should help future lunar landing craft get a very detailed picture of the details of the landing zone they&#8217;re targeting, and a Descent Landing Computer that handles processing of the sensor data. Blue Origin flew elements of this system once before, last October, and improvements have already been made based on that test that are integrated into this version.</p>
<p>The Blue Origin capsule also carries a number of other experiments, both form NASA and from academic institutions including the University of Florida. The launch plan includes a take-off, separation of the capsule, a controlled return powered landing for the booster, and a parachute-assisted landing for the capsule after a few minutes spent in suborbital space.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream above, kicking off around 30 minutes prior to the target lift-off time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has named the person it wants to take over as its chief data protection watchdog, with sitting commissioner Elizabeth Denham <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/01/elizabeth-denhams-term-as-information-commissioner-extended/">overdue</a> to vacate the post: The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) today said its preferred replacement is New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner, John Edwards.</p>
<p>Edwards, who has a legal background, has spent more than seven years heading up the Office of the Privacy Commissioner In New Zealand &#8212; in addition to other roles with public bodies in his home country.</p>
<p>He is perhaps best known to the wider world for his verbose Twitter presence and for taking a public dislike to Facebook: In the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/facebook-just-lost-another-user-new-zealands-privacy-commissioner/">2018</a> Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal Edwards publicly announced that he was deleting his account with the social media &#8212; accusing Facebook of not complying with the country&#8217;s privacy laws.</p>
<p>An anti-&#8216;Big Tech&#8217; stance aligns with the UK government&#8217;s agenda to tame the tech giants as it works to bring in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">safety-focused legislation for digital platforms</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">reforms of competition rules that take account of platform power</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Government announces preferred candidate for Information Commissioner &#8211; <a href="https://t.co/2fri3ROyhm">https://t.co/2fri3ROyhm</a> <a href="https://t.co/i8b4OBcwzC">https://t.co/i8b4OBcwzC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Edwards (@JCE_PC) <a href="https://twitter.com/JCE_PC/status/1430779723664171009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If confirmed in the role &#8212; the DCMS committee has to approve Edwards&#8217; appointment; plus there&#8217;s a ceremonial nod needed from the Queen &#8212; he will be joining the regulatory body at a crucial moment as digital minister Oliver Dowden has signalled the beginnings of a planned divergence from the European Union&#8217;s data protection regime, post-Brexit, by Boris Johnson&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>Dial back the clock five years and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/on-data-protection-brexit-means-mirroring-eu-rules-confirms-uk-minister/">prior digital minister, Matt Hancock</a>, was defending the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a &#8220;decent piece of legislation&#8221; &#8212; and suggesting to parliament that there would be little room for the UK to diverge in data protection post-Brexit.</p>
<p>But Hancock is now out of government (aptly enough after a data leak showed him breaching social distancing rules by kissing his aide inside a government building), and the government mood music around data has changed key to something far more brash &#8212; with sitting digital minister Dowden framing unfettered (i.e. deregulated) data-mining as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">“a great opportunity”</a> for the post-Brexit UK.</p>
<p>For months, now, ministers have been eyeing how to rework the UK&#8217;s current (legacy) EU-based data protection framework &#8212; to, essentially, reduce user rights in favor of soundbites heavy on claims of slashing &#8216;red tape&#8217; and turbocharging data-driven &#8216;innovation&#8217;. Of course the government isn&#8217;t saying the quiet part out loud; its press releases talk about using &#8220;the power of data to drive growth and create jobs while keeping high data protection standards&#8221;. But those standards are being reframed as a fig leaf to enable a new era of data capture and sharing by default.</p>
<p>Dowden has said that the emergency data-sharing which was waived through during the pandemic &#8212; when the government used the pressing public health emergency to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">justify handing NHS data to a raft of tech giants</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">should be the &#8216;new normal&#8217; for a post-Brexit UK</a>. So, tl;dr, get used to living in a regulatory crisis.</p>
<p>A special taskforce, which was commissioned by the prime minister to investigate how the UK could reshape its data policies outside the EU, also issued a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994125/FINAL_TIGRR_REPORT__1_.pdf">report</a> this summer &#8212; in which it recommended scrapping some elements of the UK&#8217;s GDPR altogether &#8212; branding the regime &#8220;prescriptive and inflexible&#8221;; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/uks-ico-warns-over-big-data-surveillance-threat-of-live-facial-recognition-in-public/">advocating for changes</a> to “free up data for innovation and in the public interest”, as it put it, including pushing for revisions related to AI and “growth sectors”.</p>
<p>The government is now preparing to reveal how it intends to act on its appetite to &#8216;reform&#8217; (read: reduce) domestic privacy standards &#8212; with proposals for overhauling the data protection regime incoming next month.</p>
<p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/08/25/oliver-dowden-creating-data-laws-one-biggest-prizes-brexit/">Telegraph</a> for a paywalled article published yesterday, Dowden trailed one change that he said he wants to make which appears to target consent requirements &#8212; with the minister suggesting the government will remove the legal requirement to gain consent to, for example, track and profile website visitors &#8212; all the while framing it as a pro-consumer move; a way to do away with &#8220;endless&#8221; cookie banners.</p>
<p>Only cookies that pose a &#8216;high risk&#8217; to privacy would still require consent notices, per the report &#8212; whatever that means.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;There’s an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people’s privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,&#8221; the digital minister also told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>The draft of this Great British &#8216;light touch&#8217; data protection framework will emerge next month, so all the detail is still to be set out. But the overarching point is that the government intends to redefine UK citizens&#8217; privacy rights, using meaningless soundbites &#8212; with Dowden touting a plan for &#8220;common sense&#8221; privacy rules &#8212; to cover up the fact that it intends to reduce the UK&#8217;s currently world class privacy standards and replace them with worse protections for data.</p>
<p>If you live in the UK, how much privacy and data protection you get will depend upon how much &#8216;innovation&#8217; ministers want to &#8216;turbocharge&#8217; today &#8212; so, yes, be afraid.</p>
<p>It will then fall to Edwards &#8212; once/if approved in post as head of the ICO &#8212; to nod any deregulation through in his capacity as the post-Brexit information commissioner.</p>
<p>We can speculate that the government hopes to slip through the devilish detail of how it will torch citizens&#8217; privacy rights behind flashy, distraction rhetoric about &#8216;taking action against Big Tech&#8217;. But time will tell.</p>
<p>Data protection experts are already warning of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tim2040/status/1430758650398875652">regulatory stooge</a>.</p>
<p>While the Telegraph suggests Edwards is seen by government as an ideal candidate to ensure the ICO takes a &#8220;more open and transparent and collaborative approach&#8221; in its future dealings with business.</p>
<p>In a particularly eyebrow raising detail, the newspaper goes on to report that government is exploring the idea of requiring the ICO to carry out &#8220;economic impact assessments&#8221; &#8212; to, in the words of Dowden, ensure that “it understands what the cost is on business” before introducing new guidance or codes of practice.</p>
<p>All too soon, UK citizens may find that &#8212; in the &#8216;sunny post-Brexit uplands&#8217; &#8212; they are afforded exactly as much privacy as the market deems acceptable to give them. And that Brexit actually means watching your fundamental rights being traded away.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to Edwards&#8217; nomination, Denham, the outgoing information commissioner, appeared to offer some lightly coded words of warning for government, writing [emphasis ours]: “Data driven innovation stands to bring enormous benefits to the UK economy and to our society, but the digital opportunity before us today will <em><strong>only be realised where people continue to trust their data will be used fairly and transparently, both here in the UK and when shared overseas</strong></em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lurking iceberg for government is of course that if wades in and rips up a carefully balanced, gold standard privacy regime on a soundbite-centric whim &#8212; replacing a pan-European standard with &#8216;anything goes&#8217; rules of its/the market&#8217;s choosing &#8212; it&#8217;s setting the UK up for a post-Brexit future of domestic data misuse scandals.</p>
<p>You only have to look at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/">dire parade of data breaches</a> over in the US to glimpse what&#8217;s coming down the pipe if data protection standards are allowed to slip. The government publicly bashing the private sector for adhering to lax standards it deregulated could soon be the new &#8216;get popcorn&#8217; moment for UK policy watchers&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Equifax data leak could involve 143 million consumers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/embed/#?secret=zCLX8tq4oD" data-secret="zCLX8tq4oD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>UK citizens will surely soon learn of unfair and unethical uses of their data under the &#8216;light touch&#8217; data protection regime &#8212; i.e. when they read about it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Such an approach will indeed be setting the country on a path where mistrust of digital services becomes the new normal. And that of course will be horrible for digital business over the longer run. But Dowden appears to lack even a surface understanding of Internet basics.</p>
<p>The UK is also of course setting itself on a direct collision course with the EU if it goes ahead and lowers data protection standards.</p>
<p>This is because its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">current data adequacy deal with the bloc</a> &#8212; which allows for EU citizens&#8217; data to continue flowing freely to the UK &#8212; was granted only on the basis that the UK was, at the time it was inked, still aligned with the GDPR. So Dowden&#8217;s rush to rip up protections for people&#8217;s data presents a clear risk to the &#8220;significant safeguards&#8221; needed to maintain EU adequacy. Meaning the deal could topple.</p>
<p>Back in June, when the Commission signed off on the UK&#8217;s adequacy deal, it clearly warned that &#8220;if anything changes on the UK side, we will intervene&#8221;.</p>
<p>Add to that, the adequacy deal is also the first with a baked in sunset clause &#8212; meaning it will automatically expire in four years. So even if the Commission avoids taking proactive action over slipping privacy standards in the UK there is a hard deadline &#8212; in 2025 &#8212; when the EU&#8217;s executive will be bound to look again in detail at exactly what Dowden &amp; Co. have wrought. And it probably won&#8217;t be pretty.</p>

<p>The longer term UK &#8216;plan&#8217; (if we can put it that way) appears to be to replace domestic economic reliance on EU data flows &#8212; by seeking out other jurisdictions that may be friendly to a privacy-light regime governing what can be done with people&#8217;s information.</p>
<p>Hence &#8212; also today &#8212; DCMS trumpeted an intention to secure what it billed as &#8220;new multi-billion pound global data partnerships&#8221; &#8212; saying it will prioritize striking ‘data adequacy’ &#8220;partnerships&#8221; with the US, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and the Dubai International Finance Centre and Colombia.</p>
<p>Future partnerships with India, Brazil, Kenya and Indonesia will also be prioritized, it added &#8212; with the government department cheerfully glossing over the fact it&#8217;s UK citizens&#8217; own privacy that is being deprioritized here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Estimates suggest there is as much as £11 billion worth of trade that goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers,&#8221; DCMS writes in an ebullient press release.</p>
<p>As it stands, the EU is of course the UK’s largest trading partner. And statistics from the House of Commons library on <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7851/">the UK&#8217;s trade with the EU</a> &#8212; which you won&#8217;t find cited in the DCMS release &#8212; underline quite how tiny this potential Brexit &#8216;data bonanza&#8217; is, given that UK exports to the EU stood at <em>£294 billion</em> in 2019 (43% of all UK exports).</p>
<p>So even the government&#8217;s &#8216;economic&#8217; case to water down citizens&#8217; privacy rights looks to be puffed up with the same kind of misleadingly vacuous nonsense as ministers&#8217; reframing of a post-Brexit UK as &#8216;Global Britain&#8217;.</p>
<p>Everyone hates cookies banners, sure, but that&#8217;s a case for <em>strengthening</em> not weakening people&#8217;s privacy &#8212; for making non-tracking the default setting online and outlawing manipulative dark patterns so that Internet users don&#8217;t constantly have to affirm they want their information protected. Instead the UK may be poised to get rid of annoying cookie consent &#8216;friction&#8217; by allowing a free for all on citizens&#8217; data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based fund 88mph co-led the round with China-based MSA Capital, with participation from Zagadat Capital, Kepple Ventures and Vunani Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay spun off last year from online sports betting company betPawa. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> CEO <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/nikolai-barnwell-23ba82191?trk=public_profile_browsemap_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click">Nikolai Barnwell</a>, betPawa&#8217;s former head of New Markets, Africa. He also sits on the board of 88mph.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, starting pawaPay was to help people send and receive money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internationally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting instance would be freelancers in Ivory Coast trying to receive payment for services on a global payments platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use a bank account or card. But in places like Ivory Coast, where mobile money is prevalent, that becomes an issue.</span></p>
<h2>How big is mobile money in Africa?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the World Bank&#8217;s 2015 figures, there are over 350 million unbanked individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various inadequacies are responsible for this stat, but from banks&#8217; perspectives, no incentive drives them to actually bank these people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most unbanked people rarely earn </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wage in their respective countries, so it&#8217;s difficult for banks to make money off these individuals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, opening a bank account involves many KYC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">Know Your Customer</a>) processes for this population subset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one thing is for sure: The unbanked have mobile phones, and there are over 850 million mobile connections in Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194262" style="width: 406px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194262" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2194262" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?w=396" alt="" width="396" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gettyimages-1187939995-594x594-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194262" class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Jekesai NJIKIZANA / AFP) (Photo by JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP via Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This huge market is why mobile money is prevalent across the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telecom operators using proxies bypassed the banks and created their own systems to allow people to transfer money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">securely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile phones for low or no transfer fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, individuals with phone numbers can have basic financial services such as savings and transfers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up to $500 billion flows through the mobile money market in sub-Saharan Africa yearly via the accounts of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 300 million active monthly users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This alternative financial infrastructure is one of the largest globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s also one of the most underdeveloped because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">each telecom operator having its own unique mobile money product has created a fragmented infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For merchants, fragmentation means that it can be exorbitantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expensive to use at scale. </span></p>
<h2>Mobile money and card payment gateways</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay wants to position itself as a market leader in high-volume mobile money payments while delivering reliability and transparency for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its API allows these merchants to access telecom operators&#8217; mobile money systems to receive and send payments to millions of mobile money accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re making a very heavy bet on the rise of mobile money and all the complexities that arise out of mobile money and all the infrastructure that needs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around payments with mobile money at its core,&#8221; Barnwell told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And the way we&#8217;re looking at the continent, we&#8217;re looking at adoption rates for mobile money growing at an insane speed. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has become quite obvious that this is a very significant financial infrastructure and there&#8217;s a lot of it that&#8217;s been missing if you want to work serious volume and businesses on mobile money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194269" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194269" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194269" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png 898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=768,328 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-pawaPay-Works.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194269" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PawaPay</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay handles local operations, compliance, regulatory cover and bank accounts, making it simple to receive payments in a new market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be handling over 10 million transactions on its rails per week, with beta operations in 10 African countries &#8212; Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barnwell tells TechCrunch that although these transaction volumes look impressive, pawaPay would have done more if not for regulatory hurdles and licensing approaches in each market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In each country, we&#8217;ve had to start from scratch with the right data to understand how they look at the space,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the licensing sheets, what kind of companies they want to license, what kind of requirements they&#8217;re looking for, how we can work quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with them to make sure that they&#8217;re comfortable with us,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the CEO states that while regulation slows down processes, it&#8217;s important for pawaPay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because many unregulated companies operate without licenses and unstable technologies, some with the intention to commit fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e&#8217;ve gone in and decided we want to be completely regulated. We want to be completely covered in all the markets, with full licensing and be a very stable reliable premium product in these markets,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various payment gateways facilitating payments for businesses in Africa, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, DPO Group, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/south-african-payments-startup-yoco-raises-83m-series-c-led-by-dragoneer/">Yoco</a>, MFS Africa and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pure mobile money play, MFS Africa is a clear competitor to pawaPay. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both platforms are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on addressing the unique challenges accompanying mobile money, while the others drive innovation around bank and card payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194270" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194270" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194270" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?w=680" alt="PawaPay" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png 3001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=2048,1200 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pawaPay-Team-Remote-All-Hands-Meeting-.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PawaPay</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MFS Africa connects over 300 million mobile money wallets enabling a range of banks, telcos, money transfer operators and other financial institutions interoperability at scale in Africa through a single integration point</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay isn&#8217;t far off. Barnwell says the company connects to nearly the same number of wallets and hopes to go live across 30 to 40 telco integrations soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While East Africa (buoyed by Kenya&#8217;s M-Pesa) has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been the critical market for mobile money, West Africa is catching up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last year, West Africa recorded 198 million mobile money accounts compared to East Africa&#8217;s 293 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The West African region also grew the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transaction value by 46%, to over $178 billion, and countries like Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast are leading the charge, which presents a vast opportunity for these payment gateway providers, unlike the card payments market where two </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">countries are prominent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Although most of the attention is on card payments, the big giant in payments in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is mobile money,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PawaPay&#8217;s mobile money focus was a key reason <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/krestenbuch">Kresten Buch</a>, founder of 88mph and chairman of pawaPay, led the round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that when 88mph </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in Africa a decade ago, &#8220;one of the key drivers was that mobile money was a superior payment method to credit and debit cards when used for online payment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Zagadat Capital, here&#8217;s what founder <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ajibade-oluwatosin-71616560">Oluwatosin Ajibade</a> (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Eazi">Mr Eazi</a>, a singer-songwriter and entrepreneur popular in Africa&#8217;s music scene), who also sits on pawaPay&#8217;s board, had to say about the investment:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hugely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on Africa and very familiar with the landscape, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that mobile money-focused fintech is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one of the most exciting places to invest but also one of the most important bridges to ensuring financial inclusion of the billions of people across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The kicker for us was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the clear mission, vision and strategy and we are confident that the pawaPay team is the best team to achieve it.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Copenhagen-based process automation platform <a href="https://www.leapwork.com">Leapwork</a> has snagged Denmark&#8217;s largest ever Series B funding round, announcing a $62 million raise co-led by KKR and Salesforce Ventures, with existing investors DN Capital and Headline also participating.</p>
<p>Also today it&#8217;s disclosing that its<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> post-money valuation now stands at $312M. </span></p>
<p>The &#8216;no code&#8217; 2015-founded startup last raised back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/leapwork-raises-10m-for-its-easy-process-automation-platform-plans-us-expansion/">2019</a>, when it snagged a $10M Series A. The business was bootstrapped through earlier years &#8212; with the founders putting in their own money, garnered from prior successful exits. Their follow on bet on &#8216;no code&#8217; already looks to have paid off in spades: Since launching the platform in 2017, Leapwork has seen its customer base more than double year on year and it now has a roster of 300+ customers around the world paying it to speed up their routine business processes.</p>
<p>Software testing is a particular focus for the tools, which Leapwork pitches at enterprises&#8217; quality assurance and test teams.</p>
<p>It claims that by using its &#8216;no code&#8217; tech &#8212; a label for the trend which refers to software that&#8217;s designed to be accessible to non-technical staff, greatly increasing its utility and applicability &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">businesses can achieve a 10x faster time to market, 97% productivity gains, and a 90% reduction in application errors. So t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he wider pitch is that it can support enterprises to achieve faster digital transformations with only their existing mix of in-house skills. </span></p>
<p>Customers include the likes of PayPal, Mercedes-Benz and BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>Leapwork&#8217;s own business, meanwhile, has grown to a team of 170 people &#8212; working across <span lang="EN-US">nine</span> offices throughout Europe, North America and Asia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B funding will be used to accelerate its global expansion, with the startup telling us it plans to expand the size of its local teams in key markets and open a series of tech hubs to support further product development.</p>
<p>Expanding in North America is a big priority now, with Leapwork noting it recently opened a New York office &#8212; where it plans to &#8220;significantly&#8221; increase headcount.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of our global presence, we want to ensure we are as close to our customers as possible, by continuing to build up local teams and expertise across each of our key markets, especially Europe and North America,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Christian Brink Frederiksen tells TechCrunch. &#8220;For example, we will build up more expertise and plan to really scale up the size of the team based out of our New York office over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Equally we have opened new offices across Europe, so we want to ensure our teams have the scope to work closely with customers. We also plan to invest heavily in the product and the technology that underpins it. For example, we&#8217;ll be doubling the size of our tech hubs in Copenhagen and India over the next 12 months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Product development set to be accelerated with the chunky Series B will focus on enhancements and functionality aimed at &#8220;breaking down the language barrier between humans and computers&#8221;, as Brink Frederiksen puts it</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe and the US are our two main markets. Half of our customers are US companies,&#8221; he also tells us, adding: &#8220;We are extremely popular among enterprise customers, especially those with complex compliance set-ups &#8212; 40% of our customers come from enterprises banking, insurance and financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, because our solution is no-code, it is heavily used across industries, including healthcare and life sciences, logistics and transportation, retail, manufacturing and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about competitors &#8212; given that the no code space has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">a seething hotbed of activity over a number of years</a> &#8212; Leapwork&#8217;s initial response is coy, trying the line that its business is a &#8216;truly special snowflake&#8217;. (&#8220;We truly believe we are the only solution that allows non-technical everyday business users to automate repetitive computer processes, without needing to understand how to code. Our no-code, visual language is what really sets us apart,&#8221; is how Brink Frederiksen actually phrases that.)</p>
<p>But on being pressed Leapwork names a raft of what it calls &#8220;legacy players&#8221; &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/23/insight-ventures-invests-165-million-in-automated-testing-startup-tricentis/">Tricentis</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/smartbear-expands-its-testing-market-reach-with-zephyr-acquisition/">Smartbear</a>, <a href="https://www.ranorex.com">Ranorex</a>, <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/home">MicroFocus</a>, <a href="https://www.eggplantsoftware.com">Eggplant Software</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/mabl-announces-20-million-series-b-to-bring-automated-qa-to-enterprise-customers/">Mabl</a> and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev">Selenium</a> &#8212; as (also) having &#8220;great products&#8221;, while continuing to claim they &#8220;speak to a different audience than we do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly Leapwork&#8217;s Series B raise speaks loudly of how much value investors are seeing here.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Patrick Devine, director at KKR, said: &#8220;Test automation has historically been very challenging at scale, and it has become a growing pain point as the pace of software development continues to accelerate. Leapwork’s primary mission since its founding has been to solve this problem, and it has impressively done so with its powerful no-code automation platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The team at Leapwork has done a fantastic job building a best-in-class corporate culture which has allowed them to continuously innovate, execute and push the boundaries of their automation platform,” added Stephen Shanley, managing director at KKR, in another statement.</p>
<p>In a third supporting statement, Nowi Kallen, principal at Salesforce Ventures, added: “Leapwork has tapped into a significant market opportunity with its no-code test automation software. With Christian and Claus [Rosenkrantz Topholt] at the helm and increased acceleration to digital adoption, we look forward to seeing Leapwork grow in the coming years and a successful partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proof of the no code &#8216;pudding&#8217; is in adoption and usage &#8212; getting non-developers to take to and stick with a new way of interfacing with and manipulating information. And so far, for Leapwork, the signs are looking good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://intellect.co/">Intellect</a>, a Singapore-based startup that wants to make mental health care more accessible in Asia, announced it has raised $2.2 million in pre-Series A funding. It is taking part in Y Combinator’s current batch, which will hold its Demo Day at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The round was led by returning investor Insignia Venture Partners and included participation from Y Combinator, XA Network and angel investors like Rainforest co-founder J.J. Chai; Prenetics and CircleDNA founder Danny Yeung; and Gilberto Gaeta, Google’s director of global HR operations.</p>
<p>This brings Intellect’s total funding since it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/"> launched a year ago</a> to $3 million, including a seed round announced in December 2020 that was also led by Insignia.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based Intellect wants to lower barriers to mental health support in Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/singapore-based-intellect-wants-to-lower-barriers-to-mental-health-support-in-asia/embed/#?secret=qsli2RvTtS" data-secret="qsli2RvTtS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Intellect offered two main product suites: a consumer app with self-guided programs based on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, and a mental health benefits solution for employers with online therapy programs and telehealth services. The startup now claims more than 2.5 million app users, and 20 enterprise clients, including FoodPanda, Shopback, Carousell, Avery Dennison, Schroders and government agencies.</p>
<p>Founder and chief executive officer Theodoric Chew told TechCrunch that Intellect’s usage rate is higher than traditional EAP helpline solutions. On average, its mental health benefits solution sees about 20% to 45% engagement within three months after being adopted by companies with more than 5,000 employees.</p>
<p>In many Asian cultures, there is still a lot of stigma around mental health issues, but that has changed over the last year and a half as people continue to cope with the emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chew said. “From individuals, to companies, insurers and governments, all these different types of people and organizations are today prioritizing mental healthcare on an individual and organizational level in an extremely rapid manner.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intellect protects user privacy with zero-knowledge encryption, so the startup and employers don’t have access to people’s records or communications with their coaches and counsellors. Any insights shared with employers are aggregated and anonymized. Chew said the company is also compliant with major data privacy regulations like ISO, HIPAA and GDPR.</p>
<p>Intellect is currently collaborating in 10 studies with institutions like the National University of Singapore, King’s College London, University of Queensland and the Singapore General Hospital. It says studies so far have demonstrated improvements in mental well-being, stress levels and anxiety among its users.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand into more Asian markets. Intellect currently covers 12 countries and 11 languages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A milestone for <a href="https://jolla.com">Jolla</a>, the Finnish startup behind the Sailfish OS &#8212; which formed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/10/can-jolla-become-meegos-saviour-ceo-plans-two-smartphones-already/">almost a decade ago</a>, when a band of Nokia staffers left to keep the torch burning for a mobile linux-based alternative to Google&#8217;s Android &#8212; today it&#8217;s announcing hitting profitability.</p>
<p>The mobile OS licensing startup describes 2020 as a &#8220;turning point&#8221; for the business &#8212; reporting revenues that grew 53% YoY, and EBITDA (which provides a snapshot of operational efficiency) standing at 34%.</p>
<p>It has a new iron in the fire too now &#8212; having recently started offering a new licensing product (called AppSupport for Linux Platforms) which, as the name suggests, can provide linux platforms with standalone compatibility with general Android applications &#8212; without a customer needing to licence the full Sailfish OS (the latter has of course baked in Android app compatibility since 2013).</p>
<p>Jolla says AppSupport has had some &#8220;strong&#8221; early interest from automotive companies looking for solutions to develop their in-case infotainment systems &#8212; as it offers a way for embedded Linux-compatible platform the capability to run Android apps without needing to opt for Google&#8217;s automotive offerings. And while plenty of car makers have opted for Android, there are still players Jolla could net for its &#8216;Google-free&#8217; alternative.</p>
<p>Embedded linux systems also run in plenty of other places, too, so it&#8217;s hopeful of wider demand. The software could be used to enable an IoT device to run a particularly popular app, for example, as a value add for customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolla is doing fine,&#8221; says CEO and co-founder Sami Pienimäki. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy to see the company turning profitable last year officially.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general it&#8217;s the overall maturity of the asset and the company that we start to have customers here and there &#8212; and it&#8217;s been honestly a while that we&#8217;ve been pushing this,&#8221; he goes, fleshing out the reasons behind the positive numbers with trademark understatement. &#8220;The company is turning ten years in October so it&#8217;s been a long journey. And because of that we&#8217;ve been steadily improving our efficiency and our revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our revenue grew over 50% since 2019 to 2020 and we made €5.4M revenue. At the same time the cost base of the operation has stablized quite well so the sum of those resulted to nice profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the consumer mobile OS market has &#8212; for years &#8212; been almost entirely sewn up by Google&#8217;s Android and Apple&#8217;s iOS, Jolla licenses its open source Sailfish OS to governments and business as an alternative platform they can shape to their needs &#8212; without requiring any involvement of Google.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/jollas-sailfish-os-now-certified-as-russias-first-android-alternative/">Russia was one of the early markets that tapped in</a>.</p>
<p>The case for digital sovereignty in general &#8212; and an independent (non-US-based) mobile OS platform provider, specifically &#8212; has been strengthened in recent years as geopolitical tensions have played out via the medium of tech platforms; leading to, in some cases, infamous bans on foreign companies being able to access US-based technologies.</p>
<p>In a related development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/">this summer</a>, China&#8217;s Huawei launched its own Android alternative for smartphones, which it&#8217;s called HarmonyOS.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fpo2g6UZo9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/">Huawei responds to Android ban with service and security guarantees, but its future is unclear</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei responds to Android ban with service and security guarantees, but its future is unclear&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/huawei-responds-android/embed/#?secret=fpo2g6UZo9" data-secret="fpo2g6UZo9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pienimäki is welcoming of that specific development &#8212; couching it as a validation of the market in which Sailfish plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily see Huawei coming out with the HarmonyOS value proposition and the technology as a competitor to us &#8212; I think it&#8217;s more proving the point that there is appetite in the market for something else than Android itself,&#8221; he says when we ask whether HarmonyOS risks eating Sailfish&#8217;s lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are tapping into that market and we are tapping into that market. And I think both of our strategies and messages support each other very firmly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jolla has been working on selling Sailfish into the Chinese market for several years &#8212; and that sought for business remains a work in progress at this stage. But, again, Pienimäki says Jolla doesn&#8217;t see Huawei&#8217;s move as any kind of blocker to its ambitions of licensing its Android alternative in the Far East.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we see the Chinese market in general is that it&#8217;s been always open to healthy competition and there is always competing solutions &#8212; actually heavily competing solutions &#8212; in the Chinese market. And Huawei&#8217;s offering one and we are happy to offer Sailfish OS for this very big, challenging market as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have good relationships there and we are building a case together with our local partners also to access the China market,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;I think in general it&#8217;s also very good that big corporations like Huawei really recognize this opportunity in general &#8212; and this shapes the overall industry so that you don&#8217;t need to, by default, opt into Android always. There are other alternatives around.&#8221;</p>

<p>On AppSupport, Jolla says the automative sector is &#8220;actively looking for such solutions&#8221;, noting that the &#8220;digital cockpit is a key differentiator for car markers &#8212; and arguing that makes it a strategically important piece for them to own and control.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of, let&#8217;s say, positive vibes in that sector in the past few years &#8212; new comers on the block like Tesla have really shaken the industry so that the traditional vendors need to think differently about how and what kind of user experience they provide in the cockpit,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s been heavily invested and rapidly developing in the past years but I&#8217;m going to emphasize that at the same time, with our limited resources, we&#8217;re just learning where the opportunities for this technology are. Automative seems to have a lot of appetite but then [we also see potential in] other sectors &#8212; IoT&#8230; heavy industry as well&#8230; we are openly exploring opportunities&#8230; but as we know automotive is very hot at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is plenty of general linux OS base in the world for which we are offering a good additional piece of technology so that those operating solutions can actually also tap into &#8212; for example &#8212; selected applications. You can think of like running the likes of Spotify or Netflix or some communications solutions specific for a certain sector,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of those applications are naturally available both for iOS and Android platforms. And those applications as they simply exist the capability to run those applications independently on top of a linux platform &#8212; that creates a lot of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another development, Jolla is in the process of raising a new growth financing round &#8212; it&#8217;s targeting €20M &#8212; to support its push to market AppSupport and also to put towards further growing its Sailfish licensing business.</p>
<p>It sees growth potential for Sailfish in Europe, which remains the biggest market for licensing the mobile OS. Pienimäki also says it&#8217;s seeing &#8220;good development&#8221; in certain parts of Africa. Nor has it given up on its ambitions to crack into China.</p>
<p>The growth round was opened to investors in the summer and hasn&#8217;t yet closed &#8212; but Jolla is confident of nailing the raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are really turning a next chapter in the Jolla story so exploring to new emerging opportunities &#8212; that requires capital and that&#8217;s what are looking for. There&#8217;s plenty of money available these days, in the investor front, and we are seeing good traction there together with the investment bank with whom we are working,&#8221; says Pienimäki.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely an appetite for this and that will definitely put us in a better position to invest further &#8212; both to Sailfish OS and the AppSupport technology. And in particular to the go-to market operation &#8212; to make this technology available for more people out there in the market.&#8221;</p>
