										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Millennial consumers are emerging as a key demographic in the insurance market, and today a Swedish startup that&#8217;s building a business catering specifically to their needs and priorities is announcing a round of funding to fuel its growth. Hedvig, a neo-insurer that provides property, travel, contents, and accident insurance geared to the lifestyles of younger adults &#8212; it also has a &#8220;clumsiness&#8221; policy, and a portion of profits is donated to charity &#8212; has raised $45 million in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>Anthemis &#8212; a firm that specializes in fintech and insurance investments &#8211;led the round, with previous backers Cherry Ventures, Obvious Ventures and CommerzVentures participating, along with new backers Swedish Novax, Nineyards Equity, Jonas Kamprad and Mathias Kamprad. Valuation is not being disclosed, and this brings the total amount of funding in Hegvig to $68 million.</p>
<p>The company, based out of Stockholm, is also live in Norway and Denmark and it will use part of the funding to launch in its fourth (yet to be announced) country, outside of Scandinavia. Funds will also be used to continue expanding Hedvig&#8217;s team and product.</p>
<p>The startup today has some 70,000 customers, with the majority of them under the age of 30, so the plan will be to continue building more products for them. In <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/hedvig-ab/pressreleases/hedvig-becomes-first-european-neoinsurer-to-transition-from-mga-to-a-full-stack-carrier-3081740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March of this year</a>, Hedvig picked up an EU-wide insurance carrier license to gear up for that geographical and product growth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One of the reasons we transitioned into a full-stack carrier was to enable us to serve our members as they progress through life,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Lucas Carlsen. &#8220;This means we will definitely expand our offering in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To give some context on its growth so far, when we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/swedens-hedvig-raises-10-4m-led-by-obvious-ventures-to-build-nice-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedvig&#8217;s August 2019 raise led by Obvious Ventures</a>, it had 15,000 customers, meaning the startup&#8217;s customer base has grown nearly 370% over the last two years. And Hedvig, like its target demographic, seems to thrive on virality: some 40% of its month-on-month growth comes from word of mouth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carlsen and his two co-founders Fredrik Fors and John Ardelius are all younger consumers themselves and built the platform initially around the concept of &#8220;nice&#8221; insurance, products that are easier and cheaper to buy, faster to use, and generally more attuned to what millennials want. Its first products were around insurance for rented or owned properties; these days, to speak to the wider remint, the homepage features a young man on a European city street doing an extended wheelie on his bike.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Insurance has undergone a big shift in recent years thanks to technology, the evolution of smartphone use, and changing consumer expectations. Taking a page from the world of fintech and using networks of APIs to provide a compelling mix of services to be able to focus more squarely on customer relationship and better user experience, there are now a number of insurance service providers in other markets like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshmallow</a> in the U.K. or <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/fr/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lemonade</a> out of the U.S. building mobile-first, easier to use experiences for their customers, or those like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a> using technology to upend how insurance is presented to would-be buyers. But Carlsen contends that there is no one in Europe addressing the needs of, well, that free-wheeling cyclist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">&#8220;Hedvig</span> is a premium proposition for a very demanding group of consumers, who expect stellar service and ultra-fast claims handling,&#8221; Carlsen said. &#8220;We cover not only your home, but also your lifestyle through our &#8216;clumsiness insurance&#8217; that covers all of your stuff with one policy, and reimburses you even for damages caused by your own sheer clumsiness &#8212; a type of lifestyle insurance that does not exist in large parts of Europe today.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many might assume that younger adults would be the last people to think of, let alone buy, insurance. They often have less money for discretionary purchases, they may not own properties, and the assumption is that younger people simply feel more invincible. In fact, it seems that the opposite may be the case if you pitch the product more specifically to those younger users&#8217; lifestyles and their values as consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;[Our] insurance experience made us a cult brand in just a few years,&#8221; Carlsen said, adding that about 40% of our growth is organic or through word-of-mouth. &#8220;We now look forward to taking our proposition to markets where insurance is an even more painful experience than in the Nordics.&#8221; In addition to its customer service and insurance offerings, Hedvig also has worked in a social good angle. Its business model is based on taking a 25% cut of the premium a customer pays. Hedvig said that the rest goes into &#8220;a common claims pool for whenever a <span class="il">Hedvig</span> member needs help.&#8221; Whatever is left over from that and the end of the year &#8212; <em>if</em> there’s anything left in the common claims pool) at the end of the year &#8212; is then donated to charity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over time, it sounds like it&#8217;s likely that Hedvig will look to expand to other demographics. &#8220;<span id="m_-2950506719947182324gmail-docs-internal-guid-cdb3a853-7fff-5205-d622-4aafb9e670db">It’s not surprising that it’s the on-demand younger generation that appreciates our dedication to service and ultra-fast claims handling,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;With that said, we can clearly see how others want to join in with house insurance being our fastest growing segment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ruth Foxe Blader, a partner at Anthemis, and Matthew Jones, an MD at the firm, co-led this investment. It&#8217;s notable that Blader, when at AllianzX, also led an investment in Lemonade. Jones, meanwhile, is taking a board seat with this round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The <span class="il">Hedvig</span> team has a truly unique mix of talent and skills in technology, design and insurance. The combination of their creativity and customer empathy gives them an advantage that will be difficult for others to follow. Insurance is exciting again!” he said in a statement.</p>

<p><a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/">Night School Studio</a>, the independent game developer known for narrative-driven titles like “Oxenfree,” announced today it has been acquired by Netflix. This makes it the first games studio the streaming giant has purchased.</p>
<p>In Netflix’s announcement, Mike Verdu, vice president of game development, wrote Night School’s “commitment to artistic excellence and proven track record make them invaluable partners as we build out the creative capabilities and library of Netflix games together.” He added that Netflix plans to add “exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play” that will be included with its membership, and have no ads or in-app purchases.</p>
<p>Night School Studio was founded in 2014 by Sean Krankel, a former senior game designer at Disney Interactive, and Adam Hines, who was a lead writer at Telltale Games. (Telltale Games was a Netflix partner,<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/telltale-games-shut-down-official-netflix"> working on interactive shows</a> like “Minecraft: Storymode” adventure before shutting down).</p>
<p>In a statement on Night School’s site, Krankel wrote “Netflix gives film, TV and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing.”</p>
<p>For fans of Oxenfree and other Night School titles, Krankel reassured them that it will keep working on Oxenfree II and “cooking up new game worlds.”</p>
<p>“The Netflix team has shown the utmost care for protecting our studio culture and creative vision,” he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>News of the acquisition comes less than a day after Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-is-launching-a-trio-of-members-only-casual-games-in-poland-italy-and-spain/">launched three new casual mobile games in Poland, Italy and Spain</a>, a month after it released two games that were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/netflix-begins-testing-mobile-games-in-its-android-app-in-poland/">tie-ins to the “Stranger Things” series</a>.</p>
<p>In Netflix’s <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">second-quarter shareholder letter</a>, the company said it is in the early stages of exploring its gaming model, and views gaming as another content category, like its original films, animation and reality TV shows.</p>
<p>Before working on mobile games, Netflix first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/netflix-debuts-choose-your-own-adventure-stories-for-kids/">ventured into interactive storytelling</a> four years ago, when it launched “choose-your-own-adventure”-style children’s shows. The next year, it took the format to content for adult viewers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/black-mirror-bandersnatch-trailer/">Black Mirror’s “Bandersnatch” episode</a>. Since then, it’s added other interactive children’s shows like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/netflix-is-adding-an-interactive-minecraft-story-to-its-lineup-denies-entry-into-gaming/">“Minecraft: Story Mode,”</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/netflixs-emilys-wonder-lab-is-smart-interactive-science-tv-for-kids/">“Emily’s Wonder Lab.”</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Peter Relan is not exactly a household name, but he has seen a lot over the course of his career and enjoyed a fair amount of success. A Stanford grad who logged time at Hewlett-Packard and Oracle before becoming the CTO of the ill-fated, bubble-era company Webvan, Relan has, in more recent years, become known in founder circles for creating three &#8220;low-volume, high-touch incubators&#8221; that have punched above their weight.</p>
<p>The very first class back in 2007 included founder Jason Citron who, at the time, was developing a social mobile gaming company, OpenFeint, that he subsequently sold in 2011 to the social gaming platform Gree of Japan for $104 million.</p>
<p>Relan, who played operating partner, owned half the company, and when Citron <a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/openfeint-ceo-jason-citron-resigns/">almost immediately</a> decided to start a second company that he would later call Discord, he headed straight back to Relan to help build it. (Relan&#8217;s other &#8220;graduates&#8221; include the social gaming company Crowdstar, which <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/64788/is-glu-mobiles-45-million-crowdstar-acquisition-already-paying-off/">sold</a> to Glu Mobile in 2016, and Agawi, an early game streaming company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/18/report-last-year-google-secretly-acquired-agawi-a-specialist-in-streaming-native-mobile-apps/">sold to Google</a> in 2015.)</p>
<p>Relan long ago moved on from gaming and is now focused on climate change, equality and the &#8220;ethics of technology,&#8221; but he talked with us recently about his relationship with Citron. (Relan sat on Discord&#8217;s board until last year.) He also said he has &#8220;two big things brewing &#8212; one in AI and one in climate change,&#8221; so watch this space for more information. In the meantime, you can hear our conversation <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vc-peter-relan-on-writing-discords-first-check/id1498270180?i=1000535831815">here</a> or read lightly edited excerpts from it below.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You launched your accelerator, YouWeb, around the same time as Y Combinator got underway, but it was structured very differently.</strong></p>
<p>PR: Every year, we were like, let&#8217;s just [partner with a] few entrepreneurs here, and we&#8217;ll give them a year instead of the traditional three months, and we&#8217;ll co-create. So we don&#8217;t have hundreds of companies. Over 15 years, we&#8217;ve incubated about 30 companies.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did founders find you?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PR: It&#8217;s all referenced by other people. So, for example, I met Jason when he was 22. He was a roommate of my nephew, who had graduated from Berkeley. I was a Stanford alumnus; I asked a couple of people at Stanford, and we found the founders from there. It was very much low key. We weren&#8217;t trying to build this massive application process. We were just looking for founders who have particular types of inclinations; because I&#8217;m an engineer, I really wanted very techie, developer founders.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When you say &#8216;we,&#8217; who else was involved, and were you funding this incubator out of your own pocket or did you have outside investors?</strong></p>
<p>PR: I started with my own funds, but then we rounded up a network for the founders, including seven or eight investors who were executives and other founders who succeeded [including at] Yahoo, Google, Oracle and Microsoft. It was like $2.5 million for that first class, and we sponsored eight founders.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One was Jason, whose first company &#8212; co-founded with an EIR at YouWeb, Danielle Cassley &#8212; was OpenFeint. How fully baked was that company at the outset?</strong></p>
<p>PR: Jason is a core gamer at heart, and he arrived saying, &#8216;I just want something in gaming.&#8217; There was no idea, there was no particular game, there was no particular product, and actually OpenFeint, which is a social chat platform, began as a game called &#8220;Aurora Feint&#8221; that was a really beautiful game and was really well-received, but in terms of financial success, it was doing okay. And the most interesting thing about it, inside, was actually a social platform that had leaderboards and achievements and chat. So we pulled out the social platform and said, &#8216;Let&#8217;s [put] the game aside and let&#8217;s scale this platform.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was your role?</strong></p>
<p>PR: I was executive chairman. He was co-founder and CEO. So we worked like business partners. He was the product guy. I was the mentor. And Danielle was involved, but she moved on. So it was Jason and me pretty much. I would help with the financings and with the strategy and business development. We did a big deal with AT&amp;T to pre-install OpenFeint on AT&amp;T mobile phones. So there was a lot of that kind of stuff. My goal was to be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Y Combinator famously takes a 7% stake for its early checks. What percentage of OpenFeint did you own?</strong></p>
<p>PR: We used to do co-creation, so we would be 50/50. Obviously, it was a big hit for YouWeb [when it sold], because we were equal partners with Jason and Danielle. In our second [batch] where we worked with Discord, we [operated] much more like YC because I wanted to actually do a little less work and work across a broader number of fields, not just gaming.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It says something about your relationship that Jason turned around and came back to you with Discord. It&#8217;s also interesting that a 26-year-old who&#8217;d just made a fortune would jump right back into work.</strong></p>
<p>PR: I remember when he left Gree. It was late October or November of 2011, and he just sent a simple email saying &#8216;I&#8217;m back.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Great.&#8217;</p>
<p>Again, it started with a game and &#8212; we&#8217;re skipping ahead here &#8212; three years later, the game is doing okay but not great, and the chat platform features are very, very popular and, like déjà vu, he suddenly pulls out the chat platform and launches it as Discord. So [it&#8217;s] repeat [and] play but done much better this time, obviously, right? [Discord] has now got more than 300 million, 400 million users now &#8212; well over 300 million.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And now its valuation is reportedly valued at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/chat-app-discord-is-worth-15-billion-after-new-funding?sref=gni836kR">$15 billion</a>. How did its Series A round come together? I&#8217;d heard at some point that some firms &#8212; maybe General Catalyst, maybe Accel &#8212; lost out on that opportunity. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p>PR: Actually, the first round of Discord was really interesting. It wasn&#8217;t even a priced round. It was really people investing in Jason, and perhaps a little bit in the fact that we were working together &#8212; sort of like, &#8216;Hey, here&#8217;s a couple of people who&#8217;ve been successful with something, and here&#8217;s a guy who wants to keep going and do something bigger now maybe.&#8217; So the first round was really a bunch of VCs who had essentially decided to write these $250,000 checks. Accel was in there and General Catalyst and IDG and Time Warner.</p>
<p>And then the question you&#8217;re asking is how Benchmark, a completely different firm that was not [part of] those first 10 checks and was not a seed investor, ended up getting the deal. What happened was TechCrunch Disrupt. He got to the finalist thing and people really loved his presentation style and his company and [longtime Benchmark investor] Mitch Lasky noticed it and said, &#8216;Hey, we should talk.&#8217; I think it was almost so fast that if I recall, it was really just, &#8216;Hey, is anybody else really ready to do something? If not, I have a term sheet.&#8217;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Entrepreneurs need to convince employers to turn to edtech for a solution more elusive than even education: motivation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remote work may have changed the way we spend our days, but there’s quite a sneaky disruptor among us: burnout. As the pandemic drags on, employees are either soul-searching for a bigger purpose or simply exhausted by the uncertainty and stale culture of their current jobs.</p>
<p>It’s not a small subset of the working population, either: Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work">estimates</a> that 41% of people are likely to consider leaving their employer within the next year, and 46% are planning to make a major pivot or career transition.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Freshly capitalized, MasterClass and Outschool are looking for ways to grow into their valuations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Employers are under fresh pressure to retain talent, which has made some turn to more comprehensive and creative benefits, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">pre-conception and postpartum support</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/headspace-ginger-lyra-health-calm/">text-based mental health care and on-demand meditation</a>. As the movement to support employees better gathers momentum, traditionally consumer-focused edtech startups are taking notice.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, direct-to-consumer companies, including Outschool and MasterClass, have quietly spun up products targeting employers. The platforms, which mix entertainment and education, have an unconventional value proposition. Outschool, an after-school enrichment platform for kids, is betting that working parents could use some extra help keeping their children engaged. And MasterClass, which offers expert-led classes on-demand, hopes that a chat with their favorite celebrity could inspire a star employee to stay at the company longer.</p>
<p>The belief that employers will invest in edutainment benefit platforms is a departure from the traditional pitch that edtech has used to break into this market. Companies like Udemy and Guild Education, for example, focus much more on reskilling and upskilling workforces to fill the latest in-demand roles.</p>
<p>As nascent efforts begin to get real investment, consumer edtech’s success will hinge on whether it can effectively, and consistently, translate its impact to employers in the long term. Put simply, entrepreneurs need to convince employers to turn to edtech for a solution even more elusive than education: motivation.</p>
<h2>When the struggle is more obvious</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amyyamnerjenkins/">Amy Yamner Jenkins</a> joined Outschool last fall as a contractor to grow the after-school marketplace’s business. When schools didn’t reopen in August 2021, she said schools and employers began turning to Outschool to relieve the stress of another year of remote learning.</p>
<p>These early customer signals fundamentally changed Outschool’s priorities. A year later, Jenkins is the head of schools and distribution, in charge of a 10-person team that solely works on helping get Outschool into more schools and employer benefits packages. Today, over 100 companies, including Alto Pharmacy, Mursion and Twitter, use Outschool.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was easy to be a working parent prior to the pandemic,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;But it just feels like the pandemic made it even more obvious [to companies] what the struggle was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before a startup lands its first customer or investor, its founders must invest time and energy to develop intellectual property.</p>
<p>In some cases, IP can be as tangible as a patent, but strategic assets can also take the form of product visualizations, target audience data or early product/engineering prototypes.</p>
<p>Brett Lovelady, founder of design firm Astro Studios, defines these design and development assets as &#8220;creative capital,&#8221; which &#8220;can ultimately last longer and potentially become more valuable&#8221; than venture capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/creative-capital-is-the-secret-sauce-not-venture-capital/">In a guest post</a> for TechCrunch+, he describes different types of creative capital and includes multiple examples of how startups can leverage it for success.</p>

<p>It’s a two public-offering week, with both U.S. software company Amplitude and direct-to-consumer eyeglass purveyor Warby Parker set to go public via direct listings.</p>
<p>“Even if you are tired of IPOs, these two warrant your attention,” writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two direct listings will help us figure out which side of the public-private divide is truly undervaluing startups,&#8221; says Alex.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s either pesky bankers extracting unearned value from hardworking Silicon Valley types at graduation day, or it’s private-market investors irked that anyone else accretes upside from startups.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first step? Start developing relationships now with influencers so your live-shopping experience has an authentic feel.</p>
<p>“Ahead of a volatile retail season, one theme is clear: It’s a now-or-never moment for brands to adopt live shopping, expand their audience ownership and build a new community of influencers,” Schill writes in a guest post that includes case studies from brands like Knix, Urban Decay and Lancôme.</p>

<p>To repair the damage humankind has inflicted on Earth&#8217;s climate patterns, solutions that touch nearly every aspect of our behavior are required.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have 100 areas, 1,000 different areas that need to be reinvented and industries that need to be reconstructed,&#8221; SOSV managing general partner Sean O’Sullivan said last week at TechCrunch Disrupt in conversation with reporter Kirsten Korosec and Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there’s going to be some percentage of folks who are going to stiff-arm the whole thing,&#8221; Roberts said. &#8220;But by and large, I think the majority of people are starting to cooperate a lot more.&#8221;</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm preview five questions that form the basis of their upcoming analysis of global Q3 2021 VC activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did Europe’s venture scene keep raising record sums?</li>
<li>What’s going on with China’s venture capital market?</li>
<li>Is the U.S. holding onto, or losing, venture dominance?</li>
<li>Where in Latin America are we seeing the most acceleration?</li>
<li>Are mega-rounds still the key driver in venture aggregates?</li>
</ul>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/heres-everything-amazon-announced-this-morning-recap/"><strong>Amazon releases a metric fuckload of hardware:</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">Including a robot, it turned out</a>. The company also dropped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-introduces-amazon-glow-an-interactive-video-calling-device-for-kids-and-families/">video calling device</a> along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-takes-on-fitbit-with-the-80-halo-view/">with a fitness wearable</a>. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/why-amazon-built-a-home-robot/">company’s $999 Astro robot</a> is driving the most attention today, but the company’s list of new hardware was extensive. On the heels of the Microsoft Surface event, it’s important to remember that every major software company also has a hardware effort.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/"><strong>The Rivian EV truck is good:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch’s inimitable transportation guru <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">Kirsten Korosec</a> has notes on the 2022 Rivian R1T electric truck on the blog today, and she’s largely impressed. What did she like? Terrain flexibility, acceleration speed and internal details. Not to mention that the R1T is “no delicate flower” despite its premium finishes.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/"><strong>The huge opportunity in climate tech:</strong></a> Korosec dropped another major piece recently, this one focused on the “enormous challenges and abundant opportunities” for startups amid the rising climate crisis. Startups have shown a strong ability to drive software revenues. Perhaps upstart tech companies will also play a role in keeping our planet &#8212; our home! &#8212; cool in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get too deep into the day’s venture capital roundup, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/five-questions-for-venture-capital-in-q3/">took a look ahead to the third quarter’s venture capital results</a>, detailing the five questions we are most curious about. Those include what’s up with venture investment in China, what Latin American tallies will tell us about the spread of startup activity in the region and more.</p>
<ul>
<li>TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya/">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> dug <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/do-you-need-another-app-to-discover-beautiful-places-when-you-travel/">into Backdrop</a></strong>, a startup that has built a “photo-sharing app that merges tech, social media and travel,” asking if we really need another mobile application to help us find gorgeous places while we travel. Perhaps Instagram has real competition on the horizon?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/highnote-emerges-from-stealth-with-54m-and-a-plan-to-take-on-marqeta-in-the-world-of-card-issuing-as-a-service/"><strong>Highnote wants to take on Marqeta:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The world of card issuance is a busy one &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/all-the-reasons-why-you-should-launch-a-credit-or-debit-card/">more here from TechCrunch+</a> &#8212; and is about to get busier. Flush with $54 million in capital, Highnote just dropped its stealth tag and showed the world what it is building, namely what we described as a way to make it “easy for any company of any size to provide virtual payment cards to their customers.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/stark-a-hub-for-accessible-software-design-launches-a-mac-app-in-beta/"><strong>Stark wants to make software more accessible:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/microsoft-offers-new-accessibility-testing-service-for-pc-and-xbox-games/">not just Microsoft</a> that is busy making technology products more accessible. Stark is building tech to help lots of companies get in on the work. The company’s product is now in private beta, allowing users to upload designs, which Stark will then parse to identify possible accessibility issues along with suggesting possible changes. Cool!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/hospitals-clinics-patient-platform-heydoc-raises-8-3m-series-a-led-by-smedvig-capital/"><strong>Heydoc raises $8.3M for medical data management:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Heydoc’s work to build a “system for managing the medical data and admin tasks” that healthcare workers run into all the time is now flush and has designs to break out of its current market in the U.K. to other locales.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/federated-genomic-data-startup-lifebit-raises-60m-round-led-by-tiger-global/"><strong>Today’s Tiger round is Lifebit:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Another day, another huge check from Tiger. This time it’s Lifebit, which works to provide access to biomedical data that could help in drug discovery. This reminds me a bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2021-is-cellino/">what Cellino is up</a> to, albeit from a different angle. See, not <em>all</em> startups have to build enterprise-focused software. How nice to be reminded of that!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rize-raises-11-4m-to-scale-its-embedded-fintech-service/">Rize raises $11.4M for embedded fintech, with a twist:</a> </strong>Embedded banking solutions are pretty common these days. What sets Rize apart, in its view, is a method of uniting different account types under a single user profile. Synthetic accounts, in its own verbiage.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong> </strong>Which form of venture debt should your startup go for?</h2>
<p>Startup founders have more options than in years past when it comes to fundraising, thanks in large part to a surplus of liquidity. Besides traditional VC, crowdfunding, venture banks and venture debt funds are all viable options.</p>
<p>In a detailed overview of venture debt options, Andy Weyer, managing director of technology at Runway Growth Capital, shares three use cases depicting how debt capital can benefit borrowers hoping to retain leverage for future rounds or access working capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle,&#8221; advises Weyer.</p>

The Redmond-based software giant’s store will now allow for third-party storefronts. If this is more sea change than PR effort, we leave to your discretion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rpa-industry-consolidation-continues-with-sale-of-blue-prism-to-vista-for-1-095b/"><strong>Blue Prism sells for £1.095B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The RPA market is seeing some consolidation, it appears, in the wake of the UiPath IPO. Vista is buying Blue Prism for just under 1.1 billion pounds, with an intention to unite the company with another of its own portfolio entities. Blue Prism is a public company, mind, so you should have heard of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/cloudflare-enters-infrastructure-services-market-with-new-r2-storage-product/"><strong>And, finally, Cloudflare takes on AWS:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Cloudflare is best known for its content <em>delivery</em> work, not for providing the sort of cloud infra that Amazon’s AWS is famous for selling. And yet Cloudflare intends to poke the dragon with R2, a forthcoming service from the public company that will take on Amazon’s S3 storage product. Notably, R2 will delete data egress fees, perhaps putting Amazon into something akin to a pricing tight spot.</li>
</ul>

					<description><![CDATA[We caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum, and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roham Gharegozlou has been betting on the potential success of NFTs for years. This year, it happened.</p>
<p>Gharegozlou and the team at his startup, <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a>, shipped the blockchain world&#8217;s first popular game, CryptoKitties, back in 2017. The startup then launched NBA Top Shot late last year, and it promptly caught fire and brought worldwide attention to the crypto collectibles space.</p>
<p>We caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it would be fast, but NBA Top Shot went from 4,000 to 400,000 users in a matter of weeks,&#8221; Gharegozlou said.</p>
<p>Top Shot&#8217;s success has made <a href="https://www.dapperlabs.com/">Dapper Labs</a> a venture darling — the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">announced a $250 million funding round last week</a>, reaching a reported $7.6 billion valuation. The massive valuation is not just a bet on the continued success of Top Shot, it&#8217;s also a nod to the potential of the platform that Dapper Labs is building for other consumer-minded blockchain developers. The startup has built its own blockchain, called Flow, sidestepping the popular Ethereum blockchain, which the vast majority of successful NFT platforms live on today. Dapper Labs is betting that won&#8217;t be the case for long.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first year or year and a half of Dapper Labs, we spent about $30 million trying to build on Ethereum. We built Dapper Wallet — the user experience you see on Top Shot, we tried building it on top of Ethereum,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We realized there are multiple issues. There&#8217;s cost, there&#8217;s scale, there&#8217;s throughput, there&#8217;s all these things, but fundamentally, it&#8217;s all about user experience. The user experience that you build for when you&#8217;re designing a protocol and blockchain for financially sophisticated traders or very hardcore DeFi things, those aren&#8217;t the same trade-offs that you want when you&#8217;re building for consumer applications.&#8221;</p>

		Jack Lynch is an edtech veteran and CEO of <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/">HMH</a>, a learning technology company.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’ve heard a lot about the role of technology in pandemic education, and for good reason: Digital solutions enabled school communities to maintain learning through uncertainty and interruption none of us could have imagined.</p>
<p>However, the triumphs of edtech have been paired with critical challenges. Since the pandemic closed schools in March 2020, school districts have invested in getting students access to computing devices and the internet.</p>
<p>Technology-hesitant teachers became technology-proficient as they learned to navigate remote teaching and learning in impromptu virtual classrooms. Still, with all of the progress we made in digital learning, the interruption of the face-to-face social aspects of the classroom experience resulted in the students finishing the 2020-2021 school year four to five months behind in reading and math on average, according to a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-education-the-lingering-effects-of-unfinished-learning">recent study from McKinsey &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>We’re starting to see the promise of digital learning take hold; teachers can use software to differentiate and personalize instruction. But we can’t stop here. Over the last 18 months, “technology” has been a synonym for “virtual,” where many kids felt isolated, sitting behind a device and craving connection with their peers and teachers.</p>
<p>We now have the opportunity to take what we have learned and use it to usher in a new era of education — one that is powered to a meaningful degree by technology yet centered on human connection, and one where we reject the false choice between engaging software and an incredible teacher. As we return to school this fall, we can blend the best of technology with the best of the classroom experience.</p>
<p>HMH recently shared results of our annual <a href="https://www.hmhco.com/educator-confidence-report">Educator Confidence Report</a>, and the findings provide critical insights into the characteristics that should define the post-pandemic classroom.</p>
<p>Over 1,200 front-line educators from across the U.S. responded, and while optimism has fallen (only 38% of educators reported a somewhat positive or positive view of the state of their profession), confidence in the mastery and benefit of learning technologies is on the rise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’re moving from digital promise to digital proof.</p>
<p>Despite a tumultuous year, teachers’ current views on technology provide a bright spot, paving the way for more purposeful use of digital solutions.</p>
<p>Educator confidence in using edtech is at an all-time high since we began this survey seven years ago, with 66% of teachers very or extremely confident in their abilities. Many credit their experience of being thrown into the deep end in March 2020. Today, a nearly unanimous 95% of teachers have experienced the benefits of edtech, and 77% believe tech will help them be more effective teachers post-pandemic.</p>
<p>Of critical importance is the <em>type</em> of benefit teachers are experiencing. 81% report at least one of the following top three benefits, all of which are highly student-centric: improved student engagement; differentiated, individualized instruction; and flexible access to instructional content.</p>
<p>Despite technology playing a larger and more effective role, educators report that there are still critical barriers to access and efficacy that must be addressed, including lack of devices and internet access. 57% of educators also indicated that lack of student engagement with tech is a major barrier. More than half told us that the lack of time to plan for integrating digital resources into instruction was a top challenge.</p>
<h2>Students’ emotional well-being is educators’ top concern</h2>
<p>We all recognize that at the center of teaching and learning is the strong connection built and nurtured between teacher and student, which serves as the foundation for academic and social-emotional growth and drives engagement. We cannot let technology that breaks that connection and isolates students obscure that critical relationship, and data from this year’s survey is an important harbinger.</p>
<p>Among educators, 58% are concerned that students will demonstrate increased social-emotional needs after the pandemic, and social-emotional needs broadly remained the top concern this year (ahead of teachers’ own salaries and concerns about students falling behind). In addition, 82% of educators believe a well-crafted, fully integrated social-emotional learning (SEL) program will have an impact.</p>
<p>Ultimately, to begin to recover and transition into our “post-pandemic instructional model,” we can benefit from a best-of-both-worlds approach that fuses the power of technology with the tried-and-true social gathering of the classroom — “high-tech” working in a mutually reinforcing way with “high-touch.”</p>
<h2>Educators’ unique experiences shed light on what the classroom of the future will look like</h2>
<p>Technology alone will not usher in education’s new era. It is critical that we leverage digital solutions with a community-oriented, connected and human mindset.</p>
<p>At HMH, we strive for an edtech ecosystem that drives engagement, not isolation; for solutions that offer actionable data and insights that allow teachers to differentiate instruction, not simply “a page under glass”; for innovations that do not add to educators’ full plates, but rather extend their capabilities and give them time to focus on the social-emotional needs of their students.</p>
<p>We heard loud and clear that educators believe in the potential of technology to accomplish these goals — 82% of educators believe customized learning for every student will transform learning and teaching in the future, and 75% believe technology solutions that connect instruction and assessment on one platform will be essential to this transformation.</p>
<p>Edtech’s potential has been unlocked at an exponential rate over the past year, but the future of the classroom is not merely high-tech. It is high-touch, too.</p>
<p>When we asked educators what they are most looking forward to post-pandemic, the answer was clear — being together with their student community: 80% cited interacting face-to-face with students, 74% said more student engagement and 63% noted student collaboration opportunities.</p>
<p>The passionate discussion around in-person versus digital learning is too often shortsighted in its creation of a strict binary — digital or analog. But our greatest success will come from embracing the fact that these are <em>not</em> opposing forces; they are complementary force multipliers.</p>
<p>We’ve lost a great deal over the last year, but we’ve also gained important ground — and we can continue that momentum. As a society, we will continue to assess the health risks before us and navigate an increasingly hybrid world that includes our workplaces, neighborhoods and, of course, our schools.</p>
<p>I believe that as we do ultimately return to our school buildings, we’ll be ready to usher in a new era of learning, one powered by tech and innovation but forever defined by the community of teachers and students at its heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Continuing research by Stanford and Apple from the 2017 Apple Heart Study, which managed to enroll more than 400,000 participants and became one of the largest studies of its kind ever performed, has shown that the Apple Watch is capable of detecting other types of arrhythmic heart beat irregularities in addition to atrial fibrillation (AFib). Apple Watch currently offers potential atrial fibrillation detection and notifications as one of its core health features, introducing it to the device with its Series 4 update, which added an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor.</p>
<p>The results of the Apple Heart Study proved the science behind that feature, which Apple itself has always positioned as a way to be more aware of your health and potential conditions that may affect your heart health, rather than any kind of very accurate predictor or actual medical device. But over the years there have been many verified stories of Apple Watch users who credit the AFib notification feature as the reason they were able to catch an otherwise asymptomatic issue early thanks to follow-up care from a doctor.</p>
<p>This additional research from the Heart Study dives deeper into the data gathered to show that for 40% of participants who received a notification about a potential irregular heartbeat from their Apple Watch, but for whom follow-up testing with a medical ECG didn&#8217;t show AFib, there were other arrhythmias present. These included premature atrial complexes, premature ventricular complexes and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. These are fairly common, and often identified by those who experience them as heart palpitations, but premature complexes in particular could be an indicator of other underlying problems.</p>
<p>The new study, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCEP.121.010063">published in the American Heart Association&#8217;s Circulation Journal</a>, also found that nearly a third of participants who had no AFib detected using the ECG patch after receiving a notification were in fact diagnosed with atrial fibrillation by the end of the Heart Study, indicating that the Apple Watch may have been detecting cases early which the subsequent ECG patch had missed. That would suggest a higher efficacy for the Apple wearable than shown in prior studies.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a lot of speculation about potential new sensors and technical capabilities being introduced to new generations of Apple Watch, but we&#8217;ve already seen that research from large-scale studies like the Apple Heart Study, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">Apple Heart and Movement Study</a> can provide a pathway to new capabilities using existing hardware and sensors, too. Apple Watch showing promising results in terms of detecting other heart arrhythmias might just fit into the category of explorations that find their way to more Health features in future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Given the surplus of liquidity in the markets, entrepreneurs have access to more funding options than ever before. Venture banks, venture debt funds and venture capitalists are each jockeying to prove how their money is greener.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, each has constraints that dictate their behavior. While a venture capitalist may swing for the fences in each investment they make to get outsized returns, one home run can make up for nine strikeouts. Contrarily, most banks are playing Billy Beane’s Moneyball — they try to get the entire lineup on-base while making as few outs as possible in the process.</p>
<p>Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>It helps to understand how venture banks make a profit: Essentially, they take deposits from one customer and lend them to another. Most banks currently collect a 4% interest rate from loans while paying less than a 1% interest rate to depositors, generating a margin of approximately 3%.</p>
<p>If we assume that a bank must also cover 2% of overhead for costs like employee payroll and rent, then it must collect at least $0.99 of every $1.00 loaned to generate a profit.</p>
<p>Despite the unscrupulous behavior of a few bad actors (see <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp">the Great Recession</a>), the banking industry has a profoundly positive impact on economic productivity overall. More economic productivity means more taxes, so federal and state governments have a vested interest in greasing the skids and have instituted agencies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to help protect depositors and monitor banks.</p>
<p>The FDIC ensures that each bank under its regulatory oversight has a sound lending policy in place and operates within those parameters. That said, there is an exception to every rule, and borrower activity that may be deemed “too risky” by rigid underwriting guidelines may, in fact, be normal (or even desirable) in certain circumstances. For instance, increasing sales and marketing or research and development spend to leverage or develop a sustainable competitive advantage that will bear fruit in the future — even if that means foregoing profit and increasing burn in the short term).</p>
<p>Therein lies the rub: In the process of protecting depositors, rigid credit guidelines, thin margins and low risk tolerances can create challenges for borrowers operating in dynamic and sometimes volatile markets, often leading to undesirable outcomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT world collectively seems to be trying to turn internet memories into one big game &#8212; with a lot of cash involved, of course. The original &#8220;Doge&#8221; image sold for $4 million back in June, the original &#8220;Pepe&#8221; comic image sold for $1 million in April; in short, people are becoming meme millionaires. Buying and selling six-figure JPEGs is a weird phenomenon, but in the end doesn&#8217;t do a ton to convince the average internet user that NFTs are worth caring about.</p>
<p><a href="https://eternal.gg/">Eternal</a> wants to turn trading internet history into a game, but it&#8217;s focused on a very particular slice of the web &#8212; popular clips from game streamers. In a user interface that functions and feels very similar to NBA Top Shot, users can buy packs of serialized clips from Eternal&#8217;s network of game streamers they&#8217;ve partnered with. The marketplace is built by startup Zelos Gaming, helmed by co-founders Jeffrey Tong and Derek Chiang, which has pivoted from building out a sort of cross-platform battle pass (which we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/zelos-is-like-a-cross-game-battle-pass-rewarding-you-for-completing-challenges-in-games-you-already-play/">covered here last year</a>) toward now embracing the wild world of NFTs with Eternal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vFheg6E4AJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=vFheg6E4AJ" data-secret="vFheg6E4AJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup is building up a pretty wide roster of crypto investment firms and personalities, as its backers include NFX, Mark Cuban, Coinbase Ventures, Gary Vaynerchuk, Dapper Labs and Arrington Capital, which have invested $4.5 million in the startup in its latest funding round. The team was previously backed by Y Combinator.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very much a Top Shot for X type platform at the moment &#8212; which is apparent in the site&#8217;s design &#8212; but the team has big ideas for how the platform evolves down the road. Unlike Top Shot, which was able to nab deals with the NBA and Players Association, there&#8217;s no overarching esports or Twitch equivalent, leaving Eternal destined for a fairly complicated weave of partnerships with streamers and streamer networks designed to ensure they don&#8217;t take their business elsewhere. The startup says they&#8217;re largely focused on popular streamers operating in the top 0.05% of Twitch.</p>
<p>Streamers can sell top clips, which are conveniently already tracked by platforms like Twitch, as well as videos from their social media, &#8220;immortalizing&#8221; the moments on the blockchain. The company hopes that by pairing up-and-coming streamers with more established personalities they can bring awareness to more creators and help build a network of users that &#8220;own a piece&#8221; of them and have a vested interest in their success.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Top Shot is a great model but [Eternal] works way better for creators because it gives creators a brand new way to monetize,&#8221; CEO Jeffrey Tong tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Building a closer relationship between fans and creators has shown early promise as an exciting nuance of the NFT world as investors showcase their investments pumping up creators in the process; what&#8217;s less clear is how this looks on a smaller scale when users have tens or hundreds of dollars of investment in a creator, versus thousands or millions.</p>
<p>A big selling point of the platform is that it&#8217;s built on Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow, a consumer app-friendly blockchain which cuts back on complexity (and a bit of decentralization) in favor of building an onboarding flow users actually make it through. Living outside the Ethereum ecosystem and trading in USD means moving further away from a sizable network of crypto-rich NFT acolytes, but it also means approaching what is potentially a much larger consumer audience. The company wants Eternal to end up on more blockchains down the road by next year, though cross-chain maneuverings seem to get tricky pretty quickly today.</p>
<p>Flow has a pretty low-key suite of active marketplaces on its chain at the moment, but Eternal has shown early momentum. According to <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/">Cryptoslam</a>, the marketplace has done about $300,000 in transactions this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, <a href="https://www.getstark.co/">Stark</a> launched a private beta for its Stark for Mac app, which streamlines accessibility compliance to make products more inclusive while allowing everyone involved in a project to easily collaborate. Companies can upload their design files into Stark&#8217;s tool, which then identifies accessibility issues and suggests changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Stark started in 2017 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/cat-noone/">Cat Noone</a> and her team realized that there wasn&#8217;t an easy solution for designers to make sure their creations were accessible and inclusive. Now, more than 500,000 people have used Stark&#8217;s integrated plug-ins for apps like Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch and Google Chrome, which offer checks and suggestions to make sure that visual materials meet accessibility standards for visually impaired people. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We started with the plugins, and they&#8217;re still a great way of creating awareness by surfacing issues that are happening in your product,&#8221; Noone told TechCrunch. &#8220;But they don&#8217;t solve accessibility issues for you in a way that scales, or in a way that ensures everyone is involved in the product.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Noone says that the Stark for Mac app will &#8220;supercharge accessibility&#8221; by making it even easier to address sweeping problems across swaths of design files. For example, if an app like Twitter were to change its font (which it recently did, sparking conversation about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitters-web-redesign-isnt-as-accessible-as-it-should-be-experts-say/">need for customization</a> in accessible design), the designers would have to arduously change the typeface on hundreds of different screens within the app. But Stark makes that process much faster. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208775" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208775" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208775 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?w=680" alt="Messages that might appear in Stark warning users of potential accessibility issues" width="680" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=2048,1138 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stark-Mac-Beta-Inspect.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208775" class="wp-caption-text">Messages that might appear in Stark warning users of potential accessibility issues. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stark</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What Stark does is, for any instance that the issue occurs, it allows you to take that suggested change, open up the design file, make the change, and go ahead and sync it,&#8221; Noone said. &#8220;So at that point, you have not just this one individual screen, but you have your entire design system, every screen where this instance shows up rectified. That&#8217;s massive, because it takes your design development time and completely squashes it, and our goal is to decrease your time to compliance, all the while educating you about why this was rectified.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Noone has been saying since last year, when Stark raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/stark-raises-1-5m-for-a-toolkit-that-helps-developers-and-others-create-more-inclusive-design/">$1.5 million in seed funding</a>, that the product can be the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/grammarly-raises-90m-at-over-1b-valuation-for-its-ai-based-grammar-and-writing-tools/">Grammarly</a> of accessible design, functioning on both a consumer and enterprise level. Though the company isn&#8217;t yet profitable, some of Stark&#8217;s existing customers include Microsoft, Pfizer, Instagram and ESPN. Plus, Stark hosts a Slack community for people interested in accessible design, as well as a public library of accessibility resources that Noone says is the largest on the internet. Stark has a limited free plan that allows users to try out the product and join its Slack, but access to its existing suite of tools costs $60 per year. Teams can request a quote for a custom plan, which adds access to unified billing and multi-team management. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Accessibility is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/make-accessibility-part-of-your-startups-products-and-culture-from-day-one/">crucial</a> for tech companies, because if their products aren&#8217;t usable by people with certain disabilities, then they&#8217;re missing out on a massive customer base. But, if being inclusive isn&#8217;t a good enough motivator (sigh), then money is.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in recent events, the pandemic pushed so many businesses to increase their digital presence. We reached a point where tech companies that don&#8217;t make their products accessible to all possible users are excluded from the market, and they miss out on this windfall,&#8221; Noone said. But Stark makes it easier to retrofit years of old design files to be compliant with accessibility standards. &#8220;The Stark for Mac app ensures that you no longer need to employ these 10 or 20 consultants, because the individuals that are building the product are educated, and the tools sit with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the private beta version of the Stark for Mac app will work with Sketch, but Noone says the app will quickly roll out compatibility with other popular design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. Then, it will allow users to assign tasks to others within the app by integrating with project management tools. People who want to try the private beta can contact Stark for access on its <a href="http://getstark.co">website</a>. The beta will be free, but once it launches publicly, Stark will announce a pricing plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the luxury of building this alongside a very vocal community,&#8221; Noone said. &#8220;Granted, we&#8217;re rolling out into private beta, but it&#8217;s still very much beneficial for engineers and designers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stark&#8217;s team is 17 strong, with people working remotely across eight different countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a team from all around the world, with so many languages, so many skin colors, so many orientations &#8212; just the way we view ourselves and the way we navigate the world is inclusion in itself, which I think is pretty magical,&#8221; Noone said. She wants Stark to be able to adapt to emerging technologies like VR and AR, while also addressing that accessibility looks different across cultures &#8212; what makes a typeface legible in English, for example, may not necessarily hold true for writing in Arabic or Thai. &#8220;We are a reflection of the product we built, and I think that makes it ridiculously easy to put our money where our mouth is, because it&#8217;s something we as a collective live every day.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon held an event this morning, and wow-oh-wow did they announce a lot. Smart thermostats! Flying security cameras! Robot companions!</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t tune in or have time to catch it all? Here&#8217;s a recap of the biggest news:</p>
<h2><strong>Smart Thermostat</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2209308" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209308" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209308" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Amazon smart thermostat 2021" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/amazon-fall-2021-smart-thermostat-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-launches-a-60-smart-thermostat/">building a thermostat</a>, partnering with Honeywell spinoff co. Resideo to get it done. It&#8217;ll be Alexa-compatible, of course, allowing you to say things like &#8220;Alexa, turn off the AC.&#8221; At just $60 (about half the cost of the cheapest Nest), they&#8217;re definitely aiming to undercut the market here.</p>

<p>Leaning hard into the &#8220;video calling with the grandparents&#8221; part of the pandemic, Amazon is building an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-introduces-amazon-glow-an-interactive-video-calling-device-for-kids-and-families/">interactive tablet/projector thing for kids and families</a>. The 8&#8243; screen connects the kid with a remote family member, while a built-in projector beams a game onto the touch-sensitive surface in front of it. The family member on the other end of the video call can play along while they chat, interacting with the game via tablet. Amazon is working on games in partnership with Disney, Mattel and Nickelodeon. It&#8217;ll launch with an &#8220;early access price&#8221; of $250, with the price eventually increasing to $299.</p>

The one that flies around your house to record footage while you&#8217;re away? They initially didn&#8217;t announce when it would actually be available (presumably because they wanted to wait until everyone got <a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Manhack">their Half-Life references</a> out of the way,) but the company says it&#8217;s going up for purchase now on an invite-only basis.</p>

<p>Amazon acquired Blink in 2017, then acquired another security camera maker with Ring in 2018. Rather than merging the two brands into one, Blink lives on as the generally more affordable line. This morning they announced a $50 smart doorbell with 1080p video and two years of battery life, a $40 floodlight mount for its existing outdoor camera, and a $50 solar panel mount.</p>

<p>Amazon is making a robot that will roll around your house like a little Alexa-powered Wall-E.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> this week launched AngelList Stack, a new suite of products that will compete with Carta in providing services to help founders start, operate and maintain ownership over their companies. The new software will cover four bases: end-to-end incorporation, business banking, advisor equity grants and cap table management.</p>
<p>“Every time you actually go to start a company, you start off with this optimism,” said AngelList CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avlok">Avlok Kohli</a>. “You have this idea, you’re super confident, and you want to go do it, and then there is all this mundane stuff that you have to figure out.”</p>
<p>The idea with AngelList Stack is to take some of those mundane and arcane processes of starting a company, and make it simpler, said Kohli, who was a repeat founder before joining AngelList.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Wipuc1e29Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/angellist-ventures-avlok-kohli-on-rolling-funds-and-the-busy-state-of-vc/">AngelList Venture&#8217;s Avlok Kohli on rolling funds and the busy state of VC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AngelList Venture&#8217;s Avlok Kohli on rolling funds and the busy state of VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/angellist-ventures-avlok-kohli-on-rolling-funds-and-the-busy-state-of-vc/embed/#?secret=Wipuc1e29Q" data-secret="Wipuc1e29Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The end-to-end incorporation service will help founders figure out the paperwork of actually starting a company, from which state to incorporate in to what kind of business classification to pursue. It will also help founders track and file 83(b) filings, a niche but important document for those with equity that can cost millions in back taxes if done wrong.</p>
<p>By providing a simpler UX for founders, Kohli hopes AngelList can do more than a lawyer consultation when it comes to officially launching a company.</p>
<p>“Lawyers usually view incorporation as a loss leader just to build up a relationship with the founder and work with them in the future, or just to make the paperwork easier,” Kohli said. “But then they stop right there.” AngelList, alternatively, wants to then usher founders into its next tool: banking services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The banking tool has two parts: deposit accounts with interest and debit cards. Both accounts make it easier for founders to automatically accept wire transfers from investors, which can then blend into AngelList’s new cap table tool. The cap tool will include issuing digital shares, SAFEs, reporting, 409As and employee option grants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208945" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208945" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208945" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png" alt="" width="862" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png 1625w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=768,579 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=680,513 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=1536,1159 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208945" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AngelList</p></div></p>
<p>“Founders can raise their first SAFE round entirely on Stack by sending a link to investors to digitally sign the SAFE,” the company said in a statement. “Once the funds arrive in the bank account, investors are automatically added to the cap table.”</p>
<h2>A full Carta</h2>
<p>AngelList Stack has echoes of Carta, formerly named eShares. While AngelList launched with a focus on angels and venture, Carta broke out with a focus on employees and founders. Over time, both pursued scale with Carta taking over cap table land, and AngelList taking over syndicates and fund operations. As both companies mature, they are overlapping in their vision to be an end-to-end stack for venture and startups.</p>
<p>AngelList, comparatively, is a smaller organization than Carta with only $26.2 million to date, per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/angellist">Crunchbase</a>. While the ability to raise capital doesn’t necessarily illustrate the ability of a company to be successful, it can give the startup runway when its customers &#8212; other startups &#8212; face volatility. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/data-shows-which-tech-roles-might-be-most-vulnerable-amid-layoffs/">Both companies</a> had layoffs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/angellist-lays-off-a-number-of-staff-and-cuts-executive-salaries/">amid the early innings</a> of the COVID-19 pandemic. For signals of how much has changed since, AngelList said that it has nearly doubled its staff to 95 people over the past year to keep up with its product roadmap; and Carta recently valued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">its own cap table management and valuation service at $7.4 billion.</a></p>

<p>“There are a lot of experiments around point solutions, around solving different problems for different point problems for founders,” Kohli said, in reference to other competitors. “Our view is that founders prefer always being integrated into one bundle.”</p>
<p>At launch, AngelList Stack services are free but AngelList will eventually monetize through SaaS management fees, or through transaction fees on its financial tooling.</p>
<h2>Network, then platform</h2>
<p>Platform plays aren’t new to AngelList. Last year, the startup pioneered rolling funds, an investment vehicle that raises money through a quarterly subscription from interested investors. The early traction of that product inspired the firm to pivot to focus more on venture SaaS more broadly.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UfvT4YJvIt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">AngelList pioneers rolling VC funds in pivot to SaaS</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AngelList pioneers rolling VC funds in pivot to SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/embed/#?secret=UfvT4YJvIt" data-secret="UfvT4YJvIt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AngelList is pursuing a similar strategy when it comes to founders. It piloted roll-up vehicles, which allow founders to raise capital from up to 250 accredited investors with a single line on the cap table, and is now expanding into more services. In other words, AngelList appears to be unbundling venture, and rebundling founder services.</p>
<p>“We are approaching the building of the two businesses very differently,” Kohli said. He explained that the founder&#8217;s products are focused more on workflow software, while its flagship products, targeted to investors, are focused on workflow software and capital allocation.</p>
<p>While some could argue that connecting funders to founders feels like a natural synergy for AngelList to pursue, Kohli explained that the startup has no plans to become a fundraising marketplace such as Hum Capital or ClearCo.</p>
<p>“Our view is that the market is quite efficient, and we can’t offer an experience that is much better than what is happening today,” he said. Ironically, this call is a step away from what AngelList initially launched to do, which was to connect angel investors to entrepreneurs. As it pivots to work on more support SaaS tooling, AngelList is a very different company that it was 10, or even five years ago.</p>
<p>In the past, Kohli has described the power of AngelList as its capital network. Today’s launch illustrates a broader push to make AngelList a capital and creator network. The decade-old company has worked on a rebrand. AngelList.com recently rebranded to include solely AngelList Venture and rolling funds. Talent and Product Hunt, two of AngelList’s other offerings, moved to separate websites and continue operating as independent entities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today announced a new subscription service called &#8220;Alexa Together,&#8221; designed for families with aging family members who are still living independently, but who may need extra support. The $19.99 per month subscription expands on Amazon&#8217;s existing product, Alexa Care Hub, an earlier investment in elder care, by taking many of Care Hub&#8217;s features and adding on new protections, like an urgent response feature and access to a professional emergency helpline.</p>
<p>The company in November 2020 first introduced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21390531011">Care Hub,</a> an option in the Alexa mobile app, which has allowed family members to keep an eye on older parents and loved ones &#8212; with their permission &#8212; in order to receive general information about their activities and to be alerted if the loved one has called out for help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209424" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209424" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209424" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg 705w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.07-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209424" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>With Alexa Together, family members can continue to access features like care alerts, which are designed to keep family members in the loop when an aging family member asks Alexa for help.</p>
<p>Starting early next year, Alexa Together will also make it possible for multiple people to provide support for a loved one &#8212; which is useful in situations where siblings may split the duties of caring for mom or dad, for example. Even nearby neighbors could be added to the support system, so they could check on a customer&#8217;s family member in the case of an emergency.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209425" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg 868w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-28-at-12.51.03-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Caregivers can also do things like set up reminders on loved ones&#8217; devices or link to a music service so they can easily play their favorite songs, Amazon says. And they can add contacts to the family member&#8217;s Alexa account, so they can call friends and family hands-free.</p>
<p>The new subscription also introduces an urgent response feature which enables hands-free, 24/7 access to an emergency helpline. That way, if an elderly family member takes a fall at home or has another type of emergency, they can just ask Alexa to call for help.</p>
<p>Alexa will then do so and alert all the family members, neighbors and anyone else connected to the account.</p>
<p>The subscription will be offered for free for six months, then is a $19.99 per month paid subscription if you continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">iRobot’s CEO once told me, with a wink, that he didn’t become a truly successful roboticist until he became a vacuum salesman. It’s a good line, and one that betrays some fundamental truths about the industry. Robots are hard, and in a lot of ways home robots are doubly so.</p>
<p>That no one has managed to crack the code beyond the wild success of robotic vacuums like the Roomba is not for lack of trying. To date, it’s largely been the realm of startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/cozmo-maker-anki-is-shutting-its-doors/">Anki</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/04/the-lonely-death-of-jibo-the-social-robot/"> Jibo</a> (or the rare exception of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/mayfield-robotics-ceases-production-of-kuri-robot-amid-a-questionable-future/">Bosch-created Kuri</a>), but today, Amazon announced that it’s throwing its own tremendous resources behind the problem.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209179" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209179" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2209179" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/astro_media_animation-gif_01.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="575" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, it’s doing more than that. The company just announced its first robot, Astro. The product is taking its first baby steps to market as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/amazon-will-let-users-vote-on-new-alexa-with-pre-orders-including-a-cuckoo-clock/">Amazon’s Day One Edition</a> program. Previously Amazon has used the platform in a manner akin to Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where customers effectively vote with their preorders. The new robot, which shares a name with the Jetsons dog, a track on the White Stripes debut and major league baseball team in Houston, will be available on a limited basis later this year. Astro is, far and away, the most ambitious device to be launched with the program, which has thus far included things like a receipt printer and smart Cuckoo clock. It’s also the most expensive, with a price tag of $999.</p>
<p>The price, however, is set to go up quickly. Per Amazon&#8217;s press materials,</p>
<blockquote><p>Astro will cost $1,449.99, but as part of the Day 1 Editions program, it will be available for an introductory price of $999.99 and include a free six-month trial of Ring Protect Pro.</p></blockquote>

<p>The robot serves three primary functions at launch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home security</li>
<li>Monitoring loved ones</li>
<li>Offering a kind of mobile version of the in-home Alexa experience</li>
</ol>
<p>The company begun work on the robot roughly four years ago, leveraging different Amazon departments to build a fully realized home robot.</p>

<p>“We talked about AI, computer vision and processing power, and one of the topics that came up was robotics,” Amazon VP Charlie Tritschler tells TechCrunch. “How has robotics changed to make it maybe possible for consumers. We have a lot of experience using robotics in our fulfillment center, of course, but we thought about what could you do for the consumer in the home to make things more convenient or provide more peace of mind. That started us thinking about it, and by the end we were saying, ‘jeez, does anybody think we won’t have robotics in the home in five to 10 years?’ ”</p>

<p>Amazon Robotics &#8212; which began in 2012 with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/19/amazon-acquires-online-fulfillment-company-kiva-systems-for-775-million-in-cash/">acquisition of Kiva Systems</a> &#8212; formed a sounding board for the consumer team’s ideas. But the company’s existing robotics are industrial and primarily focused on getting packages delivered in the least amount of time possible. Ultimately, Amazon said it had to build many of Astro’s components from scratch &#8212; including, most notably, the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system it uses to map and navigate the home.</p>
<p>That last bit struck me as particularly surprising, given not just how complex an undertaking it is (it’s something iRobot has effectively been iterating on for a decade), but also given some of the robotic technologies Amazon currently houses. Most notably, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/amazon-acquires-autonomous-warehouse-robotics-startup-canvas-technology/"> acquired Canvas,</a> a fully autonomous warehouse cart startup, in 2019. But Amazon insists that the new SLAM system was built from the ground up, and while it considered making robotic startup acquisitions, it ultimately didn’t do so in order to build Astro. Other in-house technologies did factor in, however, including Ring’s security monitoring and various Alexa and home technologies, built into the robot, which features Amazon’s smart assistant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208848" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208848" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2208848" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CMC_0256.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208848" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interact with Astro last week, and the robot’s got a bit of a dual personality, from that perspective. The robot’s primary personality is best described as something akin to R2-D2/BB8 or Wall-E. Its face, which is effectively a screen or a tablet, sports a pair of minimalist eyes &#8212; like a set of lowercase, bolded letter “o”s. They blink and dart around from time to time, but they’re nowhere near as expressive as what Anki hired a team of ex Pixar and Dreamworks animators to create with Cozmo.</p>
<p>This is augmented by the occasional bleeps and bloops, which bring to mind the aforementioned Star Wars droids. The robot can be summoned with a “Astro,” but when you need to converse more directly, that requires an “Alexa,” at which point, the familiar voice assistant takes over.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2209189,2209182,2209190,2209188,2209187,2209184,2209186,2209191"]</p>
<p>Beyond offering some personality, Astro’s 10-inch touchscreen face also serves as a standard Echo Show display, so you can do things like watch a movie, teleconference and control your smart home. The screen moves on its own and can be manually tilted 60 degrees for a better look. The screen also supports Amazon’s new Visual ID facial recognition to personalize interactions with Astro.</p>
<p>There are a pair of speakers on-board, as well. Though the robot itself is surprisingly quiet (it&#8217;s no robotic vacuucm). In fact, Amazon tells me that they had to introduce sound a la an electric car, so you know when it&#8217;s cruising around the house. You do hear the occasional servo sound, however, when it pivots to turn by changing the directions of its wheels.</p>
<p>There’s a cargo bin on the rear (which has an optional cupholder) that can carry up to 4.4 pounds. Inside is a USB-C port so you can charge your phone. Astro itself has a Roomba-like dock and takes less than an hour to charge from zero to full.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, there are a whole bunch of sensors on board. That includes proximity sensors built into its base and a pair of cameras, including a five-megapixel RGB built into the bezel of its face/screen. The other is decidedly more surprising, popping out the top of its head. This 12-megapixel RGB/IR camera sticks up for livestreaming purposes. Its retractable base can extend as tall as four feet, to serve as a kind of periscope for the robot to get a better look.</p>

<p>Having spent around an hour with the robot and its creators, I have to say I’m pretty impressed with what the team has built here. Of course, the question of how many people are interested in owning the thing is a different one entirely. The company says it has tested Astro in “thousands” of homes to work out some of the kinks &#8212; like getting stuck in the occasional corner. The Day One program is less a public beta than a method for gauging customer interest in the product.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2209216,2209215,2209218,2209214"]</p>
<p>“I think this is the first of the robot series that we’re doing. This is an invite-only program &#8212; we want to make sure that people that get Astro can have a great experience with it, given the challenge of homes and different spaces,” says Tritschler. “As we think long term, as we think of consumer robotics, of course we want to have all different kinds of price ranges and capabilities, and have a more directed mainstream product as part of that. But we think Astro is a good place to start to reaffirm all of the work we’ve done to create value from day one and ensure that what we’ve done actually makes sense for the consumer. We’re going to be interested in getting that feedback when we start shipping the product later in the year.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is introducing two new services tied to user health and fitness, and its Halo personal health devices. They include Halo Fitness, a new service for interactive home video workouts that looks a lot like Apple Fitness+, and Halo Nutrition, a personalized, guided meal planner.</p>
<p>Both of these services will be included as part of Amazon&#8217;s Halo membership for users of its Halo line of fitness trackers, which include the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-takes-on-fitbit-with-the-80-halo-view/">new Halo View activity tracker that adds an OLED display</a>. The Halo subscription costs $3.99 per month after a six-month free trial bundled with Halo Band, or a 12-month trial with Halo View, and Amazon says it&#8217;ll include both of these new features starting later this year for Fitness, and in January 2022 for Nutrition.</p>
<p>Halo Fitness offers &#8220;studio quality workouts&#8221; led by &#8220;industry experts,&#8221; and offers real-time display of metrics like heart rate and heart rate intensity zone as captured by the Halo fitness bands. The workouts include coaches like Michael Hildebrand, Elena Cheung and Elizabeth Andrews, and it will offer cardio, strength, yoga, outdoor and mobility classes in terms of types of workouts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209363" style="width: 1350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209363" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2209363 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg" alt="Amazon Halo kitchen" width="1340" height="894" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg 1340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Halo_Kitchencooking.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1340px) 100vw, 1340px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209363" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Halo Nutrition will offer recipe discovery and meal planning, with options to create tailor-made menus based on dietary preferences and requirements, or pre-curated menus for specific diets including classic, keto, Mediterranean, Nordic, paleo, vegan and vegetarian. At launch, Amazon says it&#8217;ll have a library of over 500 recipes from partners including Whole Foods and WW, with integration with Alexa Shopping list for finding ingredients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On its first try, Rivian produced the Goldilocks of pickup trucks.</p>
<p>The Rivian R1T electric truck is neither too big nor small. It handles rock crawling and off-camber trails with ease, can zip from zero to 60 miles per hour on a dirt road in just a few seconds without the typical back-end slippage — although there is an option to provide that drifting effect — and it can crank through winding mountain roads, pushing the edge of each corner without body roll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s loaded with the kind of interior and exterior touches that put it firmly in the premium zone &#8212; and yet the Rivian R1T is no delicate flower.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s designers and engineers helped the truck steer clear of pretension by combining form and function from tip to tail. Some of the added surprises &#8212; the location of functional details like tie-downs, an air compressor and outlets &#8212; suggest that numerous Rivian employees tested the truck in real-world conditions, including camping, mountain biking and even more mundane tasks like grocery-fetching.</p>
<p>The result is a vehicle that feels right for all seasons and ready for anything. And, importantly, it&#8217;s a joy to drive.</p>
<p>On a press drive over three days, a near-production-spec R1T proved to be the electric truck none of us knew we needed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say every choice landed perfectly. There are a few hardware details and elements on the software user interface side of things that could use a nip here and a tuck there. I&#8217;m looking at you, odd notch that is maybe a pen holder, but certainly the soon-to-be dust collector by the wireless charging pad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, far more time and miles are required to provide a full review. Still, as a total package, the Rivian R1T impresses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208964" style="width: 2741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208964" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208964 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg" alt="Rivian R1T line up Colorado" width="2731" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg 2731w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2290.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>What Rivian has accomplished with the R1T is no small feat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult for established automakers to anticipate and then tick every box on consumers&#8217; wish lists. It&#8217;s even harder to mass-produce that vehicle all while maintaining proper fit and finish. Rivian is in the rarefied position of aiming to bring the first electric truck to market in the U.S., making it a vehicle that drivers will covet and doing it to scale.</p>
<p>Rivian has delivered on the desirability and drivability fronts. Now it faces two more tests: production and delivery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s making progress toward those goals. The first production Rivian R1T electric pickup truck in &#8220;Rivian blue&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/rivians-first-production-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-rolls-off-the-line/">rolled off the assembly line</a> earlier this month at the company&#8217;s factory in Normal, Illinois, marking a milestone more than a decade in the making for the automaker and its founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe.</p>
<p>The company, which started in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later, has undergone explosive growth in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years.</p>
<p>Rivian operated in secret for years before it revealed prototypes of its all-electric R1T truck and R1S SUV at the LA Auto Show in late 2018.</p>
<p>Since then, Rivian has raised billions of dollars ($10.5 billion since 2019); expanded its Normal, Illinois, factory; hired thousands of employees (more than 8,000); landed Amazon as a commercial customer; and, most recently, filed confidentially for an IPO. In addition to its Illinois factory, Rivian has facilities in Palo Alto and Irvine, California; and Plymouth, Michigan; and an office in the U.K.</p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2209311" style="width: 2059px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209311" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209311 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg" alt="" width="2049" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg 2049w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2333.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209311" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The R1T that I drove was a Launch Edition version in glacier white and equipped with Pirelli Scorpion 20-inch all-terrain tires, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">putting it at about $75,000, excluding the $1,075 destination charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Launch Edition, which comes with special badging, is no longer available. However, Rivian&#8217;s &#8220;Adventure package&#8221; trim, which starts at $73,000, is nearly identical in terms of offerings. The Launch and Adventure editions, for instance, come standard with an off-road upgrade with reinforced underbody shield, dual front bumper tow hooks and air compressor, as well as interior accents, 100% recycled microfiber headliner and “Chilewich floor mats.”</span></p>
<p>The R1T features a skateboard architecture that houses the battery pack, drive units, an independent air suspension that would prove handy, and thermal and lower body structure. This skateboard chassis integrated all of these pieces together, which means different top hats — or vehicle bodies — can be placed on top. This gives Rivian the flexibility and hopefully cost-efficiency to make numerous vehicles using the same foundation.</p>
<p>The result, in this case, is a truck with a low center of gravity and 68 cubic feet of cargo space, which the designers and engineers provide in thoughtful ways that consider customers of all heights. (The two-layered frunk, or front trunk, pictured below, being one such example.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209389" style="width: 2741px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209389" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209389 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg" alt="" width="2731" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg 2731w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2459.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2731px) 100vw, 2731px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209389" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The powertrain includes a 135-kWh lithium-ion battery, four motors for all-wheel drive and a single-speed transmission that produces 835 horsepower and 908 pound-feet of torque. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That&#8217;s a lot of numbers that loosely translate to power, performance and the added benefit of a planted feeling even while accelerating through turns.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">How Rivian architected the quad-motor drive — in which a dual-motor drive unit is on the front and rear axles — </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is worth noting here since I was able to experience why its design matters. The four motors independently adjust torque, which provides traction control in a variety of conditions. In my case, it was dirt roads. This setup also sends power to the wheels that need it most, depending on the situation, which manages slip and helps control vehicle rotation. </span></p>
<p>The vehicle&#8217;s thermal control and battery management system allows for the vehicle to tow up to 11,000 pounds and a DC fast charge rate of 140 miles in 20 minutes at 200 kilowatts — neither of which we were able to try. Those two items are on my list once I get the vehicle to myself for a few days.</p>

<p>The press drive started for everyone — except me due to a late plane arrival — at the Denver International Airport. From here, reporters drove about 100 miles along Interstate 70 up and into the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The drive would end in Breckenridge, a popular ski town that sits at the base of the Ten-Mile Range. (TechCrunch, not Rivian, paid for my travel and accommodations. Rivian supplied the truck and meals.)</p>
<p>My time in the Rivian R1T would have to wait until the following day.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, and after an outdoor breakfast served on <a href="https://rivian.com/support/article/what-is-the-camp-kitchen">the Rivian Camp Kitchen</a>, a safety check and briefing, we set off for the main event.</p>
<p>Most of the day would be spent off-road, although I would double-dip into the paved mountain highway driving portion. The initial route, which traveled along the North Fork of the Swan River before connecting to Deer Creek and Saints John (yes, Saints) trails, offered a circuit of rock crawling, a challenging V notch section and some steep uphills and downhills and a few sections of speed-friendly dirt road that allowed us to try &#8220;rally&#8221; mode. (More on that later.)</p>

<p>Drivers would eventually pass through the old mining-camp-turned-town of Montezuma and then onto Highway 6, a curvaceous stretch of paved road that travels up and over Loveland Pass. The final part of the day varied in mileage depending on the driver. The afternoon route that I and the other reporter in the truck opted for took us up and over Loveland Pass twice and then back through Keystone, onto Swan Road and to our final destination.</p>
<p>The following morning, reporters again had a chance to drive back to the airport. In all, the first drive encompassed about 270 miles over three days.</p>
<h2>The handling and performance</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2208954" style="width: 1646px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208954" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2208954 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png" alt="rivian R1T back end" width="1636" height="858" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=1536,806 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rivian-back-end.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Rivian</p></div></p>
<p>During the off-road section, the independent air suspension proved its worth. Drivers can pick from one of several modes: all-purpose, sport, off-road, conserve and towing. Within the off-road mode, there are even more options, including off-road auto, rock crawl and rally. There&#8217;s also a drift mode, which I didn&#8217;t test.</p>
<p>The ride height, damping, pedal map that controls regenerative braking and suspension on the vehicle adjust depending on the drive mode. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For instance, in conserve mode, the vehicle lowers to about 8 inches; in off-road, it can be as high as 14.9 inches. </span></p>
<p>During our off-road excursion, we put the vehicle up and over steep slopes and even made a shallow ford. The ground clearance, combined with an approach angle of 34 degrees, a breakover of 25.7 and departure angle of 29.3 degrees, meant the vehicle never scraped or stuttered. There were moments when, as I prepared to drive around a particularly large boulder — the standard technique in other vehicles — a Rivian employee would encourage me to just drive over it. And I would, without the negative results.</p>

<p>The only issue that cropped up during our day of off-road driving was the passenger window, which would occasionally lag or stop. While that would be problematic in a production-spec&#8217;d vehicle, I suspect, and would hope, that these are the kind of minor glitches found and fixed in the weeks leading up to customer deliveries.</p>
<p>While the performance of the vehicle in these various modes proved worthy, the interface made moving between them a little wonky. More on that next.</p>
<h2>User interfaces</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2209256" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209256" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209256 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg" alt="" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/210914_ERoss_MD_INT-DriverPOV_05373_FINAL-RX.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209256" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rivian</p></div></p>
<p>The interior of the vehicle provides a mostly good balance of technology and physical components. The windshield wipers and gear selector are on stalks, and thankfully not located in the central infotainment system. And there are two thumb toggles on the steering wheel for controlling volume, skipping tracks and controlling the phone and Alexa voice assistant, as well as some of the advanced driver assistance features.</p>
<p>There is also a driver monitoring system (camera) that is meant to be used when the advanced driver assistance system, branded Driver+, is activated. And there is a driver display, which is simple in its design and delivers only a few pieces of critical information, including speed, a navigation map, if needed, and range.</p>
<p>Moving to the right and center is a rectangular central touchscreen that houses nearly everything needed for the vehicle, including a few items that I wish had a redundant physical button or knob. First, a positive note: The infotainment system skips the dreaded home screen button and instead places all of the necessary items permanently on the bottom. This makes finding and navigating to almost everything intuitive.</p>

<p>You won&#8217;t find me whining for more buttons and knobs on a typical day. But when headed up a steep rocky slope, I audibly wished for the ability to move the direction of the air vent without tapping the touchscreen and moving the small dot until the air moved away from my face. Nor did I love trying to change the brake regen levels while bumping along the trail or driving along winding mountain roads.</p>
<p>Some of that awkwardness would likely be erased after more time in the truck. Still, there are specific spots — the HVAC being the big one — where I suspect the Rivian customer will want the option to grab a physical knob or vent.</p>
<p>The software in my truck operated as it should, meaning in this test truck we didn&#8217;t experience any lagginess. My phone connected easily via Bluetooth and was able to play music. Notably, the vehicle is not equipped with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.</p>
<p>Rivian does have the benefit of being software-centric and has a cloud-based architecture that will allow for over-the-air software updates that employees promise me won&#8217;t require a trip to a service center. Instead, these updates will occur with some regularity and deliver new features and apps.</p>
<p>Tesla owners have come to love the OTAs because the company has used them as a means to deliver video games and other fun surprises. The Rivian seems, at least for now, to lean less on this. The &#8220;Easter eggs&#8221; in the vehicle were hardware-focused, which might be based on what Rivian believes its future customers want.</p>
<h2>Hardware accessories</h2>
<p>There are a few hardware components such as the keys, gear tunnel and gear guard that are worth mentioning at least briefly. I&#8217;ll be digging into all of the accessories, including the nifty portable speaker, tire air compressor and flashlight, in future articles this week.</p>
<p>First up is the key. Or perhaps <em>keys</em>. Rivian developed four ways for owners to get into their vehicles: the phone app, a fob that has a carabiner-type lock, a credit-card-like key and a bracelet. That might seem like overkill, but it is in keeping with the target Rivian customer, who is active and likely on some kind of adventure in a remote area.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209210" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209210" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209210 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-keys.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209210" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Next up is the Rivian gear tunnel, which provides 11.6 cubic feet of storage. This is the central feature of the vehicle and the one design element that Scaringe told me remained consistent through numerous iterations of the truck&#8217;s early designs.</p>
<p>Inside the gear tunnel is an optional skateboard upgrade, which the $5,000 Camp Kitchen can attach to. But clearly, Rivian is preparing for more accessories — maybe a heater for ski and snowboard boots or a snap-on bucket for storing dirty biking clothes (I&#8217;m just making suggestions) — that can be attached to the skateboard.</p>
<p>The gear tunnel doors, which pop up once the user pushes a button on the pickup bed frame, drop down. The doors, which are robust enough for a person to stand on, provide more storage. In the photo below, a Rivian employee can be seen removing the air compressor attachment from one of the compartments.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209238" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209238" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209238 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="1499" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Rivian-gear-tunnel-compressor.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, there is a hardware and accompanying software feature called Gear Guard, which is included in the Adventure package trim. The system consists of a locking cable that is plugged into the truck bed wall and then can be connected to a bike mounted on the rack or other gear. Once connected, the security system kicks in, as you can see in the photo below.</p>
<p>The security system taps into the vehicle&#8217;s 10 exterior cameras and will record a person if they approach and begin to tamper with the gear. That recorded video can be viewed on the central display, stored and even shared. The missing detail is that this is not delivered immediately to the user&#8217;s phone app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209246" style="width: 2059px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209246" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2209246 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg" alt="" width="2049" height="1536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg 2049w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2466.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2049px) 100vw, 2049px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209246" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>I expect that Rivian will add that functionality as it rolls out and improves its app. That&#8217;s the beauty of building a vehicle from the ground up while focused on the integration of software and hardware: Many of these niggling details can be improved.</p>
<p>What Rivian got right just happens to be the stuff that would be the hardest to change. The truck has the off-road capability of a truck, the on-road performance of a zippy sedan or sports car and the added benefit of quiet electric power, all without skimping on design, interior material choices, software or functional accessories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of inaugural effort that should build confidence in the brand and, I suspect, will hit the right note with customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ring is just one part of Amazon&#8217;s annual devices and services event this year, but they&#8217;re bringing a lot of updates, including a new Pro Alarm suite that includes refreshed hardware and integrated Eero Wi-Fi 6 router capabilities. They also have a new service offering called &#8216;Virtual Security Guard&#8217; that basically keeps an eye on your Ring feeds the way you would in case you can&#8217;t, and they&#8217;re improving alerts on their existing doorbells and cameras with smarter event recognition.</p>
<h2>Ring Alarm Pro</h2>
<p>Ring Alarm Pro is an upgraded home security system suite that includes a base station with Eero built-in. The base station doubles as a Wi-Fi 6 router that is mesh capable for linking up to other modern Eero hardware (which is some nice consumer brand synergy for another Amazon acquisition). Ring Alarm Pro also includes 24/7 backup internet thanks to 3GB of included cellular data use per month, with extra data available at $3/1GB. Ring&#8217;s Power Pack accessories can be attached to the base station to keep the internet up and running in case of a power outage, too.</p>
<p>The Alarm Pro base station also has a microSD card slot with support for cards with up to 64GB in capacity, which can provide local video storage for your connected Ring cameras and doorbells.</p>
<p>Like Ring&#8217;s previous alarm products, it works with their motion sensors, door and window sensors and fire and moisture sensors and more. The company is also introducing a Pro tier of its subscription product ($20/month), which is how you can gain access to that cellular backup service as well as professional monitoring and (synergy again!) ad blocking, content filtering and threat protection services for your home internet via Eero.</p>
<h2>Virtual Security Guard</h2>
<p>Not to be confused with its new Pro tier subscription (which is offered alongside its existing, $10/month option), is a new separate subscription service called Virtual Security Guard that aims to replicate the benefits of having an onsite security guard.</p>
<p>Basically, this adds an additional level of scrutiny in terms of professional monitoring, through a partnership with monitoring company Rapid Response. Rapid Response personnel will keep an eye on the Ring camera and doorbell feeds you specify if you&#8217;re a member, responding to motion alerts and providing interventions including triggering sirens and lights, using two-way talk features and even escalating to actually dispatching emergency services should they judge that that&#8217;s required.</p>
<p>Ring is quick to point out the ways in which Virtual Security Guard remains wholly within the control of the individuals subscribing; cameras are opted out by default, for instance, so that a user selects which will be monitored and when. Agents also can&#8217;t activate the cameras unless they&#8217;re green lighted to be monitored in either Home or Away mode as specified by a user. They can only see real-time videos via Live View, when a motion event is detected, and videos are not saved for download or any other use by the agents. Finally, any Privacy Zones set up by a user are hidden for monitoring agents, and the Ring app also shows live when Virtual Security agents are monitoring feeds, and any past Live Views seen by the agents will also be clearly marked.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s no word on specific pricing here, but it sounds like it&#8217;s going to be a premium since it requires that a user have a professional monitoring plan in place already. They also have to have an outdoor, hardwired video doorbell or security cam from Ring in place in order to use the program, and it&#8217;s going to be available on an invite-only basis starting later this year.</p>
<h2>Custom Event and Package Alerts</h2>

<p>Ring has a lot of pretty flashy announcements this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rings-home-security-drone-is-now-available-in-the-u-s-via-invite-only">including its flying drone actually shipping</a>, but the news that might be the most useful to most of its users is the introduction of new smart alerts, including Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts.</p>
<p>Package Alerts do exactly what they say, offering you the ability to specify a zone of your choosing and get an alert anytime a package is present in that zone. So you could set it up to watch your front step or your porch, for instance, and get an alert about anything Amazon (for instance) drops off there.</p>
<p>Those are going to be available to anyone with Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 and Ring Video Doorbell (2020 model year) devices with roll-out starting today — provided you have a Ring Protect Plan.</p>
<p>Custom Event Alerts apply for Spotlight Battery Cam users, again provide they have a Ring Protect Plan, and will offer a bit more custom flexibility. So you can, for instance, use a still of your garage door closed as captured by your Ring, and a still of it open, and teach it to differentiate between those two states and alert you about state changes when they happen. Ring mentions this can work with gates and doors, and other types of state changes as defined by users. It&#8217;s going to start rolling out a bit later than Package Alerts, with availability expected &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last but not least, Ring is targeting the contractor and job site management crowd with Jobsite Security, a product based around the Ring Alarm Pro that tweaks it for professional use with upgrades like Outdoor Contact sensors for keeping track of gate open/closed status, for instance. There&#8217;s also a lot of Safety Orange involved, which reflects the target audience (pun intended because safety orange is in part used for its reflectivity).</p>
<p>Jobsite Security is a team-up with The Home Depot, which will sell it exclusively starting at $399.99. It&#8217;s a smart extension of the company&#8217;s brand beyond the domestic sphere, and may be a precursor to more B2B efforts to come.</p>
