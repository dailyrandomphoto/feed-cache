										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Apple announced a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of new features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targeted at child safety on its devices. Though not live yet, the features will arrive later this year for users. Though the goals of these features are universally accepted to be good ones &#8212; the protection of minors and the limit of the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), there have been some questions about the methods Apple is using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Erik Neuenschwander, Head of Privacy at Apple, about the new features launching for its devices. He shared detailed answers to many of the concerns that people have about the features and talked at length to some of the tactical and strategic issues that could come up once this system rolls out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also asked about the rollout of the features, which come closely intertwined but are really completely separate systems that have similar goals. To be specific, Apple is announcing three different things here, some of which are being confused with one another in coverage and in the minds of the public. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/apple-icloud-photos-scanning/"><b>CSAM detection in iCloud Photos</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A detection system called NeuralHash creates identifiers it can compare with IDs from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other entities to detect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">known CSAM content</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in iCloud Photo libraries. Most cloud providers already scan user libraries for this information &#8212; Apple’s system is different in that it does the matching on device rather than in the cloud.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/"><b>Communication Safety in Messages</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A feature that a parent opts to turn on for a minor on their iCloud Family account. It will alert children when an image they are going to view has been detected to be explicit and it tells them that it will also alert the parent.</span></p>
<p><b>Interventions in Siri and search</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; A feature that will intervene when a user tries to search for CSAM-related terms through Siri and search and will inform the user of the intervention and offer resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on all of these features you can read our articles linked above or </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s new FAQ</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it posted this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From personal experience, I know that there are people who don’t understand the difference between those first two systems, or assume that there will be some possibility that they may come under scrutiny for innocent pictures of their own children that may trigger some filter. It’s led to confusion in what is already a complex rollout of announcements. These two systems are completely separate, of course, with CSAM detection looking for precise matches with content that is already known to organizations to be abuse imagery. Communication Safety in Messages takes place entirely on the device and reports nothing externally &#8212; it&#8217;s just there to flag to a child that they are or could be about to be viewing explicit images. This feature is opt-in by the parent and transparent to both parent and child that it is enabled.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188037" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png 2004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-7.58.23-AM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188037" class="wp-caption-text">Apple&#8217;s Communication Safety in Messages feature.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have also been questions about the on-device hashing of photos to create identifiers that can be compared with the database. Though NeuralHash is a technology that can be used for other kinds of features like faster search in photos, it&#8217;s not currently used for anything else on iPhone aside from CSAM detection. When iCloud Photos is disabled, the feature stops working completely. This offers an opt-out for people but at an admittedly steep cost given the convenience and integration of iCloud Photos with Apple’s operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this interview won’t answer every possible question related to these new features, this is the most extensive on-the-record discussion by Apple’s senior privacy member. It seems clear from Apple’s willingness to provide access and its ongoing FAQ’s and press briefings (there have been at least 3 so far and likely many more to come) that it feels that it has a good solution here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the concerns and resistance, it seems as if it is willing to take as much time as is necessary to convince everyone of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Most other cloud providers have been scanning for CSAM for some time now. Apple has not. Obviously there are no current regulations that say that you must seek it out on your servers, but there is some roiling regulation in the EU and other countries. Is that the impetus for this? Basically, why now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erik Neuenschwander: Why now comes down to the fact that we&#8217;ve now got the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy. This is an area we&#8217;ve been looking at for some time, including current state of the art techniques which mostly involves scanning through entire contents of users libraries on cloud services that &#8212; as you point out &#8212; isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve ever done; to look through user&#8217;s iCloud Photos. This system doesn&#8217;t change that either, it neither looks through data on the device, nor does it look through all photos in iCloud Photos. Instead what it does is gives us a new ability to identify accounts which are starting collections of known CSAM.</span></p>
<p><b>So the development of this new CSAM detection technology is the watershed that makes now the time to launch this. And Apple feels that it can do it in a way that it feels comfortable with and that is ‘good’ for your users?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s exactly right. We have two co-equal goals here. One is to improve child safety on the platform and the second is to preserve user privacy, And what we&#8217;ve been able to do across all three of the features, is bring together technologies that let us deliver on both of those goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Announcing the Communications safety in Messages features and the CSAM detection in iCloud Photos system at the same time seems to have created confusion about their capabilities and goals. Was it a good idea to announce them concurrently? And why were they announced concurrently, if they are separate systems?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, while they are [two] systems they are also of a piece along with our increased interventions that will be coming in Siri and search. As important as it is to identify collections of known CSAM where they are stored in Apple&#8217;s iCloud Photos service, It&#8217;s also important to try to get upstream of that already horrible situation. So CSAM detection means that there&#8217;s already known CSAM that has been through the reporting process, and is being shared widely re-victimizing children on top of the abuse that had to happen to create that material in the first place. for the creator of that material in the first place. And so to do that, I think is an important step, but it is also important to do things to intervene earlier on when people are beginning to enter into this problematic and harmful area, or if there are already abusers trying to groom or to bring children into situations where abuse can take place, and Communication Safety in Messages and our interventions in Siri and search actually strike at those parts of the process. So we&#8217;re really trying to disrupt the cycles that lead to CSAM that then ultimately might get detected by our system.</span></p>

<p><b>Governments and agencies worldwide are constantly pressuring all large organizations that have any sort of end-to-end or even partial encryption enabled for their users. They often lean on CSAM and possible terrorism activities as rationale to argue for backdoors or encryption defeat measures. Is launching the feature and this capability with on-device hash matching an effort to stave off those requests and say, look, we can provide you with the information that you require to track down and prevent CSAM activity &#8212; but without compromising a user’s privacy?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, first, you talked about the device matching so I just want to underscore that the system as designed doesn&#8217;t reveal &#8212; in the way that people might traditionally think of a match &#8212; the result of the match to the device or, even if you consider the vouchers that the device creates, to Apple. Apple is unable to process individual vouchers; instead, all the properties of our system mean that it&#8217;s only once an account has accumulated a collection of vouchers associated with illegal, known CSAM images that we are able to learn anything about the user&#8217;s account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, why to do it is because, as you said, this is something that will provide that detection capability while preserving user privacy. We&#8217;re motivated by the need to do more for child safety across the digital ecosystem, and all three of our features, I think, take very positive steps in that direction. At the same time we&#8217;re going to leave privacy undisturbed for everyone not engaged in the illegal activity.</span></p>
<p><b>Does this, creating a framework to allow scanning and matching of on-device content, create a framework for outside law enforcement to counter with, ‘we can give you a list, we don&#8217;t want to look at all of the user’s data but we can give you a list of content that we&#8217;d like you to match’. And if you can match it with this content you can match it with other content we want to search for. How does it not undermine Apple’s current position of ‘hey, we can&#8217;t decrypt the user&#8217;s device, it&#8217;s encrypted, we don&#8217;t hold the key?’</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t change that one iota. The device is still encrypted, we still don&#8217;t hold the key, and the system is designed to function on on-device data. What we&#8217;ve designed has a device side component &#8212; and it has the device side component by the way, for privacy improvements. The alternative of just processing by going through and trying to evaluate users data on a server is actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amenable to changes [without user knowledge], and less protective of user privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature. I understand that it&#8217;s a complex attribute that a feature of the service has a portion where the voucher is generated on the device, but again, nothing&#8217;s learned about the content on the device. The voucher generation is actually exactly what enables us not to have to begin processing all users&#8217; content on our servers which we&#8217;ve never done for iCloud Photos. It&#8217;s those sorts of systems that I think are more troubling when it comes to the privacy properties &#8212; or how they could be changed without any user insight or knowledge to do things other than what they were designed to do.</span></p>
<p><b>One of the bigger queries about this system is that Apple has said that it will just refuse action if it is asked by a government or other agency to compromise by adding things that are not CSAM to the database to check for them on-device. There are some examples where Apple has had to comply with local law at the highest levels if it wants to operate there, China being an example. So how do we trust that Apple is going to hew to this rejection of interference If pressured or asked by a government to compromise the system?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well first, that is launching only for US, iCloud accounts, and so the hypotheticals seem to bring up generic countries or other countries that aren&#8217;t the US when they speak in that way, and the therefore it seems to be the case that people agree US law doesn&#8217;t offer these kinds of capabilities to our government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even in the case where we&#8217;re talking about some attempt to change the system, it has a number of protections built in that make it not very useful for trying to identify individuals holding specifically objectionable images. The hash list is built into the operating system, we have one global operating system and don&#8217;t have the ability to target updates to individual users and so hash lists will be shared by all users when the system is enabled. And secondly, the system requires the threshold of images to be exceeded so trying to seek out even a single image from a person&#8217;s device or set of people&#8217;s devices won&#8217;t work because the system simply does not provide any knowledge to Apple for single photos stored in our service. And then, thirdly, the system has built into it a stage of manual review where, if an account is flagged with a collection of illegal CSAM material, an Apple team will review that to make sure that it is a correct match of illegal CSAM material prior to making any referral to any external entity. And so the hypothetical requires jumping over a lot of hoops, including having Apple change its internal process to refer material that is not illegal, like known CSAM and that we don&#8217;t believe that there&#8217;s a basis on which people will be able to make that request in the US. And the last point that I would just add is that it does still preserve user choice, if a user does not like this kind of functionality, they can choose not to use iCloud Photos and if iCloud Photos is not enabled no part of the system is functional.</span></p>
<p><b>So if iCloud Photos is disabled, the system does not work, which is the public language </b><a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><b>in the FAQ</b></a><b>. I just wanted to ask specifically, when you disable iCloud Photos, does this system continue to create hashes of your photos on device, or is it completely inactive at that point?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If users are not using iCloud Photos, NeuralHash will not run and will not generate any vouchers. CSAM detection is a neural hash being compared against a database of the known CSAM hashes that are part of the operating system image. None of that piece, nor any of the additional parts including the creation of the safety vouchers or the uploading of vouchers to iCloud Photos is functioning if you’re not using iCloud Photos. </span></p>
<p><b>In recent years, Apple has often leaned into the fact that on-device processing preserves user privacy. And in nearly every previous case and I can think of that&#8217;s true. Scanning photos to identify their content and allow me to search them, for instance. I’d rather that be done locally and never sent to a server. However, in this case, it seems like there may actually be a sort of anti-effect in that you&#8217;re scanning locally, but for external use cases, rather than scanning for personal use &#8212; creating a ‘less trust’ scenario in the minds of some users. Add to this that every other cloud provider scans it on their servers and the question becomes why should this implementation being different from most others engender </b><b><i>more</i></b><b> trust in the user rather than </b><b><i>less</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;re raising the bar, compared to the industry standard way to do this. Any sort of server side algorithm that&#8217;s processing all users photos is putting that data at more risk of disclosure and is, by definition, less transparent in terms of what it&#8217;s doing on top of the user&#8217;s library. So, by building this into our operating system, we gain the same properties that the integrity of the operating system provides already across so many other features, the one global operating system that&#8217;s the same for all users who download it and install it, and so it in one property is much more challenging, even how it would be targeted to an individual user. On the server side that&#8217;s actually quite easy &#8212; trivial. To be able to have some of the properties and building it into the device and ensuring it&#8217;s the same for all users with the features enable give a strong privacy property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, you point out how use of on device technology is privacy preserving, and in this case, that&#8217;s a representation that I would make to you, again. That it&#8217;s really the alternative to where users&#8217; libraries have to be processed on a server that is less private.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The things that we can say with this system is that it leaves privacy completely undisturbed for every other user who&#8217;s not into this illegal behavior, Apple gain no additional knowledge about any users cloud library. No user&#8217;s iCloud Library has to be processed as a result of this feature. Instead what we&#8217;re able to do is to create these cryptographic safety vouchers. They have mathematical properties that say, Apple will only be able to decrypt the contents or learn anything about the images and users specifically that collect photos that match illegal, known CSAM hashes, and that&#8217;s just not something anyone can say about a cloud processing scanning service, where every single image has to be processed in a clear decrypted form and run by routine to determine who knows what? At that point it&#8217;s very easy to determine anything you want [about a user&#8217;s images] versus our system only what is determined to be those images that match a set of known CSAM hashes that came directly from NCMEC and and other child safety organizations. </span></p>
<p><b>Can this CSAM detection feature stay holistic when the device is physically compromised? Sometimes cryptography gets bypassed locally, somebody has the device in hand &#8212; are there any additional layers there?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s important to underscore how very challenging and expensive and rare this is. It&#8217;s not a practical concern for most users though it&#8217;s one we take very seriously, because the protection of data on the device is paramount for us. And so if we engage in the hypothetical where we say that there has been an attack on someone&#8217;s device: that is such a powerful attack that there are many things that that attacker could attempt to do to that user. There&#8217;s a lot of a user’s data that they could potentially get access to. And the idea that the most valuable thing that an attacker &#8212; who&#8217;s undergone such an extremely difficult action as breaching someone&#8217;s device &#8212; was that they would want to trigger a manual review of an account doesn&#8217;t make much sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, let&#8217;s remember, even if the threshold is met, and we have some vouchers that are decrypted by Apple. The next stage is a manual review to determine if that account should be referred to NCMEC or not, and that is something that we want to only occur in cases where it&#8217;s a legitimate high value report. We&#8217;ve designed the system in that way, but if we consider the attack scenario you brought up, I think that&#8217;s not a very compelling outcome to an attacker.</span></p>
<p><b>Why is there a threshold of images for reporting, isn’t one piece of CSAM content too many?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to ensure that the reports that we make to NCMEC are high value and actionable, and one of the notions of all systems is that there&#8217;s some uncertainty built in to whether or not that image matched, And so the threshold allows us to reach that point where we expect a false reporting rate for review of one in 1 trillion accounts per year. So, working against the idea that we do not have any interest in looking through users&#8217; photo libraries outside those that are holding collections of known CSAM the threshold allows us to have high confidence that those accounts that we review are ones that when we refer to NCMEC, law enforcement will be able to take up and effectively investigate, prosecute and convict.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just months after raising $28 million, </span><a href="http://getjerry.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today that it has raised $75 million in a Series C round that values the company at $450 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backer Goodwater Capital doubled down on its investment in Jerry, leading the “oversubscribed” round. Bow Capital, Kamerra, Highland Capital Partners and Park West Asset Management also participated in the financing, which brings Jerry’s total raised to $132 million since its 2017 inception. Goodwater Capital also led the startup’s Series B </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jerry’s new valuation is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about “4x” that of the company at its Series B round, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder and CEO Art Agrawal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What factored into the current valuation is our annual recurring revenue, growing customer base and total addressable market,” he told TechCrunch, declining to be more specific about ARR other than to say it is growing “at a very fast rate.” He also said the company “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to meet and exceed growth and revenue targets” with its first product, a service for comparing and buying car insurance. At the time of the company&#8217;s last raise, Agrawal said Jerry saw its revenue surge by &#8220;10x&#8221; in 2020 compared to 2019.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI-powered Jerry raises $28M to help you save money on car insurance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ai-powered-jerry-raises-28m-to-help-you-save-money-on-car-insurance/embed/#?secret=we2WbYw8cF" data-secret="we2WbYw8cF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry, which says it has evolved its model to a mobile-first car ownership “super app,” aims to save its customers time and money on car expenses. The Palo Alto-based startup launched its car insurance comparison service using artificial intelligence and machine learning in January 2019. It has quietly since amassed nearly 1 million customers across the United States as a licensed insurance broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today as a consumer, you have to go to multiple different places to deal with different things,” Agrawal said at the time of the company’s last raise. “Jerry is out to change that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new funding round fuels the launch of the company’s “compare-and-buy” marketplaces in new verticals, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing, repair, warranties, parking, maintenance and “additional money-saving services.” Although Jerry also offers a similar product for home insurance, its focus is on car ownership.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div>Agrawal told TechCrunch that the company is on track to triple last year’s policy sales, and that its policy sales volume makes Jerry the number one broker for a few of the top 10 insurance carriers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The U.S. auto insurance industry is an at least $250 billion market,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The market opportunity for our first auto financing service is $260 billion. As we enter more car expense categories, our total addressable market continues to grow.&#8221;</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to reliable and affordable transportation is critical to economic empowerment,” said Rafi Syed, Jerry board member and general partner at Bow Capital, which also doubled down on its investment in the company. “Jerry is helping car owners make the most of every dollar they earn. While we see Jerry as an excellent technology investment showcasing the power of data in financial services, it’s also a high-performing investment in terms of the financial inclusion it supports.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital Partner Chi-Hua Chien said the firm’s recurring revenue model makes it stand out from lead generation-based car insurance comparison sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Agrawal agrees, noting that Jerry&#8217;s high-performing annual recurring revenue model has made the company “attractive to investors” in addition to the fact that the startup “straddles” the auto, e-commerce, fintech and insurtech industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognized those investment opportunities could drive our business faster and led to raising the round earlier than expected,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re eager to launch new categories to save customers time and money on auto expenses and the new investment shortens our time to market.”</span></p>
<p>Agrawal also believes Jerry is different from other auto-related marketplaces out there in that it aims to help consumers with various aspects of car ownership (from repair to maintenance to insurance to warranties), rather than just one. The company also believes it is set apart from competitors in that it doesn’t refer a consumer to an insurance carrier’s site so that they still have to do the work of signing up with them separately, for example. Rather, Jerry uses automation to give consumers customized quotes from more than 45 insurance carriers “in 45 seconds.” The consumers can then sign on to the new carrier via Jerry, which can then cancel former policies on their behalf.</p>
<p>Jerry makes recurring revenue from earning a percentage of the premium when a consumer purchases a policy on its site from carriers such as Progressive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, the autonomous vehicle company born out of a $4 billion joint venture with Aptiv and Hyundai, is expanding its presence in California by opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into the area follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional&#8217;s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">fully driverless robotaxi services</a> in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>While Motional declined to disclose its investment into the California expansion, the company is clearly putting its capital to work with plans to hire dozens of people and scale up operations in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p>Motional has had an office in Los Angeles since 2016. The LA office is where some of the company&#8217;s machine learning and hardware engineers are based. As part of its expansion plan, Motional has moved the team into a larger location in Santa Monica near the Santa Monica Pier.</p>
<p>Mortional is also opening a new operations facility located a few miles away and plans to more than double the number of employees based in Los Angeles to more than 100 people. The operations facility will support Motional&#8217;s plans to begin mapping roads and eventually testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads. Testing routes will initially be centered in and around the Santa Monica area, near its office and operations facility.</p>
<p>Motional said it will use the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/">all-electric Hyundai IONIQ 5</a>, the vehicle that will be the cornerstone of its eventual commercial robotaxi service, in its testing there. The Hyundai IONIQ 5, which was revealed in February 2021 with a consumer release date expected later this year, will be fully integrated with Motional&#8217;s driverless system. The vehicles will be equipped with the hardware and software needed for Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities such as lidar, radar and cameras. Level 4, is a designation by SAE, that means the vehicle will handle all driving operations in certain conditions and environments.</p>
<p>For now, the testing will involve autonomous vehicles with a safety driver behind the wheel. The company does not yet have a permit in the state to test its AVs without a human operator behind the wheel. That permit issued by the California Department of Motor Vehicles,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is first time the company has tested on public roads in Los Angeles. Motional already tests its AVs in Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh and Singapore.</p>
<p>Motional&#8217;s President and CEO Karl Iagnemma described this as a &#8220;doubling down&#8221; of its West Coast footprint. &#8220;This expansion is the latest in our growth trajectory and will position Motional with the talent, testing capabilities, and R&amp;D resources we need to deliver on our commercialization roadmap, Iagnemma said, adding that Los Angeles has long been an important part of its global operations.</p>
<p>Motional has also opened an office in Milpitas, a Silicon Valley town located in the southern section of the San Francisco Bay. The company&#8217;s compute design team will be based out of this office, Motional said in its announcement.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi has today announced the CyberDog, an open-source quadruped robot intended for developers to “build upon” and create applications for. The machine, which resembles a beefier version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-spot-enterprise-self-charging-spot-arm-153956229.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Boston Dynamics’ Spot,</a> is a showcase for Xiaomi’s engineering know-how, including its proprietary servo motors.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2F83b74d60-f9e4-11eb-a9ff-d4be069b0cc1&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=3324989bc504a34271872aabb152715e580c9495" alt="Xiaomi CyberDog" data-uuid="9cb1a42f-f613-38a9-b7a7-139232f90084" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div>
</figure>
<p>Running the show is a version of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">NVIDIA’s Jetson Xavier NX</a>, which has been dubbed the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. In terms of being able to experience the world, CyberDog has 11 sensors over its body, including touch and ultrasonic sensors, cameras and GPS to help it “interact with its environment.”</p>
<p>Xiaomi says that this technology is good enough to enable CyberDog to follow its owner and navigate around obstacles. It is also capable of identifying posture and tracking human faces, enabling it to pick out and track individuals in a group.</p>
<figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2F1ddc12b0-f9de-11eb-bbdb-7d384d28c280&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=b62c015fec4baca2c1da1270b096807e213a1149" alt="Render of the Xiaomi CyberDog in all of its terrifying glory." data-uuid="02f6c36a-49e2-3729-a844-10c971d3bd7a" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div>
</figure>
<p>Rather than selling this as a general-sale product, the company is for now going to release 1,000 of these things to “Xiaomi fans, engineers and robotics enthusiasts to jointly explore the immense possibility of CyberDog.” This will be facilitated by an open-source community, hosted by Xiaomi, which may be followed by the construction of a robotics laboratory to lay a pathway for “future innovations.”</p>
<p>Of course, this thing isn’t cheap, and those folks willing to get involved will need to shell out 9,999 yuan or around $1,540 to get one of these for themselves.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Privacy is emotional — we often value privacy the most when we feel vulnerable or powerless when confronted with creepy data practices. But in the eyes of the court, emotions don&#8217;t always constitute harm or a reason for structural change in how privacy is legally codified.</p>
<p>It might take a material perspective on widening privacy disparities — and their implication in broader social inequality — to catalyze the privacy improvements the U.S. desperately needs.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s leaders announced their plans for the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) update in 2020. In short, iOS users can refuse an app&#8217;s ability to track their activity on other apps and websites. The ATT update has led to a sweeping <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-apple-tightens-tracking-rules-advertisers-shift-spending-toward-android-devices-11625477401">three-quarters</a> of iOS users opting out of cross-app tracking.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Whenever one user base gears up with privacy protections, companies simply redirect their data practices along the path of least resistance.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With less data available to advertisers looking to develop individual profiles for targeted advertising, targeted ads for iOS users look less effective and appealing to ad agencies. As a result, new findings show that advertisers are spending <a href="https://bgr.com/tech/apples-iphone-is-so-good-at-protecting-privacy-advertisers-are-giving-up-and-switching-to-android/">one-third less</a> in advertising spending on iOS devices.</p>
<p>They are redirecting that capital into advertising on Android systems, which<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"> account</a> for just over 42.06% of the mobile OS market share, compared to iOS at 57.62%.</p>
<p>Beyond a vague sense of creepiness, privacy disparities increasingly pose risks of material harm: emotional, reputational, economic and otherwise. If privacy belongs to all of us, as many tech companies say, then why does it cost so much? Whenever one user base gears up with privacy protections, companies simply redirect their data practices along the path of least resistance, toward the populations with fewer resources, legal or technical, to control their data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>More than just ads</h2>
<p>As more money goes into Android ads, we could expect advertising techniques to become more sophisticated, or at least more aggressive. It is not illegal for companies to engage in targeted advertising, so long as it is done in compliance with users&#8217; legal rights to opt out under relevant laws like CCPA in California.</p>
<p>This raises two immediate issues. First, residents of every state except California currently lack such opt-out rights. Second, granting some users the right to opt out of targeted advertising strongly implies that there are harms, or at least risks, to targeted advertising. And indeed, there can be.</p>
<p>Targeted advertising involves third parties building and maintaining behind-the-scenes profiles of users based on their behavior. Gathering data on app activity, such as fitness habits or shopping patterns, could lead to further inferences about sensitive aspects of a user&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>At this point, a representation of a user exists in an under-regulated data system containing — whether correctly or incorrectly inferenced — data that the user did not consent to sharing. (Unless the user lives in California, but let&#8217;s suppose they live anywhere else in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Further, research finds that targeted advertising, in building detailed profiles of users, can enact discrimination in<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/how-targeted-ads-and-dynamic-pricing-can-perpetuate-bias"> housing and employment opportunities</a>, sometimes in violation of federal law. And targeted advertising can impede individuals&#8217; autonomy, preemptively narrowing their window of purchasing options, even when they don&#8217;t want to. On the other hand, targeted advertising can support niche or grassroots organizations in connecting them directly with interested audiences. Regardless of a stance on targeted advertising, the underlying problem is when users have no say in whether they are subject to it.</p>
<p>Targeted advertising is a massive and booming practice, but it is only one practice within a broader web of business activities that do not prioritize respect for users&#8217; data. And these practices are not illegal in much of the U.S. Instead of the law, your pocketbook can keep you clear of data disrespect.</p>
<h2>Privacy as a luxury</h2>
<p>Prominent tech companies, particularly Apple, declare privacy a human right, which makes complete sense from a business standpoint. In the absence of the U.S. federal government codifying privacy rights for all consumers, a bold privacy commitment from a private company sounds pretty appealing.</p>
<p><em>If the government isn&#8217;t going to set a privacy standard, at least my phone manufacturer will</em>. Even though only<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/05/04/how-americans-see-digital-privacy-issues-amid-the-covid-19-outbreak/"> 6%</a> of Americans claim to understand how companies use their data, it is companies that are making the broad privacy moves.</p>
<p>But if those declaring privacy as a human right only make products affordable to some, what does that say about our human rights? Apple products skew toward<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Infographics/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users"> wealthier, more educated consumers</a> compared to competitors&#8217; products. This projects a troubling future of increasingly exacerbated privacy disparities between the haves and the have-nots, where a feedback loop is established: Those with fewer resources to acquire privacy protections may have fewer resources to navigate the technical and legal challenges that come with a practice as convoluted as targeted advertising.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take this as me siding with Facebook in its feud with Apple about privacy versus affordability (see:<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-fired-dozens-abusing-access-user-data-an-ugly-truth-2021-7"> systemic access control issues</a> recently coming to light). In my view, neither side of that battle is winning.</p>
<p>We deserve meaningful privacy protections that everyone can afford. In fact, to turn the phrase on its head, <em>we deserve meaningful privacy protections that no company can afford to omit from their products. </em>We deserve a both/and approach: privacy that is both meaningful and widely available.</p>
<h2>Our next steps forward</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, there are two key areas for privacy progress: privacy legislation and privacy tooling for developers. I again invoke the both/and approach. We need lawmakers, rather than tech companies, setting reliable privacy standards for consumers. And we need widely available developer tools that give developers no reason — financially, logistically or otherwise — to implement privacy at the product level.</p>
<p>On privacy legislation, I believe that policy professionals are already raising some excellent points, so I&#8217;ll direct you to some of my favorite recent writing from them.</p>
<p>Stacey Gray and her team at the Future of Privacy Forum have begun an excellent<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/preemption-in-us-federal-privacy-laws/"> blog series</a> on how a federal privacy law could interact with the emerging patchwork of state laws.</p>
<p>Joe Jerome published an outstanding<a href="https://techpolicy.press/a-post-mortem-on-state-privacy-legislation/"> recap</a> of the 2021 state-level privacy landscape and the routes toward widespread privacy protections for all Americans. A key takeaway: The effectiveness of privacy regulation hinges on how well it harmonizes among individuals and businesses. That&#8217;s not to say that regulation should be business-friendly, but rather that businesses should be able to reference clear privacy standards so they can confidently and respectfully handle everyday folks&#8217; data.</p>
<p>On privacy tooling, if we make privacy tools readily accessible and affordable for all developers, we really leave tech with zero excuses to meet privacy standards. Take the issue of access control, for instance. Engineers attempt to build manual controls over which personnel and end users can access various data in a complex data ecosystem already populated with sensitive personal information.</p>
<p>The challenge is twofold. First, the horse has already bolted. Technical debt accumulates rapidly, while privacy has remained outside of software development. Engineers need tools that enable them to build privacy features like nuanced access control prior to production.</p>
<p>This leads into the second aspect of the challenge: Even if the engineers overcame all of the technical debt and could make structural privacy improvements at the code level, what standards and widely available tools are available to use?</p>
<p>As a June 2021<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/new-fpf-report-highlights-privacy-tech-sector-evolving-from-compliance-tools-to-platforms-for-risk-management-and-data-utilization/"> report</a> from the Future of Privacy Forum makes clear, privacy technology is in dire need of consistent definitions, which are required for widespread adoption of trustworthy privacy tools. With more consistent definitions and widely available developer tools for privacy, these technical transformations translate into material improvements in how tech at large — not just tech of Brand XYZ — gives users control over their data.</p>
<p>We need privacy rules set by an institution that is not itself playing the game. Regulation alone cannot save us from modern privacy perils, but it is a vital ingredient in any viable solution.</p>
<p>Alongside regulation, every software engineering team should have privacy tools immediately available. When civil engineers are building a bridge, they cannot make it safe for a subset of the population; it must work for all who cross it. The same must hold for our data infrastructure, lest we exacerbate disparities within and beyond the digital realm.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The deal is notable because it is Robinhood's first major purchase since going public in July, and because it illustrates where Robinhood may look to invest some of its newly liquid equity wealth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. consumer investing and trading service Robinhood announced this morning that it will acquire Say Technologies in a $140 million cash deal.</p>
<p>Say Technologies is a venture-backed startup, having <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/asayinc/company_financials">raised $8 million in 2018, per Crunchbase data</a>. <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company was worth $28 million on a post-money basis following the investment, implying that the company&#8217;s backers managed a roughly 5x return on their investment.</p>
<p>Say was backed by Point72 Ventures, among other investors.</p>
<p>The deal is notable because it is Robinhood&#8217;s first major purchase since going public in late July, and because it illustrates where Robinhood may look to invest some of its newly liquid equity wealth; when a company goes public, it can more easily purchase other companies thanks to recharged cash balances and a floating stock.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Robinhood <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/8/10/say-technologies-is-joining-robinhood">wrote</a> that &#8220;Say was built on the belief that everyone should have the same access to the financial markets as Wall Street insiders.&#8221; What does that mean? In practice, Say has built a communications platform that allows even smaller shareholders to pose questions to the companies in which they invest. Sure, some companies are including retail questions in their earnings calls, but what Say has in mind is broader.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OYzir089JD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/embed/#?secret=OYzir089JD" data-secret="OYzir089JD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You can see how Say and Robinhood might fit together. Robinhood has a huge user pool of retail investors who like to trade and invest. Say has the technology to connect retail investors to the companies that they own. With Robinhood&#8217;s database of which retail investor owns what, and Say&#8217;s communications tech, the trading platform may be able to offer a better shareholder experience than what rival platforms can offer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By offering a service like what Say has built to its user base, Robinhood can offer a unique twist on retail investing. This feels somewhat analogous to Spotify spending heavily to procure exclusive rights to certain podcasts; such efforts differentiate Spotify from rivals despite having a commoditized core offering. Trading is now free in many places, so Robinhood layering specialized services on top of its investing service makes good sense, perhaps helping drive user loyalty and net new-user adds.</p>
<p>Shares of Robinhood are off around 1.2% today, despite generally higher markets. We might say that investors were selling lightly in wake of the news, but that would be a somewhat bold read of the day&#8217;s trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal-owned Venmo is expanding its support for cryptocurrency with today&#8217;s launch of a new feature that will allow users to automatically buy cryptocurrency using the cash back they earned from their Venmo credit card purchases. Unlike when buying cryptocurrency directly, these automated purchases will have no transaction fees associated with them &#8212; a feature Venmo says is not a promotion, but how the system will work long term. Instead, a cryptocurrency conversion spread is built into each monthly transaction.</p>
<p>Cardholders will be able to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash through the new &#8220;Cash Back to Crypto&#8221; option, rolling out now to the Venmo app.</p>
<p>Venmo had first introduced the ability for customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency in April of this year, as part of a larger investment in cryptocurrency led by parent company, PayPal. In partnership with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paxos.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618924466703000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFORHplBX48OKy9S0KRYp6IimIx9A"><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">Paxos Trust Company</span></a><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services, Venmo&#8217;s over 70 million users are now able to access cryptocurrency from within the Venmo app. </span></p>
<p>The cash back feature, meanwhile, could help drive sign-ups for the Venmo Credit Card, by interlinking it with the cryptocurrency functionality. Currently, Venmo cardholders can earn monthly cash back across eight different spending categories, with up to 3% back on their top eligible spending category, then 2% and 1% back on the second highest and all other purchases, respectively. The top two categories are adjusted monthly, based on where consumers are spending the most.</p>
<p>To enable Cash Back to Crypto, Venmo customers will navigate to the Venmo Credit Card home screen in the app, select the Rewards tab, then &#8220;Get Started.&#8221; From here, they&#8217;ll agree to the terms, select the crypto of their choice, and confirm their selection. Once enabled, when the cash back funds hit the customer&#8217;s Venmo balance, the money is immediately used to make a crypto purchase &#8212; no interaction on the user&#8217;s part is required.</p>
<p>The feature will not include any transaction fees, as a cryptocurrency conversion spread is built into each monthly transaction. This is similar to how <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-03-30-PayPal-Launches-Checkout-with-Crypto">PayPal is handling Checkout with Crypto,</a> which allows online shoppers to make purchases using their cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency is converted to fiat, but there are not transaction fees.</p>
<p>The feature can also be turned on or off at any time, Venmo notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company views Cash Back to Crypto as a way for newcomers to cryptocurrency to enter the market, without having to worry about the process of making crypto purchases. It&#8217;s more of a set-it-and-forget-it type of feature. However, unless users make regular and frequent transactions with their Venmo Credit Card, these cash back-enabled crypto purchases will likely be fairly small.</p>
<p>The company has yet to offer details on how many Venmo credit cardholders are active in the market. So far, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has only said, during Q1 earnings, that the card &#8220;is outpacing our expectations for both new accounts and transactions.&#8221; This past quarter, the exec noted that the company was also seeing &#8220;strong adoption and trading of crypto on Venmo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The introduction of the Cash Back to Crypto feature for the Venmo Credit Card offers customers a new way to start exploring the world of crypto, using their cash back earned each month to automatically and seamlessly purchase one of four cryptocurrencies on Venmo,&#8221; noted Darrell Esch, SVP and GM at Venmo, in a statement. &#8220;We’re excited to bring this new level of feature interconnectivity on the Venmo platform, linking our Venmo Credit Card and crypto experiences to provide another way for our customers to spend and manage their money with Venmo,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The new option will begin rolling out starting today to Venmo Credit Cardholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://surfside.io/">Surfside</a>, a data and marketing platform aimed directly at the Cannabis industry, has today announced the close of a $4 million seed round led by Casa Verde. The firm&#8217;s managing partner, Karan Wadhera, will join the Surfside board.</p>
<p>The startup is relatively new, but helmed by two founders experienced in the marketing and data space. Jon Lowen and Michael Blanche both hail from SITO Mobile, where they worked on location-based advertising and marketing via mobile devices.</p>
<p>The duo has built a platform that uses many of the same principles to bring better marketing acumen and strategies to bbusinesses in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>One of the major marketing challenges for dispensaries and cannabis brands is that the usual channels through which small brands advertise &mdash; Facebook and Google &mdash; are not available to them. Not only are those powerful marketing channels, but they also provide valuable analytics about potential and existing customers.</p>
<p>Surfside looks to fill that gap in the cannabis space, offering businesses data around their customers using a combination of existing data, publicly available data, loyalty program data, etc. to help these brands better understand their customers.</p>
<p>The startup creates profiles of customers, looking to understand their location, their other interests, and other important details that can help brands and businesses market and advertise to both existing and new customers.</p>
<p>But Surfside actually goes a step further and develops campaigns for these businesses, allowing them to work one-on-one with a marketing expert to develop and activate these campaigns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Originally, Surfside generated revenue via the campaign itself, taking a cut of the spend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re almost an extension of the marketing departments at a dispensary,&#8221; said Lowen. &#8220;Small dispensaries don&#8217;t necessarily have the bandwidth to run these campaigns or log into extra software. Our team can help plan, execute and get the most value out of the data for them. Now, we want to start empowering brands, retailers, dispensaries as they progress to be able to have ownership of the data, with these consumer insights and research at their fingertips, and give them the ability to decide if they want to activate on their own or continue using the experts we have here.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new financing, the company is adding another revenue stream through its data platform, allowing cannabis businesses to purchase a SaaS license. This way, businesses who&#8217;d like to use the data but develop their own campaigns and marketing strategies have the option to do so.</p>
<p>Surfside believes that their technology can expand well beyond cannabis and into other verticals, but see an opportunity in the cannabis space to grow and build alongside the burgeoning industry.</p>
<p>Moreover, the complicated regulatory landscape in the cannabis space allows Surfside to become a compliance monitor, as well, which may end up being yet another revenue stream for the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the use of AI has grown and developed over the last several years, companies like <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> have tried to tap into it to improve their software and help customers operate faster and more efficiently. Kathy Baxter, principal architect for the ethical AI practice at Salesforce will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=kathybaxterpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=kathybaxterpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS</a> on October 27th to talk about the impact of AI on SaaS.</p>
<p>Baxter, who has more than 20 years of experience as a software architect, joined Salesforce in 2017 after more than a decade at Google in a similar role. We&#8217;re going to tap into her expertise on a panel discussing AI&#8217;s growing role in software.</p>
<p>Salesforce was one of the earlier SaaS adherents to AI, announcing its artificial intelligence tooling, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/18/salesforce-turns-its-attention-to-artificial-intelligence-with-salesforce-einstein/">the company dubbed Einstein</a>, in 2016. While the positioning makes it sound like a product, it&#8217;s actually much more than a single entity. It&#8217;s a platform component, which the various pieces of the Salesforce platform can tap into to take advantage of various types of AI to help improve the user experience.</p>
<p>That could involve feeding information to customer service reps on Service Cloud to make the call move along more efficiently, helping salespeople find the customers most likely to close a deal soon in the Sales Cloud or helping marketing understand the optimal time to send an email in the Marketing Cloud.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IFp4AkiCfW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/18/salesforce-turns-its-attention-to-artificial-intelligence-with-salesforce-einstein/">Salesforce Einstein delivers artificial intelligence across the Salesforce platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce Einstein delivers artificial intelligence across the Salesforce platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/18/salesforce-turns-its-attention-to-artificial-intelligence-with-salesforce-einstein/embed/#?secret=IFp4AkiCfW" data-secret="IFp4AkiCfW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company began building out its AI tooling early on with the help of 175 data scientists and has been expanding on that initial idea since. Other companies, both startups and established companies like SAP, Oracle and Microsoft have continued to build AI into their platforms as Salesforce has. Today, many SaaS companies have some underlying AI built into their service.</p>
<p>Baxter will join us to discuss the role of AI in software today and how that helps improve the operations of the service itself, and what the implications are of using AI in your software service as it becomes a mainstream part of the SaaS development process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Baxter, the conference will also include Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi, UiPath’s Daniel Dines, Puppet’s Abby Kearns, and investors Casey Aylward and Sarah Guo, among others. We hope you&#8217;ll join us. It&#8217;s going to be a stimulating day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">African e-commerce giant Jumia today reported its <a href="https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/JMIA-Q2.21-ER-10.08.21.pdf">second-quarter financial performance</a>. In the wake of its earnings reports, Jumia&#8217;s shares climbed 3.38% to $21.99 per share with a market cap of $2.168 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get into the company&#8217;s results, Jumia historically reported in its financial data in Euros</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was the case until April 1, when the company swapped for the American dollar.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia cites increases in cash balances from equity fundraising as the main reason backing this outcome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company adds that although the Dollar will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going forward, starting from Q2 2021, comparative numbers from previous quarters &#8220;have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been modified</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect the change in presentation currency.&#8221; That will help us keep all the math straight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, back to business. In the second quarter of 2021, Jumia reported revenues of $40.2 million, up 4.6% on a year-over-year basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/jmia?mod=mw_quote_tab">was optimistic</a> that Jumia would report revenue of $43.34 million, up from the $38.5 million recorded in Q2 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the company did not meet revenue expectations, it did surpass investor expectations of a loss worth $0.43 a share by reporting a more modest $0.41 per-share loss in the second quarter. For reference, Jumia lost $0.61 per share in the year-ago period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the African e-commerce company has shifted from first-party sales to a marketplace for third parties, its first-party revenue increased 7% year-over-year in the second quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia&#8217;s marketplace revenue, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grew a smaller 0.6% to $26.2 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revenue mix-shift helped Jumia&#8217;s gross profit grow 4% to $26.8 million in the most recent quarter compared to its year-ago comparable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross profit after fulfillment expense also expanded 16.3% to $7.7 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Continued losses</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jumia&#8217;s operating losses and adjusted EBITDA declined in Q1 2021, they increased this past quarter</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Operating losses were $51.6 million in Q2 2021, up 24.7%, while adjusted EBITDA came in at -$41.6 million, worsening 15.1% compared to Q2 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharp losses were driven in part by how the African e-commerce juggernaut spent in the quarter. Jumia&#8217;s sales and advertising expenses rose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 115% to $17.1 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the year-ago quarter, the number was a far-smaller $7.9 million. The huge gain in sales and advertising spending may indicate that the company is back to its old method of executing aggressive advertising, which initially slowed during the pandemic. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s rising costs and declining profitability are not encouraging regarding its chances for near-term profitability. However, the company stressed long-term investments in its business in its earnings report that Jumia expects to leverage in the coming quarters and years. Given that Jumia&#8217;s shares rose following its earnings report, it appears that investors are at least amenable to the argument. Still, the company&#8217;s metrics paint a mixed picture of its efforts.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Jumia&#8217;s active customers only grew by 3.3% to 7 million in the second quarter, while orders grew by a stronger 12.8% to 7.6 million. In contrast, gross merchandise volume (GMV) fell 11% to $223.5 million in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumia&#8217;s falling GMV impacted the total payment volume (TPV) of its payment arm, JumiaPay, in the quarter. That figure fell 4% to $56.6 million, compared to the year-ago quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, on other fronts, JumiaPay&#8217;s recent results are impressive. The payment service&#8217;s &#8220;on-platform penetration&#8221; as a portion of GMV grew to 23.5% in the second quarter. And transactions made on the platform grew 12.1% to 2.7 million &#8212; the fastest transaction growth rate Jumia has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past four quarters, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supported by the company&#8217;s food delivery category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the space of five months, from October 2020 to February 2021, Jumia&#8217;s share price spiked over 700% to $65, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the pandemic increasing appetite for e-commerce stocks globally. But the company&#8217;s share price has dropped </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by more than 60% from those highs to a close at $21.27 last Friday.</span></p>
<p>Jumia closed its most recent quarter with $637.7 million in cash, which means that it has a good amount of runway ahead of itself to sort out growth and profitability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In celebration of Coinbase&#8217;s earnings report today, investors poured a mountain of cash into one of the company&#8217;s global competitors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kidding, of course, but today really is <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2021/Coinbase-Announces-Date-of-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">Coinbase&#8217;s earnings day</a>, and private investors really did just push $210 million into another exchange.</p>
<p>The company, FalconX, is now worth $3.75 billion. As <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/crypto-platform-falconx-quintuples-valuation-to-3-75-billion">Bloomberg notes</a>, that&#8217;s a 5x valuation jump in less than half a year. FalconX raised a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-falconx/cryptocurrency-platform-falconx-secures-50-million-investment-idUSKBN2B32VD">smaller $50 million round in March</a>, notably in part from Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>The FalconX news should not surprise. Indian crypto exchange <a href="https://thetechportal.com/2021/08/10/crypto-exchange-platform-coindcx-raises-90mn-led-by-b-capital-turns-unicorn/">CoinDCX just raised $90 million</a>, reaching a $1 billion valuation in the process. This past weekend, Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/indonesias-pintu-exchange-raises-%2435m-in-extended-series-a-led-by-lightspeed-venture-2021">Pintu raised $35 million</a>. And earlier this year, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ftx-valued-at-18b-in-massive-900m-series-b">FTX raised $900 million</a> at an $18 billion valuation. There <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentinian-crypto-exchange-lemon-raises-030000578.html#:~:text=Lemon%2C%20an%20Argentina-based%20crypto%20exchange%2C%20raised%20%2416.3%20million,Peru%20and%20Uruguay%2C%20CEO%20Marcelo%20Cavazzoli%20told%20CoinDesk.">are other examples</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of capital in a global race to fund the next Coinbase, I reckon.</p>
<p>And you can&#8217;t fault investors in their hunt. After all, Coinbase has proven to be an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">incredibly powerful business</a> when crypto interest is high; trading revenues at the U.S. crypto exchange rose to $1.80 billion in the first quarter of 2021, per its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978821000010/coin-20210331.htm">most recent 10-Q filing</a>. Coinbase managed to juice its revenue haul for $771.5 million in net income. In per-share terms, Coinbase earned $3.05 per diluted piece of equity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It was an impressive result. Today, investors are expecting Coinbase to report $1.77 billion to $1.83 billion in revenue, depending on which analyst summary you prefer, and earnings per share of around $2.57. You can somewhat easily puzzle out what sort of net income that EPS figure represents, given the company&#8217;s Q1 results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d normally argue that Coinbase&#8217;s results today would help set the tone for venture investment in the private sector and valuations for other crypto exchanges. But given the sheer amount of money that has recently flowed into a coterie of startups around the globe hoping to build the Coinbase of their market, the concept seems somewhat moot.</p>
<p>Instead, Coinbase&#8217;s earnings and comments about the market will simply help us understand the playground in which <em>other</em> crypto exchanges are currently playing, admittedly from a decidedly U.S.-centric perspective. Coinbase&#8217;s last quarter saw it generate some 81% of its revenues from its domestic market, as a data point.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s no fun to be had. We can do some math regarding trading volumes and valuations. Since we have Coinbase&#8217;s trading volume data, we can parse other exchanges for their own shared data and see which seem expensive &#8212; or cheap. So, let&#8217;s do just that. Into the numbers!</p>
<h2>Trading volume as revenue proxy</h2>
<p>Per its 10-Q filing concerning the quarter ended March 31, 2021, Coinbase reported that it saw trading volume of $334.74 billion, up 1,022% from its Q1 2020 number of $29.83 billion. The company also reported that its transaction &#8212; trading &#8212; revenues for the period were $1.54 billion. So, Coinbase generated around $0.0046 per dollar of traded crypto on its platform in the period.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but we&#8217;re wandering into the realm of speculative math, which means that everything we&#8217;re doing today is directional rather than absolute. Our goal of seeing how other exchanges are valued based on their trading volumes will be useful, but not definitive. We&#8217;ll have to wait for more S-1s and similar filings to get to full confidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ownbackup.com">OwnBackup</a>, the late stage startup that helps companies in the Salesforce ecosystem back up their data, announced a $240 million Series E today at a $3.35 billion valuation. The latter is up from $1.4 billion in January when the company announced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005466/en/OwnBackup-Raises-167.5-Million-Investment-from-Insight-Partners-Salesforce-Ventures-and-Sapphire-Ventures">a $167.5 million Series D.</a></p>
<p>Alkeon Capital and B Capital Group co-led today&#8217;s investment, which also included BlackRock Private Equity Partners and Tiger Global along with existing investors Insight Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Sapphire Ventures and Vertex Ventures. The company has now raised close to $500 million, over $455 million coming since last July.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of capital, but OwnBackup CEO Sam Gutmann says that as the Salesforce ecosystem has grown, which includes not only Salesforce itself, but companies like Veeva and nCino, business has been booming, growing 100% year-over-year since 2018. That kind of growth gets investor attention and Gutmann reported a lot of inbound investor interest in this round.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the company announced that it will now support the same type of backup for Microsoft Dynamics 365 customers, thereby greatly expanding its potential market. &#8220;We&#8217;re also announcing that we are expanding into the Microsoft ecosystem specifically around Microsoft Dynamics 365&#8217;s huge ecosystem. I think it&#8217;s the second largest B2B SaaS ecosystem beyond Salesforce. We&#8217;re just getting started there, but super excited about the opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company also sees the opportunity to grow the business through acquisition. Over the last year, it bought two small companies, but he says that was more focussed on acquiring specific talent to develop the platform, while future acquisitions could be more focussed on expanding the business itself. He certainl</p>
<p>As the company takes on this kind of investment, Gutmann sees an IPO possibility at some point in the future, but for now he&#8217;s concentrating on growth. &#8220;We&#8217;re not focused on exiting. We&#8217;ve really focused on developing what is already a huge market and growing into an even bigger market, continuing to expand with a business that has great unit economics and continues to grow nicely,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company has ballooned to 500 employees this year with plans to double that number in the next year. As he does that, Gutmann says that hiring in general is challenging, but he is always looking to find ways to diversify his workforce. &#8220;It&#8217;s really, really hard. Our hiring managers definitely focus on [diversity], but at the end of the day, we want the best employees for the job. I think we&#8217;ve made a lot of strides. We&#8217;re working with one of our largest investors Insight, who is co-sponsoring a program to train, more on the junior side, some underrepresented minorities in technical fields and bring them on as full time employees after that program,&#8221; Gutmann said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gutmann says his offices have remained open throughout the pandemic, but nobody was required to come in. In fact, he says that his company is one of the few that has actually added office space to make it easier to distance. The company, which is located in New Jersey, has also expanded space outdoors for working outside when the weather permits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scotts Miracle-Gro knows how to make plants grow, and now the company is looking to cannabis companies to grow its balance sheet. The company today announced an investment entity specifically for cannabis.</p>
<p>Called The Hawthorne Collective, the entity is said to be pursuing minority investments in companies not currently being pursued by ScottsMiracle-Gro’s cannabis subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, which owns and operates dozens of cannabis-focused gardening brands.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Collective’s first investment comes in a $150 million convertible loan to Toronto-based RIV Capital, a cannabis investment and acquisition firm. <a href="https://scottsmiraclegro.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/scottsmiracle-gro-announces-creation-new-investment-entity">According to the company’s press release,</a> the note accrues interest at 2.03%, and upon close, RIV Capital will become The Collective’s preferred vehicle for future investments.</p>
<p>The addition of this investment vehicle gives Scotts Miracle-Gro a new entry into the expanding world of cannabis. Its operating subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, already houses some of cannabis’ most potent gardening brands.</p>
<p>“Indeed, the growth of The Hawthorne Gardening Company over the past six years has generated significant shareholder value,” said Jim Hagedorn, Scotts Miracle-Gro Chairman and CEO, in a released statement. “It also has allowed us to develop a rare level of expertise and insight regarding the cannabis space without being involved in the plant-touching aspects of the industry. That is why we are beginning to invest in other areas of the industry through The Collective while continuing to pursue near-in strategic acquisitions to fold into the existing Hawthorne Gardening business.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Merchants use Upscribe’s technology to drive subscriber growth, reduce churn and enable personalized subscription experiences, like skipping shipments and swapping out products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.upscribe.io">Upscribe</a> founder and CEO Dileepan Siva watched the retail industry make a massive shift to subscription e-commerce for physical products over the past decade, and decided to get in it himself in 2019.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company, developing subscription software for direct-to-consumer e-commerce merchants, is Siva’s fourth startup experience and first time as founder. He closed a $4 million seed round to go after two macro trends he is seeing: buying physical products, like consumer-packaged goods, on a recurring basis, and new industries offering subscriptions, like car and fashion companies.</p>
<p>Merchants use Upscribe’s technology to drive subscriber growth, reduce churn and enable their customers to personalize a subscription experience, like skipping shipments, swapping out products and changing the order frequency. Brands can also feature products for upsell purposes throughout the subscriber lifecycle, from checkout to post-purchase.</p>
<p>Upscribe also offers APIs for merchants to integrate tools like Klaviyo, Segment and Shopify — a new subscription offering for checkouts.</p>
<p>Uncork Capital led the seed round and was joined by Leaders Fund, The House Fund, Roach Capitals’ Fahd Ananta and Shippo CEO Laura Behrens Wu.</p>
<p>“As the market for D2C subscriptions booms, there is a need for subscription-first brands to grow and scale their businesses,” said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of Uncork Capital, in a written statement. “We have spent a long time in the e-commerce space, working with D2C brands and companies who are solving common industry pain points, and Upscribe’s merchant-centric approach raised the bar for subscription services, addressing the friction in customer experiences and enabling merchants to engage subscribers and scale recurring revenue growth.”</p>
<p>Siva bootstrapped the company, but decided to go after venture capital dollars when Upscribe wanted to create a more merchant-centric approach, which required scaling with a bigger team. The “real gems are in the data layer and how to make the experience exceptional,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is growing 43% quarter over quarter and is close to profitable, with much of its business stemming from referrals, Siva said. It is already working with customers like Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and True Botanicals and across multiple verticals, including food and beverage, health and wellness, beauty and cosmetics and home care.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to “capture the next wave of brands that are going to grow,” he added. Siva cites the growth will come as the DTC subscription market is forecasted to reach $478 billion by 2025, and 75% of those brands are expected to offer subscriptions in the next two years. As such, the majority of the funding will be used to bring on more employees, especially in the product, customer success and go-to-market functions.</p>
<p>Though there is competition in the space, many of those are focused on processing transactions, while Siva said Upscribe’s approach is customer relationships. The cost of acquiring new customers is going up, and subscription services will be the key to converting one-time buyers into loyal customers.</p>
<p>“It is really about customer relationships and the ongoing engagement between merchants and subscribers,” he added. “We are in a different world now. The first wave could play the Facebook game, advertising on social media with super low acquisition and scale. That is no longer the case anymore.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weeks after Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">rolled out</a> increased protections for minors using its app, Google is now doing the same for its suite of services, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/families/giving-kids-and-teens-safer-experience-online/">including</a> Google search, <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-safety-and-digital-wellbeing-options-younger-people-youtube-and-youtube-kids/">YouTube</a>, YouTube Kids, Google Assistant, and others. The company this morning announced a series of product and policy changes that will allow younger people to stay more private and protected online and others that will limit ad targeting.</p>
<p>The changes in Google&#8217;s case are even more expansive than those Instagram announced, as they span across an array of Google&#8217;s products, instead of being limited to a single app.</p>
<p>Though Congress <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-google-and-twitter-grilled-by-congress-what-you-need-to-know/">has been pressing</a> Google and other tech companies on the negative impacts their services may have on children, not all changes being made are being required by law, Google says.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some of these updates directly address upcoming regulations, we’ve gone beyond what’s required by law to protect teens on Google and YouTube,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Many of these changes also extend beyond any single current or upcoming regulation. We’re looking at ways to develop consistent product experiences and user controls for kids and teens globally,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In other words, Google is building in some changes based on where it believes the industry is going, rather than where it is right now.</p>
<p>On YouTube, Google says it will &#8220;gradually&#8221; start adjusting the default upload setting to the most private option for users ages 13 to 17, which will limit the visibility of videos only to the the users and those they directly share with, not the wider public. These younger teen users won&#8217;t be prevented from changing the setting back to &#8220;public,&#8221; necessarily, but they will now have to make an explicit and intentional choice when doing so. YouTube will then provide reminders indicating who can see their video, the company notes. YouTube told us the changes will only apply to new uploads &#8212; it will not retroactively set any existing videos to private.</p>
<p>YouTube will also turn on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/">its &#8220;take a break&#8221; and bedtime reminders</a> by default for all users ages 13 to 17 and will turn off autoplay. Again, these changes are related to the default settings  &#8212; users can disable the digital well-being features if they choose.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ec10qfiHX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/">YouTube rolls out new tools to help you stop watching</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube rolls out new tools to help you stop watching&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/youtube-rolls-out-new-tools-to-help-you-stop-watching/embed/#?secret=4ec10qfiHX" data-secret="4ec10qfiHX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On YouTube&#8217;s platform for younger children, YouTube Kids, the company will also add an autoplay option, which is turned off autoplay by default so parents will have to decide whether or not they want to use autoplay with their children. The change puts the choice directly in parents&#8217; hands, after <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22412232/youtube-kids-autoplay">complaints from child safety advocates and some members of Congress</a> suggested such an algorithmic feature was problematic. Later, parents will also be able to &#8220;lock&#8221; their default selection.</p>
<p>YouTube will also remove &#8220;overly commercial content&#8221; from YouTube Kid, in a move that also follows <a href="https://www.democraticmedia.org/article/ftc-complaints-filed-campaign-commercial-free-childhood-and-center-digital-democracy-lead">increased pressure</a> from consumer advocacy groups and childhood experts, who have long since argued that YouTube encourages kids to spend money (or rather, beg their parents to do so.)</p>
<p>How YouTube will draw the line between acceptable and &#8220;overly commercial&#8221; content <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10938174">is less clear</a>, but the company says it will, for example, remove videos that focus on product packaging &#8212; like the popular &#8220;unboxing&#8221; videos. This could impact some of YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/22/18275767/toy-unboxing-videos-youtube-advertising-ethics">larger creators</a> of videos for kids, like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/949926198/9-year-old-boy-is-named-highest-earning-youtube-star-of-2020">multi-millionaire</a> Ryan&#8217;s Toy Review. In addition to product packaging, it also says it will look to remove any content that &#8220;incites viewers to buy a product&#8221; and &#8220;content focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsewhere on Google, other changes impacting minors will also begin rolling out.</p>
<p>In the weeks ahead, Google will introduce a new policy that will allow anyone under the age of 18, or a parent or guardian, to request the removal of their images from Google Image search results. This expands upon the existing &#8220;right to be forgotten&#8221; <a href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7347822?hl=en">privacy policies already live in the E.U.</a>, but will introduce new products and controls for both kids and teenagers globally.</p>
<p>The company will make a number of adjustments to user accounts for people under the age of 18, as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes to YouTube, Google will restrict access to adult content by enabling its <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/510?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">SafeSearch</a> filtering technology by default to all users under 13 managed by its <a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/">Google Family Link</a> service. It will also enable SafeSearch for all users under 18 and make this the new default for teens who set up new accounts. Google Assistant will enable SafeSearch protections by default on shared devices, like smart screens and their web browsers. In school settings where Google Workspace for Education is used, SafeSearch will be the default and switching to Guest Mode and Incognito Mode web browsing will be turned off by default, too,<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/safer-learning-with-google-for-education/"> as was recently announced</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, location history is already off by default on all Google accounts, but children with supervised accounts now won&#8217;t be able to enable it. This change will be extended to all users under 18 globally, meaning location can&#8217;t be enabled at all under the children are legal adults.</p>
<p>On Google Play, the company will launch a new <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/new-google-play-safety-section.html">section</a> that will inform parents about which apps follow its <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/families/">Families policies</a>, and app developers will have to disclose how their apps collect and use data. These features &#8212; which were partially inspired by Apple&#8217;s App Store Privacy Labels &#8212; <a href="https://support.google.com/transparencyreport/answer/7347822?hl=en">had already been detailed for Android developers </a>before today.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s parental control tools are also being expanded. Parents and guardians who are Family Link users will gain new abilities to filter and block news, podcasts, and access to webpages on Assistant-enabled smart devices.</p>
<p>For advertisers, there are significant changes in store, too.</p>
<p>Google says it will expand safeguards to prevent age-sensitive ad categories from being shown to teens and it will block ad targeting based on factors like age, gender, or interests for users under 18. While somewhat similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">to the advertising changes Instagram introduced</a>, as ads will no longer leverage &#8220;interests&#8221; data for targeting young teens and kids, Instagram was still allowing targeting by age and gender. Google will not. The advertising changes will roll out globally in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>All the changes across Google and YouTube will roll out globally in the coming weeks and months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every woman will go through menopause some time during her life, but like many other femtech topics, this one is still not talked about as much as it should be.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com/">Elektra Health</a>, a women’s health technology company startup that raised $3.75 million in seed funding to continue developing its platform that provides evidence-based care, education and a community for women going through the various stages of menopause.</p>
<p>Co-founders Alessandra Henderson and Jannine Versi told TechCrunch that more than 50 million women in the United States are currently in some stage of menopause, while the industry itself represents a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/menopause-startups-vc-funding/">$600 billion global market opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>CEO Henderson, whose background includes business creation platform Human Ventures, called menopause a “cultural zeitgeist” that is coming into its own in terms of the conversation and having investors believe in Elektra’s mission. The company is also personal for Henderson — she went on a hormonal health journey that began four years ago after experiencing symptoms that went unexplained by specialists.</p>
<p>Several years later, she wanted to start a company in femtech. There was so much already in the reproductive space, yet no one was talking about what comes next or the phases for moving through menopause, Henderson said. It was when she was introduced to her co-founder Versi, whose background is in digital health, that the idea for Elektra came together.</p>
<p>Menopause is a hormonal health transition that typically starts in women when they reach their 40s or 50s. There have been up to 34 identified symptoms of menopause, and research has found that 80% of women say <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576769/">menopause symptoms have negatively impacted their quality of life</a> in some way. At the same time, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2018/menopause-symptoms-doctors-relief-treatment.html#:~:text=Most%20medical%20schools%20and%20residency,Mostly%2C%20the%20courses%20are%20elective.">less than 20% of obstetrics/gynecology residency programs educate doctors about menopause</a>.</p>
<p>Elektra’s platform is picking up that slack by offering clinical care via telemedicine and its proprietary <a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com/services/">“Meno-morphosis” program</a> that features evidence-based guidance on symptoms, a community of support and access to a 1:1 dedicated menopause expert. The program will open completely to the public in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are all about caring for women by providing content, education, care, coaching and counseling, especially working in the arc of their journey,” Versi said. “This is such an intimate topic, but we have referral rates of 40% where women are talking about it themselves and then bring a friend along. Sustaining that is important to us. We are seeing clusters of friends come along and really bond with the community.”</p>
<p>The New York-based company’s seed funding was co-led by Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Flare Capital Partners, with participation from City Light Capital, January Ventures, Human Ventures, The Fund, Community Fund and a group of angel investors, including Hannah and Guy Raz, Claire Diaz-Ortiz and Jenny Fielding.</p>
<p>This new round of funding will be used to grow its team and to expand its integrative, evidence-based solution to millions of women in the U.S., and beyond.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/embed/#?secret=iJaImDlIbF" data-secret="iJaImDlIbF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since founding the company in 2019, more than 1,800 women have participated in Elektra’s private beta educational programming.</p>
<p>“Last year was about learning and growing the things that women want,” Henderson said. “We are making an impact in the way women deserve.”</p>
<p>Much of women’s health technology is aimed at fertility, but Elektra Health is not alone in tackling this issue: new startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/2182193/">Peppy recently reported funding</a> to address menopause in employee health; meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/personalized-menopause-platform-vira-health-raises-1-5m-from-localglobe-mmc-ventures/">Vira Health raised £1.5 million</a> in seed funding for a U.K. platform.</p>
<p>Katelin Holloway, founding partner at Seven Seven Six, said in her previous roles leading compensation and benefits for companies, she became increasingly aware that the need for menopause care was just as desired by employees as fertility benefits.</p>
<p>When her employees began requesting desk fans, she started investigating the source of the requests and found it was from the company’s non-Gen Z employees, and all women.</p>
<p>“I realized I had a decent cohort of women experiencing menopause,” Holloway said. “The fan on the desk was kind of a ‘bat signal’ to other employees, unlocking conversations between them where they had previously been experiencing these symptoms in silos.”</p>
<p>Once she became an investor, she put out the call again looking for a company providing that kind of care and was introduced to Elektra. Holloway said there is a whole new group of women entering their 40s who want to talk about menopause and have the technology available, while also wanting privacy for care and a community to share in the experience.</p>
<p>She called Elektra’s co-founders “incredible women who care deeply about this space and have amazing credentials and background to bring to this company.” She also said she was sold on their approach of care, community and content, which aligns with what was working in the pregnancy and fertility spaces.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The co-founders reached out to local home chefs and gathered them together in a marketplace where they could share their culture and passion of food with others.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Home-cooked food delivery service <a href="https://www.eatwoodspoon.com">WoodSpoon</a> is planning an expansion after raising $14 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Restaurant Brands International led the round along with World Trade Ventures and a group of individual investors, including Victor Lazarte.</p>
<p>New York-based WoodSpoon was started in 2019 by Oren Saar and Merav Kalish Rozengarten, two Israelis in America that longed for the food they grew up with. They began reaching out to local home chefs in the area and gathered them together in a marketplace where they could share their culture and passion of food with others.</p>
<p>Two years later, the company boasts over 16,000 active customers in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and 50% month over month growth. Customers can order dishes that run the gambit of world cuisine through WoodSpoon’s website or app and receive on-demand delivery to their doorstep or schedule service. Saar told TechCrunch that 35% of WoodSpoon’s customers have ordered four times in 17 days after their first order.</p>
<p>The new funding gives the company a total of $16 million — it raised $2 million at the end of 2020. Saar said the Series A enables the company to accelerate growth through R&amp;D and marketing and to double its team so it can expand into new markets, like major cities across the United States, over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>At the same time as it brings customers culturally diverse food, WoodSpoon helps generate income for its home chefs — a mix of 150 active professional chefs, immigrants and cooks making dishes for the company at least three times a month. WoodSpoon interviews each chef, inspects their kitchens and provides training to keep consistent quality.</p>
<p>“When you scale, you can lose touch with your customers and lose the personal connection with the home chefs,” Saar said. “We feel every home chef is part of our family and want to help them build their brand, so it is important that this food is high quality.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WoodSpoon has about 30 employees and plans to hire more engineers to continue developing its technology. Saar said a new product will be launching at the end of August, while WoodSpoon’s app will get an overhaul to have a new look and feel.</p>
<p>The Series A also enables WoodSpoon to onboard its waitlist of hundreds of home chefs that want to join the marketplace.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-online-food-delivery-services-market-report-2021-market-is-expected-to-reach-192-16-billion-in-2025--from-126-91-billion-in-2021---long-term-forecast-to-2030--301285677.html">global online food delivery services market</a> is forecasted to be $126.91 billion in 2021, and then reach $192.16 billion in 2025, according to consultancy firm Research and Markets.</p>
<p>Chris Brigleb, head of corporate development at Restaurant Brands International, said technology is a big focus for his company, which spent a lot of time looking around for potential investments beyond the traditional quick-serve restaurant space.</p>
<p>He began meeting with tech-enabled businesses and came across WoodSpoon four months ago. The more Brigleb learned about the company, the more he liked it, and even encouraged Saar to speed up WoodSpoon’s growth and fundraising plans, he said.</p>
<p>Though WoodSpoon’s concept is not new, he felt its approach was the complete package of user experience on the customer side, the ease of searching the marketplace by chef or cuisine and support for the chef in terms of providing packaging and logistics management.</p>
<p>“The delivery was a key for us and a differentiator,” Brigleb said. “They take all of the hard parts about delivering for home chefs off of their plate so they can focus on the actual cooking that is special to them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic continues to push forward in its quest to build a 3D map of the world.</p>
<p>This morning the company announced that it has acquired <a href="https://scaniverse.com/">Scaniverse</a>, an iPhone/iPad app for scanning objects and environments in high-resolution 3D.</p>
<p>A rep for Niantic tells me that Scaniverse will remain on the App Store, with plans to continue supporting it as a standalone app. Features previously limited to a $17-per-year &#8220;Pro&#8221; subscription, including higher-resolution processing and support for exporting models to other 3D software, will now be free.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">first wrote about years ago</a>, one of Niantic&#8217;s goals is to build a detailed and endlessly-evolving 3D map of the world — a step they see as fundamental to enabling true, rich augmented reality experiences if/when the world ever embraces something like AR glasses. It&#8217;s a rather massive (and never ending) task, but one made a bit more feasible by way of its ever-roaming player base across games like Pokémon GO, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, and Ingress.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Scaniverse creator Keith Ito will be joining Niantic&#8217;s AR team. The company declined to outline any other terms of the acquisition. This is Niantic&#8217;s latest acquisition in the 3D mapping space, having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/niantic-acquires-ar-startup-6d-ai-as-the-game-creator-squares-up-against-apple-facebook/">acquired 6D.ai for an undisclosed sum in early 2020</a>.</p>
<p>For context, here&#8217;s a demo of the Scaniverse app doing its thing:</p>

The deal, valued at about $532 million and expected to generate proceeds of up to $161.5 million, includes Leafly’s recent capital raise of $31.5 million from investors, including Merida Capital Holdings.te</p>
<p>The company is expected to list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol of LFLY as Merida will adopt the Leafly name. Existing Leafly shareholders will own about 72% of the merged company. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Leafly was founded in 2010 and has grown into a leading marketplace and resource. The company offers a deep library of content for consumers, including detailed information about strains, retailers, and current events. For retailers, Leafly offers a subscription-based platform that 7,800 brands and 4,600 retail subscribers use. <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/leafly-to-go-public-via-combination-with-spac-merida-merger-corp-i-271628512551">According to a report</a>, the company is expected to see revenue hit $43 million in 2021 and $65 million in 2022.</p>
<p>Despite the successes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/leafly-lays-off-91-employees-with-funding-on-pause/">Leafly experienced a turbulent 2020</a> with layoffs and leadership changes. Yoko Miyashita took over as the company’s CEO in August 2020 and has been focused on Leafly, leaning heavily into building a better online shopping experience. In February 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/leafly-and-jane-partner-to-build-a-better-online-cannabis-shopping-experience/">the company partnered with Jane</a> to improve Leafly’s e-commerce tools.</p>
<p>By going public through a SPAC, Leafly is signaling it&#8217;s entering a growth phase just in time for the US Government to loosen cannabis restrictions.</p>
