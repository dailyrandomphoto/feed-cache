										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been fined again by Italy&#8217;s competition authority &#8212; this time the penalty is €7 million (~$8.4M) &#8212; for failing to comply with an earlier order related to how it informs users about the commercial uses it makes of their data.</p>
<p>The AGCM began investigating certain commercial practices by Facebook back in <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/detail?id=a275df5f-079b-4772-9870-3148c9ca558c">2018</a>, including the information it provided to users at sign up and the lack of an opt out for advertising. Later the same year it went on to <a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2018/12/Facebook-fined-10-million-Euros-by-the-ICA-for-unfair-commercial-practices-for-using-its-subscribers’-data-for-commercial-purposes">fine Facebook €10M</a> for two violations of the country&#8217;s Consumer Code.</p>
<p>But the watchdog&#8217;s action did not stop there. It went on to launch further proceedings against Facebook in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe/">2020</a> &#8212; saying the tech giant was still failing to inform users “with clarity and immediacy” about how it monetizes their data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Facebook Inc. have not complied with the warning to remove the incorrect practice on the use of user data and have not published the corrective declaration requested by the Authority,&#8221; the AGCM writes in a <a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/2/IP330-">press release</a> today (issued in Italian; which we&#8217;ve translated with Google Translate).</p>
<p>The authority said Facebook is still misleading users who register on its platform by not informing them &#8212; &#8220;immediately and adequately&#8221; &#8212; at the point of sign up that it will collect and monetize their personal data. Instead it found Facebook emphasizes its service&#8217;s &#8216;gratuitousness&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The information provided by Facebook was generic and incomplete and did not provide an adequate distinction between the use of data necessary for the personalization of the service (with the aim of facilitating socialization with other users) and the use of data to carry out targeted advertising campaigns,&#8221; the AGCM goes on.</p>
<p>It had already fined Facebook €5M over the same issue of failing to provide adequate information about its use of people&#8217;s data. But it also ordered it to correct the practice &#8212; and publish an &#8220;amendment&#8221; notice on its website and apps for users in Italy. Neither of which Facebook has done, per the regulator.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, has been fighting the AGCM&#8217;s order via the Italian legal system &#8212; making a petition to the Council of State.</p>
<p>A hearing of Facebook&#8217;s appeal against the non-compliance proceedings took place in September last year and a decision is still pending.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on AGCM&#8217;s action, a Facebook spokesperson told us: <span lang="EN-IE">“We note the Italian Competition Authority’s announcement today, but we await the Council of State decision on our appeal against the Authority’s initial findings.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;Facebook takes privacy extremely seriously and we</span><span lang="EN-IE"> have already made changes, including to our Terms of Service, to further clarify how Facebook uses data to provide its service and to provide tailored advertising</span><span lang="EN-IE">,&#8221; it added.</span></p>
<p>Last year, at the time the AGCM instigated further proceedings against it, Facebook told us it had amended the language of its terms of service back in 2019 &#8212; to &#8220;further clarify&#8221; how it makes money, as it put it.</p>
<p>However while the tech giant appears to have removed a direct &#8220;<em>claim</em> of gratuity&#8221; it had previously been presenting users at the point of registration, the Italian watchdog is still not happy with how far it&#8217;s gone in its presentation to new users &#8212; saying it&#8217;s still not being &#8220;immediate and clear&#8221; enough in how it provides information on the collection and use of their data for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The authority points out that this is key information for people to weigh up in deciding whether or not to join Facebook &#8212; given the economic value Facebook gains via the transfer of their personal data.</p>
<p>For its part, Facebook argues that it&#8217;s fair to describe a service as &#8216;free&#8217; if there&#8217;s no monetary charge for use. Although it has also made changes to how it describes this value exchange to users &#8212; including dropping its former slogan that “Facebook is free and always will be” in favor of some fuzzier phrasing.</p>
<p>On the arguably more salient legal point that Facebook is also appealing &#8212; related to the lack of a direct opt out for Facebook users to prevent their data being used for targeted ads &#8212; Facebook denies there&#8217;s any lack of consent to see here, claiming it does not give any user information to third parties u<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">nless the person has chosen to share their information and give consent.</span></p>
<p>Rather it says this consent process happens off its own site, on a case by case basis, i.e. when people decide whether or not to install third party apps or use Facebook Login to log into a third-party websites etc &#8212; and where, it argues, they will be asked by those third parties whether they want Facebook to share their data.</p>
<p>(Facebook&#8217;s lead data supervisor in Europe, Ireland&#8217;s DPC, has an open investigation into Facebook on exactly this issue of so-called &#8216;forced consent&#8217; &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">complaints filed</a> the moment Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation begun being applied in May 2018.)</p>
<p>The tech giant also flags on-site tools and settings it does offer its own users &#8212; such as &#8216;Why Am I Seeing This Ad&#8217;, &#8216;Ads Preferences&#8217; and &#8216;Manage Activity&#8217; &#8212; which it claims increase transparency and control for Facebook users.</p>
<p>It also points to the &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/facebooks-latest-transparency-tool-doesnt-offer-much-so-we-went-digging/">Off Facebook Activity</a>&#8216; setting it launched last year &#8212; which shows users some information about which third party services are sending their data to Facebook and lets them disconnect that information from their account. Though there&#8217;s no way for users to request the third party delete their data <em>via</em> Facebook. (That requires going to each third party service individually to make a request.)</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/24/facebooks-dodgy-defaults-face-more-scrutiny-in-europe/">Last year</a> a German court ruled against a consumer rights challenge to Facebook&#8217;s use of the self-promotional slogan that its service is “free and always will be” — on the grounds that the company does not require users to literally hand over monetary payments in exchange for using the service. Although the court found against Facebook on a number of other issues bundled into the challenge related to how it handles user data.</p>
<p>In another interesting development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">last year</a>, Germany&#8217;s federal court also unblocked a separate legal challenge to Facebook&#8217;s use of user data which has been brought by the country&#8217;s competition watchdog. If that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/09/is-europe-closing-in-on-an-antitrust-fix-for-surveillance-technologists/">landmark challenge</a> prevails Facebook could be forced to stop combining user data across different services and from the social plug-ins and tracking pixels it embeds in third parties&#8217; digital services.</p>
<p>The company is also now facing rising challenges to its unfettered use of people&#8217;s data via the private sector, with Apple set to switch on an opt-in consent mechanism for app tracking on iOS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">this spring</a>. Browser makers have also been long <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">stepping up action</a> against consentless tracking &#8212; including Google, which is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">phasing out support for third party cookies on Chrome</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a low energy solution to home heating and cooling sitting right underneath most houses, but until recently no one has been able to tap it.</p>
<p>That solution is geothermal energy, using the earth&#8217;s own heat to provide temperature controlled comfort to homeowners is the mission that Kathy Hannun set for herself while working at Google X (the skunkworks division within Google) and it&#8217;s been her goal when she spun out her technology as the startup <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com/">Dandelion Energy</a>.</p>
<p>Her company is now helmed by chief executive Michael Sachse, a former entrepreneur in residence at the venture firm NEA and a longtime executive at the energy management company, Opower, so Hannun can focus on pushing the technology she developed forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Helping her advance the geothermal tech is a new $30 million cash infusion from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the fund backed by Bill Gates and a slew of other billionaires to provide financing that can commercialize the new sustainable technologies needed to help the world respond and adapt to global warming.</p>
<p>In Dandelion&#8217;s case that means driving down the cost of installing geothermal systems from over $50,000 to roughly $18,000 to $20,000. The company partnered with Con Edison back in 2019 to offer Westchester homeowners $5,000 off their installations, and that project accounts for some of the 500 homes that are already using Dandelion&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>While the number of installations is small Sachse and Hannun have ambitious goals and some other strategic financial backers that may help them meet their targets.</p>
<p>Chiefly, the U.S. homebuilding giant Lennar is an investor in the company&#8217;s latest round and their presence on the cap table could mean big things if Dandelion can get its systems installed in any planned new construction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to be able to do 10,000 homes per year. When we think about getting to 10,000 homes per year what that requires is for us to expand geographically,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lennar, which depending on how you measure it either the second largest or the largest homebuilder &#8212; they are not just an investor but we are working with them on developing communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For now Dandeliion&#8217;s technology is only used by folks in very specific situations who could loosely be described as upper middle class.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We think of our typical customer as someone who is interested in making a sound economic choice. They&#8217;re in their 40s or 50s, with a college degree and good credit,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Living in a home that is 2000 to 2500 square feet that is by definition a little bit removed from the traditional urban infrastructure. Upper middle class product in the same way that solar has found traction in homes like that.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>Currently, the company focuses on the retrofit market and is confining its operations to the Northeast where there are roughly 5.6 million homes that use fuel oil or propane where installing a Dandelion system can make economic sense given the current costs for the tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The core target customer is someone who is using fuel oil or propane to heat their home. The reason to target them is because we think the payback or them is most attractive,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Typically the customers who are investing in a Dandelion system and paying cash are going to see a five to seven year payback. Customers who are financing are going to see a lower energy bill  from day one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Dandelion&#8217;s innovations touch on three different aspects of making geothermal systems work, the drill, the heat exchanger, and the monitoring and management system for the heating and cooling system once it&#8217;s installed.</p>
<p>First, the company designed a drill that could give installation operations a smaller footprint. Installers need about 7 feet of space to drill down the 300 feet to 500 feet the company needs to access the 55 degree temperatures necessary to create the Dandelion heat loop.</p>
<p>The company then connects that loop to a novel heat exchanger located in a mechanical room of the house. That heat pump is connected to several sensors allowing the company to integrate with things like the Nest Thermostat to enable homeowners to have more control of the temperature n their homes through their smart phones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113978" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113978" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png" alt="" width="1024" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png 2272w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=300,116 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=768,298 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=680,264 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=1536,596 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=2048,795 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dandelion.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113978" class="wp-caption-text">Dandelion Energy heating and cooling system. Image Credit: Dandelion Energy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dandelion’s system also includes a smart remote monitoring system that collects and stores data. The data is then uploaded about every 10 seconds and is monitored by Dandelion engineers, the company said. This means any potential problems will be caught immediately and a repair man can be sent to the homeowner’s house before the customer is even aware there might be an issue. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s executives argue that massive adoption of their home heating and cooling systems represent a vital part of any energy transition away from fossil fuels, chiefly because electric heating systems are inefficient.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we had a grid that was large enough to renewable supply electricity and not worry about the efficiency of the electricity demand we’d be in an amazing spot,&#8221; Sachse said. &#8220;Realistically to electrify the grid we need to triple our capacity while becoming more efficient. I don’t see how we get there without as part of that journey finding more sustainable ways to heat our homes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Geothermal home heating would certainly go a long way toward stabilizing the grid, according to Hannun</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Already air conditioners that are more efficient are putting enormous strain on the grid. Drives fuel use and transition challenges. The benefits of geothermal because of that connection to the ground is really moving out the demand peak,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The technology has a lot of benefits that it confers to the grid and help it operate much better. Which is one reason why we’ve seen utilities in New York embrace this technology and really become its champion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Breakthrough Energy Ventures is wholeheartedly on board with Dandelion&#8217;s solution.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through a combination of technology, data and operations, Dandelion is making geothermal heating and cooling cost-effective for the residential market, and working to solve a critical need for homeowners and our energy ecosystem,&#8221; said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Dandelion&#8217;s geothermal heat pumps provide an efficient electric heating and cooling system that lowers the cost of heating and cooling for homeowners, no matter their region or climate. We&#8217;re looking forward to working with Dandelion as they look to fully displace fossil fuels from the home&#8217;s heating and cooling systems.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/">TigerGraph</a>, a well-funded enterprise startup that provides a graph database and analytics platform, today announced that it has raised a $105 million Series C funding round. The round was led by Tiger Global and brings the company&#8217;s total funding to over $170 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;TigerGraph is leading the paradigm shift in connecting and analyzing data via scalable and native graph technology with pre-connected entities versus the traditional way of joining large tables with rows and columns,&#8221; said TigerGraph found and CEO, Yu Xu. &#8220;This funding will allow us to expand our offering and bring it to many more markets, enabling more customers to realize the benefits of graph analytics and AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current TigerGraph customers include the likes of Amgen, Citrix, Intuit, Jaguar Land Rover and UnitedHealth Group. Using a <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/gsql/">SQL-like query language</a> (GSQL), these customers can use the company&#8217;s services to store and quickly query their graph databases. At the core of its offerings is the TigerGraphDB database and analytics platform, but the company also offers a hosted service, <a href="https://www.tigergraph.com/cloud/">TigerGraph Cloud</a>, with pay-as-you-go pricing, hosted either on AWS or Azure. With GraphStudio, the company also offers a graphical UI for creating data models and visually analyzing them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The promise for the company&#8217;s database services is that they can scale to tens of terabytes of data with billions of edges. Its customers use the technology for a wide variety of use cases, including fraud detection, customer 360, IoT, AI, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Like so many other companies in this space, TigerGraph is facing some tailwind thanks to the fact that many enterprises have accelerated their digital transformation projects during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 12 months with the COVID-19 pandemic, companies have embraced digital transformation at a faster pace driving an urgent need to find new insights about their customers, products, services, and suppliers,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Graph technology connects these domains from the relational databases, offering the opportunity to shrink development cycles for data preparation, improve data quality, identify new insights such as similarity patterns to deliver the next best action recommendation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hardware may <a href="https://pando.com/2013/10/03/hardware-is-the-new-software-nope-says-marc-andreessen-its-called-hardware-for-a-reason-it-is-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indeed be hard</a>, but a startup that&#8217;s built a platform that might help buck that idea by making hardware a little easier to produce has announced some more funding to continue building out its platform.</p>
<p>Fictiv, which positions itself as the &#8220;AWS of hardware&#8221;, providing a platform for those wanting to design and manufacture items, to easily evaluate and order the manufacturing, and subsequent movement of those goods, has raised $35 million.</p>
<p>It will be using the money to continue building out its platform and the supply chain that underpins Fictiv&#8217;s business, which the startup describes as the &#8220;Digital Manufacturing Ecosystem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>David Evans, the CEO and founder, said that the focus of the company has been and will continue to be jobs that are highly specialised, and ultimately not mass-produced items, such as prototypes or objects that are specialised and by their nature not aimed at mass markets, such as particular medical devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on 1,000 to 10,000,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;This is the range where most products still die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round &#8212; a Series D &#8212; is coming from a mix of strategic and financial investors. Led by 40 North Ventures, it also includes Honeywell, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., Adit Ventures, and M20 (Microsoft&#8217;s strategic investment arm), as well as past backers Accel, G2VP, and Bill Gates.</p>
<p>The round brings the total raised by Fictiv to $92 million, and its valuation is not being disclosed</p>
<p>Evans said that the last couple of years since its previous round ($33 million raised in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/fictiv-raises-33m-to-be-the-aws-of-hardware-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2019</a>) have well and truly tested the business concept that he envisioned when first establishing the startup.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, &#8220;we had no idea what the trade wars between the U.S. and China would do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite abruptly, the supply chain got completely &#8220;crunched, with everything shut down&#8221; in China over those disputes, at which point, Fictiv shifted manufacturing to other parts of Asia such as India, and to the U.S. That ended up helping the company when the first wave of Covid-19 hit, initially in China.</p>
<p>Then came the global outbreak, and Fictiv found itself shifting yet again as plants shut down in the countries where it had recently opened. Then, with trade issues cooled down, Fictiv again reignited relationships and operations in China, where Covid had been contained early, to continue working there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we were just in the right places at the right time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup made its name early on with building prototypes for tech companies neighboring it in the Bay Area, startups build VR and other gadgets, with services that included injection molding, CNC machining, 3D printing and urethane casting, with customers using cloud-based <a href="https://www.fictiv.com/our-platform">software</a> to design and order parts, which then were routed by Fictiv to the plants best suited to make them.</p>
<p>These days, while that business continues, Fictiv is also working with very large global multinationals on their efforts with smaller-scale manufacturing, products that are either new or unable to be tooled as efficiently in their existing factories.</p>
<p>Work that it does for Honeywell, for example, includes mostly hardware for its aerospace division. Medical devices and robotics are two other big areas for the company currently, it said.</p>
<p>But Evans and his investors are careful not to describe what they do as specifically industrial technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Industrial tech is a misnomer. I think of this as digital transformation, cloud-based SaaS and AI,&#8221; said Marianne Wu, the MD of 40 North. &#8220;The baggage of industrial tech tells you everything about the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fictiv&#8217;s pitch is that by taking on the supply-chain management of producing hardware for a business, it can produce hardware using its platform in a week, a process that might have previously taken 3 months to complete, which can mean lower costs and more efficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you speed up development, you see more products getting introduced,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, however. One of the big sticking points in manufacturing has been the carbon footprint that it creates in production, and also in terms of the resulting goods that are produced.</p>
<p>That will likely become even more of an issue, if the Biden Administration follows through on its own commitments to reduce emissions and to lean more on companies to follow through for those ends.</p>
<p>Evans is all too aware of that issue and accepts that manufacturing may be one of the hardest to shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainability and manufacturing are not synonymous,&#8221; he admits. And while materials and manufacturing will take longer to evolve, for now, he said the focus has been on how to implement better private and public and carbon credits programs. He envisions a better market for carbon credits, he said, with Fictiv doing its part with the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/01/2137387/0/en/Fictiv-Launches-Carbon-Neutral-Shipping-Program.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of its own tool</a> for measuring this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainability is ripe for disruption, and we hope to have the first carbon-neutral shipping program, giving customers better choice for more sustainability. It&#8217;s on the shoulders of companies like us to drive this.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, and struggle to get out of a debt cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup is developing financial products targeted toward this segment of the population, with the goal of helping them build credit, save money, access funds and plan for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That startup, </span><a href="http://www.seedfi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Wednesday it has raised $50 million in debt and $15 million in an equity funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z. The VC firm also led SeedFi&#8217;s $4 million seed funding when it was founded in March of 2019.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flourish, Core Innovation Capital and Quiet Capital also participated in the latest financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi was founded on the premise that it is difficult for many Americans to get ahead financially. Its founding team has worked at both startups and big banks, such as JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, and operates under the premise that many legacy financial institutions are simply not designed to help Americans who are struggling financially to get ahead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen firsthand how the system has been designed for underprivileged Americans to fail,” said Jim McGinley, co-founder and CEO of SeedFi. “Our average customer earns $50,000 a year, yet they pay $460 a year in overdraft fees and payday loan companies charge them APRs of 400% or more. They barely make enough to cover their expenses and any misstep can set them back for years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous roles, McGinley was responsible for payday loans for underserved communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There I got insights to the financial difficulties they had and the need for better products to help them get a step up,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder Eric Burton said he can relate because he grew up in Central Texas as part of “a super poor family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I experienced all the struggles of being low income and the necessity of taking on high-priced credit to get through day to day,” he recalled. “I personally was trapped in a debt cycle for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, a job offer he got from Capital One was temporarily rescinded because the company said he had “bad credit,” which turned out to be a result of unpaid medical bills he’d incurred at the age of 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know about them, but was able to get the job after using my signing bonus to pay off that debt,” he said. “So I can understand how a certain starting point makes it very hard to progress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi’s goal is to tackle the root of the problem. It launched in private beta in 2019, and helped its initial customers build more than $500,000 in savings &#8212; even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it’s launching </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the public with two offerings. One is a credit building product that is designed to “create important long-term savings habits.” Customers save as little as $10 from every paycheck, which is reported to the credit bureaus to build their credit history, and are then able to generate $500 in savings in six months’ time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After six months of on-time payments, SeedFi customers with no credit history were able to establish a credit score of 600, while customers with existing credit scores and less than three credit accounts boosted their scores by 45 points, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of enabling consumers to build credit history beyond traditional methods is becoming increasingly more common. Just last week, we wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/">Tomo Credit,</a> which provides customers with a debit card so they can build credit based on their cash flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeedFi’s other offering, the Borrow &amp; Grow Plan, is designed to be a more affordable alternative to installment or payday loans. It provides consumers with “immediate access” to funds while also helping them build savings and credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz general partner </span><a href="https://a16z.com/author/angela-strange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angela Strange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , who has joined SeedFi’s board with the financing, believes there’s “a massive business opportunity for new financial services entrants to reach historically underserved populations through better product experiences, underwriting and technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog post, she shares an example of how SeedFi works. The company evaluates risk and extends credit to a customer that might be traditionally hard to underwrite. It determines how much to lend, as well as the proportion of dollars to give as money now versus savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, a typical SeedFi plan might be structured as $500 right now and $500 reserved in a savings account. The borrower pays off $1,000 over time, and at the end of the plan, he or she has $500 in a savings account. Not only has the borrower paid a lower interest rate, he or she is in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financial position after making the decision to borrow money,” Strange writes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, SeedFi plans to use its new capital to build out its product suite and grow its customer base. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will be able to more efficiently fund our growing loan portfolio and serve more customers,” McGinley said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://certific.co/">Certific</a>, a health tech startup co-founded by TransferWise&#8217;s Taavet Hinrikus, is breaking cover today with the launch of what it claims is the first &#8220;certified&#8221; remote COVID-19 testing service.</p>
<p>The British-Estonian company is using techniques borrowed from the worlds of fintech and telemedicine, including asking users to film themselves while taking the at-home test, in a bold attempt to solve remote testing&#8217;s adherence and trust problem.</p>
<p>Initially targeting private individuals and businesses in the U.K., with other markets to follow, tests can be ordered online and are carried out remotely with the promise of a certified result the following day for PCR tests and in under 90 minutes for antigen tests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, the Certific app and user journey is designed to increase trust in remote testing and ensure that self-performed tests reach the same standard as those carried out in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>“When the pandemic hit, we started toying around with the first finger prick tests to see if you have antibodies, and thinking, &#8216;hey, is there a way to make use of these to help the world along,’ ” Hinrikus told me during an interview earlier this week. “[But] then it turned out that these kind of antibody tests, and the end immunity, was a very unclear concept. And so we kind of put it on hold, but we kept on thinking about what better things we can do to make testing more trustworthy and easier”.</p>
<p>Then late last year he and Certific’s other co-founders &#8212; physician Dr. Jack Kreindler and CEO Liis Narusk &#8212; realised that there were things “that we can and should be doing to come up with a more democratised way of medical testing, and apply this to the pandemic”.</p>
<p>Hinrikus doesn’t quite say it, but as the founder of TransferWise and a prolific angel investor, including backing Estonian verification platform Veriff, there’s little doubt that Certific is partly inspired by the authentication techniques that have gained prominence in fintech, such as video selfies used to onboard new customers at digital banks. In addition, medical director Kreindler has experience with anti-doping in close-combat sports.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yeK8way83T"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/">Veriff raises $7.7M Series A to become the &#8216;Stripe for identity&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Veriff raises $7.7M Series A to become the &#8216;Stripe for identity&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/embed/#?secret=yeK8way83T" data-secret="yeK8way83T" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Coupled with more traditional identity checks, the Certific app asks you to film yourself while you take the test. The recording and test result is securely uploaded to Certific and checked by a qualified physician to ensure you have adhered to the manufacturer&#8217;s instructions properly. A medical certification containing the test result is then delivered back to the app. PCR tests cost £64, and the soon to be available rapid antigen tests will be sold in 12-packs for £249 (making the price of a single antigen test £20.75).</p>
<p>But how easy would it be to cheat the test and therefore fake a result? “That&#8217;s one thing we definitely are very, very focused on solving,” says Certific CEO Narusk. “Our experience in all the anti-fraud and anti-cheat areas means that we went far and beyond to make sure that you can&#8217;t actually tamper with the process. So when you record the video, and after you have recorded the video, it is checked by our test verification officers who make sure that you haven&#8217;t moved the tests away from the screen”.</p>
<p>In addition, Certific ensures that the test you have used is actually the test that you ordered and contains the same unique ID, and that you are the person who was supposed to do the test.</p>
<p>That in itself isn’t entirely fraud proof, and Hinrikus clarifies that Certific is initially focusing on ensuring that a test is carried out medically correctly. He says that a higher-priced tier will be offered at a later stage with enhanced video verification, such as a live operator acting as a witness.</p>
<p>This could be particularly useful for businesses, such as live events or travel, where there could be incentives for individuals to cheat and where operators may be required to prove to insurance companies or government authorities that they are COVID-19 safe.</p>
<p>Kreindler, Certific’s medical director, contrasts this with key workers that are currently permitted by U.K. authorities to carry out coronavirus home-testing without any additional verification, but who aren’t nearly as likely to want to fake a result.</p>
<p>“If you think about it, those public servants are not at a great disadvantage if they test positive, because they still get paid. So there&#8217;s less of an incentive to cheat. And the challenge comes where you are doing point of care testing in an environment where there actually is some incentive or a big disadvantage [to testing positive]”.</p>
<p>Kreindler also says it’s not just about individuals and that Certific has worked with academics in Estonia, North America and in the U.K. to develop a computational risk model for mass testing for “super spreader” environments, such as large events. People will not only be able to take a test at home before attending, but a risk model that continually learns and takes into account “democratised decentralised testing” and an understanding of vaccination and immunity, could enable further mitigations to be put in place to make sure there&#8217;s no net spread of the virus back into the community. “That&#8217;s very core to our thinking going forward,” he says. “It&#8217;s not just about certifying testing, it&#8217;s also about certifying crowds”.</p>
<p>Zooming out even further &#8212; and beyond the current coronavirus pandemic &#8212; Certific has been built to be entirely test agnostic. Combining speed, convenience, adherence and trust, the company aims to be the rails on which existing and future home tests can run (my words, not theirs). In the future, this could span testing for sexually transmitted diseases (SDIs) to anti-doping tests in sports. And, of course, new types of COVID-19 tests as they come on stream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest challenges for organizations in modern times is deciding where, when, and how to use the advances of technology, when the organizations are not technology companies themselves. Today, a startup out of Manchester, England, is announcing some funding for a platform that it believes can help.</p>
<p><a href="https://peak.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peak AI</a>, which has built technology that it says can help enterprises &#8212; specifically those that work with physical products such as retailers, consumer goods companies, and manufacturing organizations &#8212; make better, AI-based evaluations and decisions, has closed a round of $21 million.</p>
<p>The Series B is being led by Oxx, with participation from past investors MMC Ventures and Praetura Ventures, as well as new backer Arete. It has raised $43 million to date and is not disclosing its valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Richard Potter, the CEO who co-founded the company with Atul Sharma and David Leitch, said that the funding will be used to continue expanding the the functionality of its platform, adding offices in the U.S. and India, and growing its customer base.</p>
<p>Its list of clients today is an impressive one, including the retailer PrettyLittleThing, KFC, PepsiCo, Marshalls and Speedy Hire.</p>
<p>As Potter describes it, Peak identified its opportunity early on. It was founded in 2014, a time non-tech enterprises were just starting to grasp how the concept of AI could apply to their businesses but felt it was out of their reach.</p>
<p>Indeed, the larger landscape for AI services at that time was largely one focused on technology companies, specifically companies like Google, Amazon and Apple that were building AI products to power their own services, and often snapping up the most interesting talent in the field as it manifested through smaller startups and universities.</p>
<p>Peak&#8217;s basic premise was to build AI not as a business goal for itself but as a business service. Its platform sits within an organization and ingests any data source that a company might wish to feed into it.</p>
<p>While initial integration needs technical know-how &#8212; either at the company itself or via a systems integrator &#8212; using Peak day-to-day can be done by both technical and non-technical workers.</p>
<p>Peak says it can help answer a variety of questions that those people might have, such as how much of an item to produce, and where to ship it, based on a complex mix of sales data; how to manage stock better; or when to ramp up or ramp down headcount in a warehouse. The platform can also be used to help companies with marketing and advertising, figuring out how to better target campaigns to the right audiences, and so on.</p>
<p>Peak is not the first company that has seized on the concept of using a &#8220;general&#8221; AI to give non-tech organizations the same kinds of superpowers that the likes of big tech now use in their own businesses everyday.</p>
<p>Sometimes the ambition has outstripped the returns, however.</p>
<p>Witness Element AI, a highly-touted startup backed by a long list of top-shelf strategic and financial investors to build, essentially, an AI services business for non-tech companies to use as they might these days use Accenture. It never quite got there, though, and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/servicenow-is-acquiring-element-ai-the-canadian-startup-building-ai-services-for-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by ServiceNow last year</a> at a devalued price of $500 million, the customer deals it had were wound down, and the tech was integrated into the bigger company&#8217;s stack.</p>
<p>Other efforts within hugely successful tech companies have not fared that well either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Einsten&#8217;s features are essentially useless, and you can quote me on that,&#8221; said Potter of Salesforce&#8217;s in-house CRM AI business. &#8220;Because it is too generic, it doesn’t predict anything useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is perhaps the crux of why Peak AI is working for now: it has remained focused for now on a limited number of segments of the market, in particular those with physical objects as the end product, giving the AI that it has built a more targeted end point. In other words, it&#8217;s &#8220;general&#8221; but only for specific industries.</p>
<p>And it claims that this is paying off. Peak’s customers have reported a 5% increase in total company revenues, a doubling of return on advertising spend, a 12% reduction in inventory holdings, and a 5% reduction in supply chain costs, according to the company (although it doesn&#8217;t specify which companies, which products, or anything that points to who or what is being described).</p>
<p>&#8220;Richard and the excellent Peak team have a compelling vision to optimize entire businesses through Decision Intelligence and they&#8217;re delivering real-world benefits to a raft of household name customers already,&#8221; said Richard Anton, a general partner at Oxx, in a statement. &#8220;The pandemic has meant digitization is no longer a choice; it’s a requirement. Peak has made it easier for businesses to get started and see rapid results from AI-enabled decision making. We are delighted to support Peak on their way to becoming the category-defining global leader in Decision Intelligence.&#8221; Anton is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games has taken its fight against Apple&#8217;s App Store rules to the European Union where it&#8217;s lodged a complaint with the bloc&#8217;s antitrust regulators.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-games-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-apple">blog post</a> today the maker of the popular online game Fortnite said it&#8217;s extending its battle for what it dubbed &#8220;fairer digital platform practices for developers and consumers&#8221; to Europe, noting the bloc is already looking into competition concerns attached to the Apple App Store (and its payment service, Apple Pay).</p>
<p>The EU opened a formal probe into certain Apple practices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regional lawmakers have also recently set out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">plan to expand platform regulation</a> to put specific strictures on &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; platforms with the aim of ensuring fairness and accountability vis-a-vis third parties. And the issue of platform power is certainly one that&#8217;s now under close scrutiny by regulators and lawmakers around the world.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re bringing our fight to end Apple’s App Store monopoly to Europe. Apple’s practices are harming consumers and app developers in Europe and around the world, and we’re joining the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EU</a>’s ongoing investigation into Apple’s abuse of its dominant position <a href="https://t.co/LIb346QmEi">https://t.co/LIb346QmEi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1361935723620950019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The complaint, filed with the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition, alleges that through a series of carefully designed anti-competitive restrictions, Apple has not just harmed but completely eliminated competition in app distribution and payment processes,&#8221; Epic writes, adding: &#8220;Apple uses its control of the iOS ecosystem to benefit itself while blocking competitors and its conduct is an abuse of a dominant position and in breach of EU competition law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not seeking damages against Apple but wants EU competition authorities to impose remedies against what it describes as the iPhone maker&#8217;s &#8220;monopoly channels&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yXyLyyI1gy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/">Apple terminates Epic Games&#8217; App Store account</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple terminates Epic Games&#8217; App Store account&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games/embed/#?secret=yXyLyyI1gy" data-secret="yXyLyyI1gy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“What’s at stake here is the very future of mobile platforms,” said Epic Games founder and CEO, Tim Sweeney, in a statement. “Consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing and developers have the right to compete in a fair marketplace. We will not stand idly by and allow Apple to use its platform dominance to control what should be a level digital playing field. It’s bad for consumers, who are paying inflated prices due to the complete lack of competition among stores and in-app payment processing. And it’s bad for developers, whose very livelihoods often hinge on Apple’s complete discretion as to who to allow on the iOS platform, and on which terms.”</p>
<p>Epic launched a US lawsuit against Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">last August</a> after Apple banned Fortnite from the App Store.</p>
<p>The tech giant made the move after Epic tried to bypass its in-app purchase framework (and circumvent the cut Apple takes) by adding its own payment mechanism to Fortnite to let users purchase in-game currency directly &#8212; in direct contravention of Apple&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>As well as banning Fortnight, Apple said it would go further and revoke Epic&#8217;s developer account and access to developer tools for its Unreal Engine &#8212; a move that would have affected third party app makers that rely on Epic&#8217;s engine. However it was barred from going that far.</p>
<p>A US judge quickly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/">denied Epic&#8217;s motion to force Apple to unblock the game</a> but Cupertino was ordered not to block Epic’s ability to provide and distribute its Unreal Engine on iOS &#8212; limiting Apple&#8217;s ability to take a scorched earth approach to try to shut Epic&#8217;s battle down.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qePCbo2yQ4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/">Apple ordered to not block Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine, but Fortnite to stay off App Store</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple ordered to not block Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine, but Fortnite to stay off App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/apple-ordered-to-not-block-epic-games-unreal-engine-but-fortnite-to-stay-off-app-store/embed/#?secret=qePCbo2yQ4" data-secret="qePCbo2yQ4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since then Epic has filed legal complaints against Apple in Australia and the UK. It&#8217;s now also petitioning EU regulators.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division, meanwhile, opened a formal investigation of Apple last summer &#8212; more than a year after the Europe-based music streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-a-complaint-against-apple-with-the-european-commission-over-apple-tax-and-restrictive-rules/">Spotify had made a similar complaint</a> over &#8216;restrictive&#8217; App Store rules and the 30% cut Cupertino takes on iOS in-app payments.</p>
<p>The Commission said at the time that an unnamed e-book/audiobook distributor had also complained about the impact of App Store rules on competition.</p>
<p>It confirmed today that it has received a complaint <span lang="EN-IE">by Epic Games against Apple. </span><u></u><u></u><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;</span><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">We will assess it based on our standard procedures,&#8221; a Commission spokesperson told us. </span></p>
<p>Epic&#8217;s argument is that Apple is denying Fortnight users on iOS a choice between Apple payment and Epic direct payment &#8212; claiming savings would be passed to direct purchasers (although Epic of course stands to gain money if it can open up a channel that bypasses Apple&#8217;s cut on in-app payments).</p>
<p>Epic has also tried to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fortnite-maker-asked-apple-to-publish-epic-games-app-store-2020-8">push Apple to let it operate an Epic Games Store on iOS</a> &#8212; a move Apple refused, citing the &#8220;exacting standards for security, privacy, and content&#8221; which it argues are predicated on the App Store rules (although Apple&#8217;s claims of curation equaling &#8216;quality&#8217; don&#8217;t always live up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">the reality of what it allows to operate on its App Store</a>).</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-arcade-is-apples-new-cross-platform-gaming-subscription/">2019</a>, Apple also launched its own gaming distribution service, Apple Arcade &#8212; a pure-play content play that offers access to new and exclusive games playable across Apple&#8217;s device ecosystem.</p>
<p>That move was perhaps the straw the broke the camel&#8217;s back vis-a-vis Epic Games deciding to go all in on an antitrust brawl with Apple. (Its blog post references Apple Arcade, and notes that Apple has barred competitors, including itself, from doing the same).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Epic has also squared up to Google, which similarly takes a cut of in-app payments of Android apps distributed via its Play Store &#8212; and which also removed Fortnight from the Play Store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368079/fortnite-epic-android-banned-google-play-app-store-rule-violation">last year</a>.</p>
<p>However Google&#8217;s Android platform allows sideloading of third party apps and alternative app stores, arguably making it harder to make an antitrust case stick vs the tighter restrictions applied by Apple.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, Android dominates smartphone marketshare &#8212; while Apple&#8217;s cut of the global market is less than a fifth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprises have been loading more of their operations into cloud &#8212; and, more often than not, multi-cloud &#8212; environments over the last year, creating vast networks of services that can be complex to manage. Today, <a href="http://varmour.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vArmour</a>, a startup that provides ways to manage in real time and ultimately secure how applications (and people) work in those fragmented environments is announcing funding to capitalize on the demand for its services.</p>
<p>The Bay Area startup has picked up funding of $58 million in what it described as an oversubscribed round. Co-led by previous backers AllegisCyber Capital and NightDragon, existing investors Standard Chartered Ventures, Highland Capital Partners, Australian carrier Telstra, Redline Capital, and EDBI also participated.</p>
<p>CEO Tim Eades (who co-founded the company with Roger Lian) said this round is likely to be its final fundraising ahead of an IPO for the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We had one hell of a year in 2020 with companies rushing to the cloud,&#8221; he said in an interview, with net new annual recurring revenue doubing year over year in the last year. It started out, he noted, with perhaps 10% of business processes in the cloud, and ended at more like 50%. &#8220;Now the focus for us is to get to the public markets, maybe in two or 2.5 years from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company appointed a CFO last October as part of its go-public plan, he noted &#8212; <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/06/2104340/0/en/vArmour-Appoints-Chris-Dentiste-as-Chief-Financial-Officer-to-Bolster-Business-Leadership-and-Corporate-Strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Dentiste</a>, who previously had been the CFO of RSA. &#8220;His job is to help me find the right window. My job is to make sure we have enough fuel in the tank, and we do,&#8221; said Eades.</p>
<p>He added that the company is likely also to look at making some acquisitions in the meantime. A recent launch of an AI lab in Calgary, Canada, points to one area where we might see some activity.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation, although Eades confirmed it was a significant up-round. We&#8217;re also double checking what the total raised to date is now too (we&#8217;ll update when we get that information).</p>
<p>For some context, in the last round of funding that we covered &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/varmour-a-security-startup-focused-on-multi-cloud-deployments-raises-44m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$44 million round in 2019</a> led by the same two investors &#8212; we mentioned a <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/55942-03/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> estimate of $420 million from the previous round &#8212; a figure that the company did not dispute with us at the time.</p>
<p>vArmour has been around for several years, with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/20/in-year-3-of-stealth-mode-enterprise-security-startup-varmour-raises-another-36m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first three spent in stealth mode</a>, quietly building its technology, raising money and amassing early customers. Those customers, Eades said, fall into categories like telecommunications (strategic backer Telstra being one of them), and financial services.</p>
<p>Those industries speak largely to the challenges that vArmour is addressing in its business.</p>
<p>Legacy businesses in critical verticals often pre-date the modern era of business, and while many of them are going through what enterprise people like to refer to as &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, the evolution is not a smooth one.</p>
<p>In many cases, adopting new technologies can be slow, and in almost every case, when you are talking about large enterprises, the changes are very piecemeal, affecting one particular service, or region, or department, or even a subsection of any of those.</p>
<p>All of this means that for malicious actors, there are a number of options to tackle when setting out to look for vulnerabilities in a business or its network, and for those on the inside, it makes for a very complicated and fragmented situation when it comes to monitoring those networks and the services running on them, finding vulnerabilities or suspicious activity, and doing something about that. VArmour&#8217;s term that it uses for this is &#8220;Application Relationship Management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eades &#8212; whose <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tieades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">background</a> includes working for the likes of IBM but also leading number of startups acquired by bigger technology giants &#8212; has first-hand understanding of how that complexity looks from both sides, from the end user end and from the service provider end. That is in essence what his company has identified and is trying to fix.</p>
<p>Having started out in managing application policies and providing insights to protect on that front, the company is expanding the range of tools that it provides with the recent launch of identity access management on top of that.</p>
<p>But that is likely to be just one of the product steps that it takes to tackle what remains a difficult problem to fix, as its growth is related not just to the growth of activity on a network, but further digital migration of services, and the rise of new technology within an organization&#8217;s stack.</p>
<p>(And that is also an area that vArmour is not alone in considering, or even the only approach to tackling it: consider yesterday&#8217;s news of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/sources-palo-alto-networks-acquired-devops-security-startup-bridgecrew-for-around-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palo Alto Networks acquiring Bridgecrew</a> to extend its own ability to provide automated security monitoring services to DevOps teams.)</p>
<p class="p6">“Managing risk and resiliency in the hybrid cloud is one of the most significant security challenges for enterprises,” said Bob Ackerman, Founder and Managing Director at AllegisCyber Capital, in a statement. “vArmour’s platform provides the visibility, controls, and accountability necessary to actively manage these challenges and has done this for hundreds of customers. We are ecstatic to be part of their next stage of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;As applications become more complex, more distributed, and more targeted by attackers, the importance of full visibility into the relationships between applications becomes increasingly important.&#8221; added Dave DeWalt, founder of NightDragon. &#8220;vArmour&#8217;s approach to application relationship management ensures that enterprises of all sizes can continuously audit, respond, and control identity relationships to best protect their important IP, and mitigate risk to the business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-takes-a-690m-stake-in-cloud-based-swedish-crm-company-sinch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $690 million from SoftBank</a> in December to make acquisitions, the Sweden-based cloud communications company <a href="https://www.sinch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinch</a> has followed through on its strategy in that department. Today the company announced that it is <a href="https://www.sinch.com/news/sinch-establishes-leadership-in-u-s-voice-communications-by-acquiring-inteliquent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Inteliquent</a>, an interconnection provider for voice communications in the U.S. currently owned by private equity firm GTCR, for $1.14 billion in cash.</p>
<p>And to finance the deal, Sinch said it has raised financing totaling SEK8.2 billion &#8212; $986 million &#8212; from Handelsbanken and Danske Bank, along with other facilities it had in place.</p>
<p>The deal will give Sinch &#8212; a competitor to Twilio with a range of messaging, calling and marketing (engagement) APIs for those building communications into their services in mobile apps and other services &#8212; a significant foothold in the U.S. market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Inteliquent &#8212; a profitable company with 500 employees and revenues of $533 million, gross profit of $256 million, and Ebitda of $135 million in 2020 &#8212; claims to be one of the biggest voice carriers North America, serving both other service providers and enterprises. Its network connects to all the major telcos, covering 94% of the U.S. population, with more than 300 billion minutes of voice calls and 100 million phone numbers handled annually for customers.</p>
<p>Sinch is publicly traded in Sweden &#8212; where its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SINCH.ST?p=SINCH.ST&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> is current at $13 billion (just over 108 billion Swedish krona) &#8212; and the acquisition begs the question of whether the company plans to establish more of a financial presence in the U.S., for example with a listing there. We have asked the company what its next steps might be and will update this post as and when we learn more.</p>
<p>“Becoming a leader in the U.S. voice market is key to establish Sinch as the leading global cloud communications platform,&#8221; said Oscar Werner, Sinch CEO, in a statement. &#8220;Inteliquent serves the largest and most demanding voice customers in America with superior quality backed by a fully-owned network across the entire U.S.. Our joint strengths in voice and messaging provide a unique position to grow our business and power a superior customer experience for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inteliquent provides two main areas of service, Communications-Platform-as-Service (CPaaS) for API-based services to provide voice calling and phone numbers; and more legacy Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) products for telcos such as off-net call termination (when a call is handed off from one carrier to another) and toll-free numbers. These each account for roughly half of the total business although &#8212; unsurprisingly &#8212; the CPaaS business is growing at twice the rate of IaaS.</p>
<p>Its business, like many others focusing on services for people who are relying more on communications services as they are seeing each other in person less &#8212; saw a surge of use this past year, it said. (Revenues adjusted without Covid lift, it noted, would have been $499 million, so still healthy.)</p>
<div class="gmail_default">&#8220;<span class="il">Sinch</span> is focused on delivering unparalleled customer experiences at scale and with the investors we have today, we believe we have the financial muscle <span lang="EN-US">for both extensive product development and M&amp;A</span> that is needed to take advantage of a consolidating global market <span lang="EN-US">as we </span>continue <span lang="EN-US">building the </span>leading CPaaS company,&#8221; Werner told TechCrunch over email.</div>
<p>As for Sinch, since being founded by CLX in 2008 (its name was a rebrand after CLX acquired Sinch, which spun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/14/rebtel-spins-out-sinch-with-12m-in-funding-to-offer-communications-tools-to-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out from Rebtel in 2014</a>) to take on the business of providing comunications tools to developers, it has been on an acquisition roll to bulk up its geographical reach and the services that it provides to those customers.</p>
<p>Deals have included, most recently, buying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/sinch-to-buy-indias-acl-mobile-for-70-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACL in India for $70 million</a> and SAP&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/sinch-acquires-saps-digital-interconnect-messaging-business-for-250m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital interconnect business for $250 million</a>. The deals &#8212; combined with Twilio&#8217;s own acquisitions of companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/twilio-acquires-email-api-platform-sendgrid-for-2-billion-in-stock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendgrid for $2 billion</a> and last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segment for $3.2 billon</a>, speak both to the bigger trend of consolidation in the digital (API-based) communications space, as well as the huge value that is contained within it.</p>
<p>Inteliquent itself had been in private equity hands before this, controlled by GTCR based in Chicago, like Inteliquent itself. According to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/93991-42/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>, its most recent financing was a mezzanine loan from Oaktree Capital in 2018 for just under $19 million.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Inteliquent itself has been an investor in innovative communications startups, participating in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/zipwhip-nabs-9m-from-microsoft-more-to-let-any-number-send-and-receive-sms-texts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B for Zipwhip</a>, a startup that is building better ways to integrate mobile messaging tools into landline services.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the tremendous opportunities this combination unlocks, expanding the services we can provide to our customers. Combining our leading voice offering with Sinch’s global messaging capabilities truly positions us for leadership in the rapidly developing market for cloud communications“, comments Ed O’Hara, Inteliquent CEO, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dixa.com/">Dixa</a>, the Danish customer support platform promising more personalised customer support, has acquired Melbourne-based &#8220;knowledge management&#8221; SaaS Elevio to bolster its product and technology offerings.</p>
<p>The deal is said to be worth around $15 million, in a combination of cash and Dixa shares. This sees Elevio&#8217;s own VC investors exit, and Elevio&#8217;s founders and employees incentivised as part of the Dixa family, according to Dixa co-founder and CEO, Mads Fosselius.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have looked at many partners within this space over the years and ultimately decided to partner with Elevio as they have what we believe is the best solution in the market,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Dixa and Elevio have worked together since 2019 on several customers and great brands through a strong and tight integration between the two platforms. Dixa has also used Elevio’s products internally and to support our own customers for self service, knowledge base and help center&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fosselius says that this &#8220;close partnership, strong integration, unique tech&#8221; and a growing number of mutual customers eventually led to a discussion late last year, and the two companies decided to go on a journey together to &#8220;disrupt the world of customer service&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition comes with many interesting opportunities but it has been driven by a product/tech focus and is highly product and platform strategic for us,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;We long ago acknowledged that they have the best knowledge product in the market. We could have built our own knowledge management system but with such a strong product already out there, built with a similar tech stack as ours and with a very aligned vision and culture fit to Dixa, we felt this was a no brainer&#8221;.</p>

<p>Founded in 2015 by Jacob Vous Petersen and Mads Fosselius, Dixa wants to end bad customer service with the help of technology that claims to be able to facilitate more personalised customer support. Originally dubbed a “customer friendship” platform, the Dixa cloud-based software works across multiple channels — including phone, chat, e-mail, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and SMS — and employs a smart routing system so the right support requests reach the right people within an organisation.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the platform competes with Zendesk, Freshdesk and Salesforce. However, there&#8217;s also overlap with Intercom in relation to live chat and messaging, and perhaps MessageBird with its attempted expansion to become an “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">Omnichannel Platform-as-a-Service</a>” (OPaaS) to easily enable companies to communicate with customers on any channel of their choosing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elevio is described as bridging the gap between customer support and knowledge management. The platform helps support agents more easily access the right answers when communicating with customers, and simultaneously enables end-users to get information and guidance to resolve common issues for themselves.</p>
<p>Machine learning is employed so that the correct support content is provided based on a user’s query or on-going discussion, whilst also alerting customer support teams when documents need updating. The Australian company also claims that creating user guides using Elevio doesn&#8217;t require any technical skills and says its &#8220;embeddable assistant&#8221; enables support content to be delivered in-product or injected into any area of a website &#8220;without involving developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Adds the Dixa CEO : “Customer support agents still spend a lot of time helping customers with the same type of questions over and over again. Together with Elevio we are able to ensure that agents are given the opportunity to quickly replicate best practice answers, ensuring fast, standardised and correct answers for customers. Elevio is the world leader in applying machine learning to solve this problem&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nate Faust has spent years in the e-commerce business — he was a vice president at Quidsi (which ran Diapers.com and Soap.com), co-founder and COO at Jet (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/confirmed-walmart-buys-jet-com-for-3b-in-cash/">acquired by Walmart for $3.3 billion</a>) and then a vice president at Walmart.</p>
<p>Over time, he said it slowly dawned on him that it&#8217;s &#8220;crazy&#8221; that 25 years after the industry started, it&#8217;s still relying on &#8220;single-use, one-way packaging.&#8221; That&#8217;s annoying for consumers to deal with and has a real environmental impact, but Faust said, &#8220;If any single retailer were to try to tackle this problem right now on their own, they would run up into a huge cost increase to pay for this more expensive packaging and this two-way shipping.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he&#8217;s looking to change that with his new startup <a href="https://www.shopolive.com/">Olive</a>, which consolidates a shopper&#8217;s purchases into a single weekly delivery in a reusable package.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Olive works with hundreds of different apparel brands and retailers, including Adidas, Anthropologie, Everlane, Hugo Boss, Outdoor Voices and Saks Fifth Avenue. After consumers sign up, they can install the Olive iOS app and/or Chrome browser extension, then Faust said, &#8220;You shop on the directly on the retailer and brand sites you normally would, and Olive assists you in that checkout process and automatically enters your Olive details.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113844" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113844" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2113844" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?w=680" alt="Olive chrome extension" width="680" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Olive-chrome-extension.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113844" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Olive</p></div></p>
<p>The products are sent to an Olive consolidation facility, where they&#8217;re held for you and combined into a weekly shipment. Because the retailers are still shipping products out like normal, all that packaging is still being used — but at least the consumer doesn&#8217;t have to dispose of it. And Faust said that eventually, Olive could work more closely with retailers to reduce or eliminate it.</p>
<p>Until then, he said the real environmental impact comes from &#8220;the consolidation of deliveries into fewer last mile stops&#8221; — the startup estimates that doubling the number of items in a delivery reduces the per-item carbon footprint by 30%.</p>
<p>The weekly shipments are delivered by regular mail carriers in most parts of the United States, and by local couriers in dense urban areas. They arrive in reusable shippers made from recyclable materials, and you can return any products by just selecting them in the Olive app, then putting them back in the shipper and flipping the label over.</p>
<p>In fact, Faust argued that the convenience of the return process (no labels to print out, no visits to the local FedEx or UPS store) should make Olive appealing to shoppers who aren&#8217;t drawn in by the environmental impact.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELfk4rJbKto?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;In order to have the largest environmental impact, the selling point can’t be the environmental impact,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Olive delivery is available at no extra cost to the consumer, who just pays whatever they normally would for shipping.</p>
<p>Faust acknowledged that Olive runs counter to the &#8220;arm&#8217;s race&#8221; between Amazon and other e-commerce services working to deliver purchases as quickly as possible. But he said that the startup&#8217;s consumer surveys found that shoppers were willing to wait a little longer in order to get the other benefits.</p>
<p>Plus, Olive is starting with apparel because &#8220;there&#8217;s not that same expectation of speed&#8221; that you get in other categories, and because the items cost enough that the delivery economics still work out, even if you only order one product in a week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tens of thousands of students and professionals move out of India each year to pursue higher education and for work. Even after spending months in a new country, they struggle to get a credit card from local banks, and end up paying a premium to access a range of other financial services.</p>
<p>Banks in the U.S., or in most other countries for that matter, rely on local credit scores to determine the worthiness of potential applicants. Even if an individual had a great credit score in India, for instance, that wouldn’t hold any water for banks in a foreign land.</p>
<p>That was the takeaway <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/graghunandan/?originalSubdomain=in">Raghunandan G</a>, the founder of ride-hailing firm TaxiForSure (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold to local giant Ola</a>), returned to India with after a trip. After months of research and assembling a team, Raghunandan believes he has a solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On Wednesday, he announced <a class="c-link" href="https://zolve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://zolve.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Zolve</a>, a neobanking platform for individuals moving from India to the U.S. (or the other way around).</p>
<p>The startup works with banks in the U.S. and India to provide consumers access to financial products seamlessly &#8212; without paying any premium or coughing up any security deposit.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Raghunandan said the startup underwrites the risks, which has enabled banks in foreign countries to extend their services to Zolve customers. “Consumers can open an account with us and access all banking services as if they are banking with their national bank,” he said.</p>
<p>As part of the announcement, Raghunandan said two-month-old Zolve has raised $15 million in a seed financing round led by Accel and Lightspeed. Blume Ventures and several high-profile angel investors, including Kunal Shah (founder of Cred), Ashish Gupta (formerly the MD of Helion), Greg Kidd (known for his investments in Twitter and Ripple), Rahul Mehta (managing partner at DST Global) and Rahul Kishore (senior managing director of Coatue Capital), also participated in the round.

<p><div id="attachment_2113848" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113848" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2113848 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/raghunandan-zolve-taxiforsure.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113848" class="wp-caption-text">Before starting Zolve, Raghunandan founded TaxiForSure, a ride-hailing firm, that he later sold to Ola for $200 million. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zolve</p></div></p>
<p>Raghunandan acknowledged that a handful of other startups are also attempting to solve this challenge, but he said other firms are not making use of a consumer&#8217;s credit history from their origin nation. &#8220;We are the only one who is looking at this problem in a completely different light. We are not trying to solve the problem at the destination country where consumers face the challenges. We are finding the solution in the home country itself, where the consumers already have a reputation and credit history,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once a customer has access to a credit card and other financial services in the new nation, they can quickly broaden their local credit history, something that otherwise takes years, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global citizen community is largely underserved in terms of access to financial services and we believe that there is a huge market opportunity for Zolve. Raghu has a proven track record as a founder and we are delighted to partner with him again, on his latest venture. The team&#8217;s passion and commitment are commendable and we are positive that Zolve will create tremendous value for this community,&#8221; said Anand Daniel, partner at Accel, in a statement.</p>
<p>Headquartered in San Francisco and Bangalore, Zolve offers a range of compelling features even for those who don&#8217;t plan to visit a foreign land. If you&#8217;re in India, for instance, you can use Zolve to buy shares of companies listed at U.S. exchanges. You can also buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrency from exchanges based in the U.S. or Europe, said Raghunandan.</p>
<p>The startup, which has already amassed more than 5,000 customers, has formed revenue-sharing arrangements with its banking partners. Raghunandan said since Zolve currently onboards customers in India and generates much of its revenue from banking partners in the U.S., it&#8217;s already operating on a profitable model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People who have spent time in jail or prison often face barriers to accessing stable jobs, housing and financial services. These types of barriers are a key driver of recidivism for the more than <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/outofwork.html">600,000 people who are released from prison each year</a>. Between 2005 and 2014, an estimated 68% of people released in 2005 were arrested again within three years. Within nine years, 83% of those released in 2005 were rearrested, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/18upr9yfup0514.pdf">according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://centerforjustice.columbia.edu/justicethroughcode#/text-296">Justice Through Code</a>, a semester-long coding and interpersonal skills intensive that takes place at Columbia University, aims to provide alternative paths for people once they reenter society.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, students learn the fundamentals of Python and other computer science basics. They also receive career coaching, public speaking training, and learn negotiation skills and how to write a resume. Once students complete the program, Justice Through Code, which held its first cohort last year with just over 30 students, puts them in touch with its partners for paid internships and jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the students in the first cohort who were interested in finding jobs or internships after the program, more than 80% of them were placed in relevant roles within six months, Justice Through Code founder Aedan Macdonald told TechCrunch. Antwan (pictured above) is one of the graduates who secured an internship after the program. Antwan has been interning full time at Columbia in the school&#8217;s IT department since December.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just amazing that within one year of me coming across that flyer [for Justice Through Code] on Facebook, I&#8217;m actually working an internship at Columbia,&#8221; Antwan told TechCrunch. &#8220;And it&#8217;s just been tremendous. I mean, it&#8217;s been nonstop learning every single day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before that, Antwan spent time at Emergent Works.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really gave me my first opportunity of using the theory that I learned in the program in a work setting,&#8221; Antwan said.</p>
<p>Justice Through Code works with a handful of tech partners to support its program and its students. Amazon Web Services, for example, provides laptops to students who need them while technologists from Google, Slack and Coursera speak to students on their experiences in tech.</p>
<p>AWS has yet to hire folks from the program but an AWS spokesperson says the company is excited to present opportunities to graduates.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely our intention to hire individuals from this program,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Justice Through Code is now <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ6E-pW1xOeO6ud-_td8Hx_2n7PfVmbFVVa-Nj1pGIh9B1qQ/viewform?usp=send_form">accepting applications</a> for its third cohort, which Macdonald says he hopes will have a class size of up to 60 people. While Justice Through Code does not require applicants to have any prior coding experience, the program does want participants to be comfortable using computers. The application process also seeks to determine how well someone may be equipped to deal with the frustrations that come with learning how to code.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much of learning how to code is being in a kind of state where you don&#8217;t know everything,&#8221; Macdonald said. &#8220;And it can be highly frustrating. And so I think seeing how the process of how people work through problems [is beneficial]. We do a couple logic problems in the interview, and it&#8217;s really not a matter of does somebody have the answer to this, but we actually have questions in pairs. So if somebody struggles on one question, we&#8217;ll go through in detail how to solve that and then see what their process is of applying that same principle of logic to the subsequent question that utilizes the same principle. So … how people are responding in a learning environment, as well as kind of curiosity about the the industry and just a real drive to succeed if they&#8217;re selected to participate in the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justice Through Code is not the only program that serves folks impacted by the criminal justice system. The Last Mile teaches folks business and coding skills while incarcerated, and similarly has partnerships in place with tech companies to help returned citizens find jobs.</p>

<p>Macdonald, who himself spent time in prison, says he hopes Justice Through Code can help to shift &#8220;the negative stereotypes of the formerly incarcerated as not having any future beyond a minimum wage job.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reddit has published its transparency report for 2020, showing various numbers relating to removed content, government requests and other administrative actions. The largest problem by far — in terms of volume, anyway — is spam, which made up nearly all content taken down. Legal requests for content takedown and user information were far fewer, but not trivial, in number.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2020-1">The full report</a> is quite readable, but a bit long; the main points to understand are summarized below.</p>
<p>Of nearly 3.4 billion pieces of content created on Reddit (which is to say posts, comments, hosted images, etc.), 233 million were removed. These numbers are both up by 20%-30% from 2019. Of those 233 million, 131 million were &#8220;proactive&#8221; removals by the AutoMod system and 13.6 million were removed after user reports by subreddit moderators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The remaining 85 million were taken down by Reddit admins; 99.76% of these were spam or &#8220;content manipulation&#8221; like brigading and astroturfing, with around 50,000 each of harassment, hate and sexualization of minors, smaller amounts of violent speech, doxing and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113747" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113747" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113747" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png" alt="Chart showing that content removal on reddit was largely spam." width="1024" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png 1176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png?resize=768,341 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png?resize=680,302 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reddit-removals.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>82,858 subreddits were removed, nearly four times more than 2019. The majority of these were for lack of moderation, followed by hate, harassment and ban evasion (e.g., r/bannedsub starts r/bannedsub2).</p>
<p>When it came to removing comments, hate, violence and harassment were much more prevalent. And 92% of private messages removed (of about 25,000 total) were for harassment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8OqQehIeWl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/reddit-donaldtrump-ban-capitol/">Reddit bans r/donaldtrump following violence at the US Capitol</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Reddit bans r/donaldtrump following violence at the US Capitol&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/reddit-donaldtrump-ban-capitol/embed/#?secret=8OqQehIeWl" data-secret="8OqQehIeWl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Outside of spam and content manipulation, hate speech resulted in far more bans than any other infraction; more accounts were permanently banned for hate in 2020 than for all causes combined in 2019. (But far fewer for content violations than for spam and ban evasion.)</p>
<p>Government requests to remove content were relatively few. Overall Reddit received a couple hundred requests covering about 5,000 pieces of content or subreddits. For example, 753 subreddits had their access restricted to Pakistani users due to anti-obscenity laws there.</p>
<p>Requests from individuals or companies to remove things numbered in the hundreds, and copyright takedown notices asked for about half a million pieces of content to be removed (375,774 were), more than twice 2019&#8217;s. Only a handful of DMCA counter-notices were received.</p>
<p>Law enforcement came to Reddit 611 times for user information, up 50% from last year, and the company granted 424 of those requests. These are mostly subpoenas, court orders and search warrants. Since Reddit isn&#8217;t really a social network and accounts can be essentially anonymous or throwaway, it&#8217;s hard to say what level of disclosure this actually represents. Emergency disclosure requests numbered about 300 and were mostly complied with — these are supposedly life-or-death situations in which a Reddit account is concerned.</p>
<p>Lastly Reddit received somewhere between 0 and 249 secret requests for data, targeting somewhere between 0 and 249 users, same as last year. Sadly, federal law prohibits them from saying any more than this regarding FISA orders and National Security Letters.</p>
<p>Overall the picture painted of Reddit in 2020 is of a growing community plagued by spam and inauthentic activity, plus a significant and growing contingent of hate, harassment and other prohibited content (though last year was surely an exceptional one for this). Lacking much fundamental access to or use of personally identifiable data, Reddit isn&#8217;t much of a target for three-letter agencies and law enforcement. And with &#8220;free speech&#8221;-focused alternatives to Reddit and other platforms popping up, it&#8217;s likely that the hate and harassment that were deplatformed will roost elsewhere in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. We’ll discuss how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> on March 3.</p>
<p>Join us for a wide-ranging discussion with Rashad Robinson, Jesse Lehrich and Naj Austin that explores what needs to change to make social networks more just, healthy environments rather than dangerous echo chambers that amplify society&#8217;s ills.</p>
<p>Naj Austin is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somewhere Good</a> and <a href="https://www.ethelsclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethel&#8217;s Club</a>. She has spent her career building digital and physical products that make the world a more intersectional and equitable space. She was named one of Inc. magazine&#8217;s 100 Female Founders transforming America, a HuffPost Culture Shifter of 2020 and Time Out New York&#8217;s 2020 list of women making NYC better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jesse Lehrich is a co-founder of <a href="https://accountabletech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accountable Tech</a>. He has a decade of experience in political communications and issue advocacy, including serving as the foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, where he was part of the team managing the response to Russia’s information warfare operation.</p>
<p>Rashad Robinson is the president of <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color Of Change</a>, a leading racial justice organization driven by more than 7.2 million members who are building power for Black communities. Color Of Change uses innovative strategies to bring about systemic change in the industries that affect Black people’s lives: Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Hollywood, Washington, corporate board rooms, local prosecutor offices, state capitol buildings and city halls around the country.</p>
<p>Under Rashad’s leadership, Color Of Change designs and implements winning strategies for racial justice, among them: forcing corporations to stop supporting Trump initiatives and white nationalists; framing net neutrality as a civil rights issue; holding local prosecutors accountable to end mass incarceration, police violence and financial exploitation across the justice system; forcing over 100 corporations to abandon ALEC, the secretive right-wing policy shop; changing representations of race and racism in Hollywood; moving Airbnb, Google and Facebook to implement anti-racist initiatives; and forcing Bill O’Reilly off the air.</p>
<p>Be sure to join us for this conversation and much more at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> on March 3.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reentering society after having been incarcerated by the criminal justice system can be daunting. Advances in technology and the continued, unchecked march of capitalism place obstacles in paths that can generally be difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>Fortunately for these returning citizens there are a variety of programs and resources designed to help get them up to speed. One such organization, <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile,</a> aims to help incarcerated folks learn skills so that they have a shot to get jobs after they reenter society. Some companies, like Slack, have committed to hiring returned citizens.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> on March 3, we’ll examine the importance of opportunities for returning citizens upon release from incarceration with a panel of people working in this important transition space. Joining us for the virtual discussion will be Aly Tamboura, strategic advisor at the newly formed <a href="https://justiceacceleratorfund.org/">Justice Accelerator Fund</a>; Jason Jones, remote instruction manager for The Last Mile; and Deepti Rohatgi, head of <a href="https://slack.com/about/slack-for-good">Slack for Good</a> and Public Affairs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aly Tamboura graduated from The Last Mile program while at San Quentin. Until recently, Tamboura was a manager in the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/justice-opportunity/criminal-justice-reform/">Criminal Justice Reform Program</a> at the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a>, where he helped to guide the organization toward one of its stated goals, to reform the American criminal justice system. Just last week, the Justice Accelerator Fund <a href="https://justiceacceleratorfund.org/news/">announced</a> that Tamboura joined the grant-making organization as its first strategic advisor. Tamboura will work alongside Founder and Executive Director Ana Zamora to &#8220;operationalize the fund and launch its first grant-making strategy later this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jason Jones also graduated from The Last Mile in 2018. Upon his release from San Quentin, he joined the organization as its remote instruction manager. He is a web developer and volunteers at West Oakland’s McClymonds High School teaching coding.</p>
<p>Slack decided to build its own take on programs like The Last Mile with <a href="https://www.nextchapterproject.org/about/">Next Chapter</a>, which helps train up formerly incarcerated individuals for jobs in tech and has hired a few itself. Deepti Rohatgi leads Slack for Good, which developed the program, though other companies have signed on to give it a try.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">Join us on March 3 at TC Sessions: Justice</a> to hear from Tamboura, Jones and Rohatgi about how the ability to start from a place of strength can help set folks up for success, as well as what the tech industry can do to help foster this environment. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">You can get your $5 ticket here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp</a>, a startup that uses machine learning to remove background noise from audio in real time, has raised $9M as an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/krisp-snags-5m-a-round-as-demand-grows-for-its-voice-isolating-algorithm/">$5M A round announced last summer</a>. The extra money followed big traction in 2020 for the Armenian company, which grew its customers and revenue by more than an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/krisp-reduces-noise-on-calls-using-machine-learning-and-its-coming-to-windows-soon/">first covered Krisp</a> when it was just emerging from UC Berkeley&#8217;s Skydeck accelerator, and co-founder Davit Baghdasaryan was relatively freshly out of his previous role at Twilio. The company&#8217;s pitch when I chatted with them in the shared office back then was simple and remains the core of what they offer: isolation of the human voice from any background noise (including other voices) so that audio contains only the former.</p>
<p>It probably comes as no surprise, then, that the company appears to have benefited immensely from the shift to virtual meetings and other trends accelerated by the pandemic. To be specific, Baghdasaryan told me that 2020 brought the company a 20x increase in active users, a 23x increase in enterprise accounts and 13x improvement of annual recurring revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rise in virtual meetings — often in noisy places like, you know, homes — has led to significant uptake across multiple industries. Krisp now has more than 1,200 enterprise customers, Baghdasaryan said: banks, HR platforms, law firms, call centers — anyone who benefits from having a clear voice on the line (&#8220;I guess any company qualifies,&#8221; he added). Enterprise-oriented controls like provisioning and central administration have been added to make it easier to integrate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113198" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113198" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113198" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png" alt="Illustration of six people using a video chat app." width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png 1723w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113198" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Krisp</p></div></p>
<p>B2B revenue recently eclipsed B2C; the latter was likely popularized by Krisp&#8217;s inclusion as an option in popular gaming (and increasingly beyond) chat app Discord, though of course users of a free app being given a bonus product for free aren&#8217;t always big converters to &#8220;pro&#8221; tiers of a product.</p>
<p>But the company hasn&#8217;t been standing still, either. While it began with a simple feature set (turning background noise on and off, basically) Krisp has made many upgrades to both its product and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Noise cancellation for high-fidelity voice channels makes the software useful for podcasters and streamers, and acoustic correction (removing room echos) simplifies those setups quite a bit as well. Considering the amount of people doing this and the fact that they&#8217;re often willing to pay, this could be a significant source of income.</p>
<p>The company plans to add cross-service call recording and analysis; since it sits between the system&#8217;s sound drivers and the application, Krisp can easily save the audio and other useful metadata (How often did person A talk versus person B? What office locations are noisiest?). And the addition of voice cancellation — other people&#8217;s voices, that is — could be a huge benefit for people who work, or anticipate returning to work, in crowded offices and call centers.</p>
<p>Part of Krisp&#8217;s allure is the ability to run locally and securely on many platforms with very low overhead. But companies with machine learning-based products can stagnate quickly if they don&#8217;t improve their infrastructure or build more efficient training flows — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/">Lengoo</a>, for instance, is taking on giants in the translation industry with better training as more or less its main advantage.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aiYmh1bJvl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/">With AI translation service that rivals professionals, Lengoo attracts new $20M round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With AI translation service that rivals professionals, Lengoo attracts new $20M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/embed/#?secret=aiYmh1bJvl" data-secret="aiYmh1bJvl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Krisp has been optimizing and reoptimizing its algorithms to run efficiently on both Intel and ARM architectures, and decided to roll out its own servers for training its models instead of renting from the usual suspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS, Azure and Google Cloud turned out to be too expensive,&#8221; Baghdasaryan said. &#8220;We have invested in building a data center with Nvidia&#8217;s latest A100s in them. This will make our experimentation faster, which is crucial for ML companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baghdasaryan was also emphatic in his satisfaction with the team in Armenia, where he and his co-founder Arto Minasyan are from, and where the company has focused its hiring, including the 25-strong research team. &#8220;By the end of 2021 it will be a 45-member team, all in Armenia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are super happy with the math, physics and engineering talent pool there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding amounts to $14 million if you combine the two disparate parts of the A round, the latter of which was agreed to just three months after the first. That&#8217;s a lot of money, of course, but may seem relatively modest for a company with a thousand enterprise customers and revenue growing by more than 2,000% year over year.</p>
<p>Baghdasaryan said they just weren&#8217;t ready to take on a whole B round, with all that involves. They do plan a new fundraise later this year when they&#8217;ve reached $15 million ARR, a goal that seems perfectly reasonable given their current charts.</p>
<p>Of course startups with this kind of growth tend to get snapped up by larger concerns, but despite a few offers Baghdasaryan says he&#8217;s in it for the long haul — and a multibillion dollar market.</p>
<p>The rush to embrace the new virtual work economy may have spurred Krisp&#8217;s growth spurt, but it&#8217;s clear that neither the company nor the environment that let it thrive are going anywhere.</p>

Initially started to address the nearly <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/04/08/468302/excess-administrative-costs-burden-u-s-health-care-system/">$250 billion annual administrative costs in healthcare</a>, Notable Health launched in 2017 to use automation to replace time-consuming and repetitive simple tasks in health industry admin. In early January of this year, they announced plans to use that technology as a way to help manage vaccine distribution.</p>
<p>“As a physician, I saw firsthand that with any patient encounter, there are 90 steps or touch points that need to occur,” said Notable Health Medical Director Muthu Alagappan in an interview. “It’s our hypothesis that the vast majority of those points can be automated.”</p>
<p>Notable Health’s core technology is a platform that uses robotic process automation (RPA), natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to find eligible patients for the COVID-19 vaccine. Combined with data provided by hospital systems’ electronic health records, the platform helps those qualified to receive the vaccine set up appointments and guides them to other relevant educational resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By leveraging intelligent automation to identify, outreach, educate and triage patients, health systems can develop efficient and equitable vaccine distribution workflows,” said Notable Health strategic advisor and Biden Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board Member Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/notable-health-first-to-launch-automated-identification-and-engagement-of-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine-301208397.html?tc=eml_cleartime">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Making vaccine appointments has been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/covid-vaccines-all-i-did-was-cry-elderly-americans-struggle-to-set-up-covid-vaccine-shots-.html">especially difficult for older Americans</a>, many of whom have reportedly struggled with navigating scheduling websites. Alagappan sees that as a design problem. “Technology often gets a bad reputation, because it’s hampered by the many bad technology experiences that are out there,” he said.</p>

<p>Instead, he thinks Notable Health has kept the user in mind through a more simplified approach, asking users only for basic and easy-to-remember information through a text message link. “It’s that emphasis on user-centric design that I think has allowed us to still have really good engagement rates even with older populations,” he said.</p>
<p>While the startup’s platform will likely help hospitals and health systems develop a more efficient approach to vaccinations, its use of RPA and NLP holds promise for future optimization in healthcare. Leaders of similar technology in other industries have already gone on to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">multibillion dollar valuations</a> and continue to attract investors’ interest.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325854/">expected to grow in healthcare over the next several years</a>, but Alagappan argues that combining that with other, more readily available intelligent technologies is also an important step toward improved care. “When we say intelligent automation, we’re really referring to the marriage of two concepts: artificial intelligence — which is knowing what to do — and robotic process automation — which is knowing how to do it,” he said. That dual approach is what he says allows Notable Health to bypass administrative bottlenecks in healthcare, instructing bots to carry out those tasks in an efficient and adaptable way.</p>
<p>So far, Notable Health has worked with several hospital systems across multiple states in using their platform for vaccine distribution and scheduling, and are now using the platform to reach out to tens of thousands of patients per day.</p>
