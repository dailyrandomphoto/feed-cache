		Jonathan Trull is the SVP of customer solutions, architecture and engineering at <a href="https://www.qualys.com/">Qualys</a>, where he brings over 18 years' experience in cybersecurity, including leadership roles across industry, academia, the U.S. Navy Reserves and as the CISO for the state of Colorado, Optiv and Qualys.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline, MSFT Exchange — these names have become synonymous with infamous cybersecurity events. We keep calling every new zero-day exploit a “wake up call,” but all we have been doing is collectively hitting the snooze button.</p>
<p>But the discovery of the newest widespread critical vulnerability, Log4Shell, ruined the industry’s holiday season. It&#8217;s the biggest cybersecurity threat to emerge in years, thanks to the near ubiquity of Java in web applications and the popularity of the Log4j library. Due to its unprecedented scale, compounded by the fact that it is not easy to find, getting rid of this bug from your IT environment isn’t a “one and done” activity.</p>
<p>Security teams across the globe are once again racing to remediate a software flaw, even as attackers have begun targeting the low-hanging fruit — public web servers — at a recently reported rate of <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/11/protecting-against-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2-versions-2-14-1/">100 attempts per minute</a>. A mere seven days after its discovery, <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/11/protecting-against-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2-versions-2-14-1/">more than 1.8 million attacks</a> had been detected against half of all corporate networks.</p>
<p>Are you awake now?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve participated in many urgent Log4Shell briefings with Qualys customers (who include 19,000+ enterprises worldwide, 64% of Forbes Global 100), and it’s clear that dealing with a constant barrage of zero-day vulnerabilities is one of the greatest challenges faced by today’s security teams.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Just like inventorying, gathering and analyzing threat intelligence is crucial to provide the necessary foundation for security teams to take calculated and intentional steps.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming to prioritize fixes and patches when responding to a zero-day exploit like Log4Shell. Here are a few steps to respond to security threats that we have learned and cataloged over the years:</p>
<h2>Establish a standard operating procedure</h2>
<p>Create a detailed standard operating procedure that includes step-by-step activities tailored to the vulnerability type.</p>
<p>For a zero-day response, the following information must be included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process flow for responses. If you need help, the U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has created an <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Federal_Government_Cybersecurity_Incident_and_Vulnerability_Response_Playbooks_508C.pdf">excellent guide</a>.</li>
<li>Categorize the vulnerability by the type, severity and required response times. There should be a specific category for critical zero-day vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Pre-determined service-level agreements for each response team.</li>
<li>Procedure for declaring and communicating an incident (this could be a reference to the incident response standard operating procedure).</li>
<li>Steps for tracking, reporting, and concluding the incident and returning to normal operations.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we have started to see the light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel, food delivery has shaped up to continue to be a major business. In England, for example, some 76% of people order at least one takeaway a week, whereas it was 60% pre-pandemic. Now, a startup called <a href="https://www.deliverect.com/us-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverect</a> that has built a platform to integrate the many moving parts that go into ordering and delivery for the average restaurant is announcing a big round of funding to pursue the opportunity. The startup has raised $150 million, a Series D round of funding that values the company at over $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Coatue Management and Alkeon Capital Management are leading the round, with OMERS Ventures, DST Global, Redpoint Ventures, Newion and Smartfin also participating. The round comes less than a year after its previous round &#8212; a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deliverect-gobbles-up-65m-for-a-platform-that-streamlines-online-and-offline-food-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $65 million Series C</a> that it raised last April.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time that Deliverect is disclosing its valuation but the company has grown at a pretty torrid rate since that last round. It now has its software in use in 20,000 locations across 40 markets, with the number of locations doubling in less than a year. It has also tripled its year-on-year growth (and CEO Zhong Xu, who co-founded the company with Jan Hollez (CTO), Jelte Vrijhoef (CIO) and Jerome Laredo (CRO) said in an interview that in fact the valuation has also roughly tripled since then). It&#8217;s fast heading to processing some 100 million orders globally, he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company plans to use the funding to hire more people, and to build out more functionality on its platform, including an app store to make it easier to integrate more companies as and when they are used by one of their customers. Today it&#8217;s biggest market is Europe, but it&#8217;s growing the fastest in North America, so it will also be investing to continue expanding there. (Xu actually called me from a plane about to take off to New York.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One thing that Deliverect sees is that demand for its services is definitely not slowing down. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are preparing for the age after Covid,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;We are preparing to scale to meet all of the digital opportunities in the food hospitality industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The business started in 2018 with serving independent restaurants &#8212; born, as we recounted previously, in Ghent, Belgium, out of Xu&#8217;s experience with his father, who had started a business selling point of sale systems to Chinese restaurants after immigrating to the country from China; Xu saw the fragmentation in the business and struck out on his own to fix that gap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the years since, Deliverect has moved into also work with large chains like Pret A Manger, Taco Bell and many others. Today Deliverect&#8217;s business is split roughly 50-50 between the two categories.</p>
<p>In either case, the challenge is the same: restaurants and others in the food industry typically work with a number of suppliers and need better ways to organize that into a single platform.</p>
<p>For restaurants, it might be several ordering and delivery systems that come into a kitchen that send in orders to be filled.</p>
<p>For delivery services, it might be a number of restaurants that it needs to organize for drivers.</p>
<p>Consumer packaged goods companies, a newer category of customers for Deliverect (Unilever is one such customer today), might be working directly with grocery delivery companies to supply them and thus may need their own platforms to manage how much, where and when to send of a specific product.</p>
<p>The opportunity that the company has addressed is that while a number of aggregating platforms have emerged for other parts of the hospitality industry &#8212; Booking.com, for example, for travel &#8212; restaurants and food in general had yet to be addressed.</p>
<p class="p4">&#8220;Food is the last frontier,&#8221; Xu said. &#8220;If there were no pandemic things would have moved quite slowly because the infrastructure for a restaurant is very fragmented. We’re allowing for a new age of digital solutions and we are building a new system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pret A Manger is an apt example of how Deliverect is expanding its business with customers: initially helping with deliveries, it is now also powering the company&#8217;s order management in store, too.</p>
<p>The fact that the pandemic has pushed along the growth of Deliverect in the market has also worked in the reverse, it seems.</p>
<p>Hollez recounted how one restaurant was so grateful for getting through the pandemic, crediting Deliverect for its success in handling orders for delivery, that the proprietor bought the company&#8217;s team dinner one night. &#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">his is why we do it,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Deliverect says that longer term, it might potentially consider an IPO, but that is not something on the cards at the moment. It does see an opportunity to make acquisitions selectively to add more tech and talent into the mix.</p>
<p>One area where it&#8217;s less concerned is in the area of competition, say from a point of sale provider who might want to own the bigger experience. Xu describes Deliverect as a &#8220;Switzerland&#8221; that plays nice with everyone, but doesn&#8217;t compete directly with anyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Deliverect is streamlining the on-demand ordering economy with its industry leading, omni-channel platform that connects consumers to leading restaurants and brands,” said Mark McLaughlin, general partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement. “Deliverect’s co-founders – all veterans of next generation commerce – have assembled the strongest team in hospitality to steer Deliverect’s ambitious road map and disruptive technology into new markets and use cases.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The multi-billion dollar market for restaurant-side technology is being fueled by multiple tailwinds including a change in consumer habits related to the ongoing pandemic, the need to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of delivery networks, and shifts in foodservice retail such as dark kitchens and virtual restaurant brands,&#8221; added Sebastian Duesterhoeft, a general partner at Coatue. “We believe Deliverect is capitalizing on these trends with its goal to become a category leader with a mission to empower restaurants globally. We are thrilled to partner with Zhong and the team.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the Winter Games in Beijing on the horizon, NBCUniversal will team up with TikTok for an advertising partnership to promote the network&#8217;s coverage of the Olympics. NBCUniversal told TechCrunch that its advertising partners will be the first brands to pilot a new, creative ad experience on TikTok.</p>
<p>TikTok and NBCUniversal did not elaborate on how these ads will be different from existing ones, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/nbcuniversal-checkout/">both companies</a> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">explored social shopping</a> as of late, which could be a potential avenue for their partnership. NBCUniversal will still work with other social platforms such as Twitter, which will hosts a live show and highlights.</p>
<p>According to NBCUniversal, Olympics-related content has garnered over 18 billion views on TikTok, so the network directly invited TikTok to collaborate on 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics content. This includes daily content across NBC TikTok handles, as well as a three-episode livestream show hosted by a yet-to-be-named TikTok creator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Tokyo 2020 Games highlighted our community&#8217;s appetite for sports-adjacent content that shows a different side of the Games and the athletes, creating new avenues and content strategies for brands &#8212; including NBC &#8212; to engage with and entertain them,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;While this partnership does present unique opportunities for NBCUniversal advertisers, it also includes a robust slate of content that NBC will share across its TikTok accounts, including daily posts showcasing everything from highlights to topical trends, and three livestreams hosted by a TikTok creator. The athletes’ stories and journeys are an integral part of NBC’s coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, so fans can expect to see them on TikTok across their handles.&#8221;</p>
<p>This summer at the Tokyo Games &#8212; which were pushed back a year due to COVID-19 &#8212; TikTok emerged as an unlikely hub for behind-the-scenes content from international athletes. When Suni Lee placed first in the all-around gymnastics competition at the Olympics last summer, how did she celebrate the achievement of a lifetime? She ordered pizza and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sunisalee_/video/6990385652596608262?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en">danced on TikTok</a> with her gold medal, garnering 31 million views. The prevalence of Olympians on TikTok garnered an unlikely audience for the global event. You might not have ordinarily paid attention to Olympic Rugby, but after following athlete <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ilonamaher?lang=en">Ilona Maher</a> on TikTok, maybe you&#8217;d tune in to the NBC broadcast.</p>
<p>In that regard, this partnership makes sense &#8212; TikTok has proven to be a unique way for fans to experience the international competition. But from a tech perspective, NBCUniversal&#8217;s TikTok partnership raises some questions. Headquartered in China, Bytedance is the parent company of TikTok, but TikTok is not available in China (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/short-video-search-douyin-tiktok/">Douyin</a> is Bytedance&#8217;s China-specific version of the app). Typically, people in China wouldn&#8217;t be able to use TikTok due to internet censorship in the country. But Olympic athletes and foreign media in Beijing are <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-crack-open-great-firewall-for-winter-olympic-athletes-/6356402.html">allegedly</a> being granted special SIM cards that offer uncensored internet access. Even if athletes have access to social media, they may not be posting carefree videos &#8212; the United States Olympic organizing committee <a href="https://www.axios.com/beijing-china-olympics-internet-censorship-35e1cd8e-0af4-4175-825b-19ee68fd8e34.html">warned athletes</a> to assume that &#8220;personal communications will be difficult at best while operating in China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diplomatic-boycott-olympics.html">diplomatic</a> <a href="https://time.com/6129154/beijing-olympics-boycott/">boycotts</a> of the games in Beijing, protesting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/diplomatic-boycott-olympics.html">human rights abuses</a> against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities like the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region of China. After urging from human rights groups, NBCUniversal has said it will provide &#8220;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/nbcuniversal-says-will-cover-geopolitical-issues-during-beijing-olympics-2022-01-19/">geopolitical context</a>&#8221; during its broadcast of the controversial Games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German publishers are the latest to band together to try to derail or at least delay Google&#8217;s &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan to end support for tracking cookies in Chrome via a complaint to the European Commission.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eccf5514-8b83-4d85-8305-f882adf5dac3">Financial Times</a> reports that hundreds of German publishers, advertisers and media and industry groups &#8212; including local powerhouse Axel Springer (which publishes titles like Bild and Politico) &#8212; have submitted a complaint to the bloc’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, arguing that Google&#8217;s plan to phase out support for third party cookies from its Chrome browser and replace tracking infrastructure with alternative (and it claims) more privacy-respecting alternatives for ad targeting breaches EU competition law.</p>
<p>This is not a novel argument. The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog, the CMA, has been considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">similar complaints since 2020</a> &#8212; and is in the process of consulting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">a series of behavioral and oper</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">ational commitments</a> offered by Google in a bid to avoid a full ban on the migration in that market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261149" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indeed, the regulatory attention to Privacy Sandbox has already contributed to delay the implementation timeline by up to a year, as Google said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">last summer</a> that the switch would not now happen until the second half of 2023 vs an earlier announcement, in January 2020, when it said it wanted to make the shift &#8220;within two years&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vZF5pwxgVs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">Google agrees with UK&#8217;s CMA to deeper oversight of Privacy Sandbox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google agrees with UK&#8217;s CMA to deeper oversight of Privacy Sandbox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/embed/#?secret=vZF5pwxgVs" data-secret="vZF5pwxgVs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the UK is no longer in the EU, Google has said that if the country&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority accepts its Privacy Sandbox commitments it will apply them globally &#8212; meaning they would also apply in and be relevant for the EU (which is not the same as saying they would be automatically acceptable to the bloc&#8217;s own regulators, however).</p>
<p>German publishers and advertisers don&#8217;t seem impressed by Google&#8217;s offer, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At least not judging by the 108-page complaint reviewed by the FT &#8212; in which it reports that Axel Springer, along with the country&#8217;s federal association of digital publishers and a number of others argue the planned changes will damage their businesses while allowing Google&#8217;s ads-based search business unaffected as it will collect to be able to collect vast amounts of user data.</p>
<p>Per the FT&#8217;s report of the document, the companies argue they must be allowed to continue to ask users for consent to process their data for ad targeting &#8220;without Google capturing this decision&#8221;; as well as urging that &#8220;Google must respect the relationship between publishers and users without interfering&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the report of the complaint, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People want a more private, secure web and we&#8217;ve proposed ideas to help build it with new digital advertising tools to protect privacy and prevent covert tracking, while supporting a thriving ad-funded open web.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In further background remarks, the tech giant argued that web users&#8217; expectations and regulations are both changing so there&#8217;s a need for adtech infrastructure to adapt.</p>
<p>It also pointed out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/mozilla-flips-the-default-switch-on-firefox-tracking-cookie-blocking/">other browsers</a> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/apple-defends-new-ad-tracking-prevention-measures-in-safari/">already withdrawn support</a> for tracking cookies. (Albeit, Google&#8217;s market power here, via Chrome, is far more substantial than alternative browsers like Firefox and Safari.)</p>
<p>The tech giant also claimed its Privacy Sandbox proposal are being designed in the open &#8212; in consultation with a cross-section of the web community, including publishers.</p>
<p>Although, here again, there&#8217;s no doubt Google remains in the driving seat, directing and steering these proposals (and what &#8216;consultation&#8217; there is and has been to date, certainly does not sum to co-design, let alone Google taking a more minor role in shaping the future).</p>
<p>Moreover, a perceived lack of transparency/openness in Google&#8217;s approach has also led the company to dial up the commitments it has offered the UK competition regulator on Sandbox &#8212; such as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/"> around testing</a> and taking market feedback &#8212; which suggests, contrary to Google&#8217;s background claims, that a <em>lack</em> of openness is a particular bone of contention for advertisers and publishers (at least in the UK market).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google won&#8217;t end support for tracking cookies unless UK&#8217;s competition watchdog agrees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/embed/#?secret=9NV0ey7Ocq" data-secret="9NV0ey7Ocq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In Germany, Google/Alphabet currently has two open antitrust investigations against it by the country&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (FCO): One focused on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">News Showcase product</a>; and another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">digging into its data terms</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">earlier this month</a> the German regular found Mountain View meets the threshold for ex ante regulatory interventions to be applicable &#8212; which quickly led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/google-news-showcase-fco-offers/">an offer from Google to try to settle the News Showcase complaint</a>. So it&#8217;s interesting to speculate whether the FCO has received a copy of the German publishers complaint against Privacy Sandbox.</p>
<p>If so &#8212; and if the FCO agrees there&#8217;s a problem &#8212; that would offer (very likely) the swiftest option for local behavioral relief, given Germany is ahead of other European countries (and the Commission) in updating its domestic competition rules with an eye on curbing tech giants&#8217; market power. (The UK, for example, intends to bring in a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; reform to tackle Big Tech&#8217;s market power too, but has yet to legislate, meaning the CMA is limited to its existing regulatory toolbox.)</p>
<p>However a spokeswoman for the FCO declined to confirm whether/if the regulator has received a Privacy Sandbox complaint from German publishers &#8212; saying only: &#8220;We don’t communicate about possible complaints we have received.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Commission spokeswoman also declined to comment on the FT&#8217;s report and any potential impacts the complaint could have on its own ongoing investigation of Google&#8217;s adtech practices.</p>
<p>The Commission has hit Google with a series of enforcements under Vestager&#8217;s tenure at the competition unit.</p>
<p>But it was not until<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/"> last summer</a> that Vestager finally turned her attention to Google&#8217;s adtech practices &#8212; saying then that the unit would examine whether Google is distorting competition by restricting access by third parties to user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use.</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the investigation do explicitly refer to Privacy Sandbox &#8212; with the Commission saying it would look at the plan to replace third party ‘cookies’ on Chrome with a stack of alternatives ( including considering &#8220;the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets&#8221;).</p>
<p>The EU probe also covers scrutiny of a Google plan to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android devices when a user opts out of personalised advertising to similarly assess the wider ad market effects, among other areas of investigation.</p>
<p>On this, the Commission spokeswomen told us: &#8220;<span lang="EN-IE">As part of its in-depth investigation, the Commission is examining, among others,</span><span lang="EN-IE"> </span><span lang="EN-IE">Google&#8217;s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third party ‘cookies&#8217; on Chrome and replace them with the “Privacy Sandbox” set of tools, including the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;This investigation is ongoing,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s own set of ex ante rules for tech giants &#8212; aka, the Digital Markets Act &#8212; is currently making its way through the bloc&#8217;s co-legislative process. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">MEPs recently voted to beef up restrictions</a> on gatekeepers&#8217; ability to track Internet users for ad targeting. Although the full detail of the future pan-EU law has yet to be hammered out.</p>
<p>So, whether or not Google gets its way with Privacy Sandbox, it&#8217;s clear adtech is facing substantial regional pressure to reform.</p>
<p>The outgoing UK information commissioner warned the industry <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">last fall</a> it&#8217;s past time for a big reset, emphasizing the need to move away from current methods of online tracking and profiling, and bake in data protection and privacy from the start.</p>
<p>The German publishers&#8217; apparent focus on maintaining the ability to ask users for consent to track looks, well, interesting in light of long-standing G<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DPR complaints against current &#8216;consent request&#8217; methods. (Also last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">November</a> the ad industry body, the IAB Europe, warned it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of the pan-EU regulation &#8212; along with its industry standard Transparency and Consent Framework, which is used by scores of websites to gather consent for ad targeting.)</span></p>
<p>One thing is clear: There won&#8217;t be a sticking plaster fix for <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">systematic, high velocity trading of web users&#8217; personal data for ad targeting purposes &#8212; a meaningful alternative will be required to pass muster under robust EU privacy laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether this alternative gets designed by Google &#8212; or by the wider adtech and publishing industry engaging in good faith with privacy concerns &#8212; is a whole other question. And, well, so far Google does rather look streaks ahead in this regard&#8230; </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher said he was able to remotely access dozens of Teslas around the world because security bugs found in an open-source logging tool popular with Tesla owners exposed their cars directly to the internet.</p>
<p>News of the vulnerability was first revealed earlier this month <a href="https://twitter.com/david_colombo_/status/1480632304045330433?s=20">in a tweet</a> by David Colombo, a security researcher in Germany, who said he had &#8220;full remote control&#8221; of more than 25 Teslas, but was struggling to disclose the issue to affected Tesla owners without making the details public and also alerting malicious hackers.</p>
<p>The bug is now fixed, Colombo confirmed. TechCrunch held this story until the vulnerability could no longer be exploited. Colombo published his findings in <a href="https://medium.com/@david_colombo/how-i-got-access-to-25-teslas-around-the-world-by-accident-and-curiosity-8b9ef040a028">a blog post</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2257615" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Colombo told TechCrunch that the vulnerabilities were found in TeslaMate, a <a href="https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-download logging software</a> used by Tesla owners to connect to their vehicles and access their cars&#8217; otherwise hidden data — their car&#8217;s energy consumption, location history, driving statistics, and other granular data for troubleshooting and diagnosing problems. TeslaMate is a self-hosted web dashboard often running on the home computers of Tesla hobbyists, and relies on access to Tesla&#8217;s API to tap into their car&#8217;s data, which is tied to the car owner&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>But security flaws in the web dashboard — like allowing anonymous access and using default passwords that some users never changed — coupled with misconfigurations by some Tesla owners resulted in at least a hundred TeslaMate dashboards being exposed directly to the internet, including the car owner&#8217;s API key used to remotely control their Teslas.</p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch, Colombo said the number of impacted Teslas is likely higher.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2257629" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2257629" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2257629 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png" alt="" width="900" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tesla-map.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2257629" class="wp-caption-text">One of the exposed TeslaMate dashboards showed one Tesla&#8217;s recent travel routes across California. TeslaMate has since fixed its vulnerabilities and Tesla has revoked thousands of API keys. <strong>Image:</strong> David Colombo (supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>Colombo said he discovered that TeslaMate dashboards were unprotected by default after stumbling on an exposed dashboard last year. After scanning the internet for more open dashboards, he found exposed Teslas in the U.K., Europe, Canada, China, and across the United States.</p>
<p>But contacting individual Tesla owners with exposed dashboards would be a herculean task, Colombo explained, and in many cases, it&#8217;s not possible to accurately discern a way to contact affected Tesla customers.</p>
<p>Worse, it was possible to extract the Tesla users&#8217; API key from the exposed dashboard, allowing a malicious hacker to retain long-term access to Teslas without the drivers&#8217; knowledge. (An API allows two things to talk to each other over the internet — in this case, a Tesla car and company’s servers, the Tesla app or a TeslaMate dashboard.) Access to Tesla&#8217;s API is restricted to Tesla owners through a private API key associated with the owner&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>With access to an exposed API key, Colombo said he could remotely access some features of the car, such as unlocking the doors and windows, honking the horn, and starting keyless driving, which he verified with one Tesla owner in Ireland. He could also access the data inside, such as the car&#8217;s location data, recent driving routes and where it&#8217;s parked. Colombo said he does not believe it&#8217;s possible to use the API access to move the vehicle remotely over the internet.</p>
<p>Colombo said that while the security issues weren&#8217;t in Tesla&#8217;s infrastructure, Tesla could do more to improve its security, such as revoking a customer&#8217;s API key when their password is changed, an industry-standard practice.</p>
<p>After privately reporting the vulnerabilities, TeslaMate <a href="https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate/releases/tag/v1.25.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed a software fix</a> that users have to manually install to prevent access. TeslaMate project maintainer Adrian Kumpf told TechCrunch that the update went out within a few hours of receiving Colombo&#8217;s email. In an email, Kumpf said that since the software is self-hosted, it can&#8217;t protect against users&#8217; accidentally exposing their systems to the internet, adding that TeslaMate&#8217;s documentation has long warned users to install the software &#8220;on your home network, as otherwise your Tesla API tokens might be at risk.&#8221; Kumpf also said that users who chose the advanced installation option should not be affected.</p>
<p>Colombo told TechCrunch that Tesla revoked thousands of drivers&#8217; API keys, potentially indicating that the issue may have been more widespread than initially thought. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment prior to publication. (Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/">scrapped its public relations team</a> in 2020.)</p>

The 4680 cell is said to boost the range of electric vehicles by over 15 percent. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Nikkei</ins></em></a> notes, that could boost the range of the Model S from 650km (404 miles or so) on a single charge to 750km (around 465 miles).</p>
<p>Although the battery is said to be twice as big as previous versions, it has a fivefold increase in energy capacity, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a>. As such, cars need fewer of the batteries, which are already 10 to 20 percent cheaper to produce. It&#8217;s estimated that batteries account for 30 percent of the cost of EVs. A cost reduction could make EVs more affordable and hasten the transition to electric vehicles. What&#8217;s more, a longer range means drivers won&#8217;t need to charge batteries as often.</p>
<p>Panasonic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-sold-tesla-shares-to-raise-cash-for-acquisition-103525121.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><ins>a long-time partner of Tesla,</ins></a> is reportedly investing around 80 billion yen ($704 million) on new equipment to produce the 4680. It&#8217;s said to be expanding an existing plant in Japan and making the batteries there to begin with. <em>Nikkei </em>reports the company will start making the cells on a small scale this year to develop safe and efficient processes before entering mass production in 2023. It may mass produce the batteries in other countries later.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-invest-700-million-produce-new-batteries-evs-nikkei-2022-01-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> that it was setting up a test production line in 2022, though didn&#8217;t say when it will start making the batteries at a larger scale. &#8220;We are studying various options for mass production,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Panasonic started working on the cell following a request from Tesla. The head of Panasonic&#8217;s battery division <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Panasonic-moves-toward-mass-production-of-Tesla-s-next-gen-batteries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">said in November</a> that the company hasn&#8217;t ruled out producing the cell for other automakers, though Tesla is its priority. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously said that although his company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-tesla-developing-own-ev-battery-cells.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><ins>make its own batteries</ins></a>, it would continue to source them from other suppliers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a global competition to build the biggest, most powerful computers on the planet, and Meta (AKA Facebook) is about to jump into the melee with the <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-rsc">&#8220;AI Research SuperCluster,&#8221; or RSC</a>. Once fully operational it may well sit in the top ten fastest supercomputers in the world, which it will use for the massive number crunching needed for language and computer vision modeling.</p>
<p>Large AI models, of which OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 is probably the best known, don&#8217;t get put together on laptops and desktops; they&#8217;re the final product of weeks and months of sustained calculations by high performance computing systems that dwarf even the most cutting-edge gaming rig. And the faster you can complete the training process for a model, the faster you can test it and produce a new and better one. When training times are measured in months, that really matters.</p>
<p>RSC is up and running and the company&#8217;s researchers are already putting it to work&#8230; with user-generated data, it must be said, though Meta was careful to say that it is encrypted until training time and the whole facility is isolated from the wider internet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260829" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The team that put RSC together is rightly proud at having pulled this off almost entirely remotely — supercomputers are surprisingly physical constructions, with base considerations like heat, cabling, and interconnect affecting performance and design. Exabytes of storage sound big enough digitally, but they actually need to exist somewhere too, on site and accessible at a microsecond&#8217;s notice. (Pure Storage is <a href="https://www.purestorage.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/pure-partners-with-meta-on-ai-research-supercluster.html">also proud of the setup they put together for this</a>.)</p>
<p>RSC is currently 760 Nvidia DGX A100 systems with a total 6,080 GPUs, which Meta claims should put it approximately in competition with Perlmutter at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. That&#8217;s the fifth most powerful supercomputer in operation right now, <a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2021/11/">according to longtime ranking site Top 500</a>. (#1 is <a href="https://www.r-ccs.riken.jp/en/">Fugaku</a> in Japan by a long shot, in case you&#8217;re wondering.)</p>
<p>That could change as the company continues building out the system. Ultimately they plan for it to be about three times more powerful, which would in theory put it in the running for third place.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZnykn1tDSE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s arguably a caveat in there. Systems like second-place Summit at Lawrence Livermore National Lab are employed for research purposes where precision is at a premium. If you&#8217;re simulating the molecules in a region the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at unprecedented detail levels, you need to take every calculation out to a whole lot of decimal points. And that means those calculations are more computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Meta explained that AI applications don&#8217;t require a similar degree of precision, since the results don&#8217;t hinge on that thousandth of a percent — inference operations end up producing things like &#8220;90% certainty this is a cat,&#8221; and if that number were 89% or 91% wouldn&#8217;t make a big difference. The difficulty is more about achieving 90% certainty for a million objects or phrases rather than a hundred.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an oversimplification, but the result is that RSC, running TensorFloat-32 math mode, can get more FLOP/s (floating point operations per second) per core than other, more precision-oriented systems. In this case it&#8217;s up to 1,895,000 teraFLOP/s or 1.9 exaFLOP/s, more than 4x Fugaku&#8217;s. Does that matter? And if so, to whom? If anyone, it might matter to the Top 500 folks, so I&#8217;ve asked if they have any input on it. But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that RSC will be among the fastest computers in the world, perhaps the fastest to be operated by a private company for its own purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reviewing repetitive documents is, well, repetitive, but <a href="https://www.tryklarity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klarity</a> believes people don’t have to do all of that and is building an artificial intelligence tool, targeting finance and accounting departments, that turns documents into structured data.</p>
<p>Document automation is not a new concept. There was an original wave of companies working on partial document automation, which still needs a human review, but Ondrej Antos, Klarity’s co-founder and CEO, explained that the full document automation market is still very nascent.</p>
<p>“Partial document automation companies did not achieve much scale due to the limited value of their product,” he said via email. “Full automation has the ability to replace human review for a vast majority of documents — over 85% in Klarity’s case — and with a higher accuracy. This generates a lot of value, not only for large enterprises, but also mid-market companies that have a few hundred documents every month and the market is therefore much larger.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260899" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antos founded Klarity in 2017 with Nischal Nadhamuni whom he met at MIT. They bonded over Antos’ experience of having to review large amounts of data when he was a corporate lawyer. Nadhamuni was studying Natural Language Processing and thought it could be applied to  understand documents better than humans. In August 2020, the product was launched.</p>
<p>Klarity replaces humans for tasks that require large-scale document review, including accounting order forms, purchase orders and agreements. Instead of having many accountants reading thousands of almost identical documents every month to find non-standard language, Klarity does that, helping the accountants save time and avoid mistakes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260904" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260904" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260904" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png" alt="Klarity" width="1024" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png 1590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=1536,918 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Most-Important-Doc-Detail-Screenshot.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260904" class="wp-caption-text">An example of Klarity&#8217;s document automation. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Klarity</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the last nine months, the company saw its annual recurring revenue grow nine times and over 24 times year over year, prompting Klarity to raise new capital to invest in sales and marketing to scale and continue investing in R&amp;D. It is also currently working with more than 40 enterprise and mid-market customers, including Coupa, Optimizely and 8&#215;8.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $18 million in a Series A funding round led by Tola Capital. As part of the investment, Sheila Gulati, founder and managing director of Tola Capital, joins Klarity’s board of directors. To date, Klarity has raised just over $20 million.</p>
<p>New investors also participating in the round are Invus Opportunities and a group of individual investors, including executives from its customers 8&#215;8 and Coupa. Existing investors following on include Elad Gil, Daniel Gross, Nat Friedman and Picus Capital.</p>
<p>The company is focused on hiring sales, marketing and engineering. It has 34 employees, up from 14 a year ago. It is also poised to launch new document review automation use cases for deal desk, renewals and procurement teams in late 2022.</p>
<p>“Today, the vast majority of enterprises don’t even realize there is a technological solution to this omnipresent problem,” Antos said. “We will help to educate the market that there is a technical solution to the age-old problem of document review by accounting teams and to continue building a market-leading product.”</p>

It simply <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/peloton-will-pump-100m-into-delivery-logistics-to-ease-supply-concerns/">couldn’t keep up with demand</a>, one of the better problems to have as a business on the rise. Always leave them wanting more, as P.T. Barnum may or may not have once said.</p>
<p>The connected fitness firm had already developed a kind of cultish following in various upscale circles, well before most of us had an inkling of knowledge about novel coronaviruses. But the pandemic accelerated Peloton’s success beyond what most could have reasonably predicted. Gyms across the world began to shut down, and with everyone stuck inside, home fitness provided a solution. Peloton, offering some extra connectedness in a socially distanced world, was a hit.</p>
<p>Investors bought in, sending Peloton&#8217;s share from around $30 at the start of 2020 to above $160 in the closing days of the year. In 2021, however, things hit the skids, with Peloton falling to around $36 by the end of last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Those declines have continued. Last week, things truly hit the wall at Peloton. A continued erosion in demand as gyms began to reopen has seemingly put the company on red alert. With hundreds of millions spent on manufacturing to meet a spike in demand, Peloton’s top brass appear to have seen the pandemic as less of a one-in-a-100-year-event and more the beginnings of something larger.</p>
<p>Following reports that the company had employed consulting firm McKinsey to facilitate restructuring and layoffs, Peloton lost ground. Further reports &#8212; partially denied by CEO John Foley &#8212; suggested the company was halting production across its line of treadmills and stationary bikes, and were more bad news for the value of the company.</p>
<p>And this morning, Jason Aintabi, the chief investment officer of activist investor Blackwells Capital, issued a letter to Peloton’s directors, calling for Foley’s immediate termination and imploring the board to consider selling Peloton.</p>
<p>Writes Aintabi:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe the pandemic offered Peloton a tremendous and unexpected opportunity to accelerate consumer adoption of its category-defining products and drive performance of the business and value for shareholders. With the stock now trading below the IPO price, and down more than 80% from its high, it is clear that the Company, the executives and the Board have squandered this opportunity.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the Company is on worse footing today than it was prior to the pandemic, with high fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders. And no wonder, the latter, given that Peloton underperformed every other company in the Nasdaq 100 over the last twelve months.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter concludes, “The ride for Mr. Foley is over. This Board must now independently chart a new path for Peloton.”</p>
<p>Blackwells, which acquired a significant stake of less than 5% of the company, per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-investor-to-call-on-peloton-to-fire-its-ceo-11642982211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, cites a laundry list of “leadership failures,” outlining what has been an undeniable roller coaster for Peloton since the pandemic began. Included are: Committing to a 20-year lease on a massive office space in New York City, Foley’s handling of a massive product recall after the death of a young child, promoting his wife to an executive position inside the company and large investments in increased manufacturing capacity, which were ultimately shuttered over decreased demand.</p>
<p>Last week, Foley broke from a pre-earnings “quiet period” to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-ceo-acknowledges-corrective-actions-denies-halting-all-production-of-bikes-and-treadmills/">address some of the reports</a> that have swirled around the company, calling news that it was halting all production false. He did, however, confirm that adjustments to production and headcount were seemingly inevitable.</p>
<p>“In the past, we’ve said layoffs would be the absolute last lever we would ever hope to pull,” the executive wrote. “However, we now need to evaluate our organization structure and size of our team, with the utmost care and compassion. And we are still in the process of considering all options as part of our efforts to make our business more flexible.”</p>
<p>Foley chided press coverage derived from a series of leaks, calling it, “incomplete, out of context, and not reflective of Peloton’s strategy,” and promised to offer more information on the company’s strategy during its February earnings call.</p>
<p>Blackwells, for its part, doesn’t pull any punches in the letter.</p>
<p>“We recognize that Mr. Foley undoubtedly regards Peloton as ‘his’ company and you, the Company’s directors, as ‘his’ Board,” Aintabi writes. “He has outsized influence and outsized voting power by virtue of his status as founder. Perhaps some of you – friends with Mr. Foley for many years – feel obligated to do as he wishes. But the law and equity markets expect more. You are not here to preserve Mr. Foley’s dignity or his pride. Your role, as directors, is not to protect him from embarrassment or to shield him from blame.”</p>
<p>The situation that Peloton finds iteself in is not entirely unique. Other companies that enjoyed huge pandemic-era gains have seen their values fall back to prior levels. Zoom, the video chat service that became ubiquitous during COVID, has given back nearly all of its recent gains. By late March of 2020, Zoom was worth as much as $150 per share, up from the high $60s per share at the start of the year. It rose to around $560 before falling back to $144 or so as of today.</p>
<p>Not all the news is bad. Peloton bottomed-out at $23.25 per share per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PTON/">Yahoo Finance</a>, but has since recovered to more than $27 (at the time of writing). That the company intends to cut costs is welcome news from a financial perspective. And its huge hardware bonanza of the last few years has certainly led to more bikes in the market. Perhaps those new users will hold onto their subscriptions, continuing to pump high-margin software revenues into the company&#8217;s accounts as it looks to trim headcount and other expenses.</p>
<p>But cutting to profitability is not where Peloton likely anticipated to find itself just a few quarters ago.</p>
<p>The company is worth just under $9 billion today. A price at which it is far more acquirable than it was a year ago. The number of companies that could afford to buy Peloton at a single-digit billions price tag is modest; the number of firms that could afford to pay dozens of billions for Peloton was vanishingly slim.</p>
<p>Who is on the list? Apple, perhaps, though today Peloton is an Android hardware shop. Google then? Probably not. Microsoft is out, Amazon won&#8217;t do it, and our list is getting thin. It&#8217;s not a metaverse company, so Meta is a no, and what gym group has the cash to make a buy of Peloton&#8217;s scale? Private equity might be able to juice the company for upside if costs can come down enough, but that feels like a stretch.</p>
<p>Sitting where we are today, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a sale is imminent, given the value retained by Peloton even after its sharp selloff. That means that the company likely has to tune its own engine. Keeping its CEO during that process could prove impossible if investors continue to demand restitution in the form of executive blood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industrial drones &#8212; the enterprise complement to the unmanned aerial vehicles that consumers own for leisurely use &#8212; are taking off in the market, fueled by a <a href="https://t.co/vp0SOMiCEp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new wave</a> of software and hardware technology that improves their battery life, reach and performance, and a growing number of organizations investing in these services to raise their data operations games. Today, a company focused specifically on developing AI for drones for maritime deployments is announcing a round of funding after seeing strong demand for its devices and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tekever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekever</a>, which builds drones with integrated AI specifically tailored for monitoring and detecting activity on water, has raised €20 million (just under $23 million at today&#8217;s rates). Ventura Capital led the round, with participation from Iberis Capital and a number of unnamed strategic investors from the maritime industry. It will be using the funding to hire more people, and to continue building out its technology.</p>
<p>Tekever &#8212; based, fittingly, in historic maritime superpower Lisbon, Portugal &#8212; was founded back in 2001 and has only been offering commercial services since 2018. But it has been profitable for some time now and expects to grow at a CAGR of 60% over the next three years. And indeed, this is the company&#8217;s first outside funding, made to double down on expanding its technology and selling to a wider set of organizations as the business opportunity grows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261093" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tekever&#8217;s customers include governments and their agencies, which use the company&#8217;s services to monitor waters for illegal activity; and private shipping and other seafaring companies, which use the drones to track weather patterns, traffic on the water, and other physical activity that might impact their businesses.</p>
<p>Tekever was started by a team of intelligence and AI specialists, and co-founder and CEO Ricardo Mendes describes it as a vertically integrated business, where it designs and makes both its drones and the technology that is loaded onto them to monitor and &#8220;read&#8221; what is going on in the water below, and even predict what might happen next.</p>
<p>A vertically integrated drone company is not such a rare thing, but what is a little more unusual is the order in which way Tekever built its stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started from the opposite direction of every other company working in the drone sector,&#8221; Mendes joked. The company first set out to build the technology to read its terrain &#8212; in its case, bodies of water &#8212; and then built drones fit for the purpose of making its software work. That included specific antennae, sensors and power integrated into the body of the aircraft themselves. (This also makes it essentially, at this point, impossible for the software to work on other aircraft.) The software, meanwhile, is architected to work using a mix of edge AI, satellite communications and cloud computing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Building your own very specialized drone hardware is hard (and expensive). But that was intentional, it turns out. Tekever sells both components, but most commonly operates its own fleet, and sells drone-based surveillance services, branded Atlas, which Mendes described to me as &#8220;intelligence as a service.&#8221; He said that approach was specifically taken to make its products as widely accessible as possible, since its drones &#8212; with wingspans that start at two meters and can be as wide as eight meters, with flying times as long as 20 hours &#8212; are too cost-prohibitive for anyone but the very biggest customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question we set out to answer was, &#8216;what do you need to do to make this simple and available all over the world, not just to the richest nations?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The drones are just one part of the chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an example of how Tekever is used, both the European Maritime Security Agency (EMSA) and the United Kingdom’s Home Office are customers, but so are smaller African republics. They variously use the technology to monitor their waters for vessels involved in piracy, drugs, human trafficking, migrant smuggling, pollution, illegal fishing or infrastructure security threats.</p>
<p>A recent report in the Guardian laid bare how European government agencies are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/06/fortress-europe-the-millions-spent-on-military-grade-tech-to-deter-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investing millions of euros on drones and other military technology</a> to expand their surveillance of refugee groups, its clear message being that those investments are not deterring illegal migration and are only encouraging vulnerable people to take even more risky routes. Others in the space, like Anduril, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/anduril-funding-series-d-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reaped huge financial rewards</a>, arguably on the back of their own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-10-03/tech-s-most-controversial-startup-now-makes-attack-drones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy</a>. But Tekever&#8217;s CEO and founder believes that his company not only fills a specific technical gap in the market, but that its use ensures more good than it does harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are talking about vast regions like the ocean there are a lot of unknowns about what is going on,&#8221; he said. Typically, organizations have relied on satellite imagery to get pictures of what is going on in the water, but this is not ideal since most satellite imagery is days old by the time it&#8217;s seen by a user. &#8220;Fishing, smuggling, trafficking, immigration &#8212; these are all areas where real-time intelligence is required. It’s not just footage, but the beginning of solving the problem. The objective is that you should be able to act before something bad happens,&#8221; and, because Tekever is also using predictive analytics, to preview what will come.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is gathering vast amounts of data to solve problems as they occur,&#8221; he said, noting that even having an extra five minutes to respond can make a difference because of how fast conditions can change in the water. For the U.K.&#8217;s Home Office, for example, he noted that one priority has been to identify migrant boats in the English Channel to help escort them to shore, to avoid potentially tragic accidents. &#8220;The press focuses on the migration issue itself, but it’s a huge humanitarian issue,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Going forward, there is a vast amount &#8212; a sea, even &#8212; of ways that Tekever might develop its technology. Looking at and making sense of bodies of water requires the crunching of vast amounts of data, Mendes said, but that also gives the company a large number of data sets that could be put to use, too. It has yet to be able to read submarine activity, something that today needs lidar and radar on seacraft to identify; but that is an area it&#8217;s starting to develop. Another is to identify and classify oil spills, he said.</p>
<p>Right now, Tekever&#8217;s focus remains on what Mendes described to me as &#8220;the blue economy&#8221;, but it is also breaking ground on&#8230; ground. Its focus seems to be to continue trying to create new ways of looking at the most complicated terrains. One area he noted it wants to do more in is forest and specifically rainforest. It invested in a Brazilian drone company, Santos Lab, several years ago, giving it a foothold in that part of the world.</p>
<p>“Tekever is a very unconventional UAS company and a market leader with outclass technology, thousands of hours of operational experience, a seasoned leadership team and a phenomenal and profitable business vision in a fast-growing market,&#8221; said Mo El Husseiny, managing partner at Ventura Capital, in a statement. “These attributes have made it a flagship investment for Ventura, aligned to our portfolio of disruptors in technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Tekever is one of the hottest European Deeptech scaleups, and we’re very proud to continue working with the team and helping them disrupt the global market” added Diogo Chalbert Santos, a partner at Iberis Capital. “It’s amazing what Tekever has already achieved as a bootstrapped business and I’d say not even the sky is a limit with this round.” (It seems that Santos can&#8217;t resist a pun, an investor after my own heart.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside the dramatic <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-forecast-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth</a> in e-commerce, in part <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/05/1091182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fueled by the pandemic</a>, there&#8217;s also increased demand for services that can help merchants more easily participate online. A startup called <a href="https://soona.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soona</a>, now backed by an additional $35 million in Series B funding, has been tapping into this market with its platform that allows brands to create content for their e-commerce websites and marketing through &#8220;virtual&#8221; photo and video shoots. That is, instead of having merchants ship off their items for a remote photo shoot, then wait for the results, Soona&#8217;s technology allows the brands to participate in the photo shoot process, both remotely and in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invite you to join your photo shoot in the browser. It&#8217;s not all that different than you and I joining a Zoom meeting,&#8221; explains Soona co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethgiorgi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liz Giorgi</a>. &#8220;You click on the calendar invitation and your photo shoot appears in the browser where you can see every single photo and video clip as it&#8217;s captured in real time. Those assets are there for you to interact with, so the customers or the teams can give feedback on those assets to the photographer,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261138" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261138" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2261138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?w=506" alt="" width="506" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=223,300 223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=768,1031 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=506,680 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shop-your-soona-content.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Soona&#8217;s customers can communicate to the photographer if they want to do things like change the composition, add or remove props from the scene or anything else they want to tweak about the photo shoot. What&#8217;s more, the merchants appreciate how they don&#8217;t have to pay upfront for the service. Instead, they&#8217;ll pay $39 per photo or $93 per video clip, and only have to purchase the assets they actually want. Once their selection is made, the photos and videos are delivered within 24 hours, ready to be uploaded to the merchants&#8217; website or marketing channels. Merchants can also visit their past shoots at any time and order more content.</p>
<p>The business&#8217;s success has now led to a new infusion of capital, as Soona is announcing today it&#8217;s received $35 million in new funding led by Bain Capital Ventures. Prior investors Union Square Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, Starting Line Ventures, 2048 Ventures and Range Ventures also participated in the round, bringing the company&#8217;s total raise to date to $51 million.</p>
<p>Giorgi&#8217;s background is in professional media production. Before starting Soona, she ran her own internet video production company, Mighteor, after working in media and television production. She says the experience has given her a good eye for determining how to make content, and specifically, how to make content beautiful. Her co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayleyanderson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hayley Anderson</a>, meanwhile, has a background in animation and was a creative director at Mighteor, which was later <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/04/standard-youtube-community-acquires-mighteor-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by</a> creator network Standard.</p>

<p>The duo founded Soona in 2019, launching their initial product the same year. In its earlier days, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/soona-seed-funding/">Soona worked by</a> having customers come into actual studios for their photo and video shoots, while using software that offered quick uploads of the footage for the customers to shop from immediately. But the pandemic forced Soona to readjust and switch to a virtual model. As it turned out, embracing this model has helped the business grow not only during the height of the pandemic, when in-person activities shut down, but also in the months since as remote work became more of a business norm. Soona grew its revenue 400% from 2020 to 2021, then another 300% from 2021 to 2022. The company won&#8217;t share its annual revenue figures, however, citing its competitive advantage in keeping its business metrics private.</p>
<p>Today, Soona has served around 10,000 merchants, including customers like Wild Earth, Lola Tampons, The Sill, SNOW, Birchbox and others, but not via a subscription model. Instead, it&#8217;s a transactional business &#8212; but one Giorgi believes has found the right product-market fit, as 63% of its revenue on a monthly basis last year came from repeat customers. Around 60% of its customers are $1 million to $5 million e-commerce stores, many of which are building on Shopify. The company is strong in cosmetics, beauty, wellness, fashion and footwear, and is now growing more in consumer packaged goods and nutrition products.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we may not have a recurring business model, there is a high level of reoccurrence to how often brands need these assets. And so by making it possible for them to choose when and how they&#8217;re going to spend money and make investments in these visual assets, we&#8217;ve made it really easy for them to continue to work with Soona,&#8221; notes Giorgi. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not taking subscriptions off the table,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Today, there are other businesses that allow merchants to ship in products for remote photo shoots, like Pow Photography, but they don&#8217;t offer Soona&#8217;s real-time experience. And some rivals primarily focus on &#8220;product-on-white&#8221; photography &#8212; product images on white backgrounds for traditional e-commerce sites &#8212; as opposed to the richer content created by pairing products with models in photos shot in living rooms or kitchen sets, for example. Meanwhile, other competitors work to connect merchants with photographers directly in more of a marketplace-style offering.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2261139" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2261139" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2261139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/virtual-shoot_desktop-1.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2261139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona</p></div></p>
<p>Soona&#8217;s proprietary technology, however, offers the customers everything they need to plan their photo shoot online, including access to models &#8212; both human and pet! &#8212; and stylists. Models work on a contract basis, similar to other gig economy jobs. But Soona&#8217;s photographers can either take on the jobs as gigs or transition to full-time employees. Today, there are around 35 full-time photographers on staff, and roughly 100 on contract.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Soona is looking to grow its marketplace of model services, which is now one of the quickest-growing segments of its business &#8212; 20% of the total business in 2021, in fact. Soona plans to triple the size of this platform in 2022 to bring on more types of diverse talent and new ways of showing off products for its merchant customers. It will also invest in technology that will help make more recommendations to brands about what type of photo shoots to create by asking for select business data and the merchant&#8217;s goals. Already, Soona has launched Amazon and Instagram-recommended shoots, and is planning to launch something similar for TikTok.</p>
<p>The company also plans to expand its API platform, to grow its set of integrations beyond Shopify, which today accounts for 55% of its customer base. Going forward, Soona aims to integrate with other pieces of the e-commerce technology stack, like Klayvio or BigCommerce, for example.</p>
<p>The company, which has hubs in Denver, Austin and the Twin Cities, will also triple its engineering team by adding engineers outside the current team in Minneapolis. It will grow its product team as well.</p>
<p>Giorgi declined to speak to Soona&#8217;s current valuation, but noted Soona is &#8220;on the path&#8221; toward becoming the next female-founded unicorn. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to get there very soon,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Quite a number of earlier-stage deals are going to get done at prices that might not make sense in a few months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, here we are.</p>
<p>The bad things are still happening: The U.S. stock market opened in the red this morning, with broad indices losing ground (the S&amp;P 500 is off 2.3%) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq taking even more punishment (off 2.7%).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Closer to home for startups are cloud stocks, a collection of companies that sell software along modern lines &#8212; read: SaaS via public cloud. They&#8217;re taking even heavier blows, with<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WCLD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> one key index</a> off 3.33% at the moment I write this to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But that damage is modest compared to what is going on in the decentralized world, with major cryptos falling sharply, again, adding to their seven-day losses. A quick (rounded) <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update on the red ink</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin: -3% last 24 hours, off 20% in the last week</li>
<li>Ether: -7% last 24 hours, off 30% in the last week</li>
<li>Cardano: -7% last 24 hours, off 32% in the last week</li>
<li>Sol: -11% last 24 hours, -39% in the last week</li>
</ul>
<p>That screaming sound you hear in the background is every trader who was holding leveraged longs on decentralized assets. If you bought the last dip, you just got punched. If you bought the dip with extra hot sauce, you took an even greater loss. (I don&#8217;t mean to make light here; if you are seriously taking hits, care for yourself, and remember that all money is an invention.)</p>
<p>The result of the carnage is that late-stage valuations are starting to stutter. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/swoon-in-tech-stocks-puts-startup-valuations-in-harsh-new-light-11642762808" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal interviewed Mary D’Onofrio of Bessemer Venture Partners</a> &#8212; a regular here on The Exchange &#8212; about the selloff last week, before today&#8217;s added pain. She said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The public market reset is affecting how we think about our private-market entry prices for VC deals.</p></blockquote>
<p>D’Onofrio is a growth-stage investor, so her notes here carry quite a lot of weight. More simply, the translation from public market pullback to private market reset is already underway, but on enough of a time delay that the earlier stages of startup investment are unlikely to feel it for a while yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this era of remote work, people want as much flexibility as possible to live where they want, when they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no surprise that we’ve seen a flurry of startups emerge to give people more options for long-term stays. </span><a href="https://www.anyplace.com/?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=ru" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one such startup. A self-described “digital nomad,” Satoru Steve Naito says he co-founded San Francisco-based Anyplace in 2017 because he wanted the product for himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to its name, Anyplace began its life as a marketplace that gives people the option to book hotels or rentals for 30 days or more nearly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anyplace</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they want to. That marketplace today is across over 60 countries in more than 450 cities. And now, the startup is moving into an operator role with its latest product, Anyplace Select, which is designed for remote workers and corporate travelers to be able to work from anywhere with furnished apartments that include a “fully equipped” home office.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic has raged on and offices continue to be shut down, more people have had the flexibility to move around like never before. Anyplace launched Select last year in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and San Diego, and achieved a $1 million run rate within seven months of its launch, according to Naito, who serves as the company’s CEO. Monthly revenue growth of the Select offering is over 50% on average and, as of this month, its occupancy rate is over 90%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyplace partners with real estate developers such as Greystar and AvalonBay to rent units, furnish them and then master leases them out at a higher price with its select offering. Each apartment has a “fully equipped office setup” and comes with a flexible-term contract (minimum of 30 days). They include a height-adjustable standing desk, ergonomic chair, 34-inch “ultra-wide” monitor, professional microphone, webcam, collapsible green screen, laptop stand, docking station and key light, among other things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every Select apartment provides the same or higher level of productivity as a home office,” Naito said. “Wi-Fi speed will never be an issue either, as all units have gigabit internet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would a remote worker who wants to try living in another city not just rent a place on Airbnb? The ability to have a house or apartment set up for remote work is not as easy to find as one might think, Naito contends &#8212; some offerings might have slow Wi-Fi while others might not offer an adequate desk or dedicated workspace. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most current accommodations optimize for pre-pandemic stays. People really worked all day from their rooms while staying in hotels or Airbnb,” Naito said. “However, in the post-pandemic world, people are spending more time making Zoom calls and working from their rooms. So we are creating accommodations optimized for the post-pandemic world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Airbnb has historically focused on short-term rentals, but now the hospitality giant is seeing an increase in longer-term rentals on its marketplace &#8212; evidence that there is increased demand for longer-term rentals. Last May, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky told Yahoo Finance that 24% of Airbnb stays </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-q1-earnings-booking-longer-than-28-days-131056944.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were 28 days or more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; compared to 14% just two years prior. In further evidence of its belief in the trend, Airbnb also recently backed another startup in the space, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/zeus-living-closes-on-55m-to-offer-flexible-furnished-rentals-as-it-expands-beyond-corporate-housing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeus Living</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which started out focusing on offering flexible options for corporate travelers but is now expanding to a broader pool of potential customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anyplace had just been operating a marketplace, it is now shifting its broader business focus to be an operator with its new Select offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Airbnb is not our competitor, but a partner and actually one of our biggest acquisition channels,” Naito told TechCrunch. “I don&#8217;t believe Airbnb will move into the operator space, with their own inventory. Their strength is in the platform business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To “aggressively” expand its inventory into other markets and continue to improve its functionality, Anyplace is announcing today that it has raised $5.3 million in a Series A financing led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GA Technologies,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with participation from J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ason Calacanis, Launch Fund, Japanese soccer star and Dreamers Ventures co-founder (with Will Smith) Keisuke Honda, Mercari co-founder Hiroshi Tomishima and East Ventures. The round brings Anyplace’s total raised to $8 million, and will go also toward boosting its current headcount of 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has already begun raising capital for its next round, already receiving “several investment commitments,” according to Naito, due to the company’s “rapid growth and the surge in demand for the kind of accommodations that Anyplace Select offers.” Specifically, the startup is looking to expand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to major cities in the U.S., particularly to popular vacation destinations such as Hawaii, Miami, Austin and Denver, Naito said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People no longer have to quit their full-time jobs to become digital nomads. Before the pandemic, people had to leave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their companies and become freelancers or small business owners in order to live a nomadic lifestyle,” Naito told TechCrunch. “But now, tech giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter are allowing their employees to work remotely full time…The pandemic has created many new types of nomads. So this is a major paradigm shift in the way people work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via email, Keisuke Honda told TechCrunch that he could “feel” Naito’s “grit” when he first met him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He raised capital from well-known U.S. investors like Jason Calacanis and he told me the story of how he made it. It wasn&#8217;t easy, and he struggled. He has overcome the language and various other barriers that immigrant founders face,” Honda said. “ I believe that grit is one of the most important things to succeed in a startup. Also, I was impressed by the fact that he built the product he wanted, and that he himself lives and works in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honda added that as a soccer player, he has traveled to many countries and stayed in “many hotels and Airbnb rentals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never seen accommodations like Anyplace Select with a fully equipped office environment,” he told TechCrunch. “Obviously, the number of people who work from home has been increasing and they don&#8217;t want to live only in one place. Anyplace Select will be the standard accommodation for such people in the post-pandemic world.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based venture fund <a href="https://www.swiftarcventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiftarc Ventures</a> is launching a new fund dubbed Swiftarc Telehealth to take advantage of the boom in Telehealth-focused startups which have emerged, partly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The $75 million fund will focus on three initial areas: obesity, mental &amp; behavioral health, and pediatrics. It will also look at startups in remote patient monitoring, chronic care management and in-home evaluations.</p>
<p>The timing is good. It’s estimated that over 10 years’ worth of telehealth legislation was pushed forward in the U.S. in less than three months, and more than three-fourths of the U.S. population has now utilized some form of telemedicine. The continued reimbursement support of virtual visits in the field of psychiatry and mental health is also looking like an area of expansion. In obesity care, Swiftcare says dietitians, clinicians and primary care physicians being able to communicate with each other on a platform is likely to be an opportunity for tech startups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260312" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Swiftarc will also draw on the expertise of medical experts including Sloan Saunders, co-founder, and CEO of Intellihealth, and Dr. Paul Bedocs, a leading dermatologist, as members of the Swiftarc Medical Advisory board.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swiftarcventures.com/sid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sid Jawahar</a> founder and managing partner of Swiftarc Ventures, said: “We feel good about participating in areas of healthcare that have been historically underserved. Being curious, impactful and deliberate are the three core tenets with which we began. Our goal is to fundamentally disrupt standard, antiquated healthcare delivery models and to find innovative solutions to improve access to high-quality care, ultimately reshaping the patient healthcare experience forever.”</p>
<p>Swiftarc believes that this platform-based telemedicine approach may well help control other related and serious health conditions like diabetes and hypertension at pre-onset stage.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Jawahar added: “We had not really been participating directly in healthcare deals, which all changed when we saw telehealth becoming the next frontier. That led to a really deep, exhaustive 14-month study of the industry. We really wanted to roll up our sleeves and talk to the folks that had been in it for a long time. There&#8217;s a lot of really interesting fragmented activity in telehealth. We looked at 15 health centers, everything from cardiology to neurology to dermatology to see how virtual care would fundamentally augment how healthcare was being performed. And where we landed was on these three use cases we thought were the most efficacious today: mental health, obesity, and pediatrics.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fathom.video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fathom</a>, a startup that is building an AI notetaker for Zoom, today announced that it has raised a $4.7 million seed round from a range of early-stage investors, including Zoom&#8217;s own Apps Fund. Other investors include the likes of early Zoom investors Maven Ventures, Bill Tai and Matt Ocko, early-stage funds Character.vc, Active Capital, Global Founders Capital, Rackhouse.vc and Soma Capital, as well as the CEOs of Reddit, Twitch, Cruise, Mercury, People.ai, Snapdocs and Shogun. That&#8217;s a broad coalition of investors, one that&#8217;s surely in part driven by the fact that Fathom founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rrwhite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard White</a> also previously built <a href="https://uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UserVoice</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was actually at UserVoice where I got the idea for what&#8217;s now turned into Fathom because I was doing a lot of research and customer calls in service of investigating a different product we were building at UserVoice,&#8221; White told me. &#8220;I think it was kind of January 2020 [&#8230;] and I did like 300 Zoom calls in that first month. It was kind of crazy. I&#8217;m not sure why I signed up to that many research calls. I got really well acquainted to what a terrible experience it is to have to talk to people all day long and type notes at the same time &#8212; and then after the call is over, clean up those notes so that they make sense. It&#8217;s a very stressful kind of process and you worry you&#8217;re going to miss something.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260978" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260978" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-Screenshot-Call-Recording-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fathom</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260977" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To fix that, White and his team built Fathom to make it easy to not just automatically record and transcribe every Zoom call, but also to quickly generate summaries after the call, which can then be emailed to participants or imported into a CRM system, for example. During a call, all you have to do is highlight important parts using the service&#8217;s Zoom or desktop app.</p>
<p>While sales teams are some of the obvious users for this kind of service &#8212; they tend to have a lot of Zoom calls these days, after all &#8212; White argues that there is also a wider market for a service like this and that none of the features are necessarily sales-specific. &#8220;Overall, we try to build a platform that is useful for anyone that&#8217;s on a decent number of Zoom calls per week,&#8221; said White.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260979" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260979" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2260979" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="Fathom founder and CEO Richard White" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fathom-CEO-Headshot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260979" class="wp-caption-text">Fathom founder and CEO Richard White. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fathom</p></div></p>
<p>To create this product, White took some work that had already been done at UserVoice and then spun that out as a new company &#8212; and in the process, the team also made it into Y Combinator. That may seem like a bit of an odd choice for a seasoned entrepreneur, but as White noted, a lot has changed in the last few years and simply having a cohort of like-minded founders that are going through the same processes is a very useful thing to have. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned probably as much from the common curriculum at YC as I have from having this peer network of people that are all hustling and doing the same thing,&#8221; White noted. He also likened YC to a startup union that can help with fundraising and negotiating with vendors, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of now, Fathom is available for free, with plans to add paid features over time (though the core experience will remain free). As of now, though, support for other platforms like Google Meet or Microsoft Teams is not on the roadmap.</p>
<p>“Zoom has already transformed our lives and the way we do business &#8212; now that we live on video, the need and opportunity for <span class="il">Fathom</span> is obvious,&#8221; said Jim Scheinman, early Zoom investor and founding managing partner at Maven Ventures. &#8220;The <span class="il">Fathom</span> team is incredibly strong and experienced, and they&#8217;re solving a key problem that Zoom customers face on a daily basis and will change the way people experience their business calls for the better. Being one of the first deeply integrated Zoom Apps opens the door for massive growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fathom, of course, isn&#8217;t the only company trying to solve this problem. <a href="https://www.chorus.ai/product/ai-for-revenue-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chorus</a> similarly tries to provide AI-driven solutions for sales calls, for example, while services like <a href="https://www.gong.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gong</a> focus more on analyzing customer-facing interactions across platforms and <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otter</a> mostly focuses on the transcription side of the process.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>The pay-for-processing business model has always been a largely unquestioned mainstay within the cryptocurrency landscape. Since the inception of digital assets, investors, developers and enthusiasts have been subjected to paying a processing or “miner” fee on top of the cost of the actual token purchased.</p>
<p>In April 2021, the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average cost</a> of sending bitcoin reached an all-time high of $59, surpassing its peak in December <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-ltc-eth.html#alltime&amp;search=2017">2017</a>, when the average transaction fees skyrocketed to $52. Then there’s Ethereum and its notoriously high gas fees. In 2021, the blockchain saw a number of crypto networks leaving Ethereum in search of more sustainable options such as rival blockchain Solana.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Needless to say, investing in crypto is becoming increasingly more expensive. Right now, the majority of the ecosystem is becoming disgruntled by the exorbitant cost of crypto and its use cases, especially in relation to fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, enthusiasts and speculators are gritting their teeth and bearing it, accepting it as an annoying trade-off that comes with their involvement in something that should revolutionize money.</p>
<p>However, what happens when that majority loses their enthusiasm to pursue other ways to transact and move value? We already see transactions on “centralized” services like Binance Smart Chain overtaking distributed systems like Ethereum because of a more competitive fee structure.</p>
<p>What will become of the dream of having a truly decentralized crypto ecosystem? Is it really impossible for decentralized networks to compete with centralized ones, from a transaction fee standpoint?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>It’s time for a free-market approach</h2>
<p>At present, the network economics of all current major public cryptocurrencies and blockchains ignore the need for utility-value-based pricing, which means that the price of transacting on a blockchain is not congruent with the customer’s perception of the utility value of making that transaction.</p>
<p>In other words, the fee range for transactions is not determined with the consumer’s needs in mind, nor the competitive landscape. In fact, there is little benefit for consumers when it comes to the pay-for-processing model since there is no cap on what fee can be charged for a transaction. Once fees amount to a large proportion of the value you are trying to transact, it can become inefficient and impractical to use such a network for those transactions.</p>
<p>While many would assume or hope that the network benefits from the real value of the utility provided to the user, the reality is that the pay-for-processing model only benefits crypto miners and other network stakeholders such as stakers, and not the users themselves.</p>
<p>For example, in Bitcoin, rewards are paid to miners for completing blocks of verified crypto transactions, and all fees are paid out to them. There remains an artificially scarce “block size” within which these transactions are processed, and miners have historically refused to let this block size increase.</p>
<p>Instead, they continue to demand higher fees to include transactions into a block. According to <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_miners_revenue_per_day">YChart</a>, Bitcoin miners’ average daily revenue stands around $47 million, up from around $29 million at the beginning of 2021, an increase of 62%.</p>
<p>In order for things to be sustainable in the long run, perhaps it’s time that transacting in crypto becomes beneficial to users by using utility-value-based pricing. It is high time that the world of digital assets adopts a conventional free-market economic approach, where the customer is always king.</p>
<h2>High transaction fees are a barrier to crypto network expansion</h2>
<p>Enthusiasts and early adopters will eventually become apathetic to a network, and when that time comes, pay-for-processing use cases for all these networks will most likely be reduced to only the transactions that users are willing to pay higher prices for – infrequent and higher-value settlements.</p>
<p>If this becomes a reality, value will be lost for a network’s stakeholders through under-pricing higher-value use-cases, while at the same time losing network revenue potentially derived from lower-value, high-volume use cases.</p>
<p>I refer to this impending scenario as utility mispricing — an inevitable fate for all cryptocurrency networks that rely on pay-for-processing to reward network stakeholders: that is, miners, masternode owners and stakers. The effects of utility mispricing include a decline in revenue and adoption of these networks, specifically at the point that there is an uptick in new user growth.</p>
<p>Ultimately, consumer confidence will wane, subsequently leading to a loss of brand equity, and this is likely to be fueled by negative media sentiment (as it is now, with relation to the exorbitant fees on the largest two crypto networks).</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if any of the major cryptocurrency networks will ever solve this problem in an elegant and efficient manner, short of having to implement and get consensus for a complete refactoring of their network revenue model.</p>
<h2>Alternative business models are key for network revenue</h2>
<p>While the best-case scenario would be to not throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater, adopting completely new network revenue models may be the answer. Arguably, the utility-value-based pricing model for cryptocurrency is the most user-beneficial alternative model in which low to feeless transactions can take place.</p>
<p>To achieve this, networks must set pricing through governance that involves all stakeholders, allowing for both on-chain and off-chain stakeholders to have a say on pricing parameters.</p>
<p>An example of this is Nano, a feeless cryptocurrency network that utilizes open representative voting. Votes are shared and rebroadcasted between nodes, tallied up and compared against the online voting weight available. Once a node sees a block that has received a sufficient number of votes to reach quorum, that block is confirmed in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The network offers no direct monetary incentive for nodes, thus removing emergent centralization forces and positioning it for longer-term trending toward decentralization, although the question of how this model will scale when it loses the altruism of its participants remains unanswered.</p>
<p>Another example of a network finding its way around a pay-for-processing model is Koinos. Its aim is to provide a mass-market user experience on a blockchain through what they refer to as “mana” – operating much like the mana one would come across in a video game.</p>
<p>Every token on the network is assigned a set amount of mana – similar to purchasing a mobile device that comes with preloaded data, this form of “fuel” is expended when a user consumes network resources. In this way, feeless transactions are able to accrue to liquid token holders.</p>
<p>One could also refer to this approach as hold-to-play, where the users choose to keep their tokens liquid, preventing them from participating in any yield-generating activities. Once any of the mana in any given token is consumed, that token is locked for a period of time, with the purpose of creating an opportunity cost in lieu of a real-time monetary cost that serves to disincentivize the submission of value-less transactions. Therefore, making the mana fee mechanism more dynamic and scalable than charging explicit transaction fees.</p>
<p>While there are a handful of other emerging networks that are following a model that is driven by user satisfaction, only time will tell whether major cryptocurrencies will follow suit.</p>
<h2>Major cryptos’ viability to scale remains at risk</h2>
<p>Right now, major cryptocurrencies are managing to remain relevant because of user altruism and enthusiasm; networks do not yet need to think outside of the “pay-to-play” box. However, as time passes and the hype becomes measured against the network’s performance and competitiveness in light of alternatives, networks will need to rethink the pay-for-processing model and find new solutions that are beneficial to the user as well as the network itself.</p>
<p>In any other business, customers inform the value and relevance of a product. Currently, there is an illusion that crypto enterprises don’t have to adhere to the same system, but there will have to be a shift in due time.</p>
<p>Only by providing real value to users on decentralized networks that is comparable to centralized services can the longevity of any cryptocurrency project be ensured in the long run.</p>
<p>The existing crypto ecosystems must adapt and recognize the fact that users are stakeholders, too. It is critical to ensure a network’s business model allows pricing services appropriately across all its target use cases while earning and distributing enough network revenue to make the project attractive to its investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Netherlands&#8217; competition authority has fined Apple €5 million (~$5.6 million) for failing to comply with conditions in an order requiring it to allow local dating apps to make user of third-party payment technology in their apps.</p>
<p>The tech giant could be on the hook for another €5 million fine next week if it doesn&#8217;t meet the regulatory requirement by then, and each week thereafter for a couple more months &#8212; up to a maximum of €50 million in relation to this particular order.</p>
<p>The fine relates to an <a href="https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/documents/summary-of-decision-on-abuse-of-dominant-position-by-apple.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> made by a Dutch watchdog, the Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM), last year &#8212; which found Apple in breach of antitrust rules and ordered it to adjust the conditions it imposes on dating app providers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261099" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At specific antitrust issue are App Store terms mandating the use of Apple&#8217;s own in-app payment infrastructure (aka the IAP API) for any sales of digital content, via which the tech giant extracts a commission.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s terms also ban the use of alternative payment systems by dating apps.</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he regulator also took issue with Apple banning dating apps</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from referring to other payment methods in their apps.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/apple-fails-satisfy-requirements-set-acm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACM said today</a> that Apple has failed to satisfy its conditions and must make amendments to bring the rules for dating apps in line with its order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the App Store, dating-app providers must also be able to use payment systems other than Apple’s payment system. In addition, dating-app providers must have the ability to refer to payment systems outside of the app,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The full detail of Apple&#8217;s continued infringements are not clearly stated. But the biggie seems to be Apple has not yet done what it was asked and <em>actually </em>made it possible for dating app providers to use other payment systems.</p>
<p>The Dutch regulator also criticises barriers it suggests Apple has erected to make it more difficult for dating app providers to use non-Apple payment infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple has failed to satisfy the requirements on several points,&#8221; the ACM writes. &#8220;The most important one is that Apple has failed to adjust its conditions, as a result of which dating-app providers are still unable to use other payment systems. At the moment, dating-app providers can merely express their ‘interest’.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, Apple has raised several barriers for dating-app providers to the use of third-party payment systems. That, too, is at odds with ACM’s requirements. For example, Apple seemingly forces app providers to make a choice: either refer to payment systems outside of the app or to an alternative payment system. That is not allowed. Providers must be able to choose both options.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The ACM told Apple it would need to amend conditions for dating apps in a decision last year. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But &#8212; as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/apple-app-store-dutch-antitrust-order/">reported earlier</a></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; Apple succeeded in delaying reporting of the order as it sought an injunction (some parts of the order are still under court seal). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It was also able to delay application of the order until mid January.</span></p>
<p>Last week it emerged that Apple still intended to collect a commission from local dating apps on any sales of digital content processed by non-Apple payment infrastructure &#8212; writing in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer support note</a>: “Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing that claim still appears on Apple&#8217;s post about &#8220;StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement&#8221; (as it refers to the ACM order). And it&#8217;s possible that parts of the order which remain sealed relate to commissions. But is has not been possible to confirm the detail here.</p>
<p>In a response to a question TechCrunch put to the ACM last week, querying Apple&#8217;s claim that it can still charge fees on apps that use non-Apple payment systems, a spokesperson for the regulator declined a response &#8212; saying they could &#8220;only refer to the part of the order the court upheld and cleared for publication&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s support site, meanwhile, still only points interested local developers to a <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer interest form</a>&#8221; &#8212; instead of offering a clear process for implementing non-Apple payment methods.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s accompanying text also continues to offer only a vague line that more information will be<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> available &#8220;shortly&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This delay in implementing a procedure for local dating apps to deploy alternative payment methods has cost Apple €5 million in fines so far (and counting). </span></p>
<p>Of course, a few-million-dollar fine &#8212; or even a €50 million penalty &#8212; won&#8217;t cause much consternation in Cupertino.</p>
<p>But of far greater concern for Apple are the now multiple competition complaints and probes into its App Store terms &#8212; which are attacking the commission it collects on in-app purchases &#8212; with its developer T&amp;Cs under regulatory investigation and/or order around the world, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">the EU</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">the U.K.</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">Asia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">the U.S</a>.</p>
<p>In the short term &#8212; and/or failing a substantial, global competition reform offer by Apple that would make App Store competition complaints go away &#8212; a regulatory patchwork looms for iOS app developers as each market/region&#8217;s regulators turn their attention to assessing Apple&#8217;s small print.</p>
<p>In the short term, consumer and developer wins around competition and pricing of iOS apps look more likely to come grudgingly &#8212; hard fought and hard won.</p>
<p>However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">ex ante regulation</a> of Internet giants&#8217; T&amp;Cs is now on the table in many markets &#8212; with the explicit goal of speeding up behavioral corrections. So a strategy of wilful delay looks set to get a lot more expensive in the future.</p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment on the ACM fine.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>If you own stuff, I am sorry to report that you are probably poorer today than you were on Friday, and even less wealthy than you were the Friday before. Things are selling off and we had to talk about it:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261096" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Stocks are down, and cryptos are getting utterly hammered. It&#8217;s a bad time to own equities, but worse if you are invested in digital assets. Bitcoin, ether and Solana are taking body-blows while the stock market wilts. I guess this means that all our 401(k) contributions will be cheaper in February? Small wins, but still.</li>
<li>Swiggy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-raises-700-million-at-10-7-billion-valuation/">raised a huge round at a simply enormous price</a>, which is good for the company but has us asking questions. OfficeSpace <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2022/workspace-management-platform-officespace-raises-150-million-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $150 million</a>, which caught our eye, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/spectrum-labs-b/">the recent Spectrum Labs appears to make good sense</a>.</li>
<li>And to close out we asked <em>is the party over?</em> This <a href="https://500ish.com/the-great-deflate-6bc847df9809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MG Siegler piece</a> was in our brain as we chewed over the situation. The dissonance between the public and private markets feels peak, and we aren&#8217;t sure how quickly their diverging velocities can keep up the tension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how the selloff is impacting you, we hope that you have a lovely week and stay warm. Hugs!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup <a href="https://gorillas.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a> has <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/blog/gorillas-x-frichti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.frichti.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frichti</a>, a French startup that delivers both ready-to-eat meals and groceries. The acquisition hasn’t closed just yet but both companies have entered exclusive discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t share details about the deal itself, especially as it isn&#8217;t completely signed,&#8221; Frichti co-founder and co-CEO Julia Bijaoui told me. &#8220;But it is correct to say that these are negotiations that should lead to Frichti getting acquired by Gorillas.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked when the transaction is supposed to close, she told me it could take &#8220;a few weeks or a few months&#8221;, it&#8217;s still hard to tell exactly. Over the years, Frichti had raised around €100 million in total ($114 million at today&#8217;s exchange rate).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gorillas is part of a group of startups that are trying to reinvent grocery deliveries in Europe. The company has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">nearly $1 billion</a> in its most recent funding round and is already <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/delivery-areas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operating</a> in eight markets — including France.</p>
<p>It competes with <a href="https://www.goflink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flink</a>, <a href="https://tryzapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapp</a>, <a href="https://www.cajoo.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cajoo</a>, <a href="https://getir.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a> and <a href="https://gopuff.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gopuff</a> (following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/">Dija’s and Fancy’s acquisitions</a>). With these apps, customers can buy everything they would find in a small grocery store. And they all promise near-instant deliveries so that you don’t have to plan in advance when you need to order groceries.</p>
<p>In addition to this new crop of startups, other well-established companies are trying to position themselves as competitors to instant grocery startups. For instance, Deliveroo and Uber Eats are both emphasizing grocery deliveries in their respective apps.</p>
<p>Frichti, on the other hand, has been around since 2015, but with a different positioning. In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/frichti-grabs-1-1-million-for-its-full-stack-food-delivery-service/">article</a> that I wrote back in 2015, I called the startup a full-stack food delivery startup. The startup designs its own recipes, cooks ready-to-eat meals in its own kitchens, stores food in its own micro-fulfillment centers and handles deliveries with its own delivery service.</p>
<p>The result is a complete end-to-end service with a strong brand and reasonable prices. Over the past few years, the company has expanded to include fruits, vegetables, grocery items and private label products. It has served 450,000 customers in total across eight cities in France and Belgium.</p>
<h2>The subcontracting incident of summer 2020</h2>
<p>It’s a graceful exit for Frichti and the acquisition makes a ton of sense for Gorillas. Gorillas is acquiring a strong brand, a network of micro-fulfillment centers and a different segment in the delivery space.</p>
<p>Frichti and Gorillas will still operate as two different services in Frichti&#8217;s existing markets France and Belgium. As for Gorillas&#8217; six other markets, the company could choose a different path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, we haven&#8217;t decided yet but it&#8217;s more likely that we scale many of the building blocks of Frichti&#8217;s product — but under an umbrella brand that could be Gorillas,&#8221; Frichti&#8217;s Julia Bijaoui said.</p>
<p>And because Frichti has been around for so long, Gorillas could learn a thing or two from Frichti. &#8220;We have had six years to build this model of quick commerce,&#8221; Bijaoui said. &#8220;We&#8217;re generating an operating profit, which is quite unusual in this industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the past 18 months haven’t been so easy for Frichti. In June 2020, Libération’s Gurvan Kristanadjaja <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/06/01/sans-papiers-sans-contrat-bienvenue-chez-frichti_1790003/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that some of Frichti’s deliveries were handled by undocumented workers. According to Frichti’s founders, the startup wasn’t aware of that. Instead, Frichti, like all delivery companies, relied on subcontracting companies to hire delivery people and handle some deliveries for the platform.</p>
<p>And one of those subcontracting companies lured undocumented immigrants and told them that they could make money with Frichti deliveries. There was no work contract, no minimum pay.</p>
<p>That was just one example that highlighted a much bigger problem. Frichti checked the status of all its delivery partners to make sure that they have a proper working permit and get paid properly. The company underestimated the issue.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Instead of blaming Frichti, this crisis highlights a widespread problem with the subcontracting model and app-based gig work.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Hundreds of delivery people realized that they would lose their source of income. So they decided to protest and they <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/06/05/les-livreurs-de-bonheur-sans-papiers-de-frichti-en-colere_1790397/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked access</a> to Frichti’s micro-fulfillment centers. During several weeks, Frichti simply couldn’t operate normally.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/societe/livreurs-sans-papiers-de-frichti-un-an-apres-que-sont-ils-devenus-20210603_4G4OU2G3K5EFFJZ2CWPLQ4AQZU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Libération</a>, 200 out of 500 delivery persons working with Frichti didn’t have a residence permit.</p>
<p>That incident became a serious crisis that could have led to Frichti’s bankruptcy. A few weeks later, around half of the undocumented migrants who handled Frichti deliveries <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/france/2020/07/22/la-moitie-des-livreurs-frichti-sans-papiers-bientot-regularises_1794907/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a residence permit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had this incident during the summer of 2020. Clearly, we had some flaws in our process to check the identity and the permits of our delivery partners. It&#8217;s something that we have completely fixed today. We make sure that our delivery people have a residence permit and work in optimal conditions,&#8221; Bijaoui said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an event that taught us a lot and I think we came out of it stronger because we partnered with them and helped them get residence permits,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming Frichti, this crisis highlights a widespread problem with the subcontracting model and app-based gig work. Account renting and dishonest subcontracting companies have been an issue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/business/uber-eats-deliveroo-glovo-migrants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for years</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, both regulators and companies have been slow when it comes to implementing changes for the better. I’m sure the Frichti team is glad that it has turned this page of the company’s story, but I’m also sure there are <em>other</em> companies that will face similar incidents.</p>
<p>After years of exploding growth, there has been some consolidation in the food and grocery delivery space — as today’s acquisition proves once again. Let’s hope that these newly formed delivery giants won’t turn a blind eye on exploitation in the gig economy.</p>
