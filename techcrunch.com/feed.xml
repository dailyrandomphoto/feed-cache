										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has offloaded its air taxi enterprise Elevate to Joby Aviation, the last of several moonshots to be sold by the ride-hailing company in a pursuit to stick to its core business and reach profitability.</p>
<p>The transaction announced Tuesday is part of a complex deal that includes Uber investing $75 million into Joby and an expanded partnership between the two companies. Last year, Uber and Joby, which is developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft, signed on as a vehicle partner for Uber’s Elevate initiative. Joby was the first partner to commit to deploying air taxi services by 2023.</p>
<p>The $75 million investment comes in addition to a previously undisclosed $50 million investment made as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/">Joby&#8217;s Series C financing round in January 2020</a>, Uber said. To date, Joby Aviation has raised $820 million. Uber has invested a total of $125 million into the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the deal, which is expected to close in early 2021, the two parent companies have agreed to integrate their respective services into each other&#8217;s apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advanced air mobility has the potential to be exponentially positive for the environment and future generations,&#8221; Uber CEO said Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. &#8220;This deal allows us to deepen our partnership with Joby, the clear leader in this field, to accelerate the path to market for these technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Joby is considered one of the leaders, Elevate did play a role in shaping the nascent industry, including establishing some of the benchmarks used by competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team at Uber Elevate has not only played an important role in our industry, they have also developed a remarkable set of software tools that build on more than a decade of experience enabling on-demand mobility,&#8221; Joby Aviation CEO JoeBen Bevirt said in a statement.&#8221;These tools and new team members will be invaluable to us as we accelerate our plans for commercial launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>One year ago, Uber’s business model could be categorized as an “all of the above approach,” a strategy to generate revenue from all forms of transportation, including ride-hailing, micromobility, logistics and package and food delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic and Khosrowshahi&#8217;s focus on profitability prompted the company to dump its moonshots and double down on delivery with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates/">its acquisition of Postmates</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Uber is a company focused on ride-hailing and delivery while keeping its hand in micromobility, logistics and autonomous vehicles through a series of deals struck in 2020.</p>
<p>The Joby-Elevate terms are similar to two other Uber deals this year. In spring, Uber led a $170 million funding round in micromobility startup Lime. As part of the deal, Lime acquired Uber&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary Jump. The majority of Jump&#8217;s 400 employees were laid off. Earlier this week, autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that will value the combined company at $10 billion.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/embed/#?secret=7IqAImxZiI" data-secret="7IqAImxZiI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Just like the Uber&#8217;s deals with Lime and now Joby, Aurora isn&#8217;t paying cash for Uber ATG, a company that was last valued at $7.25 billion. Instead, Uber is handing over its equity in ATG and investing $400 million into Aurora, which will give it a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Uber said October that it sold off a $500 million stake in its Uber Freight business to an investor group led by New York-based investment firm Greenbriar Equity Group. The deal valued the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis. Uber has maintained its majority stake in Uber Freight unlike the Jump, Elevate and ATG deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> normally the first company that cyberattack victims will call, has now admitted it too has fallen victim to hackers, which the company called a &#8220;sophisticated threat actor&#8221; that was likely backed by a nation-state.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html">a blog post</a> confirming the breach, the company&#8217;s chief executive Kevin Mandia said the nation-backed hackers have &#8220;top-tier offensive capabilities,&#8221; but did not attribute blame or say which government was behind the attack.</p>
<p>Mandia, who founded <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mandiant" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mandiant">Mandiant, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the incident response firm acquired by FireEye in 2014, said the hackers used a &#8220;novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past&#8221; to steal hacking tools used typically by red teams, who are tasked with launching authorized but offensive hacking campaigns against customers in order to find weaknesses or vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do.</p>
<p>&#8220;These tools mimic the behavior of many cyber threat actors and enable FireEye to provide essential diagnostic security services to our customers,&#8221; said Mandia. &#8220;None of the tools contain zero-day exploits. Consistent with our goal to protect the community, we are proactively releasing methods and means to detect the use of our stolen red team tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if stolen, these tools could make it easier for hackers to launch attacks against their victims.</p>
<p>Two years ago, hackers breached and stole similarly offensive hacking tools from the National Security Agency, which the spy agency used to collect intelligence on foreign suspected terrorists. But the exploit was later published and was used to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/the-wannacry-sinkhole/">infect thousands of computers</a> with the WannaCry ransomware, causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage.</p>
<p>Mandia said that FireEye has developed hundreds of countermeasures to minimize the impact that these tools pose in the event that the hackers use the tools, but that FireEye has seen no evidence that the tools have been abused.</p>
<p>Although the motives of the hackers are unknown, Mandia said that the hackers appeared to seek information related to its government customers.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not clear exactly when the breach happened, or how FireEye was alerted to the incident. A spokesperson for FireEye declined to comment beyond the blog post when reached by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>FireEye, valued at about $3.5 billion, saw its stock tank by more than 7% in after-hours trading. The company has gained a reputation as one of the most well-resourced cybersecurity firms on the market, often brought in to understand how a breach happened and what may have been taken.</p>
<p>In this case, FireEye said it had reported the incident to the FBI and alerted industry partners, like Microsoft, to the breach. Microsoft said it was assisting with FireEye&#8217;s investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident demonstrates why the security industry must work together to defend against and respond to threats posed by well-funded adversaries using novel and sophisticated attack techniques,&#8221; said Microsoft&#8217;s Jeff Jones. &#8220;We commend FireEye for their disclosure and collaboration, so that we can all be better prepared.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday that he has moved to Texas, confirming months of speculation that the billionaire would leave California, a state of which he has become increasingly critical. Musk confirmed the move during an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-to-discuss-teslas-banner-year-despite-pandemic-silicon-valleys-future-11607449988">The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council annual summit</a>.</p>
<p>His remarks confirmed a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-plans-to-move-to-texas-friends-and-associates-say.html">CNBC report</a> that Musk had told friends of his intent to move to Texas.</p>
<p>The move coincides with a number of SpaceX and Tesla-related projects in Texas, the sale of several of Musk&#8217;s Los Angeles homes as well as his disagreement with how California public officials have handled the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, Musk filed a lawsuit against Alameda County and threatened to move its headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada immediately. The lawsuit stemmed from Tesla&#8217;s escalating fight with health officials over whether its factory in Fremont could reopen during a stay-at-home order enacted due to the coronavirus.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the interview, Musk said California was taking its winning position for granted and becoming complacent.</p>
<p>Speculation that Musk would move to Texas picked up after Tesla picked and started construction on a site near Austin for a factory that will build its Cybertruck and the Model 3 and Model Y. His other privately held company, SpaceX, is planning a launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/texas-hold-em-musk-moves-his-foundation-to-the-lone-star-state">Bloomberg reported</a> Monday that Musk had moved his foundation to Austin, another signal that he had or was about to make the jump to Texas.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bzzsSkqTFD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-picks-austin-for-its-next-u-s-factory-to-build-cybertruck-semi-truck-model-y/">Tesla picks Austin for its next US factory to build Cybertruck, Semi truck, Model Y</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla picks Austin for its next US factory to build Cybertruck, Semi truck, Model Y&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-picks-austin-for-its-next-u-s-factory-to-build-cybertruck-semi-truck-model-y/embed/#?secret=bzzsSkqTFD" data-secret="bzzsSkqTFD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Texas has become a hotspot in recent years, with Austin, Houston and Dallas seeing spikes of growth. During the pandemic, that pace accelerated as California-based tech workers fled expensive areas such as Silicon Valley and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The state has another important perk for Musk: no state income tax.</p>
<p>California is still a major hub of SpaceX and Tesla operations. SpaceX headquarters are in Hawthorne and Tesla&#8217;s headquarters are in Silicon Valley. The company&#8217;s main factory, which assembles the Model 3, Model X and Model S and Model Y, is in Fremont.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/aws-releases-sagemaker-to-make-it-easier-to-build-and-deploy-machine-learning-models/">three years after it was first launched</a>, Amazon Web Services&#8217; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">SageMaker platform</a> has gotten a significant upgrade in the form of new features, making it easier for developers to automate and scale each step of the process to build new automation and machine learning capabilities, the company said.</p>
<p>As machine learning moves into the mainstream, business units across organizations will find applications for automation, and AWS is trying to make the development of those bespoke applications easier for its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best parts of having such a widely adopted service like SageMaker is that we get lots of customer suggestions which fuel our next set of deliverables,&#8221; said AWS vice president of machine learning, Swami Sivasubramanian. &#8220;Today, we are announcing a set of tools for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SageMaker that makes it much easier for developers to build end-to-end machine learning pipelines to prepare, build, train, explain, inspect, monitor, debug and run custom machine learning models with greater visibility, explainability and automation at scale.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/3m" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="3m">3M, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/adp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="adp">ADP, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astrazeneca" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astrazeneca">AstraZeneca, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Avis, Bayer, Capital One, Cerner, Domino&#8217;s Pizza, Fidelity Investments, Lenovo, Lyft, T-Mobile and Thomson Reuters are using SageMaker tools in their own operations, according to AWS.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s new products include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler</a>, which the company said was providing a way to normalize data from disparate sources so the data is consistently easy to use. Data Wrangler can also ease the process of grouping disparate data sources into features to highlight certain types of data. The Data Wrangler tool contains more than 300 built-in data transformers that can help customers normalize, transform and combine features without having to write any code.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/embed/#?secret=B1KAsnAwQf" data-secret="B1KAsnAwQf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon also unveiled the Feature Store, which allows customers to create repositories that make it easier to store, update, retrieve and share machine learning features for training and inference.</p>
<p>Another new tool that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> touted was Pipelines, its workflow management and automation toolkit. The Pipelines tech is designed to provide orchestration and automation features not dissimilar from traditional programming. Using pipelines, developers can define each step of an end-to-end machine learning workflow, the company said in a statement. Developers can use the tools to re-run an end-to-end workflow from SageMaker Studio using the same settings to get the same model every time, or they can re-run the workflow with new data to update their models.</p>
<p>To address the longstanding issues with data bias in artificial intelligence and machine learning models, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/aws-announces-sagemaker-clarify-to-help-reduce-bias-in-machine-learning-models/">Amazon launched SageMaker Clarify</a>. First announced today, this tool allegedly provides bias detection across the machine learning workflow, so developers can build with an eye toward better transparency on how models were set up. There are open-source tools that can do these tests, Amazon acknowledged, but the tools are manual and require a lot of lifting from developers, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drivers cruising along an off-the-beaten track might stumble upon an unusual sight in the coming months: a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rivian-automotive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rivian-automotive">Rivian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> electric charging station.</p>
<p>The electric automaker has designed and is now starting to build out a network of electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States as it prepares for the first deliveries of its R1T pickup truck and R1S sport utility vehicle. The network will include fast-chargers located along interstates, a strategy employed by Tesla and Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal.</p>
<p>Rivian is adding a second layer to its electric vehicle charging game plan that&#8217;s atypical of the industry. The company will set up dozens of EV chargers designed to power up its electric vehicles while parked at adventurous destinations, from mountain bike and hiking trails to kayaking spots and maybe even near popular climbing crags. It&#8217;s a direct appeal to Rivian&#8217;s customer base and one required to build confidence in the brand and electric vehicles, in general, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe told TechCrunch in a wide-ranging interview about charging, batteries and automated driving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re excited about the opportunity to create Rivian charging locations that aren&#8217;t on the interstate, that help draw you or enable you to go to places that normally are not the kinds of places that invite or welcome electric vehicles because of charging infrastructure,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent a lot of time thinking about how you can essentially create these curated drives where, depending on your point of interest, you can pick different paths. If you want to stop midway through the trip for a one-mile, two-mile or five-mile hike, you know, here&#8217;s a route that you want to take and here&#8217;s a charging location right next to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>An &#8220;all of the above&#8221; approach</h2>
<p>The Rivian consumer-facing network is essentially two-tiers that will offer fast charging along the interstate where drivers need it, and strategically located destination chargers for when speed isn&#8217;t as important. It has created what Scaringe described as a &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">really interesting and challenging real estate&#8221; problem as the company figures out where those points of interest are and the best spots to locate charging stations along a particular route.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building the Rivian network has been more than a test of consumer brand awareness and real estate wits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electric automaker, which has raised about $6 billion, developed the tech in-house, including the high-speed DC charger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t talked about this really, but that charger, the power electronics module — or the backbone of those chargers — is something that we&#8217;re going to be deploying at scale,&#8221; Scaringe said, adding that the high-speed DC charger will be capable of up to 140 miles in about 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hardware, and accompanying charging software, will be most visible in the consumer-facing Rivian network. However, the platform and the hardware around it also will be used for a fleet-based product, said Scaringe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you think of commercial vans, the charger and the dispenser may look a little different, but the guts of these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">power modules that are used to build up the charging capability are identically applied in these very different applications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the reasons we built all that core competency, so we can build both fleet-based B2B charging solutions and the consumer-facing adventure network for Rivian customers.</span></p>
<h2>Controlling the experience</h2>
<p>Rivian has spent years and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the R1T and R1S to market. And while it has raised $6 billion to date, those funds could easily be spent on developing technology and scaling up manufacturing. Scaringe argues that the Rivian network is a necessary undertaking if the automaker hopes to build confidence by controlling the entire ownership experience.</p>
<p>There are numerous third-party charging companies in operation today, including ChargePoint, EVConnect, EVGo, Electrify America and Greenlots. Legacy automakers have created partnerships and even made strategic investments in these businesses ahead of their own electric vehicle rollouts. But Scaringe isn&#8217;t willing to rely completely on third-party networks.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The challenge is we don&#8217;t control those networks, so the payments platforms, the uptime, the performance, the ability to reserve a charger — all those things that take the friction of charging away — we don&#8217;t truly control,&#8221; said Scaringe. &#8220;With the Rivian Adventure Network, we have 100% control of that; we get to know what vehicles are charging or how they&#8217;re charging, the rates. We can be really creative in terms of locations, so it can allow us to get to places that are very specific and unique to Rivian.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Open or shut?</h2>
<p>The Rivian network is clearly being built for Rivian customers. However, it doesn&#8217;t mean this will necessarily be a closed proprietary system like Tesla&#8217;s Supercharger network.</p>
<p>The two common connectors used for rapid charging are Combined Charging System (CCS) or CHAdeMO. CCS, a direct current connector that Rivian uses, is an open international standard that in recent years has gained popularity in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>This means that Rivian trucks and SUVs can also use any third-party CCS charging station without having to use an adapter. It also means that theoretically other electric vehicles with the CCS standard could use the Rivian network, although software could block their use.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rivian to begin deliveries of electric pickup truck in June 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/rivian-to-begin-deliveries-of-electric-pickup-truck-in-june-2021/embed/#?secret=aC7gROMfyK" data-secret="aC7gROMfyK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Scaringe wouldn&#8217;t say exactly how many charging stations would be open by this summer, when the first deliveries of the electric pickup and SUV are expected to begin. He noted that dozens of charging stations — each station having an average of six charging connectors — will be erected in the U.S. in 2021.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As that network is built it will take some of the pressure off the need to have the very large battery packs,&#8221; Scaringe said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Rivian R1T and R1S comes standard with a battery pack that has more than 300 miles of range. The company plans to make a pack with more than 400 miles of range available in the R1T beginning in January 2022. A longer range R1S </span>with both five and seven-passenger seating will be announced following start of production, the company has previously said. Rivian is also planning to eventually offer a smaller 250-mile range pack for a lower-priced R1T and R1S.</p>
<p>Even without specific numbers, it&#8217;s clear that Scaringe&#8217;s aspirations and plans extend well beyond &#8220;dozens&#8221; of the Rivian stations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;The scale of a network is not something that you can turn on overnight,&#8221; he said. It takes months of time to get full coverage of the U.S. and years of time to get dense coverage, which by 2023 or 2024, we will certainly have.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the biggest games of the year, &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-a-retro-futuristic-fantasy-with-huge-potential-if-you-can-ignore-the-cyberjank/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>,&#8221; is about to be released, but developer CD Projekt Red is already under fire for an early game sequence with the potential to induce seizures. Players with epilepsy should be warned that there is currently no way to skip this, and the visual feature will be repeated throughout the game.</p>
<p>Strobing lights can induce seizures in some people prone to them, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped many high-profile games from including them for effect. Usually there is a boilerplate warning on boot saying this is a possibility, but in most games it&#8217;s more of a warning that there may potentially be flashing lights of this type, for example if several flashbang grenades went off one after the other. Many games also offer an option to reduce the intensity of flashing lights or otherwise change their appearance, along with other options for accessibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyberpunk&#8221; seems to tread especially dangerous territory fundamentally, as its game world is full of the kind of seedy, flickering-neon lighting one associates with a grimy, futuristic dystopia. But within the first few hours of the game there is a much more severe and thoughtlessly designed event that has already <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-psa">caused a reviewer at Game Informer to experience a seizure</a>. It involves the (otherwise quite interesting) &#8220;braindances,&#8221; or BDs, which let your character relive experiences recorded by others, by donning a special headset&#8230; that boots up with intense flashing lights:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>When &#8220;suiting up&#8221; for a BD, especially with Judy, V will be given a headset that is meant to onset the instance. The headset fits over both eyes and features a rapid onslaught of white and red blinking LEDs, much like the actual device neurologists use in real life to trigger a seizure when they need to trigger one for diagnosis purposes. If not modeled off of the IRL design, it&#8217;s a very spot-on coincidence, and because of that this is one aspect that I would personally advise you to avoid altogether. When you notice the headset come into play, look away completely or close your eyes. This is a pattern of lights <em>designed </em>to trigger an epileptic episode and it very much did that in my own personal playthrough.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see the event referred to in the screenshot above (taken afterwards, but you can see the device). I recall this moment quite clearly from my own playthrough, and remember thinking it was rather an intense light show indeed. Unfortunately for this person, it caused a serious episode and could do so for many others upon its release on the 10th.</p>
<p>Among the many options for changing the appearance of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; there isn&#8217;t one for reducing flashing lights that I could find. I&#8217;ve asked CD Projekt Red about this and hopefully they can ship something to mitigate the issue at or near launch. The company did <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1336389181988343812">say on Twitter that it was looking into a solution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more and more alternative investment marketplaces pop up around specific verticals like art or collectibles, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/indie-gogo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="indie-gogo">Indiegogo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder Slava Rubin is launching a Kayak-like platform called <a href="https://www.withvincent.com/">Vincent</a> which helps curious investors get a handle on what the entire asset class has to offer.</p>
<p>Rubin and co-founders Evan Cohen, Eric Cantor and Ross Cohen have raised $2 million for the venture with backing from investors including Uncommon Denominator, ERA Ventures, The Fund and Rubin&#8217;s own firm Humbition. Vincent launched in beta this July but the firm is now ready to take the platform wide with a public launch. Rubin says the team has assembled the &#8220;most comprehensive database of alternate investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubin has been a driving force behind alternative investments since his Indiegogo days and has helped guide some of the existing legislation that has made investments in alternative assets more tenable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of the buzz around alternative investments in 2020 is the result of evolving guidance from stateside regulatory bodies, while added attention comes from the boom around investment platforms that bring users more approachable tools to access financial institutions. Specific verticals may be hoping to build up a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robinhood">Robinhood <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-like brand and following around their particular niche, but Vincent is aiming to benefit from rising tides and users eyeing diversification.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Our partners] are really heads down often on a lot of curation around a specific deal and trying to become experts in that space,&#8221; Rubin tells <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="techcrunch">TechCrunch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve learned is that the investor is thinking more about trying to get exposure to alternative investments and not only do they want exposure to one alternative investment, they want exposure to the entire asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company currently has partnerships with about 50 platforms, Rubin tells me, including platforms like WeFunder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sharespost" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sharespost">SharesPost, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Rally Rd. and Otis. The deals which span real estate, venture, collectibles, and art, among others, bring Vincent users access to $2 billion worth of investments, the company says. Users visiting Vincent are asked whether or not they are accredited which routes them to the list of deals they have access to.</p>
<p>Similar to Kayak, people are using Vincent to source the deals, but once they find an asset that tickles their fancy, they&#8217;ve being redirected to the partner platform&#8217;s site or app in order to actually carry out the deal. Once a user carries out an investment on said platform, Vincent receives a standard fee from the partner platform.</p>
<p>Vincent&#8217;s main challenge is building up a brand that resonates with users without actually managing the actual investments themselves. Most of these partner platforms, as Rubin notes, are built around curating and developing an expertise around a specific niche, whether that works in a broader scenario is the big question.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole goal of an aggregator is to really simplify an experience where the market is massively fragmented,&#8221; Rubin says.</p>
<p>Vincent is also aiming to be more than an aggregator, serving up editorial content with a blog and newsletter that the team hopes can make the platform more of a one-stop-shop for investors looking to educate themselves on alternative assets. For his part, Rubin hopes that the gold rush of startups building alternative investment platforms is the perfect time for a player to come in that focuses on streamlining everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A third-party contacts app you&#8217;re not using may be handing out your home address to its users. In November, former Yahoo CEO and Google veteran Marissa Mayer and co-founder Enrique Muñoz Torres introduced their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/marissa-mayers-startup-launches-its-first-official-product-sunshine-contacts/">newly rebranded startup Sunshine</a>, and its first product, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sunshine-contacts/id1448555773">Sunshine Contacts.</a> The new iOS app offers to organize your address book by handling duplicates and merges using AI technology, as well as fill in some of the missing bits of information by gathering data from the web &#8212; like LinkedIn profiles, for example.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/freialobo/status/1334689238328217600">some users </a>were surprised to find they suddenly had home addresses for their contacts, too, including for those who were not already Sunshine users.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Sunshine to better understand the situation, given the potential privacy concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We understand there are several ways that users may encounter someone&#8217;s home address in the Sunshine app. A user may already have the address on file in their phone&#8217;s address book, of course, or they may have opted in to allow Sunshine to scan their inbox in order to extract information from email signature lines. This is a feature common to other personal CRM solutions, too, like <a href="https://evercontact.com/">Evercontact</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that someone had signed an email with their home address included in this field, that data could then be added to their contact card in the Sunshine app. In this case, the contact card is updated in the Sunshine Contacts app, which then syncs with your phone&#8217;s address book. But this data is not distributed to any other app users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075408" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075408" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2075408" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>The app also augments contact cards with information acquired by other means. For example, it may use the information you do have to complete missing fields &#8212; like adding a last name, when you had other data that indicated what someone&#8217;s full name is, but hadn&#8217;t completed filling out the card. The app may also be able to pull in data from a LinkedIn profile, if available.</p>
<p>For home addresses, Sunshine is using the Whitepages API.</p>
<p>The company confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s augmenting contact cards with home addresses under some circumstances, even if that contact is not a Sunshine Contacts user. Sunshine says it doesn&#8217;t believe this to be any different from a user going to Google to look for someone&#8217;s contact information on the web &#8212; it&#8217;s just automating the process.</p>
<p>Of course, some would argue when you&#8217;re talking about automating the collection of home addresses for hundreds or potentially thousands of users &#8212; depending on the size of your personal address book database &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit different than if you went googling to find your aunt&#8217;s address so you can mail a Christmas card or called your old college roommate to find out where to send their birthday gift.</p>
<p>However, Sunshine clarified to TechCrunch that it won&#8217;t add the home address except in cases when it determines you have a personal connection to the contact in question.</p>
<p>Here, though, Sunshine enters a gray area where the app and its technology will try to figure out who you know well enough to need a home address.</p>
<p>Before adding the address, Sunshine requires you to have the contact&#8217;s phone number on file in your address book, not just their email. That would eliminate some people you only have a loose connection with through work, for instance. And it only updates with the home address if the partner API is able to associate that address with a phone number you have.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075413" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075413" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2075413" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?w=527" alt="" width="527" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png 527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=118,150 118w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=236,300 236w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-4.png?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075413" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Sunshine says that it&#8217;s generally able to understand the type of phone number you have on file &#8212; like if it&#8217;s a residential or business line, or if it&#8217;s a landline or mobile number. (It uses APIs to do this, similar to <a href="http://www.strikeiron.com/product-list/phone/mobile-number-detection/">StrikeIron&#8217;s</a> though not that particular one.) It also knows who the phone number belongs to. Using this information and further context, the app tries to determine if a phone number is a personal or a professional number and it will try to understand your relationship with the person who owns that number.</p>
<p>In practice, what this means is that if all the information you had on file for a contact was professional information &#8212; where they worked, a job title, a work email and a phone number, perhaps &#8212; then that person&#8217;s contact card would <em>not</em> be updated to include their home address, too.</p>
<p>And because many people use their personal cell for work, Sunshine won&#8217;t consider someone a &#8220;personal&#8221; relationship just because you have their mobile phone number. For example, if you had only a contact&#8217;s name and a cell number, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to use the app to get their home address.</p>
<p>The result of all this automated analysis is that Sunshine, in theory, only updates contact cards with home addresses where it&#8217;s determined there&#8217;s a personal relationship.</p>
<p>This, of course, doesn&#8217;t take into account some scenarios like bad exes, stalking or a general desire for privacy. Arguably, there are times when someone may have a lot of personal information for a contact in their address book, but the contact in question would rather not have their home address distributed to that person.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent this, presumably, would be to opt out at the source: Whitepages.com. (Once you have your profile URL from the Whitepages website, you can <a href="https://www.whitepages.com/suppression-requests">use this online form</a> to have your information suppressed.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2075407" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075407" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2075407" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/iPhone-perspective-2.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075407" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sunshine</p></div></p>
<p>The way the app functions raises questions about what is truly private information these days.</p>
<p>Sunshine points out that people&#8217;s home addresses are not as hidden from the world as they may think, which makes them fair game.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that our home addresses are often publicly available. Although it&#8217;s been years since most of us have had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_directory">telephone directory</a> dropped on our doorstep with phone and address listings for people in our city, home addresses today are relatively trivial to find when you know where to look online.</p>
<p>In addition to public records &#8212; like voter registration databases &#8212; there are web-based people finders, too.</p>
<p>Sunshine&#8217;s partner, Whitepages.com, makes visitors pay for its data, but others like TruePeopleSearch.com don&#8217;t have the same paywall. With someone&#8217;s first and last name and city, its website provides access to someone&#8217;s home address, prior addresses, cell phone, age and the names of family members and other close associates. (TruePeopleSearch is not a Sunshine partner, we should clarify.)</p>

<p>Even though this data is &#8220;public,&#8221; it&#8217;s uncomfortable to see it casually distributed in an app, as that makes it even easier to get to than before.</p>
<p>Plus, after years of being burned by data breaches and data privacy scandals, people tend to be more protective of their personal information than before. And, had they been asked, many would probably decline to have their home addresses shared with Sunshine&#8217;s user base. Generally speaking, people appreciate the courtesy of having someone come ask for a home address, when it&#8217;s needed &#8212; they may not want an app creeping the web to find it and hand it out.</p>
<p>Sunshine Contacts is in an invite-only beta in the U.S., so the company has time to reconsider how this feature is implemented based on user feedback before it becomes widely available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Palantir&#8217;s push into federal health work continues. The data analytics company just picked up a new U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/food-and-drug-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="food-and-drug-administration">Food and Drug Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> contract which will span three years for a <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_75F40121F80001_7524_GS35F0086U_4730">total of $44.4 million</a>. The company&#8217;s shares, which have doubled in value over the last two months, are up around 20 percent on the news.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/palantir-wins-fda-contract-to-power-drug-review-and-inspections?sref=ctSjKj2N">Bloomberg reports</a>, Palantir will help the FDA review drugs, including those developed for COVID-19 treatment and assess the safety of other FDA-regulated health products like hand sanitizer. The contract will also bring Palantir&#8217;s data analysis software to the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Oncology Center of Excellence, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>In late September, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/palantir-unilateral-voting-power/">much back and forth with the SEC</a> over its S-1, Palantir went public through a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. The secretive company, co-founded by Silicon Valley iconoclast Peter Thiel, has attracted unwanted attention in recent years for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/palantir-s1-ice-contract-public-criticism/">ongoing work with ICE</a>, the federal law enforcement agency that carries out deportations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The FDA sits within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/palantir-covid-19-va-contract/">tapped Palantir</a> for work on the coronavirus crisis. In April, Palantir secured two contracts with HHS for its software, which the White House&#8217;s Coronavirus Task Force used to track trends and make decisions about the pandemic. Palantir also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/palantir-coronavirus-cdc-nhs-gotham-foundry/">worked with the CDC</a> to model the spread of the virus as early as mid-March.</p>
<p>Although it isn&#8217;t clear if the Biden administration will continue to expand federal work with Palantir, the process of distributing vaccines provides another logistical opportunity for the controversial company. Tracking which individuals have received both doses of a vaccine is work that sounds very much in Palantir&#8217;s wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Palantir relies heavily on federal contracts in the U.S., but it also shops its software platforms to governments abroad. In November, the U.K. was considering its software to<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-talks-contact-tracing-u-223245734.html"> aid contact tracing efforts</a>, though with vaccines already in distribution there it&#8217;s not clear that those talks have continued.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s S-1 filing revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/leaked-palantir-s-1-shows-company-has-125-customers-after-17-years/">Palantir only has 125 clients</a>, with a little over half of its revenue coming from government contracts. While the focus tends to be on Palantir&#8217;s relationships in the U.S., 60 percent of its business is international, though many of its clients remain unknown both at home and abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The aerospace industry has seen an explosion of activity from the world of startups, where bright engineers are foregoing jobs at large corporations and opting instead to raise funding from increasingly ambitious venture capitalists to build their own startups to turn moonshots into business realities. In the latest development, a startup out of Munich has raised the largest round to date in European space tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isar Aerospace</a>, which is building a micro-satellite launcher significantly smaller and thus lower in price than bigger launchers on the market today, has picked up €75 million ($91 million) in funding. It plans to use the money to continue its research, development and production en route to its first commercial launches, planned for early 2022.</p>
<p>The launcher is not just significant for its design innovation, but if it proves successful, it would make Isar the first European space company to build a successful satellite launcher to compete in the global satellite market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?w=680" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084404" width="680" height="383" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/07_Fairing-Seperation_00082.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The round, a Series B, is being led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lakestar" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lakestar">Lakestar, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with previous backers Earlybird and Vsquared Ventures also contributing significantly, the company said. Earlybird and strategic backer Airbus Ventures led Isar&#8217;s <a href="https://www.isaraerospace.com/article.php?id=2019121001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous round of $17 million</a> in December 2019.</p>
<p>The startup is a spinout of TUM &#8212; the famous Munich Technical University &#8212; where co-founders Daniel Metzler, Josef Fleischmann, and Markus Brandl had all studied engineering. Fleishmann had a small claim to fame before Isar: he was <a href="https://www.tum.de/nc/en/about-tum/news/press-releases/details/34832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part of the team from TUM</a> that built the winning vehicle for the famous Hyperloop competition in the US. It was an achievement that landed him a very interesting job offer with a high profile venture in the US that will go unnamed; he opted to come back to Germany to build his own company, which became Isar.</p>
<p>As Metzler described it in an interview, there is a lot of pent-up demand among companies that need or would like to use satellite technology to augment or replace other data sources: this comes from not just the usual suspects of government or communications entities, but also navigation, GPS and mapping specialists, agribusiness interest, media and internet companies and any organizations that need the kind of high speed, far-reaching data access that can only be achieved from space.</p>
<p>The issue is that today&#8217;s technology makes launching satellites into orbit a costly and time-sucking operation.</p>
<p>Launchers are large and go up infrequently, so reserving space on them takes a lot of lead time and investment, and even then a launch can hit a snag over a technical or weather issue.</p>
<p>That issue has somewhat been addressed by the growth of private companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which are building more rockets to address demand; and a proliferation of more launch centers in a larger range of locations to increase the number of launch events.</p>
<p>Isar, on the other hand, is taking a very different approach, building not just a new kind of launchpad but a new kind of rocket that will be smaller and less expensive. The idea will be that by doing so, it will make it cheaper, easier and more flexible for more organizations to book satellite launches. The aim will be to carry a payload of over 1,000 kilograms.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?w=680" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2084405" width="680" height="383" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/200820_Launchpad_01.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>As Metzler describes it, the innovations that Isar has built into its system includes the propulsion systems with a design that relies on a different, lighter fuel than what is typically used today in launchers. It&#8217;s also taking a different, simplified approach to the design to further reduce the cost of production.</p>
<p class="p1">Metzler said that typically the price for a satellite launch today can be in the range of between $30,000 and $40,000 per kilogram. &#8220;We aim to go more in the direction of $10,000 per kilogram,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The proposition is interesting enough that Isar says it has already racked up $500 million in &#8220;customer inquiries&#8221; &#8212; essentially a loose commitment for sales as and when it gets its launchers ready to run.</p>
<p class="p1">The company sees satellite launches as an obvious bottleneck that needs addressing.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Going to space once a week is very different from planning launches three years in advance,&#8221; he said of how Isar envisions the future to look, versus how it looks now. And just to note, he said that Isar is building with sustainability in mind: if a piece does not return to earth to be re-used, it&#8217;s designed to be broken up and burned in the atmosphere, leaving no trace of the launcher.</p>
<p>Longer term, Isar might also consider space exploration and other areas of development, an ambitious roadmap (or skymap, as the case may be) that investors seem willing to support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to accompany <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/isar-aerospace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="isar-aerospace">Isar Aerospace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the largest institutional investor on its way to commercially develop space for Europe. Micro-satellites in the low Earth orbit will become a key platform technology with enormous innovation and business potential in the coming decades. That is why we need a competitive space industry in Europe if we do not want to witness the next technological leaps as a spectator,&#8221; said Hendrik Brandis, Co-Founding Partner of Earlybird. &#8220;I am particularly pleased that we are able to back a financing round of this magnitude entirely with German money. This is a clear sign of how successfully the start-up and VC industry has developed in this country in recent years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/emmanuel-macron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sat down with Niklas Zennström for an interview on the European tech ecosystem. Macron listed everything that’s needed to create European tech giants that compete with the biggest American and Chinese tech companies.</p>
<p>According to him, Europe needs to focus on “financing, integration of our markets and an actual single market, regulation for privacy and technological innovation, and having European data, a European cloud and European technologies to be sure that we don’t depend on others,” Macron said.</p>
<p>Zennström founded Skype and is currently running prolific investment firm <a href="https://www.atomico.com">Atomico</a>. As Zennström isn’t a reporter, he wasn’t particularly confrontational during the pre-recorded interview. Earlier today, his firm released its annual <a href="https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com">State of European Tech report</a> and held a virtual conference that featured Macron&#8217;s interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the report, you can see that French startups attracted more than $5 billion in funding rounds in 2020. Macron listed some of the reasons why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/27/the-year-of-the-french-unicorns/">French startups have been growing</a>, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/france-overhauls-its-special-visa-for-tech-talent/">French Tech Visa</a>, some tax reforms (flat tax on capital gains and the end of the wealth tax except on real estate), some private efforts to improve diversity, such as Station F and Ecole 42, etc.</p>
<p>But Zennström didn’t come to the Elysée Palace for Macron’s year-end performance review. Macron wants to foster a truly European tech ecosystem without borders. “We need European financing, European solutions, European talent. Now, when you look at the map, we have what we call the GAFA in the U.S., the BATX in China and GDPR in Europe,” Macron said.</p>
<p>“We have regulation, fair point. But we don’t have the equivalent of these very, very large caps,” he added.</p>
<p>According to him, it starts with European financing. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Last year</a>, the French government convinced institutional investors to invest more heavily in late-stage tech companies. Other countries should follow suit to create more public tech companies in Europe.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the French government unveiled an ambitious <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/france-announces-4-3-billion-plan-to-support-startups/">support plan</a> for startups during the economic crisis. “It’s been copied by other European countries,” a source close to the president said.</p>
<p>But Macron doesn’t want to be the inspiration for other countries. He wants to position himself as the leader of a single European tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>“We need an actual European digital market. Today, a lot of entrepreneurs have to deal with 27 regulations. This is why the different directives arriving in the coming weeks, around mid-December — for digital services and digital markets — are critical,” he said.</p>
<p>And yet, the current economic crisis has shown us that European governments all have their own stimulus plans. In Europe, when it comes to taking ambitious economic decisions, it’s hard to find common ground. Let&#8217;s see if the same is true with tech ecosystems.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Businesses and consumers alike are finding ways to adapt and stay resilient during these unprecedented times. Though recovery may take time, a new report confirms the strength of entrepreneurialism and grit of small business owners, who remain optimistic that their businesses will overcome any present and future obstacle with the right resources and preparedness.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even amidst the pandemic, the survey showed 75% of small business owners are optimistic about their business’s recovery.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the inaugural <a href="https://about.americanexpress.com/all-news/news-details/2020/The-Entrepreneurial-Spirit-in-the-United-States-Remains-Strong-/default.aspx">American Express Entrepreneurial Spirit Trendex</a>, which polled 1,000 small and midsized businesses, revealed notable insights about the entrepreneurial spirit in the United States. Even amidst the pandemic, the survey showed 75% of small business owners are optimistic about their business’s recovery and 82% feel that they are better prepared to handle a future crisis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They continue to believe in their business and pursuing what they love. Of those surveyed, 81% believe the benefits of owning their own business outweigh the challenges, including financial stability, being their own boss, turning their passion project into a business and flexibility to set their own hours. The study uncovered more insights showing the current mindset of small businesses.</p>
<h2>Small businesses are actively seeking advice</h2>
<p>In order to successfully navigate these unprecedented times, business owners are searching for resources that can properly aid them. Businesses are actively seeking virtual business conferences and webinars (47%), virtual networking events (44%), advice and resources about leading through a crisis (44%) and learning ways to destress and stay mindful (42%).</p>
<h2>Cash flow is top of mind</h2>
<p>No surprise during an economic crisis, over 81% of business owners are prioritizing <a href="https://www.kabbage.com/">cash flow management</a> and are identifying ways to cut back spending and increase sales, namely by moving services online. The survey found the top activities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing marketing efforts (41%).</li>
<li>Increasing products/services online (40%).</li>
<li>Cutting expenses (36%).</li>
<li>Diversifying revenue streams (35%).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pivot, then repeat</h2>
<p>It would be difficult to find a small business that didn’t need to adapt their operations in some form due to the pandemic. It was the year of pivots for so many, and the survey finds the trend will continue into next year.</p>
<p>According to the data, 76% of business owners have pivoted or are in the process of pivoting their business model to maintain revenue, and among those that already pivoted, 73% expect to pivot again in the next year. Staying nimble to meet the demand of new market needs and demands is crucial to maintaining the health of your business, whether there is a pandemic or not.</p>
<h2>Taking a stand</h2>
<p>Aside from navigating the pandemic, business owners are also facing a historic moment in the fight for racial justice. Many business owners (43%) are fighting for change through public statements against racial injustice or monetary contributions to a racial justice organizations.</p>
<p>Business owners are also making change within their organizations, as 73% of those surveyed aim to increase diversity in the workplace. Top-of-mind actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely changing their company culture to make diverse employees feel more included (54%).</li>
<li>Changing their hiring and recruiting processes (47%).</li>
<li>Making measurable commitments to addressing racial injustice in the future (47%).</li>
</ul>
<p>This year has taken a toll on so many small businesses, yet the data shows the entrepreneurial spirit remains strong with a drive to push onward, improve and succeed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/richard-socher" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="richard-socher">Richard Socher, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> former chief scientist at Salesforce, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/salesforce-einstein-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-couple-of-new-features/">helped build the Einstein</a> artificial intelligence platform, is taking on a new challenge &#8212; and it&#8217;s a doozy. Socher wants to fix consumer search and today he announced <a href="http://you.com">you.com</a>, a new search engine to take on the mighty Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building you.com. You can already go to it today. And it&#8217;s a trusted search engine. We want to work on having more click trust and less clickbait on the internet,&#8221; he said. He added that in addition to trust, he wants it to be built on kindness and facts, three worthy but difficult goals to achieve.</p>
<p>He said that there were several major issues that led him and his co-founders to build a new search tool. For starters, he says that there is too much information and nobody can possibly process it all. What&#8217;s more, as you find this information, it&#8217;s impossible to know what you can trust as accurate, and he believes that issue is having a major impact on society at large. Finally, as we navigate the internet in 2020, the privacy question looms large as is how you balance the convenience-privacy trade-off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He believes his background in AI can help in a consumer-focused search tool. For starters the search engine, while general in nature, will concentrate on complex consumer purchases where you have to open several tabs to compare information.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cloudtenna raises $2.5M, launches mobile search app to find content across cloud services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/cloudtenna-raises-2-5m-launches-mobile-search-app-to-find-content-across-cloud-services/embed/#?secret=1SIKpE0dTD" data-secret="1SIKpE0dTD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The biggest impact thing we can do in our lives right now is to build a trusted search engine with AI and natural language processing superpowers to help everyone with the various complex decisions of their lives, starting with complex product purchases, but also being general from the get-go as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Socher was light on details, preferring to wait until GA in a couple of months to share some more, he said he wants to differentiate from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> by not relying on advertising and what you know about the user. He said he learned from working with Marc Benioff at Salesforce that you can make money and still build trust with the people buying your product.</p>
<p>He certainly recognizes that it&#8217;s tough to take on an entrenched incumbent, but he and his team believe that by building something they believe is fundamentally different, they can undermine the incumbent with a classic &#8220;Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma&#8221; kind of play where they&#8217;re doing something that is hard for Google to reproduce without undermining their primary revenue model.</p>
<p>He also sees Google running into antitrust issues moving forward and that could help create an opening for a startup like this. &#8220;I think a lot of stuff that Google [has been doing] … with the looming antitrust will be somewhat harder for them to get away with on a continued basis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He acknowledges that trust and accuracy elements could get tricky as social networks have found out. Socher hinted at some social sharing elements they plan to build into the search tool including allowing you to have your own custom you.com URL with your name to facilitate that sharing.</p>
<p>Socher said he has funding and a team together working actively on the product, but wouldn&#8217;t share how much or how many employees at this point. He did say that Benioff and venture capitalist Jim Breyer are primary backers and he would have more information to share in the coming months.</p>
<p>For now, if you&#8217;re interested, you can go to the website and sign up for early access.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dark mode may offer respite from the visual overstimulation of a bright screen or simply give you a more consistent development experience across your text editor, IDE and terminal. Whether you like your screen bright or if you want to feel like Mr. Robot in dark mode, it’s your choice in how you experience GitHub. Enable dark mode from your settings or set it to track your system preferences,&#8221; the company says. That sums it up pretty well.</p>

<p>We had Firehawk onstage (virtually) at Disrupt to compete in the Startup Battlefield, where they were among the finalists. The chief advance of the company is taking the concept of hybrid rockets and supercharging them with 3D-printed fuel. Instead of a reservoir of liquid, solid or a combination of fuels, Firehawk prints the solid fuel with a &#8220;highly engineered internal structure&#8221; that makes it both more reliable and more powerful. It also simplifies the engine itself, which only has 12 parts.</p>

<p>Will Edwards is CEO and co-founder of Firehawk, and this is his first aerospace company — he went to law school, then worked in the software and HR industries before meeting his co-founder and CTO, Ronald Jones. They formed Firehawk and are currently assembling a 5,000 LBF thrust engine to be tested at Stennis Space Center.</p>
<p>Kayhan Space is a data-based endeavor, the brainchild of Iranian childhood friends Araz Feyzi and Siamak Hesar. Kayhan, which came through Techstars&#8217; virtual accelerator, aims to be nothing less than air traffic control for space. Satellites are proliferating, of course, and the next few years will see thousands more added to the crowd. How are they all tracked, and how will companies and organizations using different systems know if their satellites are in danger of colliding or otherwise interfering with each other?</p>
<p>Feyzi, Kayhan&#8217;s CTO, will talk with us about Kayhan&#8217;s approach to tracking satellites and how they aim to break into a market that is just now beginning to take off. With $600,000 in pre-seed funding, they&#8217;re just getting started, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, how are filmmakers reacting to the news that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/"> Warner Bros. will be releasing all of next year&#8217;s movies on HBO Max</a> at the same time that they&#8217;re released in theaters? Not too well, according to a story <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan">published yesterday in The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p>While the story includes plenty of anonymous commentary (mostly from agents), the most incendiary quote comes in a statement provided by director Christopher Nolan, in which he called the recently-launched <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Max &#8220;the worst streaming service&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service. Warner Bros. had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker’s work out everywhere, both in theaters and in the home, and they are dismantling it as we speak. They don’t even understand what they’re losing. Their decision makes no economic sense, and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On one level, Nolan&#8217;s comments aren&#8217;t too surprising, since he&#8217;s been one of Hollywood&#8217;s staunchest advocates for the theatrical movie experience. But Nolan&#8217;s words are remarkably direct and incendiary a director who&#8217;s generally reserved in his public comments — yes, he once <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/christopher-nolan-interview-dunkirk-netflix-1201857101/">criticized Netflix</a> for its &#8220;bizarre aversion to supporting theatrical films,&#8221; but he <a href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/christopher-nolan-dunkirk-oscars-movies-tv-spielberg-1202607836/">later apologized for being &#8220;undiplomatic.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>And in this case, Nolan isn&#8217;t just criticizing a rival studio. He&#8217;s taking aim at the company that&#8217;s distributed nearly all of his films, including this year&#8217;s &#8220;Tenet&#8221; (a movie whose disappointing box office performance, particularly in the U.S., likely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/media-roundup-google-to-cut-big-checks-for-news-publishers-substack-continues-to-draw-top-creators-more/">prompted the studios to delay their big releases yet again</a>, and to consider streaming distribution more seriously).</p>
<p>While Nolan was one of the few people willing to criticize Warner&#8217;s decision on-the-record, The Hollywood Reporter suggests that the producers, directors and stars behind next year&#8217;s Warner Bros. slate were all blindsided by the announcement.</p>
<p>One particular concern is financial compensation, with deals usually tied to a film&#8217;s performance in the theatrical box office. The filmmakers and star of &#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; will reportedly receive &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; for bringing their film to HBO Max, but the talent behind Warner&#8217;s other movies might not be compensated at the same level.</p>
<p>And there could even be legal repercussions. <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/legendary-entertainment-warner-bros-hbo-max-deal-dune-godzilla-1234847605/">Variety is reporting</a> that Legendary Entertainment, the production company that co-financed next year&#8217;s Warner releases &#8220;Dune&#8221; and &#8220;Godzilla vs. Kong,&#8221; is considering suing the studio over its plans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dozens of medical imaging devices built by General Electric are secured with hardcoded default passwords that can&#8217;t be easily changed, but could be exploited to access sensitive patient scans, according to new findings by security firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cybermdx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cybermdx">CyberMDX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The researchers said that an attacker would only need to be on the same network to exploit a vulnerable device, such as by tricking an employee into opening an email with malware. From there, the attacker could use those unchanged hardcoded passwords to obtain whatever patient data was left on the device or disrupt the device from operating properly.</p>
<p>CyberMDX said X-ray machines, CT and MRI scanners, and ultrasound and mammography devices are <a href="http://www.cybermdx.com/vulnerability-research-disclosures/ge-radiology-modalities">among the affected devices</a>.</p>
<p>GE uses hardcoded passwords to remotely maintain the devices. But Elad Luz, head of research at CyberMDX, said some customers were not aware that their devices had vulnerable devices. Luz described the passwords as &#8220;hardcoded,&#8221; because although they can be changed, customers have to rely on a GE engineer to change the passwords on-site.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has also <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsma-20-343-01">prompted an alert</a> by Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit, CISA. Customers of affected devices should contact GE to change the passwords.</p>
<p>Hannah Huntly, a spokesperson for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ge-healthcare" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ge-healthcare">GE Healthcare, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said in a statement: &#8220;We are not aware of any incident where this potential vulnerability has been exploited in a clinical situation. We have conducted a full risk assessment and concluded that there is no patient safety concern. Maintaining the safety, quality, and security of our devices is our highest priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest find by the New York-based healthcare cybersecurity startup. Last year the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/flaws-anesthesia-respiratory-devices-tampering/">also reported vulnerabilities</a> in other GE equipment, which the company later admitted could have led to patient injury after initially clearing the device for use.</p>
<p>CyberMDX, which works primarily to secure medical devices and improve hospital network security through its cyber intelligence platform while conducting security research on the side, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cybermdx-device-security-funding/">raised $20 million</a> earlier this year, just a month into the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the longest time, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia</a> operating system remained a bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/googles-mysterious-new-fuchsia-operating-system-could-run-on-almost-anything/">a mystery</a> &#8212; with little information in terms of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/one-day-googles-fuchsia-os-may-become-a-real-thing/">plans for it</a>, even as the team behind it brought the code to GitHub under a standard open-source license. These days, we know that it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s first attempt at developing a completely new kernel and general purpose operating system that promises to be more than <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/09/what-is-google-fuchsia/">just an experiment</a> (or a retention project to keep senior engineers from jumping ship). For the most part, though, Google has remained pretty mum about the subject.</p>
<p>It seems like Google is ready to start talking about <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fuchsia-a3b3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fuchsia-a3b3">Fuchsia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a bit more now. The company today announced that it is expanding the Fuchsia open-source community and opening it up to contributions from the public. Typically, companies start opening up their open-source projects to outside contributors once they feel they have achieved a stable foundation that others can build on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Starting today, we are expanding <span class="il">Fuchsia</span>&#8216;s open source model to make it easier for the public to engage with the project,&#8221; the team writes. &#8220;We have created new public mailing lists for project discussions, added a governance model to clarify how strategic decisions are made, and opened up the issue tracker for public contributors to see what’s being worked on. As an open source effort, we welcome high-quality, well-tested contributions from all. There is now a process to become a member to submit patches, or a committer with full write access.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also publishing a technical roadmap for Fuchsia, with a driver framework, file system performance and expanding the input pipeline for accessibility at the top of the list.</p>
<p>The company also specifically notes that Fuchsia is not ready for general product development or even as a development target. Anybody with the right technical chops can clone the repository and build the code, though. Google already provides quite a bit of <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/build/fx">documentation</a> around how to do that today, as well as an emulator.</p>
<p>Google also notes that it aims to build an include open source community around the project. &#8220;<span class="il">Fuchsia</span> is an open source project that is inclusive by design, from the architecture of the platform itself, to the open source community that we’re building. The project is still evolving rapidly, but the underlying principles and values of the system have remained relatively constant throughout the project.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in 2016 <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/true-colors-adding-support-for-hdr">added support</a> for HDR (high-dynamic range) videos on its platform, allowing cretators to upload videos offering higher contrast, more accurate shadows and highlights, a wider range of colors, and, overall improved image quality. Today, the company announced it&#8217;s now bringing HDR support to live streamed videos, too. This will make YouTube the first major platform to support live HDR streams, it says.</p>
<p>The support will be available to creators using a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10265272">supported encoder,</a> while the HDR videos themselves can be played back on the latest Android mobile devices or on HDR-capable smart TVs or streaming sticks. Google&#8217;s own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-chromecast-adds-a-remote-and-the-new-google-tv-interface-for-49/">Chromecast</a>, of course, supports HDR content. And the company had announced HDR playback on Android mobile devices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-chromecast-adds-a-remote-and-the-new-google-tv-interface-for-49/">back in 2017,</a> so that&#8217;s not unexpected either.</p>
<p>When HDR first launched on YouTube, it was only offered to select YouTube channels at first. But the support for live streaming in HDR will be immediately available to any YouTube creator who wants to give it a try. Over time, YouTube says it will work to improve the experience, by allowing creators to stream HDR from additional encoders and mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new HDR support for live video content points to YouTube&#8217;s interest in better supporting the TV platform.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, YouTube said its service, as well as its live TV streaming service YouTube TV, saw an uptick in viewing on the big screen. As stay-at-home directives went into place, YouTube <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/youtube-streaming-trends-features/">saw overall watch time on the TV</a> screen jump 80% year-over-year in March. Also that month, YouTube content accounted for 41% of ad-supported video on demand streaming time on U.S. TVs, <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/06/25/youtube-brandcast-tv-viewership-stats/">it said</a> during its Brandcast event. YouTube usage on the TV, meanwhile, jumped to<a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/06/25/youtube-brandcast-tv-viewership-stats/"> around 450 million hours</a> per day up from <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/video/youtube-watch-time-on-television-data/">250 million hours in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Live-streamed video consumption increased during the early days of the pandemic, too. According to YouTube&#8217;s pitch to advertisers, live-streamed media via TV <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/youtube-ads-on-tv/">grew 250%</a> globally from March 11 to April 10, 2020. <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/youtube-streaming-trends-features">It also noted</a> that casted content watch time increased 75% year-over-year during this time frame.</p>
<p>YouTube also notes that today, over 100 million U.S. users watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens every month.</p>
<p>By offering HDR live streams, YouTube can make a better pitch to advertisers to shift more of their dollars over to its platform from traditional pay TV networks &#8212; even if HDR viewing on YouTube&#8217;s platform remains more limited.</p>
<p>The company envisions HDR support will be useful for a range of live streams, like gaming, esports, live events such as music and sports, as well as nature and travel streams.</p>
<p>YouTube says HDR support is available as of today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies rely increasingly on machine learning models to run their businesses, it&#8217;s imperative to include anti-bias measures to ensure these models are not making false or misleading assumptions. Today at AWS re:Invent, AWS introduced <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SageMaker Clarify to help reduce bias in machine learning models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are launching Amazon SageMaker Clarify. And what that does is it allows you to have insight into your data and models throughout your machine learning lifecycle,&#8221; Bratin Saha, Amazon VP and general manager of machine learning told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He says that it is designed to analyze the data for bias before you start data prep, so you can find these kinds of problems before you even start building your model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Once I have my training data set, I can [look at things like if I have] an equal number of various classes, like do I have equal numbers of males and females or do I have equal numbers of other kinds of classes, and we have a set of several metrics that you can use for the statistical analysis so you get real insight into easier data set balance,&#8221; Saha explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2xXSwvaMQD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/embed/#?secret=2xXSwvaMQD" data-secret="2xXSwvaMQD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After you build your model, you can run SageMaker Clarify again to look for similar factors that might have crept into your model as you built it. &#8220;So you start off by doing statistical bias analysis on your data, and then post training you can again do analysis on the model,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://cmotions.nl/en/5-typen-bias-data-analytics/">multiple types of bias</a> that can enter a model due to the background of the data scientists building the model, the nature of the data and how they data scientists interpret that data through the model they built. While this can be problematic in general it can also lead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/we-need-a-new-field-of-ai-to-combat-racial-bias/">to racial stereotypes being extended to algorithms</a>. As an example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html">facial recognition systems</a> have proven quite accurate at identifying white faces, but much less so when it comes to recognizing people of color.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to identify these kinds of biases with software as it often has to do with team makeup and other factors outside the purview of a software analysis tool, but Saha says they are trying to make that software approach as comprehensive as possible.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1qwdoVNk3r"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/we-need-a-new-field-of-ai-to-combat-racial-bias/">We need a new field of AI to combat racial bias</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;We need a new field of AI to combat racial bias&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/we-need-a-new-field-of-ai-to-combat-racial-bias/embed/#?secret=1qwdoVNk3r" data-secret="1qwdoVNk3r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;If you look at SageMaker Clarify it gives you data bias analysis, it gives you model bias analysis, it gives you model explainability it gives you per inference explainability it gives you a global explainability,&#8221; Saha said.</p>
<p>Saha says that Amazon is aware of the bias problem and that is why it created this tool to help, but he recognizes that this tool alone won&#8217;t eliminate all of the bias issues that can crop up in machine learning models, and they offer other ways to help too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also working with our customers in various ways. So we have documentation, best practices, and we point our customers to how to be able to architect their systems and work with the system so they get the desired results,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SageMaker Clarify is available starting to day in multiple regions.</p>
