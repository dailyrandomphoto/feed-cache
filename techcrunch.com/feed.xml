										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For modern cars, the standalone, photo-frame-like display in the center of the dashboard has become something of a default. But with its next-generation iDrive 8 system, BMW is moving away from this design language by introducing what it calls the &#8220;BMW Curved Display,&#8221; which takes this idea to the next level by expanding that center display all the way through the cockpit. It&#8217;s actually still two screens, the 12.3-inch information display and 14.9-inch control display, but it looks like a single curved display that BMW describes as giving an &#8220;appearance of almost floating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new curved display with the new iDrive 8 system will debut in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">upcoming all-electric iX</a> and i4, which should arrive later this year.</p>
<p>While the company isn&#8217;t sharing any details about the underlying technology stack just yet, BMW is willing to say that its new stack is able to process 20 to 30 times more data than the previous system. The company plans to share more details about the stack after July, Frank Weber, BMW&#8217;s head of development, told me during a press roundtable earlier today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2125126" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90407442_highRes__4152021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125126" class="size-full wp-image-2125126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90407442_highRes__4152021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>The company provided a first glimpse of the new layout when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">announced the iX last November</a>, but at the time, it didn&#8217;t provide any details about the new iDrive system. At the core of it is, unsurprisingly, a wholesale redesign of the user interface. Drivers will be able to choose between different layouts, for example. There&#8217;s a standard &#8220;Drive&#8221; layout, which will feature &#8220;a dynamically changing area in the center of the information display to show individually selectable information.&#8221; There&#8217;s also a &#8220;focus&#8221; mode for &#8220;dynamic driving situations,&#8221; a &#8220;gallery&#8221; layout that minimizes driving info in favor of other widgets from apps like your media source and, for when you just want to drive and be left in peace, a &#8220;calm&#8221; mode that only shows your vehicle speed in the center of the information display, and virtually nothing else.</p>

<p>There also are three different driving modes: efficient, sport and personal, which allows you to change some of the core driving experience settings like engine throttle, steering characteristics and chassis settings, as well as the audio characteristics of the car.</p>
<p>For maps, which are probably still the most often used app in any car, there are also three different modes (adaptive, reduced and expanded), all going back to the central idea that the drivers should be able to decide how much information they want to see.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of personalization options and Weber acknowledged as much, but he also argues that the company has made them easy to use so that they don&#8217;t overwhelm the driver &#8212; and that a lot of drivers really want this functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you test our system in China, you cannot do enough for personalization, they almost want to personalize everything,&#8221; Weber explained. &#8220;And then there are other people who say: I just want to drive my vehicle, I don&#8217;t want to see any of that. Therefore, what we did is, we have included a &#8216;My Mode&#8217; function &#8212; a very simple surface in the vehicle. When you push My Mode, you find Sport and you find Efficiency and you find Personal here. And there, it is very easy to almost say &#8216;Do I want something that is very reduced? Or do I want something that has all the possibilities of personalization?&#8217; There are very artful things that we have included in here. And there are very simple choices.&#8221;</p>

<p>And talking about personalization, with the BMW ID, the company now offers a new system for saving those personalized settings on your smartphone and the new My BMW app.</p>

<p>With this update, BMW is also launching the next generation of its BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which made its debut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/bmw-launches-a-personal-voice-assistant-for-its-cars/">at TechCrunch Disrupt a few years ago</a>. Built on top of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Cognitive Services, the improved in-car assistant will get better at interacting with drivers through a more natural dialog, but in addition to voice interactions, BMW is now also adding more visual components and integrating the assistant with its gesture recognition capabilities. We&#8217;ll have to see this in action to see how this works in practice. So far, BMW hasn&#8217;t shared a lot of details about these features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125122" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125122" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125122" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In communication between people, a great deal of information is conveyed nonverbally,&#8221; the company explains. &#8220;The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has thus been upgraded with a greater focus on how it is presented visually. This new visualization approach features spheres of light in differing sizes and brightness levels, giving the assistant more space and new ways of expressing itself. This visual image also gives it a “face” with a clearly visible point of focus and identifiable states of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like with the iDrive 7 system, this new operation system will also support remote software upgrades, either over the air thanks to the car&#8217;s built-in SIM card and cell connectivity (up to 5G for the iX) or through the My BMW app.</p>
<p>As for current cars with the iDrive 7, Weber noted that those cars will get some of the features from iDrive 8 that can be ported back to it &#8212; and iDrive 7 will continue to get updates as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125165" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125165" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit like in the smartphone world,&#8221; Weber said. &#8220;All the things &#8212; and the good and interesting new things from iD8 that can be transferred to iD7, iD7 we&#8217;ll get those upgrades. But like a particular function on a phone, not all of them can be transferred back to the previous generation. So most of it can be transferred, but not all of them. But certainly, we will continue to work on updating the previous generation. We won&#8217;t stop that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a side note, Weber also addressed the current chip shortage that has led some car manufacturers to slow down production. He noted that since about Christmas, BMW is &#8220;fighting for every single production day&#8221; but hasn&#8217;t lost one yet. He wasn&#8217;t willing to make any forecasts, but noted that the company has started to develop alternative solutions on the engineering side. &#8220;So far, we are really able and capable of adjusting our pipeline, so that we didn&#8217;t have to stop any production at this point,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I changed things up this week to make room for an interview we had with Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology over at GM. That means I don&#8217;t have the typical roundup at the bottom of EVERYTHING, or most things, that happened this week. But don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll bring that back next issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might recall, or maybe not, that GM president Mark Reuss announced last week a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/gm-partners-with-startup-solidenergy-systems-to-pack-more-energy-in-its-batteries/">partnership with SolidEnergy Systems</a>, an MIT spinoff. GM and SES plan to work together to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. The companies are going to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts and aim to have a high-capacity, pre-production battery by 2023.</p>
<p>As one reader pointed out to me, the partnership is an interesting next step in GM&#8217;s interest in SES. Five years ago, GM Ventures, the VC arm of the automaker, invested in SES. <a href="https://www.ses.ai/about/">Rohit Makharia,</a> a longtime engineer turned investment manager at GM Ventures, is now the COO at SES. In other words, this isn&#8217;t some casual relationship.</p>
<p>Scroll below for a Q&amp;A with Lelli.</p>

<p>After the partnership between GM and SolidEnergy Systems was announced, we (meaning me and TC reporter Rebecca Bellan) jumped on the phone with Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology at GM, to try and learn about the automaker&#8217;s battery plans.</p>
<p>Specifically, we wanted to find out if SES was going to be providing the tech for the next generation of Ultium batteries. I&#8217;m not talking about the first generation of Ultium batteries that are going in the upcoming GMC Hummer. We&#8217;re talking next generation. We also wanted to learn more about GM&#8217;s approach to battery development.</p>
<p>The interview with Lelli was edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH: </b>You’ve said that GM is trying to increase energy twofold and reduce the cost of batteries by 60%. So are you aiming to work directly with SolidEnergy Systems on building the next generation of Ultium batteries?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: The SolidEnergy Systems arrangement includes building a prototype line in Massachusetts. So, this new technology will be built on that line.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Are you looking at any other battery tech startups to help speed R&amp;D along?</p>
<p><strong>LELLI</strong>: I would just say, stay tuned on that; we have a lot more to announce in the future. In the meantime, work is continuing on lithium-metal batteries and other related technologies at our R&amp;D lab. We&#8217;re working on many different technologies at this point, including high voltage cathode, electrolytes, dry processing, battery raw materials, etc.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: GM already has a lot of critical IP in the space of lithium metal batteries. How is SES filling in the gaps?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: Well they have strengths and we have strengths and that&#8217;s the beauty of this arrangement. SolidEnergy Systems</span> is a very innovative technology company and they offer many novel ideas around lithium metal anode technology, and manufacturing and, of course, we do as well. That&#8217;s where their strength is.</p>
<p>They also have a strength in electrolytes, but we have a strength in electrolytes as well and we have IP around electrolytes that we think could be an enabler to this technology. We have 49 patents and over 45 pending in this lithium metal space, so we&#8217;ve been working on it for a while. This isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve thought about, you know, a year ago and saying, &#8220;Hey what are we going to do next?&#8221; This is stuff we&#8217;ve been working on for quite some time.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: How is GM thinking about pushing for reductions in nickel and cobalt? Is that a priority?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: When we came out with the event last year on the Ultium battery, we were very focused on the precious metals. And you may remember that we commented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that our cathode would be NCMA &#8212; nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum. We said that technology we were taking on because it was able to reduce cobalt by over 70%, and we’re able to do that by building a cathode with aluminum. </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re always focused on these raw materials and reducing high-cost materials and materials that are hard to get. That&#8217;s part of my group&#8217;s job; my group is responsible for the technology roadmap relative to all these different spaces within the cell: the cathode active material, separator, electrolyte, anode material, the different ways to process the cathode in manufacturing — right now we have a wet process and if we can get dry to work, it&#8217;ll be less expensive. We work in all of these spaces simultaneously to reduce costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty with the SolidEnergy arrangement is that we can put any of those cathodes that we develop and we can tie that to the lithium metal anode. The key work we&#8217;re doing with SolidEnergy is getting the lithium anode technology to work, and then we can, at some point in time, continue to change the cathode part of that cell for further cost reduction and less reliance on some of these critical battery materials out there.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: The work around the anode is really the key to unlocking that energy density, is my understanding. Are there any other benefits?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: Equally important is the electrolyte. Because the electrolyte is not just a commodity where you can buy it and put it in. It has the electrochemistry and the kinetic of electrochemistry in the cell are very dependent on the electrolyte. </span></p>
<p>And so the life of a cell will be very dependent on what electrolyte — and the electrochemistry behind that electrolyte — and how it reacts with the materials you&#8217;re using, like lithium.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lithium gives us energy density, but then you also have to design a cell that lasts many cycles, and so to do that you have to understand all the other parts and pieces of the cell that enable that. An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrolyte is an extremely critical part of that. </span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Is SES only working with GM or is it working with other automakers or clients?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: SolidEnergy Systems can work with other OEMs and, of course, we can work with other technologies. We&#8217;re not restricting SolidEnergy Systems in any way.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: What are you expecting the range to be for the next generation of Ultium batteries?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: It&#8217;s conceivable that the range of our production in lithium metal batteries could be as high as 500 to 600 miles, but that really depends on the car you’re putting it into. If you put the same battery in a truck, it&#8217;s not going to have the range that if we took that same battery and put it in a small car. It really depends on the product you&#8217;re putting the battery in to answer that question, but to give you a frame of reference, 500 to 600 miles is conceivable.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Has GM identified which vehicles will receive the first generation Ultium battery, besides the GMC Hummer?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cadillac Lyriq and the Cruise Origin will be among the first. </span></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I predicted that Via was going to have a big year; I was right. The on-demand shuttle startup turned mobility-as-a-service provider has been expanding, snapping up contracts with cities globally. And now it&#8217;s expanding through acquisitions.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">bought Remix</a>, the startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design, for $100 million in cash and equity. Remix will become a subsidiary of Via, an arrangement that will let the startup maintain its independent brand. Remix’s 65 employees and two of its co-founders — CEO Tiffany Chu and CTO Dan Getelman — will stay on.</p>
<p>Remix’s strength is in planning, while Via brings expertise in software and operations. The acquisition should nicely round out Via&#8217;s current business and help it capture more customers, which currently number more than 350 local governments in 22 countries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure that Via is done. I expect more deal-making — maybe even a bid to go public — by this company that last year hit a $2.25 billion valuation after raising $400 million in a Series E round.</p>
<h3><b>Other deals that got my attention … </b></h3>
<p><b>Damon Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric motorcycle company, raised more than $30 million in funding, completing a bridge round led by Benevolent Capital, SOL Global Investments, Zirmania and others.</span></p>
<p><strong>FlexClub</strong>, the South African-based car subscription startup founded in 2019,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace/"> raised $5 million</a> in equity and debt. This is a seed extension round, bringing the total investment raised by FlexClub to over $6 million. The company recently expanded to Mexico.</p>
<p><b>Optibus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the transit-focused software-as-service company based in Israel,</span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/10/optibus-launches-new-ai-platform-to-help-cities-plan-transit-routes/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $107 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round co-led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><strong>Populus AI</strong>, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2017, has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/populus-ai-plots-expansion-with-5m-in-new-funding/"> raised $5 million</a> from new investors Storm Ventures and contract manufacturing and supplier company Magna along with existing backers Precursor, Relay Ventures and Ulu Ventures. The company has raised nearly $9 million to date.</p>
<p><strong>Zego</strong>, the insurtech that got its start by offering flexible motorbike insurance for gig economy workers, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/zego-unicorn/">raised $150 million</a>. DST Global led the London-based company&#8217;s C round, which gave it a $1.1 billion valuation and a unicorn status.  Other new backers include General Catalyst, whose founder and MD, Joel Cutler, joins Zego&#8217;s board. Zego has since expanded its business to offer a range of tech-enabled commercial motor insurance products.</p>
<h2>A deep dive: The Volkswagen ID. 4</h2>

<p>I recently brought on Abigail Bassett, a World Car Juror and longtime journalist who writes about cars and tech (among other topics) to review some of the most important vehicles of 2021. Last month, Tamara Warren (another longtime reporter in autos and tech) reviewed the Aston Martin DBX, a vehicle that is critical to the automaker&#8217;s survival.</p>
<p>This month, Bassett takes a deep dive into the Volkswagen ID. 4, a five-passenger, fully electric crossover with a starting price of $33,995 (before federal or state incentives).</p>
<p>The ID. 4 matters. A lot. Volkswagen, once a dabbler in electric vehicles, is now betting its future on the technology.</p>
<p>Did the ID.4 make the grade? Bassett tested it on three different occasions. I suggest you read the whole article, but for those busy folks here is the tl;dr: The VW ID.4 offers a balanced blend of technology, comfort and design for a more affordable price. It offers solid technology without being so out of this world that your average crossover buyer will balk … with one exception. The lack of seamless charging makes finding and then connecting to a third-party charging station a clunky, even complex experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A ban by Amsterdam authorities on housing owners offering their properties for vacation rentals in three central districts of the popular tourist city has been overturned after a court ruled it has no basis in law.</p>
<p>City authorities had been responding to concerns over the impact of tourist platforms like Airbnb on quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>An update to the city&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/wonen-leefomgeving/wonen/vakantieverhuur/vergunning/?fbclid=IwAR3pHxkD4dtae98Ri9FFYbzY9O6vHZPxYp80yG7U-R31ectYGzMMn8-awu0">website</a> notes that, from tomorrow, it will be possible for property owners to apply for a holiday rental permit in the three neighborhoods where vacation rentals had been entirely banned from July 1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amsterdam-ejects-airbnb-el-at-from-three-central-districts-in-latest-p2p-platform-limits/">last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>City authorities write that they are studying the court ruling and will update the page &#8220;as soon as more is known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amsterdam&#8217;s authorities took the step of prohibiting vacation rentals in the Burgwallen-Oude Zijde, Burgwallen-Nieuwe Zijde and Grachtengordel-Zuid districts last summer after a consultation process found widespread support among residents for a ban.</p>
<p>Authorities said strong growth in tourist rentals was impacting quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>It has also previously introduced a permit system to control vacation rentals in other districts of the city &#8212; which limits rentals to (currently) a maximum of 30 nights per year and for a maximum of four people per rental.</p>
<p>A further condition of the permit states that: &#8220;Your guests [must] not cause any inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the court ruling that permit system will operate in the three central districts too.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s ban on vacation rentals in the central districts was challenged by an association (Amsterdam Gastvrij) that represents the interests of homeowners who rent their properties through Airbnb and other platforms. They had argued that the<span class=""> Housing Act 2014 did not provide a legal basis for a prohibition on holiday rental.  </span></p>
<p><span class="">The Court of Amsterdam agreed, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1017">writing</a> in its judgement that &#8220;<span class="emphasis">a system of permits cannot contain a total prohibition.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""><span class="emphasis">&#8220;Anyone who meets the conditions of the permit is in principle eligible for a permit. A total ban is a major infringement of the right to property and the free movement of services and will only be seen as a justified measure in very exceptional circumstances,&#8221; it further emphasized. </span></span></p>
<p>An Airbnb spokesperson told us the company was not involved in the proceedings to challenge the ban<span class=""> but the spokesperson was keen to highlight the outcome. </span></p>
<p>However the court&#8217;s verdict leaves room for the city to amend legislation to add new conditions to the permit system that could include a &#8220;quality of life&#8221; consideration (which it does not currently).</p>
<p>The court also suggests the possibility of a quota system with a night criterion being introduced under existing legislation, as another means of using the permit system to manage quality of life. It further suggests city authorities could enforce residential (rather than touristic) purposes for houses via a zoning plan. So there are alternative avenues for <span class="">Amsterdam&#8217;s officials</span> to explore as a policy tool to limit activity on Airbnb et al.</p>
<p>At the same time the court ruling underlines the challenges European cities face in trying to regulate the impacts of rental platforms on areas like housing availability (and affordability) and wider quality of life issues for residents dealing with over-tourism (not currently an issue, of course, given ongoing travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic).</p>
<p>In recent years a number of major tourist cities in Europe have expressed public frustration over vacation rental platforms &#8212; penning an <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/nieuwsarchief/persberichten/2019/persberichten-laurens-ivens/press-release-cities-alarmed-about/">open letter</a> to the European Commission back in 2019 that called for &#8220;strong legal obligations for platforms to cooperate with us in registration-schemes and in supplying rental-data per house that is advertised on their platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cities must protect the public interest and eliminate the adverse effects of short-term holiday rental in various ways. More nuisances, feelings of insecurity and a ‘touristification’ of their neighbourhoods is not what our residents want. Therefore (local) governments should have the possibility to introduce their own regulations depending on the local situation,&#8221; they also wrote, urging EU policymakers to support a rethink of the rules.</p>
<p>Since then the Commission has announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/airbnb-and-three-other-p2p-rental-platforms-agree-to-share-limited-pan-eu-data/">limited data-sharing arrangement</a> with the leading vacation rental platforms, saying it wants to encourage “balanced” development of peer-to-peer rentals.</p>
<p>Last year the Dutch government <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/dutch-deputy-prime-minister-calls-for-digital-services-act-regulation-against-airbnb/">pressed the Commission to go further over data access to vacation rental platforms</a> &#8212; pushing for a provision to be included in a major planned update to pan-EU rules wrapping digital services, aka the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>.</p>
<p>The DSA proposal, which is now going through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, is broadly targeted at standardizing processes for tackling illegal goods and services &#8212; so it could have implications for vacation platforms in areas like data-sharing where it relates to illegal vacation rentals (i.e., where a property is advertised without a required permit).</p>

		Michael Fouquet is CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.getstark.co">Stark</a>, a startup that provides integrated accessibility tools for product design and development teams.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">For too many companies, accessibility wasn&#8217;t baked into their products from the start, meaning they now find themselves trying to figure out how to inject it retrospectively. But bringing decades-long legacy code and design into the future isn&#8217;t easy (or cheap).</p>
<p>Businesses have to overcome the fear and uncertainty about how to do such retrofitting, address the lack of education to launch such projects, and balance the scope of these iterations while still maintaining other production work.</p>
<p>Among the U.S. adult population, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html">26%</a> live with some form of disability, and businesses that are ignorant or slow to respond to accessibility needs are producing digital products for a smaller group of users. Someone who is a neophyte might not be able to use a product with overwhelming cognitive overhead. Someone using a product that isn&#8217;t localized may not be able to refill their prescription in a new country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We recently saw this play out in the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-02-09/viral-cat-lawyers-response-to-zoom-filter-mishap-is-purr-fect">cat lawyer</a>” episode, which the kitten-faced attorney took in good humor. But it also reminded us that many people struggle with today’s basic tools, and for those who don’t, it’s hard to understand just how much this disrupts people’s personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder with a software product out there, you probably won’t receive as loud an alarm bell as a viral cat filter video to tell you that something’s wrong. At least not immediately. Unfortunately, that time will come because social media has become the megaphone for support issues. You want to avoid that final, uncontrollable warning sign. Here are four other warning signs that make clear your product is not as accessible as you might think &#8212; and how you can address that.</p>
<h2>1. You didn’t define a11y principles at the start of your journey</h2>
<p>Accessibility is a key ingredient in your product cake &#8212; and it&#8217;ll always taste best when it&#8217;s added to the mix at the beginning. It&#8217;s also more time- and cost-effective, as fixing a usability issue after the product has been released can cost up to<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280742273_The_impact_of_usability_on_the_cost_of_quality"> 100 times more</a> than earlier on in the development process.</p>
<p>Your roadmap should work toward the four<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head"> principles</a> of accessibility, described using the acronym POUR.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong>erceivable: Your users need to be able to perceive all of the information displayed on your user interface.</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>perable: Your users must be able to operate and navigate your interface components.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong>nderstandable: Your content and the functioning of your user interface must be clearly understandable to users.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>obust: Your content has to be robust enough that a wide variety of users can continue to access it as technologies advance, including assistive technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without following each of these principles consistently, you cannot guarantee that your product is accessible to everybody.</p>
<p>The roadmap should integrate accessibility efforts into the design, development and quality assurance process, all the way through to product release and updates, where the cycle starts all over.</p>
<p>This means it’s vital to have everyone on your team informed and committed to accessibility. You could even go further and nominate one person from each team to lead the accessibility process and be responsible for each team’s compliance. It’s worth starting any new project with an accessibility audit so you understand exactly where your gaps are. And by syncing with sales and support teams, you can identify where users are experiencing friction.</p>
<p>This baking process helps you avoid legal problems in the future as a result of non-compliance. In 2019, a blind man<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20hands%20victory%20to%20blind%20man%20who%20sued%20Domino's%20over%20site%20accessibility,-Published%20Mon%2C%20Oct&amp;text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20denied%20a,court%20decision%20against%20the%20company."> successfully sued</a> Domino’s after he was unable to order food on the Domino’s website and mobile app, despite using screen-reading software. Beyoncé’s company was<a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/21/beyonce-lawsuit-website-ada-compliant/"> sued</a> by a blind woman that same year. Product owners are wide open to lawsuits if they don’t implement the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>To help you on your way,<a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/"> IBM’s Carbon Design System</a> is an open-source design system for digital products that offers free guidelines to build an accessible product, including for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. In addition, software tools exist that can help you do accessibility checks ahead of time rather than when the product is finished.</p>
<h2>2. You’re treating a11y like a set-it-and-forget-it</h2>
<p>Design trends evolve fast in the tech world. Your team is probably staying on top of the latest software or mobile features, but are they paying attention to accessibility?</p>
<p>A11y needs maintenance; the requirements for the web and mobile platforms are changing all the time and it&#8217;s important (as well as necessary) to stay on top of those changes. If you’re not carrying out constant tweaks and upgrades, chances are that you’ve racked up a few accessibility issues over time.</p>
<p>Plan regular meetings where you review and discuss your products&#8217; accessibility and a11y compliance. Look at what other products are doing to be more accessible and attend courses about inclusive design (e.g.,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/learn-about-the-importance-of-accessible-product-design-at-techcrunch-sessions-justice/"> TechCrunch Sessions</a>). Platforms like<a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/"> the A11Y Project</a> are also incredibly useful resources for teams to stay up to date, and they also offer books, tutorials, professional support and professional testers.</p>
<h2>3. You and your team haven’t tried out a11y tools</h2>
<p>The best accessibility tool you have is your team itself. Building a product with a diverse group of people will mean you encounter and rectify any barriers to use faster and can innovate with greater impact &#8212; after all, people with disabilities are some of the world&#8217;s greatest innovators.</p>
<p>Outside of your team makeup, ask yourself: Have you ever used a screen reader? Or tried to navigate your website using only your keyboard? Seen your designs<a href="https://www.getstark.co/"> simulated against various types of vision</a>?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, chances are you’re letting key accessibility features slip through the cracks. By putting yourself in the shoes of someone with impairments, these tools force you toward a better appreciation of their needs.</p>
<p>Try and get your team using these tools as early as possible, especially if you’re struggling to convey to them the importance of a11y. Once you’ve broadened your perspective, it’ll genuinely be harder to <em>not</em> see how people with different abilities are experiencing your product. Which is why you should come back to your product afterward, as a user, and explore it through a new lens.</p>
<h2>4. You aren’t talking to your users</h2>
<p>Lastly, there’s little chance you’ve built a truly accessible product without actually talking to its users. The general population is the most diverse set of critics to warn you if your product’s falling short for people of different backgrounds and abilities. Every single user experiences a product uniquely, and regardless of all the effort you’ve put in until now, there will likely be issues.</p>
<p>Lend an ear to a wide range of users, throughout the product life cycle. You can do this by doing user testing with each update, asking users to complete surveys on their in-app experience, and holding focus groups that proactively enlist people with a spectrum of needs.</p>
<p>Accessible design is just good design. It’s a misconception that it only improves UX for people with disabilities &#8212; it provides a better experience for everyone. And all founders want their product to reach as many people as possible. Once you put in the initial effort and embrace it, it becomes easier, like another tool in your kit. You won’t get it 100% right on the first try. But this is about progress, not perfection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic boosted U.S. online shopping by $183 billion, according to a new report by Adobe&#8217;s e-commerce division, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/15/adobe-digital-economy-index-covid-19-report.html#gs.vp3vqg">released</a> this morning. This figure represents the increase in online shopping during the months of March 2020, when the pandemic began in the U.S, through February 2021. During this time, U.S. consumers spent a total of $844 billion online. Meanwhile, $813 billion was spent during the calendar year 2020 alone, up 42% over 2019. To put this $183 billion in perspective, Adobe notes it&#8217;s nearly the size of the last holiday shopping season, when $188.2 billion was spent online during the months of November and December 2020. The firm expects this growth to continue in the years ahead, reaching $1 billion by 2022.</p>
<p>The pandemic has served as an accelerant to many industries, pushing them years ahead of where their natural growth would have otherwise taken them.</p>
<p>E-commerce benefitted from this trend as well, as consumers faced stay-at-home orders, nonessential retailers closed their doors, and in-person shopping was replaced with online commerce for many consumers. Adobe says the pandemic itself produced a &#8220;rare step change in online spending, equivalent to a 20% boost,&#8221; and noted the impacts will continue even as the pandemic comes to an end in the months to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s analysts, for example, noted that the first two months of 2021 (Jan.-Feb. 2021), have already seen consumer spending of $121 billion in the U.S, or a 34% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>Also during this time, the buy-now-pay-later method for online shopping has jumped up by 215% year over year, with orders that are 18% larger &#8212; another factor in the growing sales driven by these changes.</p>
<p>Adobe predicts that current growth rates will continue, leading to 2021 calendar year sales of somewhere between $850 billion and $930 billion. It then expects 2022 to deliver the first trillion-dollar year for U.S. e-commerce.</p>
<p>Beyond the e-commerce sales increases, the pandemic may have also led to other long-lasting changes in terms of how people shop and what they&#8217;re buying.</p>
<p>Adobe said that both in-store and curbside pickup services had grown in adoption by 67% year over year, as of Feb. 2021. Consumers seem very receptive to this hybrid model of shopping, with a recent Adobe survey finding that 30% of U.S. consumers actually prefer pickup over standard delivery, for instance.</p>
<p>The shift to regular online shopping may have some later impacts on typical &#8220;sales holidays&#8221; that had, in the past, drawn larger increases in shopper activity. Memorial Day 2020 commerce grew 20% less than other days that week, and resulted in $32 million less revenue, Adobe noted. Labor Day and Presidents Day saw similar trends. And notably, the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday 2020 also contributed 9% less to revenue share during the holiday season, equivalent to $600 million.</p>
<p>There were some indications that retailers haven&#8217;t quite adapted to the surge of new online shoppers, however. &#8220;Out of stock&#8221; messages were common, peaking in July 2020, which saw 3x the number of stockouts compared with a pre-pandemic period. And in Jan. 2021, out of stock messages were elevated at 4x pre-pandemic levels. This was common particularly among groceries, pet products and medical supplies, Adobe said.</p>
<p>Online grocery has also benefited from the change in consumer behavior and doesn&#8217;t show any signs of slowing. In Feb. 2021, the category was up by 230% compared with Jan. 2020, pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Unlike with consumer surveys, Adobe&#8217;s data is derived from trends seen directly in Adobe Analytics, which covers over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and over 100 million SKUs, giving it a more comprehensive, real-time look into the U.S. e-commerce industry and consumer spending.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voyage, the autonomous vehicle startup that spun out of Udacity, has been acquired by Cruise, a deal that points to the continued consolidation within the nascent industry.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; the majority of Voyage&#8217;s 60-person team will move over to Cruise and the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron will take on a new role as vice president of product. Voyage&#8217;s partnership with FCA, now called Stellantis, will also end once the acquisition with Cruise closes.</p>
<p>Voyage, which was founded in 2017, was a tiny startup compared to well-funded operations like Cruise, Argo AI, Waymo and Aurora. But despite its size and only raising $52 million, Cameron helped Voyage stand out. The company is best known for its operations in two senior living communities. Voyage tested and gave rides to people within a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, Calif., as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Voyage’s approach has always been to leverage our limited resources to deliver a product that restores mobility to those who need it most: senior citizens. We’ve made tremendous progress towards this goal, moving countless senior citizens (some as old as 92!) around their communities,&#8221; Cameron <a href="https://news.voyage.auto/voyage-acquired-by-cruise-d5f76011032f">wrote in a blog</a> post announcing the deal. &#8220;Now at Cruise, we are thrilled to have the substantial resources to eventually serve not just senior citizens, but every possible demographic who stands to benefit from self-driving services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voyage won&#8217;t be shutting down operations at the two senior communities immediately. However, Cruise reiterated to TechCrunch that its focus is commercial operations in San Francisco. Inevitably, any testing or operations at the senior communities will come to end, although Cruise did not provide a timeline.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s role as VP of product is another signal that Cruise is inching forward with plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco. Cruise has hired hundreds of engineers, both hardware and software, but it will need to win over customers if it hopes to build a loyal base of robotaxi users. In his new role, Cameron will be the one who will be thinking through every customer touchpoint for Cruise&#8217;s self-driving service.</p>
<p>Cameron described the union of Cruise and Voyage as a &#8220;wonderful marriage,&#8221; in a tweet Monday morning. He noted that Cruise has the &#8220;most advanced self-driving technology, unique auto partners and the first purpose-built self-driving vehicle.&#8221; &#8220;With Voyage and our customer-service obsessed team, we&#8217;ll together deliver a game-changing self-driving product.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Cruise has the funds to put towards this component of the business. Earlier this year, Cruise said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/microsoft-invests-in-cruise-in-new-2-billion-round/">raised $2 billion</a> in a new equity round that has pushed its valuation up to $30 billion and delivered Microsoft as an investor and partner. GM, Honda and other institutional investors also put more capital into Cruise as the autonomous vehicle company inches closer to commercializing its technology.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick hit of what we have in store for April. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/#b0807dca-a87a-47e9-903a-86c80adef221">the agenda</a> and start planning your schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Finding Your Product Market Fit:</strong> Sean Lane, Olive AI’s founder and CEO, is no stranger to the pivot. Hear how he practiced patience in the search for product market fit, how he knew it when he finally found it and tactics he used to build on it.</p>
<p><strong>How to Nail Your Virtual Pitch Meeting:</strong> The rules of the pitch meeting have changed. Instead of traveling across the country, wasting time in planes, trains and automobiles, founders can take upwards of 30 meetings in a day from the comfort of their home. Entrepreneur and VC Melissa Bradley will outline how to make the most of that half hour on Zoom and lock in the next meeting.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl, told us about her time at TC Early Stage 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;TechCrunch offered a great variety of sessions and speakers — top investors, founders and credible subject-matter experts — who gave unique insights based on personal experience. You get great mentorship through attending the Early Stage sessions. It’s like a mini masterclass in entrepreneurship.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mass manufacturing may be the future of 3D printing (one hopes), but health products are very much its present. From orthodontics to prosthesis, medical needs are right in the sweet spot for additive manufacturing. Prototyping is a category with a specific ceiling, while true mass manufacturing is still at an impossible scale for most of these systems. Medical and dental present a larger market that still requires a good deal of customization.</p>
<p>Today, Desktop Metal announced that it <a href="https://www.desktophealth.com/">launched Desktop Health</a>, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125113" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125113" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg 1763w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=1536,1228 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Desktop Health</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Today the world manufactures more than $85 billion in medical and dental implants each year,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop said in a release. “We think a large percentage of these parts could be printed and made patient-specific before the end of the decade, making this market a key opportunity for Desktop Metal.</p>
<p>Dentistry/orthodontics continue to be top of mind (think retainers and Invisalign-style braces, to start), but current and future applications extend beyond that. The list includes things like tissue and graft printing, as the company explores how the process might grow in the future.</p>

<p>Leading the division is Michael Mazen Jafar. The former COO of Evolus will be coming on board as the CEO of the new line. “Desktop Health has a mission to change the way patients experience personalized healthcare, through innovation and science-based solutions,&#8221; he says in the release.</p>
<p>The additive manufacturing company announced plans to go public via SPAC last August. This January, it purchased EnvisionTEC for $300 million. The German company specializes in photopolymer printing, a key emerging technology for dental. It already sported 1,000 dental customers, including Smile Direct Club, which will no doubt serve as a key foundation for the new division.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix&#8217;s original films <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-list-of-nominees-updating-live">received 35 Oscar nominations</a> this year, once again putting the streaming service ahead of ahead of any other Hollywood studios.</p>
<p>“Mank” led the pack with 10 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (David Fincher), Best Actor in a Leading Role (Gary Oldman) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Amanda Seyfried). That doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it a shoo-in to be Netflix&#8217;s first Best Picture winner, however — it’s worth remembering that in 2019, the streamer’s film “Roma” received 10 nominations as well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/24/netflix-roma-oscars/">ultimately winning three awards</a> but not Best Picture. And last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">“The Irishman” went empty-handed despite its 10 noms</a>.</p>
<p>Besides “Mank,” Netflix’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” received six nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Sacha Baron Cohen). And “Crip Camp,” a film from the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground, is nominated for Best Documentary Feature, as is “My Octopus Teacher.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HsRTtcfYii"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">Netflix&#8217;s movies only won two Oscars this year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Netflix&#8217;s movies only won two Oscars this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/embed/#?secret=HsRTtcfYii" data-secret="HsRTtcfYii" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon, meanwhile, received 12 nominations, with six for “Sound of Metal” (including Best Picture). &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; &#8220;One Night in Miami&#8221; and &#8220;Time&#8221; were nominated as well. And Apple received its first two nominations ever, for &#8220;Wolfwalkers&#8221; (Best Animated Feature) and &#8220;Greyhound&#8221; (Best Sound).</p>
<p>Of course, this is a streaming-centric year for movies overall. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing theaters to close across the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/oscars-streaming-coronavirus/">the Oscars temporarily abandoned their requirement</a> that films screen commercially in theaters in order to qualify for wards.</p>
<p>And it’s probably safe to assume that most viewers (Academy members and otherwise) watched these movies via streaming. For example, Best Picture nominee and Golden Globe winner for Best Drama Film winner “Nomadland” was released by Fox Searchlight simultaneously in theaters and on Hulu.</p>
<p>The Academy Awards will air on April 25 at 5pm Pacific on ABC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relativity Space already has a significant volume of launch contracts on the books – more pre-sales for its Terran 1 rocket than any other launch vehicle in history, in fact, according to CEO and co-founder Tim Ellis. But its latest customer is a key one: The U.S. Department of Defense, which has contracted Relativity Space to launch a payload on its behalf as part of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)&#8217;s continued efforts to find responsive launch partners capable of sending payloads with a mass between 450 kg and 1,200 kg (roughly 1,000 to 2,650 lbs) to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger satellite, and there&#8217;s a much limited number of companies that can actually launch this spacecraft,&#8221; Ellis said in an interview. &#8220;[Terran 1&#8217;s] three meter payload fairing is unique, among all the US=based companies that can actually launch that payload size, we&#8217;re still the only one that actually has the fairing big enough for that scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DIU has a specific mandate of working with innovative American companies, typically in the earlier stages of their development, and their collaboration is often seen as a stamp of approval that can set up a company for a much deeper DoD relationship going forward. In this case, citing Relativity&#8217;s relative maturity and its queue of pre-sold missions, which include a number of non-defense government contracts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Experts say Space Force is a vital, massive shift for US military&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/experts-say-space-force-is-a-vital-massive-shift-for-us-military/embed/#?secret=if8VVYTgbJ" data-secret="if8VVYTgbJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In this case, there was just a true mission need for this particular spacecraft,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;And it was a good opportunity to work with them as our first DoD customer, to start on-ramping into a broader ecosystem of capabilities that we&#8217;re hearing the government wants to see. So it&#8217;s all specifically focused on Terran 1, though of course, we now have talked about Terran R, totally independent of this program. It&#8217;s a start of a conversation, and we see lots of opportunities to help support national interests across many different places with all the things that we&#8217;re building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis is referencing Relativity&#8217;s newly-unveiled larger payload spacecraft, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/">Terran R</a>. The 3D printing rocket company debuted its plans for the much larger launch vehicle in February, and it&#8217;s tailor-made for delivering satellite constellations to low-Earth orbit – a need that the DoD has expressed plenty of interest in, given its focus on satellite technologies that offer responsive, redundant capabilities to suit shifting needs.</p>

<hr />
<p>Sadly, despite being bigger than most public companies in revenue terms, and now in possession of a valuation on a par with some of the world&#8217;s leading public companies, Stripe is still being coy with growth metrics. As part of <a href="https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-series-h">its announcement</a>, Stripe provided a few new notes on its recent scale that we&#8217;ll unpack, but we&#8217;re more left to read the entrails of a modest metrics sacrifice at this stage of the company&#8217;s growth.</p>

<p>Today, let&#8217;s examine the company&#8217;s newly shared growth results, compare them to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">what we knew previously</a>, and see if we can suss out why Stripe could be worth $95 billion today, and presumably more when it does float.</p>
<h2>New money, same questions</h2>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s new $600 million investment values the company at $95 billion. As a reference point, Roblox is worth around $38 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">closed 2020 out on a run rate of around $1.24 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Gaming companies and payments companies are very different, but Roblox&#8217;s number gives you a taste of what a company needs to generate in revenue terms in one part of the public markets.</p>
<p>Stripe is likely far larger than Roblox in revenue, but weaker in terms of gross margins. Keep that lens in mind as we remind ourselves of Stripe&#8217;s known numbers, ending with what we learned from its latest disclosures:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/airtable/">Airtable</a>, the no-code relational database that has amassed a customer base that spans 250,000 different organizations, has today announced the close of a $270 million in series E funding. The valuation comes out to $5.77 billion post-money, more than doubling its valuation from September, when it raised $185 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round was led by Greenoaks Capital, with participation from WndrCo, as well as existing investors Caffeinated Capital, CRV, and Thrive.</p>
<p>The company says it plans to use the funding to accelerate the development of its enterprise product and growing the team. Also of note: Founder and CEO Howie Liu told <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2021/03/15/airtable-tops-57-billion-valuation-on-growing-enterprise-sales-and-a-soaring-cloud-market/?sh=925ccf5249a6">Forbes</a> that he was approached by Greenoaks, rather than actively seeking funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airtable is a relational database that many describe as a souped up version of Excel or Google Sheets. Being such, and having the infrastructure to support an app ecosystem on top of that, means that this no-code tool can actually be used to write software. In other words, the use cases are nearly infinite, and so is the potential customer base.</p>
<p>Greenoaks Capital partner Neil Mehta basically said as much in the press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe Airtable is chasing a massive opportunity to become the ‘residual’ software platform for every bespoke and custom use case that is either performed manually today or structurally underserved by rigid third-party software. By equipping business users with fundamental software primitives that can be assembled together into powerful business applications, Airtable has become central to its users’ everyday workflows but at the same time is scalable and extensible enough to support incredibly complex enterprise use cases like ticketing, content management, and CRM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Airtable has raised a total of $617 million since inception, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airtable/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials and GenZers seem interested in investing more than ever these days. As a result, a number of startups have emerged in recent years to give them more options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.trygatsby.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atsby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Monday that it has raised $10 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backers include Techstars Ventures, Beta Bridge Capital, a network of “super angels” placed by ClearList and an oversubscribed SeedInvest campaign. Previous investors include Barclays Bank, SWS Venture Capital, and Rosecliff Ventures, </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Myers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Belanger-Saleh co-founded Gatsby, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commission-free options and stock trading app aimed at younger traders, in 2018. The pair had already one successful exit in Dealtable.com, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">social data room platform.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125073" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125073" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PXL_20210310_200013063.PORTRAIT-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125073" class="wp-caption-text">Co-founders and co-CEOs Jeff Myers (left) and Ryan Balenger-Saleh (right)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/peter-quinn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Quinn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a founder of stock trading service Public.com &#8212; which recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $220 million at a $1.2 billion valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; serves as Gatsby’s chief operations officer and as the company&#8217;s first hire, is considered a member of its founding team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides focusing on a younger demographic, Gatsby aims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give people “a safe and fair platform to trade on without users having to worry about getting in over their heads or being shut out of names when volatility spikes.” The app launched into iOS and Android in early 2020, with the number of signups doubling since the beginning of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also seen a spike in trade volume with cannabis and meme stocks ranking among its most popular trades of the year so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby aims to take on Robinhood by offering traders no commission trading, no per-contract fees and “with no excessive jargon.” Beyond that, it also offers users a way to earn revenues from trade activity through a rewards program or as Myers puts it, “get paid to trade.” It also hosts a social network that can be a source for trade ideas or a place for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby traders to share on their wins (or commiserate their losses).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that PFOF (payment for order flow) is a fundamentally better pricing model than commissions for users trading on small accounts as long as customers feel like their broker is being fair and honest about execution quality and how they make money,” Myers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second quarter, Gatsby plans to launch a feature called ‘Gatsby Circles,’ through which traders can create groups of friends to follow and share trades, and get alerts when someone in their circle executes a trade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital “to grow aggressively” in 2021. Specifically, the company plans to expand in engineering and brokerage operations over the course of the year. It plans to boost its 12-person team by another “10 to 20 heads” over the next three quarters, according to Myers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s goal is to have over 100,000 accounts by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby also plans to launch additional research tools for more sophisticated options traders, as well as more advanced strategies. Down the line, the startup is also planning to launch crypto-trading features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also working on building an adaptive interface. This means that Gatsby’s algorithm will assess the trader and adjust the feature set and interface to be tailored for that user depending on their experience level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jordan French, an early stage investor in Gatsby and publisher at Grit Daily News, Myers and Belanger-Saleh “have the right combination of technology and marketing experience to grow Gatsby into a defensible position that will be very difficult for competitors to unseat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also believes the company’s approach aligns closely with its core investor base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatsby seeks to “shed the ‘fat-cat cronyism’ of legacy financial institutions,” French added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at Canada’s University of Waterloo are <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/259076.php">showcasing work with prostheses and exoskeletons</a> that utilizes cameras and AI to deliver more natural human movement. The ExoNet project leverages video captured by a wearable camera, run through deep learning AI, in order to mimic how humans adapt and adjust movements based on their environments.</p>
<p>The project is an attempt to create more natural locomotion on the fly than is currently offered through systems with connected smartphone apps or other external controllers.</p>
<p>&#8220;That can be inconvenient and cognitively demanding,&#8221; Waterloo PhD candidate Brokoslaw Laschowski said in a release tied to the research. &#8220;Every time you want to perform a new locomotor activity, you have to stop, take out your smartphone and select the desired mode.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The research highlighted primarily focuses on robotic exoskeletons, which are being developed by a number of different companies to help assist people with impaired mobility. The hope here is that the ExoNet system could eventually replace the need for external control by the wearer in order to create more natural locomotion.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Naturally, the system is easier to navigate on flat terrain. Next steps would involve adapting it to environments that tend to give those with limited mobility some difficulty, including stairs and other obstacles. A final version of the system would be able to anticipate and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>“Our control approach wouldn’t necessarily require human thought,” Laschowski adds. “Similar to autonomous cars that drive themselves, we’re designing autonomous exoskeletons that walk for themselves.”</p>
<p>There are other challenges here, as well. Batteries are an issue, for one. The team is looking to improve longevity by experimenting with a system that can recharge with the wearer’s movement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://up.codes/">UpCodes</a>, a startup that develops building code compliance tools, announced today it has raised $3.36 million in pre-Series A funding. This brings its total raised so far to $4.15 million. The new funding was led by Berlin-based Point Nine Capital, which focuses on SaaS and online marketplaces.</p>
<p>The company also recently won a legal victory when United States District Court Judge Victor Marrero granted UpCodes its motion to dismiss a false advertising and unfair competition lawsuit filed against it by the International Code Council (ICC). An earlier copyright lawsuit filed by the ICC against UpCodes is still ongoing, but UpCodes won a major decision in the case last year when Judge Marrero ruled that its posting of building codes is covered by public domain and fair use.</p>

It is also used by rental tenants, landlords, homeowners, general contractors, plumbers, electricians—basically anyone with a question about building code compliance.</p>
<p>UpCodes&#8217; first product was a searchable database of building codes with collaboration tools. Then in 2018 it launched UpCodes AI, a tool that scans 3D models created with building information modeling (BIM) data and alerts architects about potential issues.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s newest feature, its code calculator, is designed for people who have compliance questions, but might not know how to navigate building codes, which differ between municipalities, contain multiple sections and often have amendments attached.</p>
<p>In response to questions like &#8220;how much square footage is allowed per floor,&#8221; &#8220;how many exits does this floor need&#8221; or &#8220;what is the maximum corridor length allowed,&#8221; the code calculator generates a list of requirements, with links to the relevant building code sections. The feature is currently available for more than 40 states as part of UpCodes&#8217; paid plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our end goal is that no matter who you are or what level of sophistication you have with building codes, you can go into a friendly interface and answer your code question,&#8221; said Scott, who worked as an architect before launching UpCodes. He notes that even at architecture, engineering and construction firms, which often work with code consultants as part of their compliance process, employees have differing levels of familiarity with referencing building codes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from users that they&#8217;ll be looking at one particular section of the code, and they&#8217;ll make the building compliant to that, but not realize there&#8217;s a more stringent piece of code somewhere else, like say the fire code compared to the building code,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It causes huge downstream issues because they don&#8217;t have the full picture of it, so that’s what we&#8217;re trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Reynolds brothers compared UpCodes code calculator to tax software like TurboTax, which help people comply with tax laws even if they haven&#8217;t parsed it closely. &#8220;When Americans file their taxes every year, they&#8217;re not cracking open the tax code. They have tax software,&#8221; said Garrett, who was previously a software engineer at PlanGrid. &#8220;We’re very much in the dark ages of compliance and so we want to modernize it and not have people read through the raw building codes, which are much more complicated than tax code.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for hiring, so UpCodes can add new features more quickly, including ones to automate calculations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to keep expanding so that ideally an homeowner on their iPhone, for example, can click and get any kind of compliance answer they want,&#8221; said Scott.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/">Sprinklr</a>, a New York-based customer experience company, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sprinklr-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-for-proposed-initial-public-offering-301247285.html">announced</a> today it has filed a confidential S-1 ahead of a possible IPO.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sprinklr today announced that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) relating to the proposed initial public offering of its common stock,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>It also indicated that it will determine the exact number of shares and the price range at a later point after it receives approval from the SEC to go public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/sprinklr-raises-200m-on-2-7b-valuation-three-years-after-last-investment/">raised $200 million on a $2.7 billion</a> valuation last year. It was its first fundraise in 4 years. At the time, founder and CEO Ragy Thomas said his company expected to end 2020 with $400 million in ARR, certainly a healthy number on which to embark as a public company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>He also said that Sprinklr&#8217;s next fundraise would be an IPO, making him true to his word. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been public about the pathway around this, and the path is that the next financial milestone will be an IPO,&#8221; he told me at the time of the $200 million round. He said that with COVID, it probably was a year or so away, but the timing appears to have sped up.</p>
<p>Sprinklr sees customer experience management as a natural extension of CRM, and as such a huge market potentially worth a $100 billion, according to Thomas. But he also admitted that he was up against some big competitors like Salesforce and Adobe, helping explain why he fundraised last year.</p>
<p>Sprinklr was founded in 2009 with a focus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/sprinklr-joins-unicorn-club/">on social media listening</a>, but it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/sprinklr-launches-major-push-into-customer-experience/">hard push into customer experience</a> in 2017 when it added marketing, advertising, research, customer and e-commerce to its social efforts.</p>
<p>The company has raised $585 million to-date, and has also been highly acquisitive buying 11 companies along the way as it added functionality to the base platform, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

<p>New York-based Garbo was founded in 2018 by Kathryn Kosmides, a survivor of gender-based violence who wanted to make it easier for everyone to be able to have the ability to look up critical information about someone&#8217;s background that could indicate a history of violence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typically, background check services are run by for-profit companies and surface a wide variety of personal information &#8212; like drug offenses or minor traffic violations &#8212; that aren&#8217;t always relevant to matters of safety and abuse. Plus, those types of charges are often levied against members of more vulnerable communities, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">Garbo has pointed out</a>, and aren&#8217;t correlated to gender-based violence.</p>
<p>Garbo instead offers low-cost background checks by collecting public records and reports of violence and abuse only, including arrests, convictions, restraining orders, harassment and other violent crimes. To use the service, a user would enter either a first and last name, or a first name and phone number &#8212; often the only information a dating app users will have on one of their matches.</p>
<p>The service will then perform what it calls an &#8220;equitable background&#8221; check, <a href="https://medium.com/garbo/update-to-garbos-database-policy-to-create-a-more-equitable-background-check-da94028ad715">meaning it will exclude drug possession charges</a> from its results, as well as traffic tickets besides DUIs and vehicle manslaughter.</p>

<p>Last year, the nonprofit launched a beta test of its technology with 500 people in the NYC area, and soon grew its waitlist to over 6,000 entirely by word-of-mouth. Garbo later pulled the test as the team realized the technology had the potential for national scale &#8212; something the team wanted to deliver before launching to the public.</p>
<p>As a small nonprofit without much in terms of financial backing, Garbo also realized a larger partner may be needed in that effort. After Kosmides was connected with Match Group&#8217;s new head of safety, Tracey Breeden, the two companies agreed to work together on bringing the technology to a broader U.S. audience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125056 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="501" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg 1484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=768,326 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=680,289 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Garbo-Logo.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;For far too long women and marginalized groups in all corners of the world have faced many barriers to resources and safety,&#8221; said Breeden, Match Group&#8217;s Head of Safety and Social Advocacy, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We recognize corporations can play a key role in helping remove those barriers with technology and true collaboration rooted in action. In partnership with Match Group, Garbo’s thoughtful and groundbreaking consumer background check will enable and empower users with information, helping create equitable pathways to safer connections and online communities across tech,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>This is Match Group&#8217;s second investment in an outside safety technology provider to enhance its dating apps&#8217; feature sets. In early 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">invested in Noonlight</a> to help it power new safety features inside Tinder and other dating apps following a damning investigative report <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one">by ProPublica and Columbia Journalism Investigations</a>, published in December 2019. The report revealed how Match Group allowed known sexual predators to use its apps. It also noted that Match Group didn’t have a uniform policy of running background checks on its dating app users, putting the responsibility on users to keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tinder&#8217;s top competitor Bumble has been marketing itself as a more women-friendly alternative to traditional dating apps like Tinder, and has rolled out a number of features designed to keep users safe from bad actors &#8212; including, most recently, a way to prevent them from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/bumbles-new-feature-prevents-bad-actors-from-using-unmatch-to-hide-from-their-victims/">using the app&#8217;s &#8220;unmatch&#8221; option to hide from their victims.</a></p>
<p>Given that gaining a reputation for being an &#8220;unsafe&#8221; app could be significantly damaging to a brand like Tinder and the larger online dating industry as a whole, it&#8217;s obvious why Match Group is now directly investing to address this problem. With the Noonlight investment, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">Match Group promised features</a> like a discreet way to trigger emergency services inside the Tinder app, similar to the feature found in Uber and Lyft, plus other anti-abuse measures.</p>
<p>Match Group says Garbo will use the new investment to hire across product, engineering and in leadership &#8212; including a head of engineering and an initial team of five engineers. This team will work to build out Garbo&#8217;s capabilities, using technologies like natural language processing and AI.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NKQKFSzY42"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals/">Accessing social groups through referrals</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Accessing social groups through referrals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/accessing-social-groups-through-referrals/embed/#?secret=NKQKFSzY42" data-secret="NKQKFSzY42" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Garbo will also benefit from sizable contributions of time and resources from Match Group, as its gets its product fully operational and then rolled out across Match Group products, starting with Tinder. And Match Group will help Garbo make the nonprofit&#8217;s technology accessible to other platforms, as well &#8212; like ridesharing companies.</p>
<p>Once live in Tinder, the background check feature may not be free, however.</p>
<p>Instead, Match Group says it will work to determine the pricing based on things like what user adoption looks like, how many people want to use it, how many searches they want to perform and other factors. It also hasn&#8217;t yet determined how deep the integration may be &#8212; whether, for example, it will link outside the app to Garbo or make it seem more like an in-app feature.</p>
<p>Match Group doesn&#8217;t have any exact time frame for the feature&#8217;s launch beyond &#8220;later this year&#8221; for Tinder, to be followed by other U.S. dating apps. The company may consider looking into similar investments for its services aimed at international users in the months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Elon Musk made $25 billion in one day. On Monday, he crowned himself “Technoking of Tesla.” In Musk-speak, this new title still translates into the chief executive officer of the electric car company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eccentric billionaire is nothing if not creative with his dubs (see: Offspring named X Æ A-Xii.) Zach Kirkhorn, the company’s chief financial officer, has also been bestowed the title of Master of Coin. A nod to &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game of Thrones</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; Honestly, who knows? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new appellations were announced via a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021012981/tsla-8k_20210315.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which reads: </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Effective as of March 15, 2021, the titles of Elon Musk and Zach Kirkhorn have changed to Technoking of Tesla and Master of Coin, respectively. Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This title change follows Musk’s announcement last month that Tesla might start accepting bitcoin as a form of payment in the near future. The cryptocurrency’s stock price hit a new high of $61,788 over the weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this is Musk&#8217;s not-so-subtle way of trying to let the world know who reigns supreme, especially after being bumped by Jeff Bezos as the richest person on the planet and after being </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/elon-musk-tesla-board-sued-in-lawsuit-alleging-erratic-tweets-violate-fiduciary-duty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued by a Tesla investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his continuous “erratic tweets” that potentially expose the electric vehicle company to fines and penalties that could drive its share price down. </span></p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s announcement had a negligible impact on the stock price. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s stock is up 1.5% in morning trading. Tesla shares had an impressive 600% soar in 2020. However, the stock is now down 20% for the year from a high of $880.82 reached January 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla also disclosed on Monday that Jerome Guillen, president of automotive, will now take on the role of president of Tesla Heavy Trucking. In a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Q4 earnings call, Musk said he expects deliveries of the Tesla Semi to begin this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The engineering work on the freight-hauling truck with an all-electric powertrain is complete, but lack of availability to battery cells might halt production, Musk said during the call. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low-code and no-code tools have been a huge hit with enterprises keen to give their operations more of a tech boost, but often lack the resources to handle more complex integrations. Today, one of the startups that has been building low-code finance tools is announcing funding to tap into that trend and expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://genesis.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a> &#8212; which has to date primarily worked with financial services companies, giving non-technical employees the tools to create ways to monitor and manage<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> real-time risk, high-frequency trades and other activities &#8212; has picked up $45 million. It plans to use the funding to bring the tools it has already built to a wider set of verticals that have some of the same needs to manage risk, compliance and other factors as finance &#8212; healthcare and manufacturing are two examples &#8212; as well as to continue building more into the stack. </span></p>
<p>This Series B includes a mix of financial investors along with strategic backers that speak to who already integrates with Genesis&#8217; tools on their own platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Led by Accel, it also includes participation from new backers GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Salesforce Ventures, in addition to existing investors Citi, Illuminate Financial and Tribeca Venture Partners, who also invested in this round. To give you an idea of who it works with, Citi, ING, London Clearing House and XP Investments are some of Genesis&#8217; customers.</p>
<p>Originally conceived in 2012 in Brazil by a pair of British co-founders &#8212; Stephen Murphy (CEO) and James Harrison (CTO), who cut their teeth in the world of investment banking &#8212; Genesis had raised less than $5 million before this round, mostly bootstrapping its business and leaning on Murphy and Harrison&#8217;s existing relationships in the world of finance to grow its customer base.</p>
<p>Today, Murphy lives in and leads the business from Miami &#8212; where he moved from New York just as the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to gain steam last year &#8212; while James Harrison (CTO) leads part of the team based out of the U.K.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=YSLA3MeqwU" data-secret="YSLA3MeqwU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you might imagine with so little funding before now for a company going on nine years old, Genesis was doing fine financially before this Series B, so the plan is to use the funding specifically to grow faster than it could have on its own steam. The startup is not disclosing its valuation with this round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not really fixated on valuation,&#8221; said Murphy in an interview, who said the funding came about after a number of VCs had approached the startup. &#8220;The most important thing is the future opportunity and where we could take the company with additional funding&#8230; this will help us hyper scale up.&#8221; He did note that the term sheets contained &#8220;some amazing numbers and multiples,&#8221; given the current interest in no-code and low-code technology.</p>
<p>Indeed, the vogue for no-code and low-code tech &#8212; other well-funded names in the crowded space include startups like <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/210114/p53#a210114p53" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/rows-formerly-dashdash-raises-16m-to-build-and-populate-web-apps-using-only-spreadsheet-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rows</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/london-based-gyana-raises-3-9m-for-a-no-code-approach-to-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gyana</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/bryter-raises-16m-for-a-no-code-platform-for-non-technical-people-to-build-enterprise-automation-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/ushur-raises-25m-for-its-no-code-platform-to-build-customer-communication-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushur</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/easysend-raises-16m-from-intel-more-for-its-no-code-approach-to-automating-b2c-interfaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySend</a>, as well as significant launches from Google and Microsoft and other bigger players &#8212; is coming out of two trends colliding.</p>
<p>On one side, we&#8217;ve well and truly entered an era in enterprise technology &#8212; with the same trend playing out in consumer tech, too &#8212; where smart developers are taking sophisticated and complex services and putting &#8220;wrappers&#8221; around them by way of APIs and simpler (low- or no-code) interfaces, so that those sophisticated tools can in turn be integrated and implemented in more places. This saves needing to build or integrate that complexity from scratch and expands access to the processes within those wrappers.</p>
<p>On the other side, the thirst for tech knowledge has become well and truly mainstream and as a result is getting far more democratized. Working in a variety of applications, using different digital tools and devices and seeing the fruits of tech pay off are all second nature to today&#8217;s working world &#8212; whether or not you are a technologist. So it&#8217;s no surprise to see more proactive, non-technical people looking for more ways to get their hands on these tools themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You now have a whole citizen developer world, for example business analysts who understand the solution you want but might not know how to get there,&#8221; Murphy said. &#8220;We play to seasoned developers first but the investment will help us put more low-code and no-code tools into place to widen the tools out to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting out in finance made sense not just because that was where the two founders had previously worked, but also because of the history of how different software tools were already being used. Specifically, he noted that the ubiquity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">microservices</a> &#8212; which themselves are collections of services as apps &#8212; laid the groundwork for more low-code. &#8220;We saw that if we could build a low-code entry point to microservices, that would be powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, investment banks, he said, have a history of wanting to build things themselves to tailor to their specific needs. &#8220;Buying off the shelf means you are at the mercy of the vendor,&#8221; he said. These factors made financial services companies very receptive to what Genesis was offering.</p>
<p>While a lot of the no/low-code players are coming at the concept with specific verticals in mind &#8212; no surprise, since different verticals have very specific use cases and needs &#8212; what&#8217;s interesting with Genesis is how the company is leveraging what it already knows about finance, and then looking at other industries that have similar demands, structures and rules.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Creatio raises $68M as the low-code space keeps attracting huge checks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/creatio-raises-68m-as-the-low-code-space-keeps-attracting-huge-checks/embed/#?secret=A72n2rAmst" data-secret="A72n2rAmst" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Murphy said that Genesis will stay &#8220;very focused on financial markets for 2021&#8221; but that it&#8217;s identified a number of other verticals similar to it, and is actually already seeing some inbound interest from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;A number of people have already approached us from the world of healthcare,&#8221; he said, pointing out that these organizations, like financial services, face challenges around how to audit data and regulations around performing transactions. Manufacturing, meanwhile, has some parallels around the area of complex event processing similar to equity algorithmic trading, he said. (In short, this relates to how external events might trigger more transactions, not unlike how external factors affect manufacturing operations.)</p>
<p>The trend is one that analysts forecast will only grow in the coming years: Gartner, for example, says that by 2024, low-code platforms will account for no less than 65% of all app development activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-code promises business users the autonomy to make their own technology usage and purchase decisions while enabling them to actually build their own applications without having to rely on IT,&#8221; said Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, said in a statement. “By bringing one of the most transformative innovations in software development to financial services, Steve and the Genesis team are taking on a huge market of legacy vendors &#8212; and winning too &#8212; while delivering on the promise of low-code. The confidence they’ve gained from serving such large institutions is proof that there’s a real and urgent need for a purpose-built low-code solution for financial markets. We’re excited to partner with Genesis and support them in delivering this across the world.&#8221; Brasoveanu is joining the startup&#8217;s board with this round.</p>

A second plant in Germany will commence production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also announced serious investments in charging infrastructure across China, Europe and the United States. It aims to grow its fast-charging network in Europe to 18,000 stations with its partner IONITY, 17,000 charging points in China through its joint venture CAMS New Energy Technology, and to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the United States by 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company’s first dedicated battery event, a clear nod <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/future-teslas-will-have-batteries-that-double-as-structure-making-them-extra-stiff-while-improving-efficiency-safety-and-cost/">to Tesla’s Battery Day</a>, also included a deep dive into novel battery chemistries that will reduce costs by up to 50%. The cell also paves the way for the transition to a solid-state battery cell, which the company anticipates for the middle of the decade. VW has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">significant investments</a> in solid-state battery manufacturer QuantumScape.</p>
<p>Volkswagen&#8217;s new Unified Premium Battery platform will be rolled out in 2023 and will be used across 80% of its EV models. The first to contain the new battery, the Audi Artemis, will be rolled out in 2024.</p>
<p>Scania AB, VW&#8217;s brand of heavy-duty trucks and buses, also has plans to increase its share of EVs. Departing from other major heavy-duty players that have opted for hydrogen fuel cells, company representatives on Monday said that it is unequivocally possible to electrify the heavy-duty transportation sector.</p>
<p>Looking to the battery&#8217;s end-of-life, VW said it will be able to recycle up to 95% of the battery through a process called hydrometallury.</p>
