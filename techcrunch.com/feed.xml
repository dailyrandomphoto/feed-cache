										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.helloagora.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has built a materials management platform for contractors, has raised $33 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8VC, Tishman Speyer, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang, Michael Ovitz, DST, LeFrak and Kevin Hartz also participated in the financing, which brings the startup’s total raised since its 2018 inception to about $45 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction tech is one of those sectors that has not historically been considered “sexy” in a startup world that often favors glitzier technology. But construction fuels the commercial and real estate industries, which in turn impacts all of us in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the $10 trillion construction industry has long been plagued with productivity challenges. In fact, according to McKinsey,</span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Operations/Our%20Insights/Reinventing%20construction%20through%20a%20productivity%20revolution/MGI-Reinventing-construction-A-route-to-higher-productivity-Full-report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">labor productivity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth in the industry has been stagnant since 1947.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189035" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189035" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2189035 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg 2564w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=768,1552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=760,1536 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=1014,2048 1014w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Quick-Order-iPhone-1.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agora</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Rioumine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Ryan Gibson founded Agora with the mission of making it easier for commercial trade contractors to order and track materials, automate manual data entry and give everyone involved in the procurement process a single platform by which they can communicate with each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end goal is to help projects move along faster, and contractors to avoid unnecessary delays by reducing building costs. The bigger picture impact, Agora hopes, is that its SaaS platform can help make the “built environment faster and more efficient to build,” and thus help make cities “more affordable and accessible to all.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Agora is tackling the problem in a very specific, niche way that is proving to be popular both with contractors and investors alike. Rather than attempting to be a blanket solution for all trades, Agora is focusing on specific trade verticals, one by one. For example, it started out with electrical and is now moving into mechanical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, there was more than $101 billion worth of electrical work done. Our customers work on all types of products,” Rioumine told TechCrunch. “For example, we have customers that do power stations, some that build hospitals and others that build school classrooms and university campuses, and still others that build churches and casinos. The work that these contractors do is so essential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agora’s annual recurring revenue has grown 760% year over year while its customer base is up 6x during the same time frame, according to the company. It has also tripled its headcount to 45 people and today is processing $140 million in annualized materials volume for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup wasn’t actively raising for the Series B &#8212; instead, investors were proactively offering term sheets, Rioumine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A few investors that knew us well approached us about preempting the round,” she told TechCrunch. “Twelve days after the first </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversation, we had multiple term sheets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Partner John Curtius said he was drawn to Agora’s “unique” trade-specific approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, the startup is “defining the future of procurement in construction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Agora is solving a huge and critical problem,” Curtius wrote via email. “Billions of dollars a year are wasted because of inefficient procurement processes and breakages in the supply chain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform specifically does things like give contractors the ability to: customize templates, create pre-approved materials lists and easily reorder frequently needed items, order from a catalogue that offers more than 400,000 SKUs and eliminate manual data entry, which reduces errors and automates basic processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By bringing both field and office teams onto one digital platform, Agora claims it saves office teams 75% of the time they spend processing purchase orders, and field teams 38% of the time their foremen spend on materials management. In total, the company said its technology can provide up to $300,000 of potential annual savings for its average customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to hire across a number of teams, as well as continue to expand beyond 30 states and into other trade verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There has been this really heavy underinvestment in tech in construction for a long time,” Rioumine said. On average, the technology spend as a proportion of revenue in construction is about 1.5%, “which is actually the lowest of the industries out there where the median is 3.3%,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So when we think about just how large this industry is and how little productivity improvements there have been recently, I think now we have this amazing opportunity to really invest in technology and bring it on to the job sites and into trade contractors’ hands.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Built on Salesforce and Google Cloud platforms, consumer goods companies can use Aforza to digitally transform product distribution and customer engagement.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://aforza.com/">Aforza</a>, developing cloud and mobile apps for consumer goods companies, announced a $22 million Series A round led by DN Capital.</p>
<p>The London-based company’s technology is built on the Salesforce and Google Cloud platforms so that consumer goods companies can digitally transform product distribution and customer engagement to combat issues like unprofitable promotions and declining market share, Aforza co-founder and CEO Dominic Dinardo told TechCrunch. Using artificial intelligence, the company recommends products and can predict the order a retailer can make with promotions and pricing based on factors like locations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.appsruntheworld.com/top-10-consumer-packaged-goods-software-vendors-and-market-forecast/">global market for consumer packaged goods apps</a> is forecasted to reach $15 billion by 2024. However, the industry is still using outdated platforms that, in some cases, lead to a loss of <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2014/aug/2012_CEU_POV_Getting%20Availability%20Right_ENG.pdf">5% of sales</a> when goods are out of stock, Dinardo said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188880" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188880" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188880" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="786" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Aforza-Trade-Promotion-Designer-Mobile-Image.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188880" class="wp-caption-text">Aforza&#8217;s trade promotion designer mobile image. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aforza</p></div></p>
<p>Dinardo and his co-founders, Ed Butterworth and Nick Eales, started the company in 2019. All veterans of Salesforce, they saw how underserved the consumer goods industry was in terms of moving to digital.</p>
<p>Aforza is Dinardo’s first time leading a company. However, from his time at Salesforce he feels he got an education like going to “Marc Benioff’s School of SaaS.” The company raised an undisclosed seed round in 2019 from Bonfire Ventures, Daher Capital, DN Capital, Next47 and Salesforce Ventures.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic happened, which had many of the investors leaning in, which was validation of what Aforza was doing, Dinardo said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Even before the pandemic, the consumer goods industry was challenged with new market entrants and horrible legacy systems, but then the pandemic turned off pathways to customers,” he added. “Our mission is to improve the lives of consumers by bringing forth more sustainable products and packaging, but also helping companies be more agile and handle changes as the biggest change is happening.”</p>
<p>Joining DN Capital in the round were Bonfire Ventures, Daher Capital and Next47.</p>
<p>Brett Queener, partner at Bonfire Ventures, said he helped incubate Aforza with Dinardo and Eales, something his firm doesn’t typically do, but saw a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor.</p>
<p>Also working at Salesforce, he saw the consumer goods industry as a major industry with a compelling reason to make a technology shift as customers began expecting instant availability and there were tons of emerging startups coming into the direct-to-consumer space.</p>
<p>Those startups don’t have a year or two to pull together the kind of technology it took to scale. With Aforza, they can build a product that works both online and off on any device, Queener said. And rather than planning promotions on a quarterly basis, companies can make changes to their promotional spend in real time.</p>
<p>“It is time for Aforza to tell the world about its technology, time to build out its footprint in the U.S. and in Europe, invest more in R&amp;D and execute the Salesforce playbook,” he said. “That is what this round is about.”</p>
<p>Dinardo intends on using the new funding to continue R&amp;D and to double its employee headcount over the next six months as it establishes its new U.S. headquarters in the Northeast. It is already working with customers in 20 countries.</p>
<p>As to growth, Dinardo said he is using his past experiences at startups like Veeva and Vlocity, which was acquired by Salesforce in 2020, as benchmarks for Aforza’s success.</p>
<p>“We have the money and the expertise — now we need to take a moment to breathe, hire people with the passion to do this and invest in new product tiers, digital assets and even payments,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Talkdesk uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service for mid-market and enterprise businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/">Talkdesk</a>, a provider of cloud-based contact center software, announced $230 million in new Series D funding that more than triples the company’s valuation to $10 billion, Talkdesk founder CEO Tiago Paiva confirmed to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>New investors Whale Rock Capital Management, TI Platform Management and Alpha Square Group came on board for this round and were joined by existing investors Amity Ventures, Franklin Templeton, Top Tier Capital Partners, Viking Global Investors and Willoughby Capital.</p>
<p>Talkdesk uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer service for midmarket and enterprise businesses. It counts over 1,800 companies as customers, including IBM, Acxiom, Trivago and Fujitsu.</p>
<p>“The global pandemic was a big part of how customers interact and how we interacted with our customers, all working from home,” Paiva said. “When you think about ordering things online, call, chat and email interactions became more important, and contact centers became core in every company.”</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Talkdesk now has $498 million in total funding since its inception in 2011. It was <a href="https://beta.techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/talkdesk/">a Startup Battlefield contestant</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt NY in 2012. The new funding follows a <a href="https://www.talkdesk.com/news-and-press/press-releases/talkdesk-raises-143-million-in-series-c-funding/">$143 million Series C</a> raised last July that gave it a $3 billion valuation. Prior to that, Talkdesk brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/talkdesk-nabs-100m-at-more-than-1b-valuation-for-its-smart-call-centers/">$100 million</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>The 2020 round was planned to buoy the company’s growth and expansion to nearly 2,000 employees, Paiva said. For the Series D, there was much interest from investors, including a lot of inbound interest, he said.</p>
<p>“We were not looking for new money, and finished last year with more money in the bank that we raised in the last round, but the investors were great and wanted to make it work,” Paiva said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Half of Talkdesk’s staff is in product and engineering, an area he intends to double down in with the new funding as well as adding to the headcount to support customers. The company also has plans to expand in areas where it is already operating — Latin America, Europe, Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>This year, the company unveiled new features, including Talkdesk Workspace, a customizable interface for contact center teams, and Talkdesk Builder, a set of tools for customization across workspaces, routing, reporting and integrations. It also launched contact center tools designed specifically for financial services and healthcare organizations and what it is touting as the “industry’s first human-in-the-loop tool for contact centers and continues to lower the barrier to adopting artificial intelligence solutions.”</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, Talkdesk appointed its first chief financial officer, Sydney Carey, giving the company an executive team of 50% women, Paiva said. Carey has a SaaS background and joins the company from Sumo Logic, where she led the organization through an initial public offering in 2020.</p>
<p>“We were hiring our executive team over the past couple of years, and were looking for a CFO, but with no specific timeline, just looking for the right person,” Paiva added. “Sydney was the person we wanted to hire.”</p>
<p>Though Paiva didn’t hint at any upcoming IPO plans, TI Platform Management co-founders Trang Nguyen and Alex Bangash have followed Paiva since he started the company and said they anticipate the company heading in that direction in the future.</p>
<p>“Talkdesk is an example of what can happen when a strong team is assembled behind a winning idea,” they said in a written statement. “Today, Talkdesk has become near ubiquitous as a SaaS product with adoption across a broad array of industries and integrations with the most popular enterprise cloud platforms, including Salesforce, Zendesk and Slack.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s less than two-decade-old ecosystem is evolving fast. But behind the funding and legitimate hype, there&#8217;s without a doubt plenty of learning that needs to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in running a startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In retrospect, founders in Nigeria do tremendous work when you consider the kind of harsh market they operate in. They are deserving of all the praise they get. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some questionable antics require addressing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are instances when founders know their companies are dying but would rather sink with it (without having a plan) than let someone else lead. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or other instances where founders know there&#8217;s a need to hire someone as CEO to blitz scale their companies but would rather settle for mediocre growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories where startups take drastic actions to save or scale a company are few and far between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> short time in the startup scene, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/adiasowho">Adia Sowho</a>, one of the well-known operators around the region, has been fortunate to experience and live through one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, she <a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/thrive-agric-ceo-steps-down/">became the CEO of Thrive Agric</a>, an agriculture fintech company, guiding it through a turnaround after <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/10/06/thrive-agric-defaulting-insurance/">the COVID-19 pandemic induced a crisis</a> in the business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, she worked as the VP of Growth and managing director, Nigeria, for fintech platform Migo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And outside the startup scene, she was the director of Digital Business at telecom operator 9mobile and is currently <a href="https://technext.ng/2021/08/02/mtn-appoints-thrive-agrics-ceo-adia-sowho-as-its-first-female-cmo/">the chief marketing officer of mobile telecoms giant MTN Nigeria</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch sat down with Sowho to share her experience working as a telecom executive, an operator with Thrive Agric and Migo, her view on how operators can work with founders, her decision to leave the startup scene and how her new journey is all according to plan.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What was your career like before becoming an operator in tech?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a long career across different parts of the mobile telecom space, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with my last role being responsible for digital business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital business in a telco is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that arm of the telco that interfaces with third parties, often startups who have products more innovative than what the telco might have, in its current portfolio, and of interest to customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got that department in its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at 9mobile and grew it to a $100 million revenue aspect of the business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In doing that, I interacted with various sectors and launched a couple of music apps, gaming platforms, content platforms from like, short-form two minutes to longer forms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also did mobile advertising, the Internet of Things and financial services. But the telco industry is very massive, and the infrastructure is very old and difficult to shift into the internet economy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, I was looking for something else to do and having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been bitten by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the startup bug because my team was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the internal startup to 9mobile, I was looking for more of that excitement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And I guess I wanted to put my money where my mouth was.</span></p>
<p><strong>So, why Migo, since a lot of startups existed at the time? I mean, we&#8217;re talking early 2018 here.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 9mobile, I decided to go to Migo because I felt like financial services was critical and the bedrock of a holistic financial system with four elements — savings, credit, insurance and payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in the Nigerian tech scene, a little bit was happening in savings, but to me, it was not a priority in a country that didn&#8217;t have a massive GDP per capita. This period was also still in the early stages of Flutterwave and Paystack and we had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started waking up to payments in a big way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was very little happening in credit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could walk into my bank and get a loan only if the company I worked for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to that bank, and the bank had some visibility of that company&#8217;s finances as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was still tough to access credit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I joined Migo, because I felt like if you don&#8217;t solve your financial services problem, you can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do anything else. After all, it&#8217;s the underlying infrastructure that everything else needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>How was your experience at the fintech startup?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I joined, the team was very small at that time. Everyone could fit into one conference room, and then, I started building out the Nigeria business as the managing director. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hired the team to start delivering products through partnerships and got the userbase to over a million users before leaving. So that was definitely a fun but trying experience. It taught me a lot about myself, and I definitely got first-hand experience of the challenge of building and leading a startup in emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><strong>Did anything transpire within the startup that led to you leaving?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">say I wanted to start a new journey. I mean, look, COVID hit a lot of businesses hard, and in your startup journey, you have to make some directional changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Migo has now more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cleanly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on embedded finance, which required making some changes within the organization, and that happened with COVID</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seemed like a good time to leave, which I did, plus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been a bit burnt out, as I was exhausted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when I left.</span></p>
<p><strong>But you joined Thrive Agric four months after leaving?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it was a few months after, that&#8217;s interesting [laughs]. So I mean, we&#8217;ve talked about how I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was drawn</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to financial services because that&#8217;s sort of fundamental to economic development. With <a href="https://www.thriveagric.com/">Thrive Agric</a>, I definitely felt the same: we eat food. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are millions of smallholder farmers in Nigeria. What Thrive does in consolidating their output to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to local off-takers is a critical aspect of Nigeria&#8217;s future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s food security. If you sit down and think about the Global Sustainable Development Goals, food security shows up somehow, right? So for me, even though I was still trying to rest, I couldn&#8217;t say no. It felt like a call to service to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">help them figure out what was wrong and try to get them out of the crisis; I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t want to see a company like that die.</span></p>
<p><strong>I remember it was a rough period for the company. How challenging was it, as it was a new experience for you? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, it was pretty tough. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;ve apologized for anything I&#8217;ve ever done in my life as much as I did that period. It was definitely intense to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be confronted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the rage of thousands of people at the same time. It&#8217;s a one-of-a-kind experience. It definitely wasn&#8217;t enjoyable, but then again, everybody was under pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rage was definitely understandable. I couldn&#8217;t challenge or argue with it. It was valid, but at the same time, so many companies worldwide suffered due to the pandemic. Sure, Thrive could have handled things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">better; obviously,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s why I joined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was a tough job keeping customers happy and protecting the founders because there were many people ready to take some very extreme measures, as you can imagine, but we managed to all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> survive it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell, how did you bring the company out of the crisis it was facing?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I stepped in, I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on addressing the problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took me a while to meet the whole company because I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">keenly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on the specific teams, people and resources </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to solve the problem first</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only after creating a plan that I could start looking at the rest of the company to address what systemic issue led to the problem. There&#8217;s no chronic problem in a startup that is not led or supported by something systemic within the startup.</span></p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about the problem. What exactly happened?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the challenge with Thrive was a timing issue. Thrive works with the farmers to grow crops. They deliver fertilizer and seeds, and the farmers grow the crops. We support farmers during harvest and manage them getting the harvest to the warehouse. Then we take the goods from the warehouse into the market and sell them to our clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So COVID prevented farmers from accessing the farms. It prevented us from accessing the markets to sell the goods. It prevented us from going to the farms to gather the produce and take them to sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the lockdown, you can&#8217;t do any of that because you can&#8217;t move. You can&#8217;t deliver seeds to the farmers; the farmers cannot plant, you cannot get people to support them with harvest, you cannot receive the goods. So the fundamental ability for the company to make money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was compromised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that happened, it wasn&#8217;t a problem anybody had seen before. The team didn&#8217;t know how to react and did not pass on the bad news to subscribers. And bad news is always tough to deliver. What it created was this timing issue and that&#8217;s why though we were able to pay back, we did with delay. We wanted to honor the obligations to subscribers. The business model does work. It&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Thrive wasn&#8217;t prepared for a pandemic, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we&#8217;ve been able to catch up a little bit.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your case with Thrive Agric is quite unique because you were brought as someone with managerial experience to help the company. That&#8217;s not the case generally within the ecosystem. Some founders rarely want to relinquish their position even if the company is going downhill. Why do you think this is so?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> part of it is because startup culture comes from Silicon Valley and startup culture there prefers to rely on less-experienced people at the beginning. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to be honest, experience and innovation are not comfortable bedfellows because when you have experience, you will lean on what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is tried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and tested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you&#8217;re trying to be innovative, you are throwing away what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is tried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and tested.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189046" style="width: 568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189046" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189046 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?w=558" alt="Adia Sowho" width="558" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg 820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?resize=123,150 123w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?resize=246,300 246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?resize=768,937 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?resize=558,680 558w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/PhotoPictureResizer_210812_014246576_crop_820x1000.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189046" class="wp-caption-text">Adia Sowho (Ex-CEO, Thrive Agric; CMO, MTN Nigeria)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the challenge that African founders now have is that we have to find a way to localize that context. But going to my first point, we can also see that Google and Facebook made changes when necessary. With Facebook, it was Sheryl Sandberg. Google did with Eric Schmidt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our startups have to do it a little bit earlier and a little bit more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">informally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first, and that&#8217;s fine because of the lack of infrastructure existing in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience helps you know where someone may have tried something or made a mistake before. That&#8217;s why my joining Thrive made sense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m happy to see that there is more interest in welcoming people with experience and quite a few more people feel emboldened to make the jump into startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the trend is changing, although it can be definitely difficult when you want a long career. To jump into the startup culture, you have to throw away many comforts and embrace an extremely dynamic environment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>How would you say Thrive Agric is faring now?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I took a systemic approach to manage the team and the startup, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they are on better footing. Now, the founders and the senior team can a little bit more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comfortably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see around corners. The only thing you can do with risk is to manage it or prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I got into Thrive, I was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on what went wrong, understanding the causality and retraining the team to better see around those kinds of corners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That work continues. I stay on as an advisor because I want to ensure the company&#8217;s continued success for the same reason I gave before: food security</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, Thrive is one of three companies that the Central Bank of Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is satisfied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with giving support to deliver</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food security nationwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It means that the sky is the limit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth because </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive is aggregating 100,000 farmers in the country just this year. The growth potential for this company is astounding.</span></p>
<p><strong>So, in all this, what does your experience at Thrive tell you about startups and the Nigerian tech ecosystem in general?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup life is hard in countries that are infrastructure rich. It is harder in countries that are infrastructure light. In Nigeria and Africa, that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forces startups to build infrastructure that they don&#8217;t have. But the problem for some is that when they build it, they individualize it, which kind of sucks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at the same time, the low-hanging fruit around here is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amazing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m excited by the potential and possibility of creating a new version of what the economy can look like by tapping into the internet and connectivity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for me, there are definitely opportunities to support startups differently. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s going to be the focus of my work with the ecosystem going forward. Figuring out how to help the ecosystem build better products and run better startups based on my experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go in and do that for everybody, I&#8217;ll try to figure out a way to share my knowledge at scale.</span></p>

<p><strong>How will you do that now that you&#8217;ve left the startup scene and gone back to the corporate world with MTN?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, let&#8217;s talk about infrastructure. You know, if you think about your startup with MTN as a partner, what does the trajectory of that startup now look like? It&#8217;s massive. So that&#8217;s why I took this role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m still doing a lot of startup ecosystem work. For me, there is a telco role in all future unicorn stories.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has locked the account of Indian National Congress, the South Asian nation&#8217;s largest opposition party, for violating its rules.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress wrote about the Twitter episode on Facebook Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;When our leaders were put in jails, we were not scared then why would we be afraid of closing our Twitter accounts now. We are Congress, this is the message of the people, we will fight, we will keep fighting. If it is a crime to raise our voice to get justice for the rape victim girl, then we will do this crime a hundred times. Jai Hind&#8230; Satyamev Jayate,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Rohan Gupta, the head of social media for Congress, alleged that Twitter had taken the step at the direction of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, adding that the firm had also suspended profiles of several of the party&#8217;s senior leaders.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said the company&#8217;s rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone on our service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken proactive action on several hundred Tweets that posted an image that violated our Rules, and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options. Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, and our aim is always to protect individuals’ privacy and safety. We strongly encourage everyone on the service to familiarise themselves with the Twitter Rules and report anything they believe is in violation,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>The locking of the Indian National Congress&#8217; account has prompted some new criticism for the American firm. &#8220;We strongly condemn the blocking of the accounts of the Indian National Congress and senior leaders of the Congress party,&#8221; tweeted Derek O&#8217; Brien, from the All India Trinamool Congress party.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, Twitter suspended the account of Rahul Gandhi (pictured above), the former president of the Indian National Congress, after he tweeted pictures with the family of a nine-year-old who was allegedly raped and murdered. The company was shortly reached by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, an Indian statutory body, which said the Congress leader&#8217;s tweets violated the privacy of a minor victim.</p>
<p>The new episode is Twitter&#8217;s latest headache in India, a key overseas market for American firms.</p>
<p>After months-long public tension with the Indian government, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/twitter-now-in-compliance-with-india-new-it-rules-government-says/">finally complied with the South Asian nation&#8217;s new IT law</a>, which went into effect in May, a lawyer for New Delhi said in a court Tuesday.</p>
<p>Twitter, which was facing heat from the Indian government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">not blocking some tweets</a> that the Indian government had deemed objectionable earlier this year, had requested a few additional months to comply with the new rules that mandate all significant social media firms &#8212; any service with more than 5 million users, per the Indian government &#8212; to appoint officials in the country to address on-ground concerns in the country.</p>
<p>The move is expected to deescalate the tension between the two. Twitter <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India’s ruling party BJP, in May as “manipulated media.” Days later, a special squad of Delhi police that investigates terrorism and other crimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made a surprise visit to two of Twitter’s offices</a> in the country to seek information about Twitter’s rationale to term Patra’s tweets as manipulated. At the time, Twitter said it was “concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.”</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mumbai-based Eruditus, which works with top universities globally to offer more than 100 executive-level courses to students in over 80 nations, said on Thursday it has raised $650 million in a new financing round led by Accel and SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The new financing round &#8212; which includes both primary and secondary transactions &#8212; values the ten-year-old Indian startup at $3.2 billion, up from about $700 million a year ago. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board also participated in the new round.</p>
<p><a href="http://eruditus.com/">Eruditus</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-backs-indian-education-startup-eruditus-in-113-million-fundraise/">counts Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Sequoia Capital India among its backers</a>, maintains a tie-up with over 30 top-tier universities, including MIT, Harvard, Columbia, Cambridge, INSEAD, Wharton, UC Berkeley, IIT, IIM and NUS. The universities and Eruditus work to develop courses that are aimed at offering higher education to students. These courses cost anything between $5,000 to $40,000.</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh funds to develop more courses and build new products.</p>
<p>“With this fundraise, we’re excited to scale our unique business model, continue to deliver strong learning outcomes, and grow our global impact at a rapid rate,&#8221; said Ashwin Damera, co-founder and chief executive of Eruditus. Damera has sold stake worth as much as $100 million in the new round.</p>
<p>The new fundraise comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital from high-profile investors. India, which is the world’s second largest internet market, has produced over 23 unicorns this year (Eruditus is the 23rd), up from 11 last year and 6 in 2019. Some investors have also doubled down on the South Asian market after China, one of the other rare big growth markets, enforced a series of regulatory changes that has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“With the rapid rate of technological disruption, continuous upskilling is necessary in today’s job market,” said Sumer Juneja, Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “The company’s partnerships with elite universities, and use of technology and data to create and deliver high quality courses positions Eruditus to lead in this space.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eruditus is SoftBank&#8217;s second major bet on India&#8217;s edtech market. The Japanese investment firm has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/">backed Unacademy</a>.</p>
<p>UpGrad, a Bangalore-based startup that specializes in higher education and upskilling courses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/india-upgrad-enters-unicorn-club-with-185-million-fundraise/">joined the unicorn club</a> earlier this week. VerSe Innovation, which operates news aggregator service Dailyhunt and short video apps Josh, said early Thursday that it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/india-verse-raises-over-450-million-to-expand-dailyhunt-and-josh-apps-globally/">raised over $450 million in a new financing round</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">VerSe Innovation, the parent firm of popular news aggregator Dailyhunt and short video app Josh, said on Thursday it has raised over $450 million in a new financing round, just five months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/dailyhunt-and-joshs-parent-firm-raises-over-100-million/">securing $200 million</a>, as the Indian startup looks to expand its offerings to international markets.</p>
<p>Siguler Guff, Baillie Gifford, affiliates of Carlyle Asia Partners Growth II and others financed VerSe Innovation’s Series I round, while existing investors Sofina Group, Qatar Investment Authority and BCap participated.</p>
<p>VerSe Innovation said in a statement that its valuation has more than doubled in the past five months without disclosing a precise figure. The startup was valued at over $1 billion in its Series H financing round. <strong>Update</strong>: VerSe Innovation&#8217;s valuation is &#8220;nearing $3 billion&#8221; in the new round, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The Google and Microsoft-backed startup claimed that Josh, which has amassed over 115 million monthly active users, 56 million of whom use the app each day. Dailyhunt, the startup said, has amassed over 300 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>Josh competes with scores of short video apps including Moj and MX TakaTak. All these apps mushroomed after India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok over cybersecurity concerns</a> in mid-2020 to cash in on the opportunity. ByteDance&#8217;s app identified India as its biggest international market, where it had courted over 200 monthly active users.</p>
<p>Moj, which claims to have over 100 million users, is operated by Tiger Global-backed ShareChat that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/india-sharechat-valued-at-3-billion-in-145-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.88 billion in a financing round</a> it unveiled last month. MX TakaTak&#8217;s parent firm, MX Player, is also currently engaging with investors to raise a round that would value the startup at over $1 billion, according to three people aware of the development.</p>
<p>VerSe Innovation is betting on building a family of apps that serves users in scores of local languages. Dailyhunt, for instance, offers its content in 14 languages from over 100,000 content partners and creators. And it plans to replicate the same strategy as it looks to expand in international markets, VerSe Innovation said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup said it also plans to invest in broadening its AI / ML stack to offer users more personalized experience.</p>
<p>The new fundraise comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital from high-profile investors. India, which is the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, has produced over 20 unicorns this year, up from 11 last year and 6 in 2019. Some investors have also doubled down on the South Asian market after China, one of the other rare big growth markets, enforced a series of regulatory changes that has wiped hundreds of billions of dollars in recent weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://appworks.tw/">AppWorks</a>, the Taipei-based venture capital firm focused on Taiwan and Southeast Asia, announced today it has closed its oversubscribed third fund, raising $150 million. AppWorks Fund III’s limited partners include Taiwan Mobile, Axiom Asia Private Capital, Fubon Life, TransGlobe Life, Hongtai Group, Wistron, Cathay Life, Phison Electronics and Taiwan’s National Development Fund. Many of these LPs also participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/appworks-50m/">AppWorks’ $50 million second fund in 2014</a>.</p>
<p>AppWorks’ total assets under management (AUM) is now $212 million. As part of Fund III’s close, AppWorks is <a href="https://appworks.tw/works/">recruiting </a>new investment associates and analysts, especially ones who will focus on sourcing deals throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Jamie Lin, the firm’s chairman and founding partner, told TechCrunch that Fund III had an initial target of $100 million, but surpassed it because of the strong performance of AppWorks’ second fund.</p>
<p>Fund II’s portfolio includes Lalamove and 91APP, and at the end of July 2021, its total value to paid-in (TVPI), or the return multiple net of fees, reached 3.3x. By comparison, the top quartile of global VC and private equity funds launched around the same time have a TVPI of 2.4x, according to data from Cambridge Associates. Fund II also achieved internal rate of return (IRR) of 34.7%, compared to 26.1% for the other funds.</p>
<p>Founded in 2009, AppWorks started its accelerator program before launching a $11 million debut fund in 2012. AppWorks’ ecosystem now includes 414 active startups that have collectively raised $4.3 billion, and have an aggregate valuation of $17.4 billion. Over the next 10 years, AppWorks’ goal is to increase that to 1,000 active startups with a collective value of more than $100 billion.</p>
<p>Lin said AppWorks has a strong incoming pipeline because many startups in its ecosystem, including ones run by accelerator alumni and its mentor network of about 100 seasoned entrepreneurs, have reached product-market fit, are scalable and need to raise funding to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>Fund III is earmarked for a portfolio of about 40 startups, split evenly between investments starting at $2 million in Series A to Series C rounds, and seed-stage investments. Seed-stage checks can range in size from about $50,000 to $200,000, depending on a startup’s needs. Part of the fund’s capital will also go toward AppWorks’ current portfolio companies as they reach maturation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AppWorks’ three main investment themes are Southeast Asia, blockchain and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Lin said that many of AppWorks accelerator graduates over the past three to five years are from Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and, increasingly, Indonesia and the Philippines. (AppWorks also serves as an LP in about 15 seed funds across Southeast Asia, which helped it maintain strong deal flow despite pandemic travel restrictions).</p>
<p>AppWorks’ current blockchain investments include Dapper Labs, Animoca Brands and Splinterlands. Lin is especially keen on NFTs and their “ability to bridge the physical world and digital world,” plus blockchain’s potential to change how people game (for example, the play-to-earn model Splinterlands is known for).</p>

<p>Investing in a mix of seed- and growth-stage deals means Fund III’s schedule will be more evenly spread out. The approach is “better for LPs, but also mostly comes from our philosophy of putting founders front and center,” Lin said. “A lot of our accelerator alumni startups are by first-time founders, so they need help all the way from seed stage. Many of our mentors have already raised seed or Series A rounds, and they come to us when they need someone to lead a Series B of $10, $15 or $20 million. It stems from our particular deal flow, since we’re mainly supporting our alumni founders and mentors, so we have two very different types of deal flows.”</p>
<p>Fund III has already backed AppWorks accelerator alumni like Pickone, WeMo Scooter, Omnichat, XREX, Blocto, SoopahGenius and Docosan. Investments from its mentor network include Carousell, Dapper Labs, Tiki, Dcard, Yummy Corp and Animoca Brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sydney, Australia-based <a href="https://fablefood.co/">Fable Food </a>is the latest plant-based food startup to announce funding. The company, which uses mushrooms in its meat alternatives, has raised $6.5 million AUD (about $4.8 million USD) in a seed round led by Blackbird Ventures, the Australian venture capital firm whose portfolio also includes Canva, Culture Amp and SafetyCulture. Other participants included agriculture and food tech venture firm AgFunder, sustainability-focused Aera VC and Better Bite Ventures, along with Singapore-based produce importer Ban Choon Marketing and former Sequoia Capital partner Warren Hogarth.</p>
<p>Fable is preparing to launch in the United States by the end of this year. In Australia, its products are available at retailers like Woolworths, Coles and Harris Farm Markets, along with restaurants including Grill’d, which recently started serving its Meaty Mushroom Burger Pattie at 136 locations. Fable’s products are also available at restaurants in Singapore and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2019 by fine dining chef turned chemical engineer and mycologist (mushroom scientist) Jim Fuller, organic mushroom farmer Chris McLoghlin and Michael Fox, whose previous startup was Shoes of Prey.</p>
<p>Fox, Fable’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch in an email that after being a vegetarian for six years, he recently became a vegan “for a mix of health, environmental and ethical reasons.”</p>
<p>“Talking to my friends and family, a lot of people want to reduce their meat consumption for the same reasons but they find it challenging because they love the taste and texture of meat and giving it up is hard,” Fox said. He wanted to find a way to make it easier for people to transition to plant-based foods, and spoke to several chefs who suggested using mushrooms as a base ingredient. Then Fox met Fuller and McLoghlin, who were in the process of developing meat alternatives using mushrooms.</p>

<p>“When we met, we realized we shared the same values and goals and had complementary skill sets,” said Fox. “We shared a common desire to help end industrial agriculture and wanted to make our food system more ethical, healthy, sustainable and lower its greenhouse gas emissions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fable&#8217;s first products include a substitute for pulled pork, braised beef and beef brisket (Fuller grew up in Texas eating slow-cooked meats and wanted to recreate the experience), along with a line of ready-made meals. The company uses shiitake mushrooms, which Fox explained are “very flavorful with their natural umami flavors, they are a slow-growing mushroom so they naturally have the fleshy fibers that give the meaty bite you typically get from animal proteins, and have the right chemical composition that when cooked allow us to taste flavors that are found in animal products.”</p>

<p>Fuller serves as Fable’s chief science officer and the startup leverages his experience as a chef/chemical engineer/mycologist to create the right combinations of flavor, aroma and texture while keeping processing and ingredients to a minimum. For example, its braised beef alternative is made with shiitake mushrooms, seven other ingredients and salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Fable also announced today it has appointed Dan Joyce, who was previously safety and compliance software company SafetyCulture’s general manager of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as chief growth officer to head global sales and marketing. It will launch in the U.S. through a combination of partnerships with restaurants and meal kit companies.</p>

<p>Other startups that use mushrooms as basis for meat alternatives include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/i-cant-believe-its-not-meat/">Meati</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2021/04/15/maker-of-mushroom-sourced-bacon-raises-40-million-to-reach-grocers-at-scale/?sh=3e7d436a72d1">AtLast</a>. Fox said a main difference is that those two startups ferment mycelium, or the root structure of fungi, instead of using mushrooms, which are the fruiting body of fungi.</p>
<p>Fable’s new funding will be used for research and development, expanding its production and manufacturing capacity in Australia and other countries. The company is keeping its product pipeline under wraps for now, but Fox said it plans to develop mushroom-based substitutes for pork, chicken, lamb and other animal proteins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last year, Tinder has experimented with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/tinder-to-roll-out-new-48-hour-in-app-events-called-vibes/">creative ways</a> for people to connect beyond just swiping right. Pandemic or not, it&#8217;s hard to make the first move &#8212; so why not break the ice by weathering a virtual apocalypse with a potential date? Today, Tinder <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">announced</a> that it will launch its second &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series after its first installment garnered engagement from over 20 million users.</p>
<p>Tinder launched Swipe Night in 2019 as an interactive &#8220;choose your own adventure&#8221; story at a time when the app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">experienced</a> a decline in one of its user engagement metrics and saw a dip in quarterly revenue. In the months since, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-match-group-results/match-quarterly-revenue-hit-by-slowing-tinder-growth-idUSKBN22H2VV">COVID slowed Tinder&#8217;s revenue</a> further, but more recently, it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/match-group-revenue-beats-estimates-delivers-positive-outlook?sref=gni836kR">rebounding</a>.</p>
<p>Noting that its user base was<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/introducing-swipe-night"> half Gen Z</a> (ages 18-25), Tinder hired now 25-year-old director Karena Evans, who has also directed music videos for Drake, as well as the premiere of HBO Max&#8217;s &#8220;Gossip Girl&#8221; reboot. The Swipe Night story invited users to choose what they would do in the apocalypse, swiping left or right to indicate their decisions as a character in the story. Based on how they swiped, users would get matched with other Swipe Night participants, and their choices would appear on their Tinder profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this new information will make for plenty of material for post-apocalyptic banter,&#8221; the company had <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/introducing-swipe-night">said</a>.</p>
<p>Skeptics might find this to be an inorganic way to boost user engagement and matches, but on Swipe Nights, there was a 26% increase in matches compared with a typical Sunday night, <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-11-Tinder-Orders-More-Swipe-Night-Following-Transformative-20-Million-Member-Turnout-and-26-Increase-in-Matches">Tinder now reports</a>. The interactive video series was even <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-25-Tinder-Wins-Entertainment-Grand-Prix-for-Swipe-Night-at-Cannes-Festival-2021">recognized</a> at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvJhVXQGHOg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The next installment for Swipe Night will be a &#8220;Gen Z whodunnit,&#8221; Tinder announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The upcoming series will utilize Tinder&#8217;s &#8220;Fast Chat,&#8221; the quick chat feature that powers <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">Tinder&#8217;s new &#8220;Hot Takes&#8221; experience</a> where users can talk before matching. On Swipe Night, Fast Chat will allow users to analyze clues and work together to solve the mystery, even if they haven&#8217;t already matched.</p>
<p>Tinder says Swipe Night will debut in the app&#8217;s &#8220;Explore&#8221; section, which is a newer part of the Tinder app that gives members different ways to meet beyond just swiping. The section was <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">announced</a> last month as part of a group of features targeting Gen Z users, along with Hot Takes and video profiles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 11, 2021. If you are a Twitter user, today has proven to be a divisive day, thanks to some design changes. We also have hardware news, mobility news, a few very neat funding rounds and even some startup media news. It’s a great day for a roundup. Also, if you are in the United States, you may have noticed a missive from FEMA today. FEMA is the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/fema-emergency-alert-system/">just ran a test of its emergency alert system</a>, or EAS. Given that the world appears to be constantly on fire, sick or underwater, it’s a good time for such an endeavor.</p>
<p>Before we go on, Disrupt is hosting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/hear-how-cityblock-healths-toyin-ajayi-carbon-healths-eren-bali-and-forwards-adrian-aoun-see-tech-impacting-access-to-health-at-disrupt-2021/">some of the most interesting founders in health tech</a>, and we’ll have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/dont-miss-these-special-breakout-sessions-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">some pretty darn cool breakout sessions to boot</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features/">Twitter’s redesign turns heads:</a> </strong>That Twitter is in the midst of something akin to a product renaissance is well known, with the social media provider working on a host of projects at once. Hell, Twitter is even working on <em>TweetDeck</em>. Today, however, Twitter stirred the pot with a web and mobile redesign that included a new font. <em>Quelle horreur !</em> No, but really, people are mad.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/heres-everything-samsung-announced-this-morning/">Here’s everything that Samsung announced today:</a></strong> As expected, Samsung held a hardware event today. What did the hardware giant show off? The Galaxy Watch 4, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 (the folding smartphone affair), the Galaxy Z Flip 2 (a smaller folding smartphone) and new headphones. If you are not into the iOS ecosystem, this is for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/"><strong>China’s regulatory shakeup not harming venture investment. Yet.</strong></a><strong> </strong>After the Chinese government started a wide-ranging crackdown on a host of domestic industries that it either found too powerful, too unregulated or too monopolistic, what impact the changes would have on startups and venture capital have been open questions. Early Q3 data indicates that things haven’t changed too much, <em>yet</em>. But with SoftBank potentially pausing Chinese deals, larger startup investment could suffer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into our usual digest of the latest and greatest funding rounds from the worlds of venture capital and high-growth startups, two product-related notes.</p>
<p>First, Airtable just bought something! Yes, <strong>Airtable</strong>, the roughly $5.8 billion spreadsheet of the future is making deals. Well, one. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/airtable-makes-bayes-its-first-acquisition-to-up-its-data-visualization-game/">company bought <strong>Bayes</strong></a>, what TechCrunch called an “early-stage visualization startup” that also features a no-code focus. If you love Airtable, this could be good news.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>Medium</strong> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/">shaking up its business model yet again</a>. Again. Yes, one more time. This time, the company is changing its partner program. Now writers on Medium can drive their own subscriptions, snagging half the long-term revenue net of fees. This feels a little Substack-y, but not in a bad way. Despite Medium’s inability to decide what it is, I remain modestly hopeful for the company thanks to my profession of getting paid to make words appear on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, some funding rounds for your enjoyment!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/doxel-raises-40m-from-insight-a16z-to-become-the-waze-for-construction/"><strong>$40M for construction-focused computer vision:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the headline from Doxel’s latest round, led by Insight Partners. The Series B brings the company’s total raised capital to just over $56 million. Doxel uses computer vision to track the progress of construction sites. It’s a neat model, and, per the company, it still has its full Series A in the bank thanks to “growth and bookings traction” of sufficient size that it has been “cash flow neutral” since its last raise. Why would Doxel raise if it didn’t need money? Because it could pad its accounts at a new, higher price implying minimal dilution. And you always want to raise when you don’t need to. It’s far cheaper than waiting for a cash crunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/e-commerce-as-a-service-platform-cart-com-picks-up-98m-to-give-brands-scaling-tools/"><strong>Cart.com raises $98 million:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Does the name Cart.com sound familiar? It might. Why? Because the Houston-based e-commerce tooling company has now raised three times this year. So you may recall it from the other two times it put capital onto its balance sheet in 2021. The company has now raised $143 million in total.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/founded-by-a-freshworks-alum-sales-commission-platform-everstage-gets-1-7m-seed/"><strong>Everstage raises $1.7M for sales commissions software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The old startup adage of <em>build software to replace manual spreadsheet processes </em>is alive and well, it turns out. Everstage wants to take sales commissions, today “calculated on spreadsheets by finance teams” that provide limited visibility to salespeople, and turn them into highly limpid software. Salespeople will dig this, given how complex commissions can be and how critical they are to sales comp totals.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/pave-gets-y-combinator-to-back-better-startup-compensation-tools-again/"><strong>Pave raises $16M</strong></a> to help companies “benchmark, plan and communicate compensation to their employees.” Akin to how sales commissions can be Gordian in their heft, employee comp is a knotty issue. Pave wants to provide more data to companies so that they can make better &#8212; and, we hope, more equitable &#8212; compensation decisions and generally improve employee lives. We dig this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The gray revolution: Fundraising within the older adult space</h2>
<p>Although older adults are one of the fastest-growing demographics, they&#8217;re quite underserved when it comes to consumer tech.</p>
<p>The global population of people older than 65 will reach 1.5 billion by 2050, and members of this cohort — who are leading longer, active lives — have money to spend.</p>
<p>Still, most startups persist in releasing products aimed at serving younger users, says Lawrence Kosick, co-founder of GetSetUp, an edtech company that targets 50+ learners.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can provide a valuable, scalable service for the older adult market, there’s a lot of opportunity to drive growth through partnerships.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The beleaguered EV startup Lordstown Motors is on track to begin production of its flagship electric truck Endurance, but only select customers will begin to receive vehicles early next year, executives said during a second quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>Executives struck a cautious tone in the second-quarter earnings call as they tried to assuage shareholder concerns and address the near-term realities of bringing its first vehicle to market without any revenue to offset its costs. Lordstown&#8217;s approach, at least this quarter, was to try and reduce operating costs from the previous quarter, helping it offset its increase in capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Lordstown reported a net loss of $108 million, a 13.7% improvement from the first quarter loss of $125 million. Its net losses are more than tenfold higher than the -$7.9 million it reported in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Lordstown cut research and development spending by 17% from the previous quarter to $76.5 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it increased its capital expenditures to $121 million from $53 million in the first quarter. Lordstown also increased its capital expenditure guidance for the year, from $250 million to $275 million to a $375 million to $400 million range, a spike related to its need to prepay for equipment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188930" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188930" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188930" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png" alt="" width="1024" height="461" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png 1966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=768,346 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=1536,692 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-15.49.08.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188930" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://lordstownmotors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lordstown Motors <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The decline in R&amp;D expenses was due to declines in purchases of vehicle components, as many of those were acquired in prior quarters, Lordstown interim CFO Becky Long said during an investor call. However, legal expenses were $9 million higher than last quarter, due to costs related to a special committee and a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over whether Lordstown exaggerated pre-sales. (The fun doesn’t stop there — the company is also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921092686/tm218118-5_posam.htm">under investigation</a> by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lordstown was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">thrown a life vest</a> earlier this summer, when investment firm Yorkville Advisors agreed to purchase up to $400 million of Lordstown’s shares. The company is “now exploring a variety of other financing options, including non-dilutive private strategic investments and debt,” interim CEO Angela Strand said during an investor call. The company is also still pursuing a loan with the U.S. Department of Energy, Long said during the call.</p>
<p>Although the company said it was still on track to begin production of the Endurance at the end of September, only “select early customers” will begin to receive vehicles in the first quarter of 2022, followed by commercial deliveries in the second quarter. Strand said this deployment plan is to allow fleet customers time to build out charging infrastructure and to manage supply chain challenges.</p>
<p>One thing that distinguishes the company from some of its competitors is its manufacturing plant — a 6.2 million square foot former General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio. It’s now looking like the company is exploring different ways to turn a profit off this asset. Strand said “serious discussions” were underway with potential partners to use Lordstown’s facility to manufacture their products, suggesting the company is eager to find additional sources of revenue to offset its mounting expenses. &#8220;This is a critical strategic pivot for us, a decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities for Lordstown,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>“We are exploring multiple partnership constructs,” she added. “That includes contract manufacturing, that includes licensing, in addition to producing our own vehicles,” she added.</p>
<p>The Lordstown executive team has not had a smooth summer. The company announced in June the resignations of both CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez, who were replaced in an interim capacity by Strand and Roof respectively. Lordstown was founded as an offshoot of Burns’ company Workhorse Group — the same company that said it had sold 11.9 million shares, or nearly three-quarters of its stake, since the beginning of July. The company is actively searching for a CEO and CFO, Strand said.</p>
<p>Lordstown was riding high in late 2020, when it announced its SPAC merger with a value of $1.6 billion. Its shares soared to $31.80 apiece at their 52-week highs. They’ve since plummeted to $5.94.</p>
<p>“We still plan to be first to market, particularly in the commercial fleet space,” Strand said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of its earnings call this week, Desktop Metal announced <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210811005852/en">plans to acquire ExOne</a>. The Pennsylvania-based firm creates a variety of different industrial 3D printers for industries like aerospace, automotive, medical and defense. More recently, we wrote about the company’s portable 3D printing factories, which are effectively mobile additive manufacturing stations built inside of shipping containers.</p>
<p>We wrote about ExOne back in February, when the company was granted $1.6 million from the DoD, in hopes of taking the systems out into the field. Each unit contains a 3D scanning station with computer and a variety of different ruggedized industrial machines, including a metal and ceramic printer, curing oven, fiber-reinforced plastic printer and a compression modeling station.</p>

<p>“Over the last two years, we’ve really focused on providing our technology into government-type applications: DoD, NASA, DoE,” ExOne’s CEO John Hartner told TechCrunch when that news broke. “Sometimes people talk about disrupting the supply chain and getting decentralized manufacturing. This is decentralized and forward-deployed, if you will. Be it an emergency, humanitarian mission or frontlines for a war fighter.”</p>
<p>Today’s transaction, which is valued at $575 million, finds Desktop Metal purchasing all of ExOne’s common stock.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to bring ExOne into the DM family to create the leading additive manufacturing portfolio for mass production,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop said in a release. “We believe this acquisition will provide customers with more choice as we leverage our complementary technologies and go-to-market efforts to drive continued growth. This transaction is a big step in delivering on our vision of accelerating the adoption of additive manufacturing 2.0.”</p>
<p>Desktop Metal has been actively pursuing acquisitions to grow out its 3D printing portfolio since it announced plans to go public via SPAC last August. In January, it acquired EnvisionTEC for $300 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are excited to join forces with Desktop Metal to deliver a more sustainable future through our shared vision of additive manufacturing at high production volumes,” Hartner said of today&#8217;s announcement. “We believe our complementary platforms will better serve customers, accelerate adoption of green technologies, and drive increased shareholder value. Most importantly, our technologies will help drive important innovations at meaningful production volumes that can improve the world.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to extend an offer to an engineer who has been working in the U.S. on an H-1B for almost five years. Her current employer is sponsoring her for an EB-2 green card, and our startup wants to hire her as a senior engineer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens to her green card process? Can we take it over?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Recruiting in Richmond</strong></p>
<p>Dear Recruiting,</p>
<p>Congrats on finding the right candidate for your role. Your startup’s ability to take over the EB-2 green card process for this candidate — or whether you have to start the green card process from the beginning — depends on where she is in the green card process and whether the position you are offering is similar to her current role.</p>
<p>Take a listen to my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/083-understanding-ac21-portability-h-1b-extensions-and-the-180-day-rule/">podcast</a> in which my colleague, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/gilberto-orozco-jr/">Gilberto Orozco Jr.</a>, an associate attorney at my firm, and I discuss the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act — or AC21 &#8212; including “green card portability.”</p>
<p>Enacted in 2000, AC21 gives international talent in certain situations the flexibility to change jobs during the green card process and the ability to extend an H-1B visa beyond the six-year limit to avoid having to leave the United States while waiting for a green card. I recommend discussing your situation and goals with an experienced immigration attorney to determine your options.</p>

<h2>The process for EB-2 green cards</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, what happens to the green card process if your candidate changes jobs depends on where she is in the EB-2 green card process. There are two types of EB-2 green cards that have slightly different processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-green-card-advanced-degree/">EB-2 green card for advanced degree professionals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for persons of exceptional ability</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The EB-2 green card requires an employer sponsor and has a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent">PERM</a> (Program Electronic Review Management) labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor.</li>
<li>Submitting a green card petition (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-140">Form I-140</a>) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for approval.</li>
<li>Getting USCIS approval after filing an adjustment of status to permanent residence application (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-485">Form I-485</a>), which can be filed along with Form I-140 depending on whether an EB-2 green card number is available based on the candidate’s country of birth, and being interviewed by a USCIS officer <em>or</em> obtaining a green card abroad through consular processing and the State Department.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation is seeking $1 billion in damages from Wisk Aero, according to court filings Tuesday, significantly escalating the ongoing legal battle between the two air taxi rivals.</p>
<p>Wisk “deployed a knowingly false extra-judicial smear campaign that projected stand-alone defamatory statements about Archer to the world,” the filing says. On this basis, Archer claims that this “smear campaign” has negatively impacted its ability to access capital and has impaired business relationships, resulting in damages “likely to exceed $1 billion.”</p>
<p>The two companies have been locked in a heated legal battle for much of this year. The dispute started in April, when Wisk filed a suit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that Archer had misappropriated its trade secrets related to Wisk’s debut eVTOL aircraft, Cora. Wisk further alleged that a former employee, Jing Xue, downloaded thousands of proprietary files from his work computer prior to joining Archer.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Archer has hit back against the accusations in court. First it filed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/archer-aviation-pushes-for-dismissal-of-wisk-trade-secret-suit/">motion to dismiss</a> the suit in early June, and later that month alleged in a separate court document that Archer’s design <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/archer-aviation-hits-back-against-rival-wisk-aeros-request-for-injunction-in-trade-secret-suit/">was well-established</a> prior to Wisk’s having filed any patents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Archer unveiled a prototype of its Maker aircraft in February, the same month that it announced (to much fanfare) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">it was going public</a> via a merger with blank-check firm Atlas Crest Investment Corp. for a pro-forma enterprise value of $2.7 billion. Late last month Archer slashed its valuation by $1 billion in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001824502/000110465921097282/tm218061d22_ex99-1.htm">“strategic reset”</a> of the transaction terms with the SPAC. While this is the same amount Archer is seeking in damages, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that is just coincidental.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the spokesperson added that the planned merger remains on track. Speaking to the suit, they said, &#8220;We have no plans to drop our counter-claim regardless of any moves Wisk may make.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Wisk spokesperson said “Archer’s counterclaim is ludicrous and its troubles are purely self-inflicted,” and characterized the filing as “full of distortions and distractions from the serious patent and trade secret misappropriation claims it faces.” The spokesperson added that Wisk intends to continue its case against Archer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Full-size pickup trucks are the meat of the U.S. automotive business; it&#8217;s a red-hot category with the Ford F-150 leading the pack in sales and the Chevrolet Silverado and Ram pickups fast followers.</p>
<p>But the air is thin at the top. What&#8217;s often lost in truck coverage is how fiercely automakers compete to woo discerning customers with packaged bundles of optional and standard features. And now, more than ever, those packaged bundles rely heavily on in-car tech.</p>
<p>Ford, as the top seller, must add bells and whistles without alienating its most discerning clientele. The 2021 F-150 &#8212; as I was reminded during a recent test drive &#8212; epitomizes this effort and hints at what is to come with the upcoming all-electric Lightning pickup truck.</p>
<p>I tested the 2021 4&#215;4 SuperCrew Lariat equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 PowerBoost Full Hybrid engine in its native suburban Detroit, 20 miles from where it was developed and manufactured.</p>
<p>Getting the details right on pickup trucks is an art of custom packaging for car companies. It&#8217;s one of the reasons that options packages are dizzying; the F-150 I tested was no exception. The F-150 offers six different powertrains, three bed lengths and three cab options, and then there&#8217;s eight trim levels, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive options.</p>
<p>This options-heavy strategy has paid off for automakers like Ford. However, as these companies add more tech and software, there is a risk of causing confusion among its most loyal customers.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2188748" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188748" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2188748 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg" alt="2021 Ford F-150 interior" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/All-new_F-150_033.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188748" class="wp-caption-text">2021 Ford F-150 interior. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford Motor Company</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What sets the F-150 apart from other vehicles in its lineup is how much functional tech matters to its core customers. On the new model I tested, a 12-inch display that houses the standard Sync4 infotainment system is the center of the dashboard &#8212; and the customer experience.</p>
<p>Sync4 was introduced on the Mustang Mach-E and on the new Ford Bronco. Sync has been steadily improving for a simpler user experience since its 2007 introduction. Sync4 doubles computational power and introduced over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/inrix-expands-its-digital-rule-book-beyond-self-driving-cars-to-help-cities-with-scooters-bikes-and-delivery-bots/">system sources data</a> from INRIX on traffic, construction (always in a Michigan summer), weather and parking space availability from data in 20,000 cities and 150 countries.</p>
<p>Natural language processing used in the system provided more accurate responses to my voice-based queries and incoming SMS messages. One caveat worth noting: It was difficult to judge the machine learning algorithm because my test vehicle had been used by multiple drivers in recent weeks.</p>
<p>For infotainment, I generally defer to Apple CarPlay, which along with Android Auto, is easy to call up, because it connects wirelessly in the F-150 and minimizes distracted driving. Ever since they debuted in production vehicles &#8212; 2014 for CarPlay and 2015 for Android Auto &#8212; it seemed inevitable that Apple and Google were going to dominate the middleware infotainment system game.</p>
<p>Sync also tees up supported apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-bets-on-google-cloud-for-its-digital-transformation/">Waze and Ford+Alexa</a>.</p>
<h2>Driving tech</h2>
<p>Driving a full-size truck for the first time can be intimidating, and Ford uses camera tech to make the big rig easier to maneuver. The split screen helps a timid driver feel confident navigating through tight spaces.</p>
<p>Five onboard cameras act as guides that assist with steering and parking. The vivid graphics incorporated into the 360-degree view from above helps to establish bearings where mirrors won&#8217;t suffice.</p>
<p>Behind the steering wheel is a 12-inch digital cluster. There&#8217;s part of me that misses the old-fashioned gauges of a classic pickup, but that&#8217;s not the direction Ford is heading. Ford is striving for future-forward vibes, encapsulated by Mustang Mach-E&#8217;s Apple-design-inspired aesthetic.</p>
<p>Through its in-car design, Ford is trying to make the case it&#8217;s a tech company first, and a 120-year-old automaker second. These earnest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">aesthetic cues</a> may be a bit too on the nose as products age over time.</p>
<p>Ford is due to introduce Blue Cruise, an advanced driver assistance system it once called Active Drive Assist, on vehicles later this year by an automatic software update, which was not yet active on the model I drove in June, though the hardware was included.</p>
<p>The company claims the system allows for hands-free driving in zones that span 100,000 miles of North American road and will be standard on the F-150 Limited vehicles in the Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Prep Package. It will be sold as an option on Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum models. The system uses a driver-facing camera to track eye gaze and head position to monitor concentration as an answer to GM&#8217;s Super Cruise.</p>

<p>Under the foot-long screen are the old-school knobs and switches that show Ford knows its customers still favor a manual cue here and there. Below that is a shift lever that folds down and flat into a 15-inch workstation, which I used for some in-car laptop time.</p>
<p>There are ample charging stations and wireless charging throughout the cabin. While the F-150 interior is spacious, every inch of real estate is carefully thought through. Seats fold to 180-degrees for proper roadside naps or to add extra cargo space.</p>
<p>The dark grey leather seats felt more utilitarian than luxurious, especially for a fully loaded vehicle. (Crosstown competitor Ram tends to outdo Ford on driving joy and interior design aesthetics.) The exterior and interior design emphasizes functionality, pure and simple. I hauled two kayaks in the back and found thoughtful hooks to connect to my bungee cords in the truck bed.</p>
<p>A bevy of 240-volt outlets are in the rear of the truck bed and two more are onboard in the cabin. The truck bed also has a convenient ruler built in on the tailgate with both metric and imperial calculations. A 2.4 kilowatt generator is standard on the hybrid model, while the optional 7.2 kW generator functions for 32 hours on a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t test out the F-150&#8217;s towing capacity, but for truck folks these numbers are essential. It has a payload of 2,120 pounds and can tow up 12,700 pounds (those numbers vary a bit depending on bed length and drivetrain). It also offers a backup towing assist function, which helps align the connection to a trailer. The model I drove was priced at $68,095, a significant leap from the $50,980 base price. In contrast, Ford produces an even higher-end F-150 trim called the Limited, which starts at $73,000.</p>
<h2>Function in form</h2>
<p>Before it goes all electric, the hybrid powertrain gives Ford a much needed boost to compete with Ram and Chevrolet, which already sell hybrid variants. The hybrid option is a logical compromise for customers who aren&#8217;t ready for the full Lightning EV that will go on sale in 2022, a launch that&#8217;s already generated buzz and 120,000 pre-orders. I clocked about 24 miles per gallon, an improvement over all-gasoline and best in its class for non-diesel. It&#8217;s still not enough to get Ford anywhere close to a stellar emissions report card, which is why the Lightning matters so much.</p>

<p>In order to court new EV customers, Ford must appease its current buyers who buy all those trucks we see on the road today. There&#8217;s two kinds of pickup truck customers: Those who rely on the functionality for their daily vocation or the weekend warriors and those who seek out the capability in case they might need it in a disaster scenario. The truck that I drove does the job of appealing to both.</p>
<p>The F-150 has always been suited to buyers who use it for home improvement projects, outdoorsy hobbies and towing. Pickup trucks also support laborers that require a rugged, functional vehicle. When Ford introduces anything new to this model, it creates hype and high stakes on how these customers feel about tweaks.</p>

<p>The buyer who seeks security came to mind while I had the F-150 on loan in late June, which is why I&#8217;ve saved the part about how it drives for last. My test drive period coincided with a summer storm that pummeled Michigan and shut down major highways and left vehicles stranded for days.</p>
<p>Before the storm, I zoomed around town, adjusting to the big loose steering and wide turns and the rhythm of stillness that occurs as the hybrid engine regenerates.</p>
<p>Once the storm came, I eased off the throttle and into a steady and sure pace, hands at 10 and two. Passenger cars and lesser capable crossover SUVs floated by me in two feet of water on the Lodge Freeway. The F-150 plowed through the muck, unbothered. I didn&#8217;t experience any skidding or stalling, in contrast to one friend who was forced to walk home because her Uber driver got stuck. The F-150 feels like a test case for a survivalist in an environmental catastrophe. The backup generator is the added security blanket.</p>
<p>Full-size trucks have an innate quality to make a driver feel invincible, which at the end of day is why people love their F-150s, and why the company has gotten so much mileage off that &#8220;Ford tough&#8221; tagline. It&#8217;s a delicate balance, keeping an unfussy truck at a price point that delivers power, substance and peace of mind.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Market timing  —  how relevant an idea is to the current state and direction of a market  —  is the most important factor in determining the durability of that idea.</p>
<p>Several inputs inform market timing: The skew of consumer preferences in response to a pandemic. The price of goods for a resource that is finite and becoming scarce. The creation of a novel algorithmic or genetic technique that enlarges the potential of what can be streamlined, repaired and built.</p>
<p>But market timing is also defined by a less discussed area that is born not in capital markets but in the public sector  —  the regulatory landscape  —  namely, the decisions of government, the broader legal system and its combined level of scrutiny toward a particular subject.</p>

<p>We can understand the successes and challenges of several valuable companies today based on their combustion with the regulatory landscape, and perhaps also use it as an optic to see what areas represent unique opportunities for new companies to start and scale.</p>
<h2>Looking back: The value in regulatory gray areas</h2>
<p>“The tech comes in and moves faster than regulatory regimes do, or can control it,” Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick said at The Aspen Institute in 2013.</p>
<p>The brash statement downplayed that the regulatory landscape had, in fact, driven a number of pivotal outcomes for the company up to that event. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/24/ubercab-ordered-to-cease-and-desist/">changed its name</a> from UberCab to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist order in its first market, California. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300244/uber-taxi-new-york-travis-kalanick-rogue">Several early employees left</a> because of the startup’s regulatory challenges and iconoclastic ethos. It <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3451108/uber-taxi-pulls-out-new-york-tlc">shut down</a> its taxi service in New York after just a month of operations, and then in early 2013 received its lifeline in the city after being approved through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4271490/uber-becomes-first-taxi-app-to-get-approved-in-new-york-city">pilot program</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present, and Uber has a market cap of about $82 billion, with the ousted Kalanick having a personal net worth in the neighborhood of $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Still, even at its scale, many of its most important questions on growth centered around how favorably the regulatory landscape would treat its category. Most recently, this came with the U.K. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html#:~:text=Uber%20now%20treats%20all%2070%2C000,were%20workers%2C%20not%20independent%20contractors.">ruling</a> that Uber drivers could not be classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>The regulatory fabric has had similar leverage over other sharing-economy companies. In October 2014, for example, Airbnb’s business model became viable in San Francisco when Mayor Ed Lee <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/10/27/mayor-lee-approves-short-term-rentals-in-san-francisco-homeaway-vbro-renting-housing-tech-cost-of-living-affordable-hotel-tax/">legalized</a> short-term rentals. In November 2015, Proposition F in the city aimed to restrict short-term rentals like Airbnb, and the startup spent millions in advertisements to mobilize voters in opposition.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s current market cap stands at $92 billion, and its CEO, Brian Chesky, has an estimated net worth over $11 billion. Like Uber, its regulatory tribulations continue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paris-court-fines-airbnb-9-6-million-for-illegal-listings/">most recently being fined</a> and judged to owe $9.6 million to the city of Paris.</p>
<p>The stories of these two companies and others in the sharing economy space demonstrate the value that the regulatory fabric can add or subtract from a company’s wealth, but also underscore the value  —  for founding teams, early employees, investors and customers  —  of navigating the gray areas.</p>
<h2>Looking around: The data economy</h2>
<p>The present regulatory fabric has precipitated market timing for ideas in a number of categories. Solutions that enable data privacy, like <a href="https://bigid.com/">BigID</a>, and ones that embed data privacy into larger customer value propositions, like <a href="https://blotout.io/">Blotout</a>, are on streamlined growth tailwinds from the GDPR in Europe and their inspired analogs in the U.S.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a year of <a href="https://ev.medium.com/medium-editorial-team-update-8679bcb9fe81">editorial pivots</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/medium-exodus-culture-memo/">employee exits</a>, Medium announced today that it will make significant changes to its <a href="https://medium.com/earn">Medium Partner Program</a>, which allows writers on the platform to monetize their content.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Medium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/medium-opens-up-its-partner-program-allowing-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-paywall/">launched</a> its Partner Program in 2017. Since then, the platform has paid out $28 million to over <a href="https://digiday.com/media/exclusive-medium-will-begin-offering-writers-a-50-cut-of-the-subscriber-revenue-their-content-generates/">200,000 contributors</a>. Initially, it offered payouts based on how much time Medium members spent reading a writer&#8217;s content. For $5 per month or $50 per year, Medium members could read all posts on the platform without hitting a paywall. Plus, part of each member&#8217;s subscription was split among the writers they read; so, if a Medium member spent 10% of their time reading one writer&#8217;s work, for example, that writer would get 10% of the subscriber&#8217;s revenue share.</p>
<p>Medium said that earnings based on read time will remain the same. But now, Medium will offer a new way to make money with the launch of a referral program.</p>
<p>Previously, if a reader converted to a paying member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210401002027/https://medium.com/earn">within 30 days</a> of reading a writer&#8217;s story, that writer would get credit for the amount of time the reader spent reading their work. Under the <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">new model</a>, Partner Program writers will now have a personalized referral landing page &#8212; for any reader who purchases a Medium subscription via their page, the writer will get half of that member&#8217;s subscription fee for as long as they remain a paying member, minus the standard 2.9% + $0.30 in payment processing fees. So, if a writer got 100 readers to sign up for a monthly Medium membership through their referral, that would net the writer $227 per month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188675" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188675" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188675" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="587" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=150,130 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=300,259 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=768,663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=680,587 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-11-at-11.39.34-AM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188675" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405927192215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>However, now it&#8217;s more difficult for a writer to join the Partner Program &#8212; writers must have 100 followers, at least one published Medium story, and they must live within <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011694187">specific geographic regions</a>. Even if a Partner meets the new eligibility requirements, they might lose their status if they don&#8217;t publish anything new in a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">six-month period</a>. Still, under the previous structure, just becoming a Partner didn&#8217;t guarantee financial rewards &#8212; some Partners with smaller followings would make <a href="https://medium.com/menlo-office/writing-stories-on-medium-for-pennies-a5eec97dbeb7">pennies</a> each month. Existing Partners will retain their status through the end of 2021, and if they haven&#8217;t reached 100 followers by then, they will be removed.</p>
<p>Also, Medium will soon institute a <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">minimum payout threshold</a> of $10, meaning that if a writer makes less than $10 in a month, that pay will roll over to the next month until they amass at least $10.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Medium has been reticent about its member numbers in the past, but CEO Ev Williams told TechCrunch in November that its member numbers were in the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">high hundreds of thousands</a>.&#8221; In March 2021, Medium had <a href="https://www.axios.com/medium-subscribers-buyout-ev-williams-88549883-dd36-4bb6-88cf-089cf174648d.html?stream=technology&amp;utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_technology">725,000 members</a> per Axios, but <a href="https://digiday.com/media/medium-eyes-media-partnerships-pursuit-1-million-subscribers/">Digiday previously reported</a> that Medium had hoped to reach 1 million members by 2020. As of September, its competitor Substack, founded in 2017, had <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-spurs-journalists-to-go-it-alone-via-email-613ca2d5-e8d5-4235-9582-48cc028e9d8b.html">250,000 paid subscribers</a> and raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">$65 million series B round</a> two months later. Medium<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/medium/company_financials"> last raised</a> venture funding in 2016 with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/medium-series-c/">$50 million series C round</a>.</p>

<p>Platforms like Substack and the newer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/ghost-cms-adds-open-source-subscription-and-membership-options/">Ghost</a> pay writers based on how many paying subscribers they have.

While Substack or Ghost readers might subscribe to multiple individual newsletters, Medium subscribers pay just one $5 monthly or $50 yearly fee to access all of the website&#8217;s content.</p>

Then, last week, Quora unveiled a monetization platform called </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/creators-can-now-monetize-their-expertise-on-quora/">Quora+</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which costs the same as a Medium membership. Similar to Medium, Quora+ subscribers get access to all content any writer chooses to put behind a paywall, and writers are paid based on engagement with their content. But writers can also write paywalled posts on <a href="https://quorablog.quora.com/Introducing-Spaces">Spaces</a>, which are like user-created publications on Quora &#8212; Quora takes a 5% cut of those payments.</span></p>

<p>Did you hear it? FEMA just ran its first nationwide test of the U.S. emergency alert system since the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, tested both the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which broadcasts an emergency tone and message on televisions and radios, and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a newer system that sends emergency notifications to smartphones. This was the second nationwide test of the WEA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">after its debut in 2018</a>, and the first test for all U.S. cell phones of users who chose to opt-in to receive test alerts.</p>
<p>The test began around 2:20 p.m. ET. If you opted-in to the test, you likely got a message on your phone that said: &#8220;THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.&#8221; (The FCC explains <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/weatest_opt-in_instructions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to opt-in</a> to test alerts.)</p>
<p>For the first time, the WEA test sent the same test message in Spanish to phones that have Spanish set as the default language.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188804" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188804" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg" alt="" width="650" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/test-fema.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188804" class="wp-caption-text">This is what the test WEA emergency alert looks like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/waEMD/status/1425523462613856261" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WA Emergency Management <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/fema-national-emergency-test/">last nationwide test</a> in 2019, FEMA <a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts#enhancements">said it has improved</a> WEA to send longer, detailed messages to the majority of phones that support it. The update also allows authorities to include tappable links, like web addresses.</p>
<p>FEMA runs these tests every year or two to ensure the system is working properly. It&#8217;s no small task: A national emergency alert system designed to broadcast the same message to potentially hundreds of millions of people at any given time is fraught with technological hurdles that require close co-operation from the cell carriers and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>The EAS system has been around since the late 1990s, but WEA was developed more recently as more Americans rely on their phones. WEA alerts, like EAS alerts, are designed to be sent by local and state authorities for public safety alerts, missing children and imminent threats, such as severe weather. More recently, FEMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/fema-is-about-to-send-a-presidential-alert-to-millions-of-u-s-phones/">rolled out &#8220;presidential alerts,&#8221;</a> which are supposed to be sent to every phone in the U.S. in the event of a national emergency. Presidential alerts, unlike other alerts, can be issued by the sitting president for any reason, and Americans cannot opt out.</p>
<p>WEA broadcasts emergency notifications through the cell towers of an affected area — such as an area about to be hit by a storm — rather than sending tens of millions of text messages, which would grind the cell networks to a halt. The alerts are created by local, state or federal authorities and are authenticated by FEMA through the Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System, or IPAWS, and then passed to cell carriers to deliver the emergency alert.</p>
<p>The emergency alert system, though, is far from perfect. In 2018, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/13/inexcusable-false-ballistic-missile-alert-in-hawaii-was-caused-by-human-error/">erroneous alert</a> sent to Hawaii residents warned of an imminent ballistic missile threat,&#8221; and that &#8220;this is not a drill.&#8221; Minutes later, the alert was canceled. The false warning came as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were at an all-time high, during which Pyongyang was regularly test-firing rockets used for its nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Security experts have also long warned that the EAS systems pose security risks. Last year, researchers found <a href="https://securityledger.com/2020/01/seven-years-later-scores-of-eas-systems-sit-un-patched-vulnerable/">dozens of internet-connected, special-purpose servers</a> used by television and radio stations to interrupt their broadcasts to relay an emergency alert, which they said could allow a hacker to break in and compromise the servers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital manufacturing startup Varda Space Industries is moving fast. Only a few weeks after announcing a $42 million Series A, Varda has signed a deal with launch company Rocket Lab for three Photon spacecraft to support the startup’s initial missions.</p>
<p>The first spacecraft will be delivered in the first quarter of 2023, with the second to follow later that year and the third in 2024. It’s an aggressive schedule for the eight-month-old Varda and would mark the company’s first three manufacturing missions to space. The contract includes an option for Varda to purchase a fourth Photon.</p>
<p>Partnering with a more established company makes sense &#8212; especially considering the Photon’s bona fides, which includes a NASA-funded mission to the moon at the end of the year. Rocket Lab was also awarded a subcontract by the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory to design two Photon spacecraft for a one-year mission to Mars.</p>

<p>Varda, which was founded by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov, is banking big on a manufacturing condition that you can only find in space: microgravity. They think that the potential market for bioprinted organs, specialized semiconductors, fiber-optic cables or pharmaceuticals &#8212; products that you can’t make in Earthbound-conditions &#8212; is high enough to make the costs of building a spacecraft and launching to space more than worth it.</p>

<p>Under this most recent deal, each Photon will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: The first will be a microgravity manufacturing module, where the space production will actually take place, and the second will be a reentry capsule designed to bring those finished products back to Earth. Asparouhov told TechCrunch that the are designing the reentry modules to bring back “on the order of 40-60 kilograms of materials” for the first couple of missions, with the aim of quickly scaling up for subsequent launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Varda says this approach is low-risk and incremental. “That’s why we&#8217;re seeing so much interest from the investment community, [the Department of Defense], NASA, et cetera, it’s this very pragmatic, one-step-at-a-time approach,” Asparouhov said. “We’ll prove this first space factory. And yes, as we start to scale it allows us to send a larger space factory and then eventually, yes, we might have something the size of the [International Space Station], 10 times the size of the ISS. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re starting with. We&#8217;re starting with a very small, near-term pragmatic approach.”</p>
<p>Each mission will last roughly three months from launch to landing, Rocket Lab said in a statement.</p>
