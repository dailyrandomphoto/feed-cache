										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Until children reach a certain age, enrichment programs are somewhat limited to school, sports, and camps, while money-making opportunities are largely non-existent.</p>
<p>Now, a year-old, L.A.-based startup called <a href="https://mighty.business/">Mighty</a>, a kind of Shopify that invites younger kids to open a store online, aims to partly fill the void. In fact, Mighty &#8212; led by founders Ben Goldhirsh, who previously founded GOOD magazine, and Dana Mauriello, who spent nearly five years with Etsy and was most recently an advisor to Sidewalk Labs &#8212; hopes to woo families with the pitch that it operates at the center of fintech, ed tech, and entertainment.</p>
<p>As often happens, the concept derived from the founders&#8217; own experience. In this case, Goldhirsh, who has been living in Costa Rica, began worrying about his two daughters, who attend a small, six-person school. Because he feared they might fall behind their stateside peers, he began tutoring them when they arrived home, using Khan Academy among other software platforms. Yet the girls&#8217; reaction wasn&#8217;t exactly positive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were like, &#8220;F*ck you, dad. We just finished school and now you&#8217;re going to make us do more school?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, he encouraged them to sell the bracelets they&#8217;d been making online, figuring it would teach them needed math skills, as well as teach them about startup capital, business plans (he made them write one), and marketing. It worked, he says, and as he told friends about this successful &#8220;project-based learning effort,&#8221; they began to ask if he could help <em>their</em> kids get up and running.</p>
<p>Fast forward and Goldhirsh and Mauriello &#8212; who ran a crowdfunding platform that Goldhirsh invested in before she joined Etsy &#8212; say they&#8217;re now steering a still-in-beta startup that has become home to 3,000 &#8220;CEOs&#8221; as Mighty calls them.</p>
<p>The interest isn&#8217;t surprising. Kids are spending more of their time online than at any point in history. Many of the real-world type businesses that might have once employed young kids are shrinking in size. Aside from babysitting or selling cookies on the corner, it&#8217;s also challenging to find a job before high school, given the Department of Labor’s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>, which sets 14 years old as the minimum age for employment. (Even then, many employers worry that their young employees might be more work than is worth it.)</p>
<p>Investor think it&#8217;s a pretty solid idea, too. Mighty recently closed on $6.5 million in seed funding led by Animo Ventures, with participation from Maveron, Humbition, Sesame Workshop, Collaborative Fund and NaHCO3, a family office.</p>
<p>Still, building out a platform for kids is tricky. For starters, not a lot of 11-year-olds have the tenacity required to sustain their own business over time. While Goldhirsh likens the business to a &#8220;21st century lemonade stand,&#8221; running a business that doesn&#8217;t dissolve at the end of the afternoon is a very different proposition.</p>
<p>Goldhirsh acknowledges that no kid wants to hear they have to &#8220;grind&#8221; on their business or to follow a certain trajectory, and he says that Mighty is certainly seeing kids who show up for a weekend to make some money. Still, he insists, many others have an undeniably entrepreneurial spirit and says they tend to stick around.  In fact, says Goldhirsh, the company &#8212; aided by its new seed funding &#8212; has much to do in order to keep its hungriest young CEOs happy.</p>
<p>Many are frustrated, for example, that they currently can&#8217;t sell their own homemade items through Mighty. Instead, they are invited to sell items like hats, totes, and stickers that they customize and which are made by Mighty&#8217;s current manufacturing partner, <a href="https://www.printful.com/">Printful</a>, which then ships out the item to the end customer. (The Mighty CEO gets a percentage of the sale, as does Mighty.)</p>
<p>They can also sell items made by global artisans through a partnership that Mighty has struck with <a href="https://www.novica.com/">Novica</a>, an impact marketplace that also sells through National Geographic.</p>
<p>The idea was to introduce as little friction into the process as possible at the outset, but &#8220;our customers are pissed &#8212; they want more from us,&#8221; says Goldhirsh, explaining that Mighty fully intends to one day enable its smaller entrepreneurs to sell their own items, as well as services (think lawn care), which the platform also does not support currently.</p>
<p>As for how it makes money, Mighty plans to layer in subscription services eventually, as well as collect transaction-based revenue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s intriguing, on the whole, though the startup could need to fend off established players like Shopify to should it begin to gain traction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also conceivable that parents &#8212; if not children&#8217;s advocates &#8212;  could push back on what Mighty is trying to do. Entrepreneurship can be alternately exhilarating and demoralizing, after all; it&#8217;s a roller coaster some might not want kids to ride from such a young age.</p>
<p>Mauriello insists they haven&#8217;t had that kind of feedback to date. For one thing, she says, Mighty recently launched an online community where its young CEOs can encourage one another and trade sales tips, and she says they are actively engaging there.</p>
<p>She also argues that, like sports or learning a musical instrument, there are lessons to be learned by creating a store on Mighty. Storytelling and how to sell are among them, but as critically, she says, the company&#8217;s young customers are learning that &#8220;you can fail and pick yourself back up and try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adds Goldhirsch, &#8220;There are definitely kids who are like, &#8216;Oh, this is harder than I thought it was going to be. I can&#8217;t just launch the site and watch money roll in.&#8217; But I think they like the fact that the success they are seeing they are earning, because we&#8217;re not doing it for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 2. We are heading into a holiday weekend here in the United States, so you might imagine that tech news slowed down. It did not, as we’ll see shortly. Looking ahead, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tc-early-stage-2021-marketing-and-fundraising-kicks-off-in-1-week/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising is next week</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt is around the corner</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/department-of-justice-opens-investigation-into-ev-startup-lordstown-motors/"><strong>When SPACs attack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The United States Department of Justice is investigating Lordstown Motors, the embattled EV company that went public via a SPAC. Detractors of the company have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">punched holes in the story it told before going public</a>, and the company’s SPAC deck has proven to be somewhat, well, disconnected from reality. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">company needs more money</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">it turns out</a>, despite having told investors that it would not. Whoops.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/"><strong>China v. Didi v. American investors:</strong></a> Sticking to the theme of companies in trouble, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is in hot water with its own domestic regulators. The company has been told to halt new user registration, pending a cybersecurity review. Just <em>days</em> after it went public in the United States. Oof.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/jim-whitehurst-steps-down-as-president-at-ibm-just-14-months-after-taking-role/"><strong>IBM’s President steps down:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jim Whitehurst, who made his way to IBM via its Red Hat deal, is out. His tenure as president at the firm lasted 14 months. Details were light on his exit, per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> Yeesh.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Today’s startup news has a strong non-American bias. That’s because nearly everyone in the United States took most of today off, regardless of what their boss thought was going on. The rest of the world was still busy, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/indias-licious-raises-192-million-for-international-expansion/"><strong>Licious raises tasty $192M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The Bangalore-based meat and seafood e-commerce player has now raised through a <em>Series F</em>. A few years back we would have joked that the F in Series F stood for “failed to go public,” but that’s no longer the case. Why <em>not</em> raise a Series F when money is so cheap? The company is now worth more than $650 million, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/swedish-gaming-giant-acquires-india-playsimple-for-360-million/"><strong>MTG buys PlaySimple for $360M:</strong></a> Why are investors betting so much money on the Indian startup ecosystem? Rising exit values, perhaps. TechCrunch noted that the sale of India’s PlaySimple to Swedish gaming giant was “one of the largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/"><strong>Tiger invests $40M into Nigerian neobank:</strong></a> It’s a big day for FairMoney, a Nigerian startup that has its genesis in offering consumers credit. It’s also yet another round for African fintech, a sector that has felt pretty active lately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter</h2>
<p>Did you hear about the CEO who made misleading claims about a funding round and got sued by the SEC? How about that pharmaceutical executive whose taunts to a former secretary of state led to a 4.4% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index?</p>
<p>In case it isn&#8217;t clear: Startup executives are held to a higher standard when it comes to what they post on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all,&#8221; says Lisa W. Liu, a senior partner at The Mitzel Group, a San Francisco-based law practice that serves many startups.</p>
<p>To help her clients (and Extra Crunch readers) stay out of trouble, Liu has six basic questions for tech execs with itchy Twitter fingers.</p>
<p>And if the answer to any of them is “I don’t know,” don’t post.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is a mixed bag, but a fun one. And each story has a strong California hook. Let’s begin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/"><strong>GM is investing in a California lithium extraction project:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Why? Batteries. Gotta have lithium to make batteries. No batteries, no electric cars. In this case the project is actually pretty neat, having a strong hook to Salton Sea Geothermal Field near Los Angeles in the southern part of the state. The geothermal field will provide power and materials. So perhaps electric cars’ pre-driving carbon footprint will be a bit more sustainable in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/twitter-colorful-misinformation-labels/">Twitter tests more attention-grabbing misinformation labels:</a> </strong>Twitter, a <em>California-based company</em>, is making its misinformation labeling a bit more standout. It’s fun to watch social media companies make warnings sterner at the same time as Google is making advertisements better blend into its organic results.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/dutch-court-will-hear-another-facebook-privacy-lawsuit/">Dutch court will hear another Facebook privacy lawsuit:</a> </strong>A few Dutch nonprofits are suing Facebook over alleged “rampant collection of internet users’ data — arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing,” TechCrunch summarized. This case <em>seems</em> like it could have broad import, depending on how it shakes out. Given, you know, how much data collection goes on literally all the time, literally everywhere, online.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, China ordered ride-hailing company Didi to stop signing up new customers after regulators announced a cybersecurity review of the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Didi&#8217;s stock price is down 5.3%. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/chinese-cybersecurity-probe-validates-didis-pre-ipo-warning-to-investors/">today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm suggested that the move wasn&#8217;t a complete surprise, but it still &#8220;puts a bad taste in our mouths,&#8221; since the company went public days ago.</p>

<hr />
<p>When Didi filed to go public, it listed several potential pitfalls facing Chinese companies that go public in the U.S., including &#8220;numerous legal and regulatory risks&#8221; and &#8220;extensive government regulation and oversight in its F-1.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this news signify for other Chinese companies that are hoping for stateside IPOs?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be off on Monday, July 5 in observance of Independence Day. Thanks very much for reading, and I hope you have an excellent weekend.</p>

<p>Did you hear about the CEO who made misleading claims about a funding round and got sued? How about that pharmaceutical executive whose taunts to a former Secretary of State led to a 4.4% decline in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index?</p>
<p>In case it isn&#8217;t clear: Startup executives are held to a higher standard when it comes to what they post on social media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all,&#8221; says Lisa W. Liu, a senior partner at The Mitzel Group, a San Francisco-based law practice that serves many startups.</p>
<p>To help her clients (and Extra Crunch readers) Liu has six basic questions for tech execs with itchy Twitter fingers.</p>
<p>And if the answer to any of them is “I don’t know,” don’t post.</p>

<p>A report from Brighteye Ventures on Europe&#8217;s edtech scene shows that this year&#8217;s deal flow is on pace to meet or surpass 2020, when remote instruction exploded.</p>
<p>According to Brighteye&#8217;s head of Research, Rhys Spence, the average deal size is now $9.4 million, a threefold increase from last year. Still, &#8220;It’s interesting that we are not seeing enormous increases in deal count,&#8221; he noted.</p>

<p>Trading platform Robinhood has attracted enough users and activity to change the conversation around retail investing — economists will likely be discussing the 2021 GameStop saga for years to come.</p>
<p>After the company filed to go public yesterday, Alex Wilhelm sorted through Robinhood&#8217;s main income statement to better understand how it scaled year-ago revenue from $127.6 million to $522.2 million in Q1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are numbers that we frankly do not see often amongst companies going public,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;300% growth is a pre-Series A metric, usually.&#8221;</p>
<p>So: where is all that revenue coming from?</p>

<p>Given the valuation gap between U.S. tech markets and those overseas, it&#8217;s easy to see why some foreign startups would head to our shores when it&#8217;s time to go public.</p>
<p>But Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm found that a record increase in European venture capital activity is picking up the pace of IPOs this year, and many of these companies are content to go public in their native markets.</p>
<p>To gain some insight into where European investors believe they have an advantage, Anna and Alex interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Franck Sebag, partner, EY</li>
<li>David Miranda, partner, Osborne Clarke Spain</li>
<li>Yoram Wijngaarde, founder and CEO, Dealroom</li>

<p>In a recent private equity survey, 80% of respondents said their co-investments with people outside traditional VC firms outperformed their PE fund investments.</p>
<p>Alternative investors are highly motivated, and because they’re seeking higher returns than are generally available in public markets, they are less daunted by risk. In return, they benefit from less expensive fee structures and develop close ties with VCs, enlarging the talent pool as they build investment skills.</p>
<p>These relationships have direct benefits for VCs as well, such as more flexibility with diversification and consolidated decision-making power.</p>
<p>“With the right deal structure, deal selection and deal investigation, co-investors can significantly increase their returns,” says C5 Capital Managing Partner William Kilmer, who wrote an Extra Crunch post for VCs considering an alternative path.</p>

<p>Smart-building products include everything from connecting landlords with tenants to managing construction sites.</p>
<p>Given their widespread impact on the enterprise — and the novel nature of much of this new technology, selecting the right digital building platform (DBP) is a challenge for most organizations.</p>
<p>Brian Turner, LEED-AP BD&amp;C, has created a matrix intended to help decision-makers identify the fundamental functions and desired outcomes for stakeholders.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to the built environment, creating those comfortable, healthy and enjoyable places requires new tools,&#8221; says Turner. &#8220;Selecting a solid DBP is one of the most important decisions to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>One perennial problem inside startups: Because no one on the founding team has significant marketing experience, growth-related efforts are pro forma and generally unlikely to move the needle.</p>
<p>Everyone wants higher click-through rates, but creating ads that “stand out” is a risky strategy, especially when you don’t know what you’re doing. This guest post by Demand Curve offers seven strategies for boosting CTR that you can clone and deploy today inside your own startup.</p>
<p>Here’s one: If customers are talking about you online, reach out to ask if you can add a screenshot of their reviews to your advertising. Testimonials are a form of social proof that boost conversions, and they’re particularly effective when used in retargeting ads.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we ran another post about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/demand-curve-email-marketing-tactics-that-convert-subscribers-into-customers/">optimizing email marketing for early-stage startups</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have more expert growth advice coming soon, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Locking down data centers and networks against intruders is just one aspect of an organization’s security responsibilities; cloud services, collaboration tools and APIs extend security perimeters even farther. What’s more, the systems created to prevent the misuse and mishandling of sensitive data often depend heavily on someone’s better angels.</p>
<p>According to Sid Trivedi, a partner at Foundation Capital, and seven-time CIO Mark Settle, IT managers need to replace existing DLP frameworks with a new one that centers on DMP — data misuse protection.</p>
<p>These solutions “will provide data assets with more sophisticated self-defense mechanisms instead of relying on the surveillance of traditional security perimeters,” and many startups are already competing in this space.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Far too often, we see medical mixups and even deaths caused by interoperability obstacles in our healthcare system. In these situations, patients in critical conditions cannot speak to their past medical history in an emergency. Upon their recovery but through no fault of their healthcare providers, they are left footing a massive medical bill or facing other severe financial repercussions. Lack of access to data not only causes these terrible outcomes &#8212; it’s also part of the reason why our healthcare costs are <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical">nearly 18% of the GDP</a> and growing.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons why healthcare data isn’t more digitally accessible is a very simple one: fear that it will be misused. Patients are scared their data will be used against them. This could happen in a number of ways, the most obvious being the threat that insurance companies will use health data to deny people coverage or that employers will use the data to exclude people when making hiring decisions. That’s why the <a href="https://healthinformatics.uic.edu/blog/health-data-privacy/">rules and regulations</a> surrounding health data privacy are so stringent.</p>
<p>So, how can investors advance (and capitalize on) tech development around this issue and help eradicate this fear?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Investors, take note</h2>
<p>We know funding for companies in healthcare and digital health has not been a problem — but profitability has. Many of these companies are still struggling financially under a fee-for-service business as required by most insurance companies, Medicaid and Medicare. There are grave inefficiencies in the fee-for-service system: It creates the wrong alignment of interests; doesn’t favor the consumer; is complicated by CPT codes (the numerical codes used to identify medical services and procedures), high copayments and deductibles; and is riddled by waste and abuse.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If the investor community bets on companies that continue to embrace a model that many agree is broken, how can we expect outsized returns?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>If the investor community bets on companies that continue to embrace a model that many agree is broken, how can we expect outsized returns? To truly lower costs and reduce inefficiencies, we have to abandon the existing structure and put the customer first.</p>
<p>The key here is to look at companies that are truly trying to solve not just one piece of this puzzle, but those that are attempting to create an end-to-end solution that connects the employer, member, hospital, specialists, pharmaceutical companies, primary care doctors and claims adjusters, powered by digital health data — all while making it more affordable for the consumer.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for those that are moving away from the fee-for-service structure and focused on employer-driven systems. Employers are properly aligned with patients, as bad health outcomes and financial stress both negatively impact productivity. Employers are also focused on KPIs in their business; they’re used to measuring and tracking results, making them great candidates for data-focused healthcare companies.</p>
<p>Most importantly, in a labor market where companies are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/08/economy/jobs-openings-april/index.html">clamoring to attract employees</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, </span>employers will have to work with healthcare technology companies that put a premium on data security because their current and potential employees will demand it.</p>
<h2>Innovation over fear</h2>
<p>The whole future of healthcare is going to focus on the ability to securely share data. To empower providers and patients to take control of their healthcare journey, we need to build a system of trust that allows the efficient flow of personal healthcare information from stakeholder to stakeholder.</p>
<p>Today, with the way HIPAA works and the requirement to keep data private, that trust has to be in the hands of a provider. Imagine if your primary care physician was the quarterback of your entire healthcare journey. Simply by handling your preventative care, they have a more complete picture.</p>
<p>Even better, preventative care is a major focus when it comes to reducing healthcare costs. If you put the data in the hands of a trusted entity and ensure that each person has access to their full medical history, people are much more likely to grant access at times of need.</p>
<h2>The good news? There’s hope</h2>
<p>The future is very bright because of technology. The challenge is being able to figure out meaningful ways to utilize and integrate it. Right now, we have a system of incumbency that is disincentivized to embrace new technologies.</p>
<p>Telehealth is a perfect example of how the system can meaningfully change. It took a global pandemic to really be able to break through to a point where telehealth was fully embraced (and covered by insurance). Now, health insurers such as <a href="https://ehrintelligence.com/news/anthem-integrates-epic-ehr-for-care-coordination-interoperability">Anthem</a> are actively trying to improve care coordination and interoperability.</p>
<p>Three critical technologies not used in healthcare today could be instrumental in bringing about this change. Ideally, all three will align to usher in a new era of healthcare:</p>
<h3>Healthcare telemetry 2.0: Collection of health data on cellular devices</h3>
<p>Through our use of social apps and e-commerce platforms on our mobile devices, people have already accepted that our cell phones are constantly collecting data on us and willingly consent to this. Sometimes this function is quite helpful — just look at court cases where detailed location data have provided alibis to suspects.</p>
<p>Anybody with a cell phone is carrying a medical device that counts our steps, tracks our screen actions and is attuned to us as users. So why are we not leveraging this function for optimized care — or at the very least trying to get medical insights out of our device use data?</p>
<p>In the future, the number of times one checks their mobile calendar in a day could be an indicator of early-onset Alzheimer’s in people of a particular age group, as one example. Technologists must continue to push the boundaries of how the computing power in our pockets and purses is used to help us, especially with so much of the groundwork already laid.</p>
<h3>Privacy 2.0: Application of blockchain to protect medical information</h3>
<p>In just the past six months, we have seen bad actors capitalizing on digital risk to cripple entire industries through data breaches. The Colonial Pipeline hack effectively shuttered gas distribution to a massive portion of the U.S. in a matter of hours. With healthcare data, stewards of the system need to be even more careful. It will be tricky to regulate the privacy and protection of healthcare data, but blockchain technology has proven to be an effective measure in maintaining trust between consumers and data stewards.</p>
<h3>Portability 2.0: Ability to securely share information with approved parties</h3>
<p>For many people with life-threatening conditions, the simple act of wearing a medical bracelet can make a difference between life and death — but at this point, medical bracelets should be obsolete. Imagine the patient benefits that could come from a next-generation medical “bracelet” that carries a patient’s entire genome, tumor profiles, long-term heart rate trends and more, and can be uploaded instantly in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>Right now, the absence of health record portability creates redundancies that are both expensive and harmful to patients. Doctors spend time and resources rescanning patients, while patients suffer from repeated (and sometimes risky) diagnostics, like blood draws and radiation. Nobody has cracked the code on portability, but effective solutions must navigate tricky regulatory waters while solving for standardization across data sets.</p>
<p>We are already seeing these technologies used in other industries. Apple and Google have turned phones into remote monitoring devices that can easily collect all types of health telemetry data. Cryptocurrency represents billions of dollars in transactions with no breach of trust in various coin exchanges. Uber and Lyft have changed the way we hire, use and pay for transportation. Applying the core technologies used in each of these examples would provide a means for disrupting the current challenges in healthcare. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>History has proven that with innovation, investment and technology, the world has become a dramatically better place. As long as rules and regulations stay out of the way, you can expect that technology will allow us to make enormous leaps forward in the next decade.</p>
<p>Making data secure and meaningful, along with personalized medicine, holds the promise to reduce long-term healthcare costs in the U.S. while improving healthcare outcomes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get your spool-of-yarn emojis ready &#8212; threads might be coming to Facebook soon. Facebook has been spotted testing a new feature that gives public figures on Facebook the ability to create a new post that&#8217;s connected to a previous one on a related subject. This feature ties the posts together more visually so fans can more easily follow updates over time. When the new post appears on followers&#8217; News Feeds, it will be shown as being connected to the other posts in a thread.</p>
<p>Social media consultant Matt Navarra first <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1410595945687945220">spotted this</a> feature in action, and shared several screenshots of how it looks. Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s testing the feature with a small group of &#8220;public figures&#8221; on Facebook for the time being. A public figure is a specific type of Facebook Page category aimed at high-profile individuals or anyone else who wants to establish a more public presence on Facebook.</p>

<p>Facebook explained these threaded posts will have a &#8220;View Post Thread&#8221; button, which lets followers easily navigate to see all of the posts in the thread. When you tap on the button, you&#8217;ll be shown where you can see all the threaded posts connected together in one place.</p>
<p>Facebook was unable to confirm if or when the test would roll out more broadly to other public figures on its platform or if it would later expand to other Page categories, like Businesses, or to Facebook Groups.</p>

<p>Threads are useful on sites like Twitter, where the character limit makes it harder to have more nuanced conversations &#8212; that&#8217;s why we end up with those oh-so-beloved &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html">notes app apology</a>&#8221; posts on Twitter. (Now, Twitter promotes its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">Revue</a> newsletter app when you write a thread). But on Facebook, your posts can be up to precisely 63,206 characters long (or, about 225 tweets).</p>
<p>Rather than inspiring longer posts, Facebook threads could be used for live commentary on an event like an award show. Or, users could post updates to their existing posts in a thread, rather than updating the original and making a clunky &#8220;edited to add&#8230;&#8221; announcement. Given that Facebook is testing this feature with public figures, perhaps its intended use is to make the sharing of news more streamlined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Facebook has dealt with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/as-advertisers-revolt-facebook-commits-to-flagging-newsworthy-political-speech-that-violates-policy/">misinformation issues</a> in the past, so for journalists or government officials sharing information about developing news events, threads could provide useful context.</p>
<p>This testing comes after Facebook announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin newsletter offshoot</a> earlier this week.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A CEO’s fiduciary duties to their company and its shareholders do not end when they are off the clock — they must always act in good faith. However, navigating the boundaries between a company’s official communications and a personal voice can be difficult in today’s social-media-connected environment.</p>
<p>What a CEO posts on Twitter can raise not only serious reputational issues for themselves and their companies but posting the wrong things at the wrong time can also cause breach of fiduciary duties and may even run afoul of securities laws.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Reputation and goodwill take a long time to build and are difficult to maintain, but it only takes one tweet to destroy it all.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fiduciary duties can be divided into three buckets: (1) duty of care — CEOs must act in good faith with the care of a reasonable person in a like position with a reasonable belief that their decisions are in furtherance of their company’s best interest; (2) duty of loyalty — CEOs must put the interest of shareholders and the company above their own self-interest; and (3) duty of good faith — CEOs must act with honesty and fairness to shareholders and the company.</p>
<p>There is no denying that Twitter can be leveraged as a powerful tool. Used appropriately, it can fortify the reputation of a company and its CEO, forge stronger consumer relationships and drive business profits. For example, Tim Cook’s habit of tweeting about his interactions with Apple customers demonstrates his customer-service values and effort to connect with consumers, which can potentially lead to a bigger and more loyal following.</p>
<p>Lately, more and more CEOs are communicating their stance on issues that are important to their consumer base to exhibit authenticity, relatability and demonstrate their personal and corporate values through social media. Following last year’s murder of George Floyd and rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, <a href="https://www.teneo.com/ceos-and-twitter-how-a-new-and-more-diverse-generation-of-ceos-are-leading-and-communicating-through-challenging-times/">nearly 60% of all S&amp;P 100 tech CEOs, unicorn CEOs, and Fortune 500 CEOs tweeted, &#8220;Black Lives Matter.&#8221;</a> This was the first time CEOs active on Twitter overwhelmingly voiced their position on racial and social justice issues.</p>
<p>Twitter can also be an opportunity to show transparency in policy. CEOs can use social media to announce new management initiatives, capability expansions and new investments in employees (diversity initiatives, new roles for women, organizational changes) that are positive in tone and speak about the future direction of the company. These can have a <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/298f9b44201.pdf">positive correlation with stock prices</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that the world was fixated on Donald Trump’s Twitter posts and their <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923621000877">correlation with the stock market</a>. Words have permanence and their impact can be catastrophic. Given their elevated role as a leader and representative of the company and the fiduciary duties they owe, CEOs must watch what they say and when they say it. What it all boils down to is awareness, common sense and the law.</p>
<h2>Don’t break the law and stick to the facts</h2>
<p>For U.S. publicly traded companies, SEC Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) says that “an issuer may not disclose material nonpublic information to certain groups, either intentionally or unintentionally, without disclosing the same information to the entire marketplace.” If companies use social media to announce key information, to comply, they must alert investors that social media will be used to disseminate such information.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is a public or private company, CEOs are corporate officers and owe fiduciary duties to their companies and their shareholders. Fiduciary duty requires CEOs to act in good faith, apply their best business judgment and to act in the best interest of the company. This is true whether they are in the boardroom or on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, enterprise computing corporation Zebra Technologies announced its plan to acquire Fetch Robotics. The San Jose-based startup has been a mainstay in warehouse and fulfillment robotics for a number of years, offering a modular system designed to automate companies behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The full deal is valued at $305 million, with Zebra acquiring the remaining 95% of the company for $290 million. It comes as interest in the category is at an all-time high, following widespread labor shortages during the pandemic.</p>
<p>After the news broke, we sat down with Fetch co-founder and CEO Melonee Wise to discuss the deal and the future of warehouse robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Why was this acquisition the right move for Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>When you look at it, over the last seven years, we’ve been building a pretty compelling cloud robotics platform. About two years ago, Zebra invested in Fetch, and we started working together through our partnership. One of the first things we did was integrating their mobile computing devices, for an out-of-the-box experience on our cloud robotics platform. When our customers got robots, they could take the hand scanner they already had today, scan a barcode and call a robot to them.</p>
<p>As we were fundraising for our Series D, this opportunity came out of that. I think when you look at it, over the last couple of years, we’ve had a good relationship with them. With the pandemic, there’s been a huge draw for more and more automation technology. Before the pandemic, there were already labor shortages for warehouse and logistics, and the pandemic only exacerbated it. One of the other great things about us joining Zebra is they have a strong go-to-market engine, and they can amplify our sales capability. They’re already in all of the customers we want to be working with. It helps us reach a much broader, wider and deeper audience.</p>
<p><strong>I’d assumed Fetch was a good potential candidate for an acquisition, but I’d always imagined it would be something like a Walmart looking to compete with Amazon robotics. I suspect that you&#8217;ve been approached by companies over the years. Why does this kind of acquisition make more sense, ultimately?</strong></p>
<p>I think the acquisition made sense because it aligns with more of our long-term vision. When we built our platform, we built it to be unifying. Not just our robots. Over the years we’ve been slowly bringing in other partners on the platform. We have a partnership with SICK, we have partnerships with other MWS providers like VARGO. That isn’t going to change. We’re still going to be partner friendly and we’re still going to bring other devices into the ecosystem. When you look at the options and the opportunities, this was a good opportunity and was well aligned with the team we wanted to build.</p>
<p><strong>I know Zebra has developed their own robot and invested in other robotics companies. Are you the cornerstone of an ecosystem play? Is this Zebra building a a robotic retail and fulfillment ecosystem around Fetch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that so far has been the discussion. It&#8217;s still evolving. I don&#8217;t have all the details for you, obviously. And of course, we still have 30 days or 35 days ‘till closing, so we&#8217;re still operating as independent businesses. In terms of vision of how we&#8217;re thinking about it, Zebra is very excited to kind of make Fetch the centerpiece of this whole new offering that they&#8217;re building out. It’s a high strategic priority for them.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Fetch brand remain? Will the company stay in San Jose? Are you staying on board?</strong></p>
<p>Fetch is not moving. We’re kind of becoming the centerpiece, so they want to keep the team together, in San Jose. My plan is to stay. We’re still working out the details [ … ] Fetch has a very strong brand, and so how do we get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Is acquisition something that a company like Fetch works toward? Do you consider it to be kind of an inevitability?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s complicated. When I started the company, I never really planned on anything. I just wanted to go build something. I mean that in the most sincere way. I wanted to go build something and not fail. And the question is, what does not failing look like? I think the facts are that in the last 20-something years, almost no robotics company has IPO&#8217;ed. Now we’re starting to see SPACS, but there hasn&#8217;t been a robotics company that’s IPO&#8217;ed through the traditional route.</p>
<p>I would say that if you were to ask me on any given day, what I thought the probability of IPO versus acquisition, I probably would have said acquisition, because there&#8217;s just not a history of robotics companies IPO&#8217;ing. That’s for lots of reasons. It’s a hardware intensive business. It takes a lot of technology and investment. Typically, they&#8217;re held privately. It’s hard for large corporate entities to have the P&amp;L to invest in this deep technology. I think that’s starting to change. And I think now that there’s SPACs, you’ll see a lot changing in that regard. But I would say you’re still going to see more acquisitions than you’re going to see IPOs for the next 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Had you been approached about acquisition in the past?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. In the past we had been, but many times before it was just too early.</p>
<p><strong>What does it mean to be too early?</strong></p>
<p>It just didn’t feel like the right time for lots of reasons. Some of it has to do with what I want. Some of it has to do with what the team wants. And some of it has to do with what our investors want. There are a lot of people at the table. This is always a hard question. Previously when those things had come up, the market was so undefined and so new, we just wanted to see where it went. Now we’re starting to see more structure to the environment, and we’re starting to see an inflection point.</p>
<p><strong>Is additional international expansion part of the plan?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We’re in several companies in Europe. We’re in APAC and expanding in that region. Right now, we aren’t placing any large bets in any of those countries. We’re waiting to see how the market develops, but we’re looking to expand.</p>

<h2>Used a headline with a more compelling value proposition</h2>
<p>The headline on the control version is <strong>“Health Insurance in China.”</strong> If I am an expat looking for health insurance in China, at least I know I am in the right place but I don’t immediately have a reason to choose you. I have to scroll and infer this from multiple elements.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For revenue-generating landing pages it is best to always follow the Bauhaus design aesthetic (from architecture). Form follows function, ornament is evil!					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The winning version instantly conveys a compelling value proposition: <strong>“Save Up to 32% on Your Health Insurance in China,”</strong> accompanied by “evidentials” to support this claim &#8212; the number of past customers and a relevant testimonial with a 4.5 star rating (by the way, it is better to use a default static testimonial rather than a moving carousel).</p>
<p>As the famed old-school direct response marketer John Caples taught us, “The reader’s attention is yours only for a single instant. They will not spend their valuable time trying to figure out what you mean.” What was true in Caples’ 1920s heyday is doubly so in the mobile age, when attention spans are shorter than a fruit fly’s!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lordstown Motors continues to stumble. The beleaguered electric vehicle startup is now being investigated by the Department of Justice, in addition to an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The investigation, first broke by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730">Wall Street Journal</a> on Friday, is still in its early stages, according to unnamed sources. It is being conducted by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lordstown Motors is committed to cooperating with any regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We look forward to closing this chapter so that our new leadership – and entire dedicated team – can focus solely on producing the first and best full-size all-electric pickup truck, the Lordstown Endurance.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The probe is just the latest in a series of woes for the startup, which recently said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">had to cut production volumes</a> for its debut electric pickup, Endurance, by half — from around 2,200 vehicles to 1,000. Just a few weeks after it made that announcement, there followed news of a corporate shakeup: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/lordstown-motors-ceo-and-cfo-resign-amidst-production-woes/">the resignation</a> of founding CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez. Burns started the company as an offshoot of his previous startup, Workhorse Group.</p>
<p>Lordstown had a strong start, with investments from General Motors that helped it purchase a 6.2-million-square-foot factory from the leading automaker in late 2019. Lordstown made positive headlines last August, when it announced it would go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">The deal</a> injected the EV startup with around $675 million in gross proceeds and skyrocketed its market value to $1.6 billion. Less than a year later, Lordstown <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">informed the SEC</a> that it does not have sufficient capital to manufacture Endurance.</p>
<p>Then, in March, the short-seller firm Hindenburg Research <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">released a report</a> disputing the company’s claims that it had booked 100,000 pre-orders for the electric pickup. It wrote that “extensive research reveals that the company’s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.” The SEC opened its investigation in the wake of these accusations.</p>
<p>The WSJ story is unclear on the scope of the inquiry and the company declined to provide details. TechCrunch will update the story if it learns more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a brief moment, earlier this week, it seemed as though Pittsburgh might be the center of the tech universe. Just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">Carnegie Mellon alum Duolingo was announcing its IPO</a>. Senators Bob Casey and Pat Toomey were in town, as Vice President Kamala Harris paid a visit to the City of Bridges to talk infrastructure.</p>
<p>The morning of TechCrunch’s City Spotlight, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robotics-roundup-18/"> Pittsburgh Robotics Network held its own event</a> to announce a new alliance with members of the local government and faculty from nearby universities.</p>
<p>“The alliance brings together leaders from top robotics companies, research institutions and universities in the Pittsburgh area, including Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Argo AI, Aurora, the University of Pittsburgh, Kaarta, RE2 Robotics, Neya Systems, Carnegie Robotics, HEBI Robotics, Near Earth Autonomy, BirdBrain Technologies, Omnicell and Advanced Construction Robotics,” a press release noted. “The Richard King Mellon Foundation commemorated this membership milestone with a grant of $125,000 to support the continued growth of the PRN.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pittsburgh-city-spotlight/">Our own Spotlight event</a>, held later that afternoon, was designed to highlight the city’s continued evolution. To many, Pittsburgh is still very much the plucky but troubled city reeling from the deindustrialization of the 70s and 80s, as the factory and industry jobs that formed its foundation moved out of town and shipped overseas. The rust belt veneer is a hard one to leave behind, but the city’s biggest cheerleaders are working hard to transform the image of Pittsburgh into one of robotics, AI, autonomy and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon has — and continues to be the cornerstone of that Pittsburgh. A world-class research school by any metric, CMU is the crown jewel of the area’s dozens of colleges and universities. While the University of Pittsburgh is a huge driver for the city’s medical and science communities, CMU is the reason it can count itself among the leaders in robots and self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Speaking at our event, Farnam Jahanian cited the school’s The Swartz Center as a major driver in its efforts to support the startup ambitions of students and faculty alike.</p>
<p>“The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon is a system of programming activities that offers a unique path of entrepreneurship, education, engagement, collaboration and opportunities for students, faculty and staff that are interested in entrepreneurship, from the Innovation Scholars Program, to the corporate startup lab, to essentially garages that students and faculty can essentially sign up for to launch their companies from plus a host of other programmatic things, resources that you would need,” says Jahanian, who was appointed CMU’s president in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/">The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship</a> was founded in 2015, courtesy of a $31 million donation from CMU alumnus and Accel Partners co-founder, James R. Swartz. The center built on previous efforts like 2012’s Carnegie Mellon Center and Project Olympus, founded in 2007. The Swartz Center and its recent precursors list among their success stories Duolingo, DataSquid and AbilLife.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/">Dave Mawhinney recently told TechCrunch</a> that he took the role as the center’s executive director in an effort, “to make it on par with Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Harvard and other great entrepreneurial universities.” CMU certainly isn’t outclassed by any of the above in terms of its position as a world-class research university, but Mawhinney concedes that the school and the city have traditionally grappled with entrepreneurial retention.</p>
<p>“You can always learn from what you have and build on it,” says Jahanian. “I would stress it is really about the entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s not about just what CMU does &#8212; that&#8217;s a critical part of it. It’s University of Pittsburgh, it&#8217;s other universities that are in our region that are also contributing significantly to our ecosystem.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Carnegie Mellon is helping build its own startups and keeping them in Pittsburgh&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/how-cmu-is-helping-build-its-own-startups-and-keeping-them-in-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=XVrh0JZ7YG" data-secret="XVrh0JZ7YG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mawhinney says that CMU’s ability to incubate and foster tech startups hit an inflection point roughly a decade and a half ago, as Big Tech took an increasing interest in the research the school was doing around things fields like AI and automation.</p>
<p>“Really, the seminal event was when Google put an office in Pittsburgh in 2006. They have over 1,000 employees,” he says. “Every major tech company — Amazon, Facebook, Apple — have all embedded hundreds of engineers in our community, so we’re growing really, really rapidly. Artificial intelligence was invented at Carnegie Mellon — and that sort of set off the robot revolution [ … ] Now we’re the center of the automated vehicle community. Aurora is co-located here, Argo is here, Aptiv is here. We have a very vibrant community and we do want to continue to grow it.”</p>
<p>Building a successful company requires a lot more than engineers, of course (there’s a decent chance you wouldn’t be reading this if that weren’t the case). In the lead up to our event, I asked several interested parties what the biggest hurdle was in continuing to attract and grow the city’s startup ecosystem. The overwhelming answer was simple: venture capital.</p>
<p>“What we need is more capital — angel funds, venture funds so that entrepreneurs have a variety of funding sources to go to locally,” Yvonne Campos of Next Act Fund LLC told TechCrunch. “We definitely need more funding for women-led businesses — women raise about one-third less capital than men-led companies. Not because of the business idea or leader, but because we invest in companies where we have the most comfort — we invest in people that look like us. Nationally, only about 20%-25% of all angel investors are women. We need more women to become active as investors.”</p>

<p>The city’s mayor, Bill Peduto, who also appeared at our event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/pittsburghs-mayor-on-the-citys-startup-community-and-the-difficulty-of-attracting-venture-capital/">echoed the sentiment</a>.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest hurdle remains access to venture capital, especially in this stage. I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off,” he told me in an interview. “However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help to take early-stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.”</p>
<p>During our conversation, however, Jahanian pushed back on the sentiment. “I respectfully disagree,” he told me. “Funding is important, but great ideas get funded. I’ve seen it my entire career. They get funded at levels that really show that these companies have a shot at being really successful.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;VCs discuss the opportunities — and challenges — in Pittsburgh&#8217;s startup ecosystem&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/vcs-discuss-the-opportunities-and-challenges-of-the-pittsburgh-startup-ecosystem/embed/#?secret=8h4Wmo7bPP" data-secret="8h4Wmo7bPP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CMU’s president points to another problem, entirely. “You need a lot more than just cool technologies or new research ideas or new concepts or products just to launch a company,” Jahanian says. “You need a lot more around it. You need marketing, product management, you need to be able to develop a business plan. So those are a lot of the resources that we do provide.”</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins CPO Bing Gordon reflected the sentiment, speaking to me over email. “[Pittsburgh needs] to import CFOs, product managers, ad sales,” he wrote. Another historical concern for the city is attracting that talent. CMU hasn’t had an issue on that front, because location is less of a key concern for students applying for research universities. When it comes to careers after college, settling down and starting a family, on the other hand, suddenly quality of life rockets up the list.</p>
<p>Jahanian says he has long championed green spaces and other communal gathering places in his conversations over the years with Peduto. He adds that the subject should continue to be top of mind for whoever the city’s new mayor is next year.</p>
<p>“One of the most important things about the startup and high-tech community in Pittsburgh is the quality of life for citizens across this town,” says Jahanian. “I can tell you as a university president, an overwhelming majority of the faculty that we recruit want to live in the city and enjoy it. That’s an important part of it. Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot more going on beyond the quality of life. The more that the city does to bridge the gap between those who are prospering and those who are potentially left behind in the economies that are created the high-tech economies is important. That&#8217;s a responsibility of the private sector and the public sector. I&#8217;m really optimistic that we&#8217;ll have a great partnership with our future mayor, as we&#8217;ve done in the past mayors to catalyze the economy and lift all boats.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Therapy is rapidly becoming a standard part of many people&#8217;s lives, but 2020 interrupted that trend by nixing in-person sessions and forcing therapists to migrate their entire practice online — and it turns out that&#8217;s not so easy. <a href="https://www.tryframe.com/">Frame</a> simplifies it with an all-in-one portal for clients and therapists, unifying the listings, tools and management software that run the countless small businesses making up the industry.</p>
<p>Kendall Bird and Sage Grazer are old friends who happened to be in the right place at the right time — a strange thing to say about anyone anywhere at the start of 2020, but it&#8217;s true. The startup&#8217;s pitch of bringing your practice entirely online and offering all-online sessions, bookkeeping, scheduling and everything turned out to be exactly what would soon be needed — though as they tell it, it has actually been needed for some time.</p>
<p>Grazer, a therapist herself, experienced firsthand the unexpected difficulties of getting up and running.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I started my practice in 2016, I was really passionate about the clinical work, but I was very overwhelmed by setting up a business, marketing, financial stuff,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So we wanted to help other therapists through that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She and Bird happened to reconnect around that time and the two saw an opportunity to improve things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172962" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172962" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2172962 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="715" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg 2389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=1536,1072 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=2048,1429 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kendallsage.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2172962" class="wp-caption-text">Kendall Bird (left) and Sage Grazer. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Frame</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We think about therapists as being a one-on-one thing, but they&#8217;re really a small business,&#8221; said Bird, who formerly worked in marketing at Snapchat, Google and YouTube. &#8220;They&#8217;re underserved and undersupported as mental health professionals — they don&#8217;t have the back-office support that doctors do, and they&#8217;re not trained how to run businesses. It just made sense to build a scalable SaaS solution that lets these people work for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The therapy industry, like other medical institutions, has two sides: client-facing and practitioner-facing. While there are a handful of services online that combine these, many essentially recruit therapists as contractors. If you want to run your own practice, you&#8217;ll likely be using a combination of specialty scheduling, telehealth, billing and other tools made with medical privacy considerations in mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;The therapy tools and services landscape is incredibly fragmented — the average therapist is using 5-7 tools, and most of those are not built for therapy,&#8221; said Bird.</p>
<p>And then of course there&#8217;s Psychology Today: a periodical that straddles the roles of pop psych and industry rag, but whose chief reason for existing for many is its voluminous therapist listings, which dominate search and provide an overwhelming first stop for anyone looking to find one in their area. But for such a personal and consequential decision these brief listings don&#8217;t give wary potential clients the impression they&#8217;re making an informed choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted an experience that was more approachable, uses language that doesn&#8217;t feel overwhelming or pathologizing,&#8221; said Grazer. &#8220;There are people going to therapy feeling alone and confused, who don&#8217;t identify with a disorder or checking a check box.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frame eschews the oversimplified &#8220;scroll through therapists near your area code&#8221; with a short quiz — not a diagnosis or personality test but just a few basic questions — that winnows down your choices to a handful of local and appropriate therapists, with whom you can instantly set up free introductory video calls. If you find someone you like, the rest of the professional relationship takes place on Frame, though of course soon in-person sessions may return.</p>
<p>For those not quite ready to take the plunge, the company organizes livestreamed sessions between volunteers and therapists to show what a full hour of work might look like. (Whatever courage it may take to confront one&#8217;s issues in therapy, it surely takes even more to do so with an audience.)</p>
<p>On the therapist&#8217;s side, Frame is meant to be a one-stop shop. Marketing and telehealth sessions are on there, as noted above, but so are things like scheduling, notes, billing, notifications, and so on, all tailored specifically to the needs of the industry. And while the shift to online services has been a long time coming, the company just happened to drop in just as the need went into overdrive.</p>

<p>&#8220;We built it before COVID ever existed — launched in March 2020 and had telehealth as an option, thinking &#8216;oh, well maybe some people will do this.&#8217; The majority of therapists in America weren&#8217;t doing sessions online at the time&#8230; but after COVID they <em>all</em> are,&#8221; Bird said. &#8220;And they&#8217;re looking for these tools now because they&#8217;re seeing the rewards of running a lot of their business through telehealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many therapists are finding that after resisting the transition for years, they are encountering all kinds of benefits, explained Grazer. Like other industries, the flexibility inherent to shifting in-person meetings to virtual ones has been freeing and in some cases profitable. The change is here to stay.</p>
<p>The site is in a closed beta limited to a part of California at present, since therapists are limited to operating in-state and there are other regulations to consider, not to mention all the usual struggles of putting together a sprawling professional service. But the $3 million funding round, led by Maven Ventures, will help fill out the product and move the company toward a larger audience. Sugar Capital, Struck Capital, Alpha Edison and January Ventures participated in the raise.</p>
<p>The money is &#8220;almost exclusively going to engineering.&#8221; The goal is to open up the beta, expand to the rest of California, then move out to other states once they have the infrastructure to do so and have responded to feedback from the initial rollout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sage and I are really aligned in the belief that the best way to make therapy more accessible to America is to support therapists,&#8221; said Bird.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy litigation that&#8217;s being brought against Facebook by two not-for-profits in the Netherlands can go ahead, an Amsterdam court has <a href="https://linkeddata.overheid.nl/front/portal/document-viewer?ext-id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:3307">ruled</a>. The case will be heard in October.</p>
<p>Since 2019, the Amsterdam-based <a href="https://dataprivacystichting.com">Data Privacy Foundation</a> (DPS) has been seeking to bring a case against Facebook over its rampant collection of internet users&#8217; data &#8212; arguing the company does not have a proper legal basis for the processing.</p>
<p>It has been joined in the action by the Dutch consumer protection not-for-profit, <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl">Consumentenbond</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair are seeking redress for Facebook users in the Netherlands for alleged violations of their privacy rights &#8212; both by suing for compensation for individuals; and calling for Facebook to end the privacy-hostile practices.</p>
<p>European Union law allows for collective redress across a number of areas, including data protection rights, enabling qualified entities to bring representative actions on behalf of rights holders. And the provision looks like an increasingly important tool for furthering privacy enforcement in the bloc, given how European data protection regulators&#8217; have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">continued to lack uniform vigor</a> in upholding rights set out in legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (which, despite coming into application in 2018, has yet to be seriously applied against platform giants like Facebook).</p>
<p>Returning to the Dutch litigation, Facebook denies any abuse and claims it respects user privacy and provides people with &#8220;meaningful control&#8221; over how their data gets exploited.</p>
<p>But it has fought the litigation by seeking to block it on procedural grounds &#8212; arguing for the suit to be tossed by claiming the DPS does not fit the criteria for bringing a privacy claim on behalf of others and that the Amsterdam court has no jurisdiction as its European business is subject to Irish, rather than Dutch, law.</p>
<p>However the Amsterdam District Court rejected its arguments, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Contacted for comment on the ruling, a</span> Facebook spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are currently reviewing the Court’s decision. The ruling was about the procedural part of the case, not a finding on the merits of the action, and we will continue to defend our position in court. We care about our users in the Netherlands and protecting their privacy is important to us. We build products to help people connect with people and content they care about while honoring their privacy choices. Users have meaningful control over the data that they share on Facebook and we provide transparency around how their data is used. We also offer people tools to access, download, and delete their information and we are committed to the principles of GDPR.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement today, the <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/nieuws/2021/rechter-veegt-bezwaren-facebook-van-tafel">Consumentenbond</a>&#8216;s director, Sandra Molenaar, described the ruling as &#8220;a big boost for the more than 10 million victims&#8221; of Facebook&#8217;s practices in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has tried to throw up all kinds of legal hurdles and to delay this case as much as possible but fortunately the company has not succeeded. Now we can really get to work and ensure that consumers get what they are entitled to,&#8221; she added in the written remarks (translated from Dutch with Google Translate).</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Dick Bouma, chairman of DPS, added: &#8220;This is a nice and important first step for the court. The ruling shows that it pays to take a collective stand against tech giants that violate privacy rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two not-for-profits are urging Facebook users in the Netherlands to <a href="https://www.consumentenbond.nl/acties/facebook/aanmelden">sign up</a> to be part of the representative action (and potentially receive compensation) &#8212; saying more than 185,000 people have registered so far.</p>
<p>The suit argues that Facebook users are &#8220;paying&#8221; for the &#8220;free&#8221; service with their data &#8212; contending the tech giant does not have a valid legal basis to process people&#8217;s information because it has not provided users with comprehensive information about the data it is gathering from and on them, nor what it does with it.</p>
<p>So &#8212; in essence &#8212; the argument is that Facebook&#8217;s tracking and targeting is in breach of EU privacy law.</p>
<p>The legal challenge follows an earlier investigation (back in 2014) of Facebook&#8217;s business by the Dutch data protection authority that identified problems with its privacy policy and &#8212; in a 2017 report &#8212; found the company to be processing users&#8217; data without their knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>However, since 2018, Europe&#8217;s GDPR has been in application and a &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; mechanism baked into the regulation &#8212; to streamline the handling of cross-border cases &#8212; has meant complaints against Facebook have been funnelled through Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission. The Irish DPC has yet to issue a single decision against Facebook despite receiving scores of complaints. (And it&#8217;s notable that  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">&#8220;forced consent&#8221;</a> complaints were filed against Facebook the day GDPR begun being applied &#8212; yet still remain undecided by Ireland.)</p>
<p>The GDPR&#8217;s enforcement bottleneck makes collective redress actions, such as this one in the Netherlands a potentially important route for Europeans to get rights relief against powerful platforms that seek to shrink the risk of regulatory enforcement via forum shopping.</p>
<p>Although national rules &#8212; and courts&#8217; interpretations of them &#8212; can vary. So the chance of litigation succeeding is not uniform.</p>
<p>In this case, the Amsterdam court allowed the suit to proceed on the grounds that the Facebook data subjects in question reside in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It also took the view that a local Facebook corporate entity in the Netherlands is an establishment of Facebook Ireland, among other reasons for rejecting Facebook&#8217;s arguments.</p>
<p>How Facebook will seek to press a case against the substance of the Dutch privacy litigation remains to be seen. It may well have other procedural strategies up its sleeve.</p>
<p>The tech giant has used similar stalling tactics against far longer-running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/facebooks-least-favorite-austrian-can-now-press-privacy-suit-in-vienna/">privacy litigation in Austria</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In that case, brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems and his not-for-profit noyb, Facebook has sought to claim that the GDPR&#8217;s consent requirements do not apply to its advertising business because it now includes &#8220;personalized advertising&#8221; in its T&amp;Cs &#8212; and therefore has a &#8220;duty&#8221; to provide privacy-hostile ads to users &#8212; seeking to bypass the GDPR by claiming it must process users&#8217; data because it&#8217;s &#8220;necessary for the performance of a contract,&#8221; as <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/facebooks-gdpr-bypass-reaches-austrian-supreme-court">noyb explains here</a>.</p>
<p>A court in Vienna accepted this &#8220;GDPR consent bypass&#8221; sleight of hand, dealing a blow to European privacy campaigners.</p>
<p>But an appeal reached the Austrian Supreme Court in March &#8212; and a referral could be made to Europe&#8217;s top court.</p>
<p>If that happens it would then be up to the CJEU to weigh in whether such a massive loophole in the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection framework should really be allowed to stand. But that process could still take over a year or longer.</p>
<p>In the short term, the result is yet more delay for Europeans trying to exercise their rights against platform giants and their in-house armies of lawyers.</p>
<p>In a more positive development for privacy rights, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cjeu-ruling-could-open-big-tech-to-more-privacy-litigation-in-europe/">recent ruling</a> by the CJEU bolstered the case for data protection agencies across the EU to bring actions against tech giants if they see an urgent threat to users &#8212; and believe a lead supervisor is failing to act.</p>
<p>That ruling could help unblock some GDPR enforcement against the most powerful tech companies at the regulatory level, potentially reducing the blockages created by bottlenecks such as Ireland.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s EU to U.S. data flows are also now facing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">possibility of a suspension order in a matter of months</a> &#8212; related to another piece of litigation brought by Schrems that hinges on the conflict between EU fundamental rights and U.S. surveillance law.</p>
<p>The CJEU weighed in on that last summer with a judgment that requires regulators like Ireland to act when user data is at risk. (Germany&#8217;s federal data protection commissioner, for instance, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/german-government-bodies-urged-to-remove-their-facebook-pages-before-next-year/">warned government bodies to shut their official Facebook pages</a> ahead of planned enforcement action at the start of next year.)</p>
<p>So while Facebook has been spectacularly successful at kicking Europe&#8217;s privacy rights claims down the road, for well over a decade, its strategy of legal delay tactics to shield a privacy-hostile business model could finally hit a geopolitical brick wall.</p>
<p>The tech giant has sought to lobby against this threat to its business by suggesting it might switch off its service in Europe if the regulator follows through on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">preliminary suspension order last year</a>.</p>
<p>But it has also publicly denied it would actually follow through and close service in Europe.</p>
<p>How might Facebook actually comply if ordered to cut off EU data flows? <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/max-schrems-on-the-eu-court-ruling-that-could-cut-facebook-in-two/">Schrems has argued</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> it may need to federate its service and store European users&#8217; data inside the EU in order to comply with the eponymous Schrems II CJEU ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Albeit, Facebook has certainly shown itself adept at exploiting the gaps between Europeans&#8217; on-paper rights, national case law and the various EU and member state institutions involved in oversight and enforcement as a tactic to defend its commercial priorities &#8212; playing different players and pushing agendas to further its business interests. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So whether any single piece of EU privacy litigation will prove to be the silver bullet that forces a reboot of its privacy-hostile business model very much remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A perhaps more likely scenario is that each of these cases further erodes user trust in Facebook&#8217;s services &#8212; reducing people&#8217;s appetite to use its apps and expanding opportunities for rights-respecting competitors to poach custom by offering something better. </span></p>

		Founder of Unicorn Capital and Minimal Capital, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanhfisher">Evan Fisher</a>'s pitching and investor strategy has helped startups raise more than $2.5 billion. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Let’s play out this scenario. Your deck is ready and you’re just about to start reaching out. What does conventional wisdom say that you should send? A three-paragraph overview, four bullet points outlining the problem, and three bullet points on how you solve it and why you’re the best. You went through all that work … but who is going to read it? <strong>A junior person</strong>. Not even a senior VC.</p>
<p>Even if you do end up with a meeting, odds are that your deck didn’t even get read. The biggest lie in venture capital is: “Yes, I read through your deck.” Because those words are immediately followed by, <em>“ … but why don’t you run us through it from the beginning?”</em></p>
<p>At that point, it’s safe to assume that no one has actually taken the time to read through what you sent, the junior guy thought it would be an interesting meeting considering the fund’s current themes of interest, and no one objected to taking the meeting. But no one has really taken the time to read through your deck.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Even if the only benefit was that other investment committee members heard the story direct from the founder, that alone would make your video pitch worth it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to DocSend, the average pitch deck review time over the last 20 weeks is <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/2020-docsend-startup-index/">less than three minutes</a>. Let’s break down how much time you’ll be given for a 12-page deck (a very concise deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover — 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Back cover — 5 seconds.</li>
<li>All the rest — 2:50.</li>
</ul>
<p>That also includes time for that critical-to-understand diagram that illustrates and distills your unique system or view of the world. Do you think 25 seconds is long enough to fully comprehend that diagram and connect the dots with your value prop? Not likely.</p>
<h2>What should you do about it?</h2>
<p>Don’t send cold decks, ever. Instead, you should be video pitching — this is a video walkthrough of your deck, with your face in a camera bubble talking through it and giving added color in a video no longer than six-and-a-half minutes. Your objective for this video: Get in, provide a basis of understanding, and get out with a punchy CTA. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy.</p>
<p>More investors are embracing video pitches (prime example: Ashton Kutcher’s <a href="https://www.soundventures.com/contact/">Sound Ventures</a>), and in the age of the Zoom-based pitch meeting, it’s quickly becoming the standard.</p>
<p>The rapid but notable shift is because in video pitching, founders get to showcase the preparedness, commitment and passion VCs are looking for, all while telling their story. None of that is effectively transmitted in a cold pitch deck. Further, it allows you to create a deeper connection even before a meeting ever takes place. In a sense, it allows you and the investor to skip a step in the relationship-building process.</p>
<h2>Why you have to do video pitches</h2>
<p>Cold decks get blown out of the water when compared with the benefits of the video pitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can connect the dots in an easy-to-digest manner. Instead of simply reading the slides, you’re adding context as you go through them. Basically, you’re doing investors a favor by doing the mental heavy lifting for them.</li>
<li>You <a href="https://unicrn.substack.com/p/investors-parenting-and-why-you-should">control the interaction</a>. It’s a recorded video, so you get to pitch with the added benefit of not getting interrupted.</li>
<li>People might not give three minutes to skim a PDF, but they will watch a six-and-a-half minute high-relevance video!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a surprise announcement today, IBM announced that Jim Whitehurst, who came over in the Red Hat deal, would be stepping down as company president <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/paul-cormier-takes-over-as-red-hat-ceo-as-jim-whitehurst-moves-to-ibm/">just 14 months after taking over</a> in that role.</p>
<p>IBM didn&#8217;t give a lot of details as to why he was stepping away, but acknowledged his key role in helping bring the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/"> 2018 $34 billion Red Hat deal</a> to fruition and helping bring the two companies together after the deal closed. &#8220;Jim has been instrumental in articulating IBM’s strategy, but also, in ensuring that IBM and Red Hat work well together and that our technology platforms and innovations provide more value to our clients,&#8221; the company stated.</p>
<p>He will stay on as a senior adviser to Krishna, but it begs the question why he is leaving after such a short time in the role, and what he plans to do next. Oftentimes after a deal of this magnitude closes, there is an agreement as to how long key executives will stay. It could be simply that the period has expired and Whitehurst wants to move on, but some saw him as the heir apparent to Krishna and the move comes as a surprise when looked at in that context.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am surprised because I always thought Jim would be next in line as IBM CEO. I also liked the pairing between a lifer IBMer and an outsider,&#8221; Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Regardless, it leaves a big hole in Krishna&#8217;s leadership team as he works to transform the company into one that is primarily focused on hybrid cloud. Whitehurst was undoubtedly in a position to help drive that change through his depth of industry knowledge and his credibility with the open source community from his time at Red Hat. He is not someone who would be easily replaced and the announcement didn&#8217;t mention anyone filling his role.</p>
<p>When IBM bought Red Hat in 2018 for $34 billion, it led to a cascading set of changes at both companies. First<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/"> Ginni Rometty stepped down</a> as CEO at IBM and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/incoming-ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-faces-monumental-challenges-on-multiple-fronts/">Arvind Krishna took over</a>. At the same time, Jim Whitehurst, who had been Red Hat CEO moved to IBM as president and long-time employee Paul Cormier moved into his role.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company also announced some other changes including that long-time IBM executive Bridget van Kralingen announced she too was stepping away, leaving her role as senior vice president of global markets. Rob Thomas, who had been senior vice president of IBM cloud and data platform, will step in to replace Van Kraligen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To see Didi get taken to task mere days after its U.S. debut puts a bad taste in our mouths.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Chinese ride-hailing provider Didi are sharply lower this morning after news broke that its domestic regulators are investigating the newly public company. A loose translation of the probe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-07/02/c_1626811521011934.htm">official notice</a> indicates that the cybersecurity review is &#8220;in order to prevent national data security risks, maintain national security and protect the public interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday, regulators ordered Didi to stop registering new users during the investigation.</p>
<p>The move comes amid a larger reset of relations between China&#8217;s burgeoning technology sector and its autocratic government. Other fallouts from the campaign included the effective silencing of Jack Ma, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">embarrassing cancellation of the Ant IPO</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/china-regulation-data-collection-may-starts/">crackdown on data collection from technology companies</a> more broadly.</p>

<strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>China is not the only nation grappling with its technology sector; India has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">made consistent noise</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/indias-central-bank-says-growing-presence-of-big-tech-in-financial-services-a-concern/">recent months</a> regarding tech firms inside its borders, for example. And there is effort inside the U.S. Congress to put some cap on Big Tech&#8217;s scale and power, though of the trio, the United States appears the least likely to take a real swipe at technology companies&#8217; market influence.</p>
<p>That Didi has run afoul of China&#8217;s regulatory bodies is not a surprise; it&#8217;s a well-known tech company in the country with lots of consumer data. Similar <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-power-play-more-control-of-tech-companies-troves-of-data-11623470478">data-rich tech shops in the country</a> have come under increased scrutiny as well.</p>
<p>But to see Didi get taken to task mere days <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">after its U.S. debut</a> puts a bad taste in our mouths.</p>
<p>The way that this saga reads from the cynical perspective is that the Chinese Communist Party was willing to let the company go public in the United States, allowing it to raise billions of dollars from foreign sources. And that the ruling party was then content to leave them holding a midsized bag by announcing its cybersecurity probe.</p>
<p><a href="https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/">Hanlon’s Razor</a> is at play in this situation, naturally.</p>
<p>Didi has not published a new SEC filing since June 30, and, as of the time of writing, its investor relations page is devoid of any information regarding today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>While going public, it&#8217;s worth noting that Didi <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001764757/000104746921001221/a2243298zf-1a.htm#da10201_risk_factors">did warn investors</a> that it faces a host of risks relating to its status as a Chinese company, namely its government, and as a Chinese company going public in the United States. Observe the following risk factors that it shared while going public (emphasis added) that dealt with the company&#8217;s business operations:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Our business is <strong>subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks</strong> that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.</li>
<li>Our business is subject to a variety of laws, regulations, rules, policies and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection and information security. Any losses, unauthorized access or releases of confidential information or personal data could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is investing in domestically sourced lithium. The company said Friday it became the first investor in an Australian company’s project to extract the mineral, a critical component of electric vehicle batteries, from the Salton Sea Geothermal Field near Los Angeles. The automaker will have first rights on lithium produced by Controlled Thermal Resources’ “Hell’s Kitchen” lithium extraction project.</p>
<p>The Hell’s Kitchen project is expected to begin producing lithium in 2024. That output would be used in GM’s Ultium battery cells, which are being manufactured as part of a joint venture with LG Energy Solution, after undergoing validation and testing. While Tim Grewe, GM’s general director of electrification strategy and cell engineering, declined to provide specifics on how much lithium GM will likely receive, he said the company expects “it’ll be a significant amount of [GM&#8217;s] North American lithium.”</p>
<p>GM and other automakers will need a lot of lithium if they want to meet their electrification targets. For GM, that includes transitioning away from internal combustion engines entirely by 2035. But that wide-scale transition will also likely mean greater competition – not only for customers&#8217; dollars, but for the source minerals that compose essential parts like batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In general, lithium is produced either via hard rock mining or by extracting the mineral from brine deposits. Both methods have been criticized for their impacts on the environment. What makes CTR’s project stand out is that it will use renewable geothermal energy – produced from the Salton Sea Geothermal Field, a huge area in the Imperial Valley that’s already home to 11 geothermal power stations – to process the lithium.</p>
<p>In addition to being powered by renewable energy, CTR says the project uses a closed-loop direct extraction process that returns spent brine to its underground source and leaves no production tailings, a kind of waste reside from mining.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PARLmFc1iKc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Most of the world’s lithium is sourced from a small number of countries, predominately Chile, Australia, China and Argentina. There is only one lithium production site in the United States, a brine operation in Nevada owned by chemical manufacturing giant Albemarle. But there’s been an increased focus on boosting domestic production in the mineral in recent years, driven largely by two trends: the anticipated demand for the mineral, which is expected to rapidly increase due in part to the transition to battery electric vehicles; and a bipartisan focus on keeping the U.S. competitive in emerging technologies.</p>
<p>According to the California Energy Commission, as much as one-third of the world’s current demand for lithium could be found in the state’s lithium deposits. The CTR project is one of many aimed at extracting lithium from the Salton Sea’s vast brine fields.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Licious, a Bangalore-based startup that sells fresh meat and seafood online, has raised $192 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its footprint beyond the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The new round &#8212; a Series F &#8212; was led by Singapore’s investment firm Temasek and Multiples Private Equity. The round, which brings the six-year-old Indian firm’s to-date raise to over $285 million, values the startup at more than $650 million (according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/licious-raises-30m-to-grow-its-meat-and-seafood-e-commerce-platform-in-india/">up from $285 million in December 2019 Series E funding</a>.</p>
<p>Existing investors 3one4 Capital, Bertelsmann India Investments, Vertex Growth Fund, and Vertex Ventures also participated in the new round, and some early investors sold some of their stakes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.licious.in">Licious</a> operates an eponymous e-commerce platform where it sells meat and seafood in over a dozen Indian cities. The startup has built a supply chain network across several Indian cities to be able to procure meat and seafood, keep them fresh, and deliver within hours of the order.</p>
<p>In recent months, the startup says it has accelerated its growth as people increase their protein consumption in a bid to improve their immunity.</p>
<p>It didn’t disclose exact figures, but said the startup has seen a 500% growth in the past 12 months and delivered to more than 2 million unique customers.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning in our pursuit of building an exemplary and iconic tech-led D2C (direct-to-consumer) brand,” said Vivek Gupta and Abhay Hanjura in a joint statement Friday.</p>
<p>According to industry estimates, India&#8217;s online meat market is worth over $4.4 billion and has grown by over 2.5x since the pandemic hit last year.</p>
<p>Licious, which competes with FreshToHome, plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to “multiple geographies,” it said, without identifying any market. The startup is also making investments to broaden its tech and supply chain networks, it said.</p>
<p>The startup’s co-founders have “revolutionised the purchase of poultry, seafood and meat in the country delighting customers with their promise of quality, freshness and timely delivery,” said Sridhar Sankararaman, MD, Multiples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish gaming giant Modern Times Group (MTG) has acquired Indian startup <a href="http://playsimple.in">PlaySimple</a> for at least $360 million, the two firms said Friday.</p>
<p>MTG said it will pay 77% of the acquisition sum to Indian game developer and publisher in cash and the rest in company shares. There’s also another $150 million reward put aside if certain undisclosed performance metrics are hit, the two firms said.</p>
<p>Friday’s deal marks one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">largest exits in the Indian startup ecosystem</a>. PlaySimple had raised $4 million Series A at a valuation of about $16 million from Elevation Capital and Chiratae Ventures in 2016. (The startup, which began its journey in Bangalore, raised just $4.5 million in total from external investors.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And it’s clear why: the revenues of PlaySimple &#8212; which operates nine word games including “Daily Themed Crossword,” “Word Trip,” “Word Jam,” and “Word Wars” &#8212; grew by 144% y-o-y to $83 million last year and it was on track to hit over $60 million revenue in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173186" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173186" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2173186 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="395" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/playsimple-captable.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173186" class="wp-caption-text">Cap table of PlaySimple after Series A in 2016.</p></div></p>
<p>“We’re very proud of the games we’ve developed over the years, and of the infrastructure and scale that we’ve achieved with our team,&#8221; said PlaySimple co-founders and management team members &#8212; Siddhanth Jain, Suraj Nalin and Preeti Reddy &#8212; in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we join the MTG family, we look forward to leveraging our proprietary technology across MTG’s gaming portfolio, expanding into the European market, investing in cutting-edge technology and building exciting new games.”</p>
<p>PlaySimple, which says its free-to-play games have amassed over 75 million installs and maintain nearly 2 million daily active users, plans to launch a number of games later this year and also expand into the card games genre.</p>
<p>&#8220;PlaySimple is a rapidly growing and highly profitable games studio that quickly has established itself as one of the leading global developers of free-to-play word games, an exciting new genre for MTG,&#8221; said Maria Redin, MTG Group President and CEO, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Stockholm-headquartered firm, which has also acquired Hutch and Ninja Kiwi in recent quarters, said PlaySimple will help it build a diversified gaming vertical. &#8220;Scaling and diversifying the GamingCo [an MTG subsidiary] helps to accelerate the operational performance while at the same time creating a more stable business,&#8221; the firm said.</p>
