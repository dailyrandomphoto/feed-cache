					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 2, 2021. It’s a good day in the tech world because former unicorn Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/">is out with new features about <em>you</em></a>. Yes, the company is taking its yearly listening review to a midyear format and packing its app with even more personalized mixes. My playlists are why I won’t leave Spotify until the heat death of the universe, so I suppose it makes sense that the service is doubling down on its personalization feature set.</p>
<p>And yes, I do listen to <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1400164730036277252">a lot of Taylor Swift in the morning</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stack-overflow-acquired-by-prosus-for-a-reported-1-8-billion/">Stack Overflow sells for $1.8B</a>: </strong>Well-known developer community and hub of copy-pastable coding snippets for software engineers of all skill levels Stack Overflow is selling itself to Prosus for nearly $2 billion. What’s Prosus? It’s part of Naspers, a South African investing group that you may have heard of. Naspers is perhaps best known for owning a large stake in Tencent.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/guild-education-valued-at-3-75-billion-with-newest-round/"><strong>Guild Education raises $150M</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The company, focused on providing what TechCrunch described as “employer-sponsored learning opportunities” for employees, is now worth $3.75 billion after its latest funding round. For the burgeoning edtech startup market, the round is big news. There’s still lots of capital for tech companies tackling the various sides of the education market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/reading-the-ipo-markets-tea-leaves/"><strong>The great technology company liquidity run continues</strong></a><strong>: </strong>As well-known tech startups like Marqeta look to list, other companies are jumping on the bandwagon. TechCrunch reported this morning that fintech firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/yieldstreet-raises-100m-as-it-mulls-going-public-via-spac-eyes-acquisitions/">Yieldstreet may go public via a SPAC</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">data-centered unicorn Confluent is also going public</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The week’s busy startup fundraising cycle continued today with a host of companies from the very earliest stages to the most mature unicorns raising capital. What follows is a selection of the day’s hottest deals. We’re starting in the world of wheels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/faction-raises-4-3m-to-deploy-3-wheeled-evs-for-driverless-delivery/"><strong>Faction raises $4.3M for three-wheeled delivery vehicles</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That are driverless, we should add. Daily Crunch is certain that, simply given the sheer amount of capital that has gone into the various projects of this sort, it will eventually work. Perhaps Faction will be the company to get it right.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/"><strong>FlixMobility raises $650M for its low-cost bus service</strong></a><strong>:</strong> If you are American, you may have not heard of FlixMobility, which operates FlixBus and FlixTrain, low-cost transport services in Europe. The company is also working to expand in the U.S. For reference, the new Flix round is a Series <em>G</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/"><strong>Tier options $60M for e-scooter network</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Electric scooter shares are <em>not</em> dead, it turns out. Sure, Bird’s SPAC demonstrates how difficult the economics proved for the model in some markets, but Tier now has access to a “highly scalable asset-backed debt facility,” in the words of its CFO, to keep growing. The company also has some neat battery tech aboard its portfolio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, today’s other rounds of note tackling a more diverse set of industries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/stemma-launches-with-4-8m-seed-to-build-managed-data-catalogue/"><strong>Stemma raises $4.8M for managed Amundsen</strong></a><strong>: </strong>What’s Amundsen? Per <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a>, it’s a “data catalogue project that [Lyft built] to manage its massive data requirements.” And now there’s a startup offering it as a service. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">reminds me of BuildBuddy to a degree</a>, in which a startup takes on a BigCo tool, helping others access and leverage it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/"><strong>$131M in total capital for Jeeves</strong></a><strong>: </strong> It’s $31 million in equity funding and $100 million in debt access, which we presume is a revolving facility of sorts because Jeeves is building a multinational expense management platform. You know, for companies that have employees everywhere. Like every single early-stage startup we talk to these days.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/divido-bags-30m-to-take-its-buy-now-pay-later-platform-to-more-markets/"><strong>Divido raises money because apparently we still need more buy now, pay later (BNPL) services</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Divido has put together a fresh $30 million round to bring its BNPL service to more markets, TechCrunch reports. The startup BNPL market has been hot because the companies in it have been doing well. But at some point we hit saturation, right? <em>Right?</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>With $1.6B Depop purchase, Etsy asks, &#8216;How do you do, fellow kids?&#8217;</h2>
<p>News broke today that Etsy will buy used fashion marketplace Depop in a transaction that values the U.K.-based startup at $1.625 billion.</p>
<p>Depop showed 100% year-over-year growth to reach $70 million in revenue last year, but it&#8217;s still worth asking whether Etsy paid a premium to expand its reach into the hearts, minds and wallets of Gen Z and young millennial consumers.</p>
<p>To frame the deal&#8217;s overall value in a larger context, let&#8217;s look at revenue multiples for rivals Poshmark and ThredUp. If large e-commerce players are willing to splash out for youth-approved marketplaces, there&#8217;s a good reason why.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oa2Wt4KTfa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase/">Etsy asks, &#8216;how do you do, fellow kids?&#8217; with $1.6B Depop purchase</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Etsy asks, &#8216;how do you do, fellow kids?&#8217; with $1.6B Depop purchase&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-asks-how-do-you-do-fellow-kids-with-1-6b-depop-purchase/embed/#?secret=oa2Wt4KTfa" data-secret="oa2Wt4KTfa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech was super busy today, Spotify aside. Today we’re talking Amazon, Apple, Facebook, GitLab and Huawei:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"><strong>Welcome to 2021, Amazon</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The American e-commerce giant is doing away with cannabis testing of its employees. Our first reaction to this news was that <em>Amazon was drug testing its employees?</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/"><strong>Apple thinks highly of itself</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Apple has a study out saying that it facilitated more than a half-trillion dollars in commerce last year. We are sure that Apple really put itself to the test in coming up with the number.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook does two things that don’t suck:</strong> Today Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/">opened up its Messenger API to all companies</a>, which is good. And Big Blue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-to-launch-a-researcher-api-for-the-academic-community/">put together a research API</a>. Both are good things from Zuck’s empire. Which is nice to say for once.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/gitlab-acquires-unreview-as-it-looks-to-bring-more-ml-tools-to-its-platform/"><strong>GitLab buys UnReview</strong></a><strong>:</strong> GitLab is north of $100 million in revenue and is slated for an eventual IPO, so it’s big enough to warrant inclusion in this section. Regardless, the GitHub competitor has bought a startup that “helps software teams recommend the best reviewers for when developers want to check in their latest code” using machine learning. Honestly, that sounds cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/huawei-officially-launches-android-alternative-harmonyos-for-smartphones/"><strong>Huawei’s new OS loves Android</strong></a><strong>:</strong> TechCrunch has lots of details on HarmonyOS, the new operating system from Huawei. It turns out that it <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/06/02/huawei-harmonyos-android-launch/">uses some Android code</a>. All hail Google, we suppose.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Would you like to work with private equity and venture capital funds?</p>
<p>There are relatively few jobs directly inside private equity and venture capital funds, and those jobs are highly competitive. However, there are many other ways you can work and earn money within the industry — as a consultant, an interim executive, a board member, a deal executive partnering to buy a company, an executive in residence or as an entrepreneur in residence.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists often have an operations background. However, historically most private equity professionals were former investment bankers and other finance professionals. Then private equity players gradually realized that value cannot be created through financial engineering alone. A <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2016/private-equity-power-of-buy-build">BCG study</a> of 121 investments found that operational improvement drives 48% of value creation in PE-backed companies<strong>. </strong>PE funds now almost always require an upgrade in management and change management teams if necessary.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the tighter your relationship with the firm, the more money you will earn:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160120" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160120" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2160120 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png" alt="PE fund structural options in working with operating executives" width="882" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png?resize=768,507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png?resize=680,449 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong> Image Credits:</strong> David Teten</p></div></p>
<p>At <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a>, we’ve used all these models. We are soon launching <a href="https://versatilevc.com/fnm/">Founders’ Next Move</a>, a selective, free community for founders researching their next move, which will be a key tool for working with outside talent.</p>
<p>The simplest path forward is to identify funds in your industry of expertise and reach out. You can explore all of the models below with them. First, start by identifying the firms that invest in companies that you&#8217;ve worked with. Then, more broadly, look for investors in the industries in which you have expertise. You can identify institutional investors through one of multiple online databases:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the different ways you can work with the investment community.</p>
<h2>Expert networks</h2>
<p>Expert network firms source subject matter experts from various domains and pair them with clients seeking topical or industry insights. They typically charge clients up to <a href="https://eninsider.com/expert-networks-compared-how-do-expert-networks-charge-their-clients/">$1,200 per hour</a>, and pay the expert $100 to $500 an hour. I founded Circle of Experts, an expert network that I <a href="https://teten.com/evalueserve-acquires-nitron-advisor">sold</a> to Evalueserve.</p>
<p>The expert network industry has grown an average <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/expert-networks-industry/#:~:text=poll%20Average%20industry%20growth%202015%E2%80%932020%3A%204.5%25&amp;text=Over%20the%20five%20years%20to,of%204.5%25%20to%20%24958.6%20million.">4.5% annually</a> between 2015 and 2020, its market size topping <a href="https://inex.one/blog/expert-network-market-size">$1.3 billion</a> in 2020.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Protesters gathered in bright red t-shirts and matching masks bearing the Independent Drivers Guild logo. Placards bearing slogans like “Freeze Hiring, Reactive Workers Now!” and “Unlock Uber” were being handed out at a table toward the entrance. What the gathering lacked in sheer numbers, it made up with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A wide range of speakers approached the podium &#8212; IDG members, drivers, local and prospective politicians. Nearly every speech was followed by a spirited call and response from the crowd, culminating in pro-union chants.</p>
<p>Previous protests have found drivers opting for other locations &#8212; perhaps most notably in 2019, when Brooklyn Bridge traffic toward the mayor’s residence at Gracie Mansion was <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/09/17/uber-lyft-drivers-protest/">slowed to a crawl</a>. Today’s location was perfectly suited for such an event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2160241" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160241" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160241" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9363.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160241" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The gathering was framed by <a href="http://jrtrealty.com/uber-expands-36k-sf-falchi-building-lic/">the Falchi Building</a>, a large office space in Queens, New York, housing some 36,000 square feet of Uber offices. The neighborhood of Long Island City has long served as an epicenter for the city’s ridesharing operations. Lyft has offices nearby, as does the Taxi Limousine Commission (TLC). Walk down a block or two and you’ll almost certainly stumble across rows upon rows of yellow cabs.</p>
<p>The concerns of gig workers are nothing new, of course, but today’s crowd gathered in Long Island City, Queens to add support to a proposed bill currently making its way through the state legislature in Albany. The legislation is designed to make it easy for gig economy workers in the state to unionize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently, the gig workers have no voice in their workplace. No voice to negotiate pay or benefits of workplace policies,&#8221; bill sponsor state Sen. Diane Savino of Staten Island explained in <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2021/05/28/bill-to-unionize-gig-workers-may-fall-short-in-albany">a recent interview</a>. &#8220;And I have been talking about this issue for several years now. The world of work is changing, and labor law has not caught up to technology and how it has changed the world of work.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160238" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9380.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Such legislation would have a profound impact on not just ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, but also a wide range of gig economy jobs, including food delivery services like Seamless. The gig economy has experienced explosive growth over the past decade, in many cases accelerated by the pandemic, as more people have relied on delivery and other services amid shutdowns. But the complaints remain the same: As corporations thrive on the backs of contractors, these workers too seldom receive the benefit of that growth.</p>
<p>The already complex math of being a driver in a city like New York is further compounded by a series of regulations that largely exist to support its once-thriving taxi business.</p>
<p>Tamina Ahmed, a member of the NYC Rideshare Club and registered nurse who has also worked as a driver for six years, cites the flexible hours as a net benefit for workers, but notes the rather intensive process required to start driving in NYC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160230" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160230" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9417.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>“That takes a lot time, funds and energy for the drivers,” Ahmed told TechCrunch after speaking at the event. “They have to sacrifice to get to this point, and it’s not right for them to be deactivated without cause. They don’t give valid reason. They just deactivate them. They’re never on the driver’s side. They’re always on the rider’s side.”</p>
<p>The group present at the protest seems optimistic about Savino’s proposed legislation. The ability to unionize brings certain protections to gig workers, include wages, discrimination protection and unemployment benefits. The latter is even more timely these days, as some<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-benefits-gig-workers-republican-states/"> one million gig employees in 20 Republican-controlled states</a> will be losing Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits soon. Prop 22, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">which passed in California last November</a>, has been seen as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/after-prop-22s-passage-uber-is-taking-its-lobbying-effort-global/">another major precedent setting legislation</a> for the industry.</p>
<p>With the legislative session ended this month, many are expecting action on Savino’s proposed bill. But not everyone is thrilled with what it offers. “[T]he biggest concern I have is that workers won’t have employee status,&#8221; State Senate Labor Committee Chair <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2021/05/28/bill-to-unionize-gig-workers-may-fall-short-in-albany">Jessica Ramos told NY1</a>. &#8220;And more than that, Uber and Lyft drivers&#8217; pay would be slashed in half. It’s very unfortunate that they crafted this bill without the workers at the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Savino&#8217;s office for additional comment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160231" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160231" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160231" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9410.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160231" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Among those I spoke with at the event, employee status wasn’t high on the list of demands. In fact, a number of drivers told me that the flexibility the current model affords them. Ramos’ name appeared on a number of the protest placards at the event, largely in a negative light. It’s a complex issue, certainly &#8212; only exacerbated by the large number of residents any legislation would impact. The rise of the gig economy has brought a number of key questions relating to the connection between worker protections and employee status to the fore.</p>

<p>What seems clear across the board, however, is that these drivers &#8212; and other gig economy workers &#8212; are seeking what, in many other industries, have become fairly fundamental protections. Of late, unionization has become a major talking point for blue and white-collar workers, alike. Efforts have seen a number of wins over the past few years, though April’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/"> failure to unionize employees</a> at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama has been seen as a major setback for the cause.</p>
<p>Like those workers, the list of complaints among drivers is long. When a speaker at today’s event asked the crowd how many in attendance had had their accounts deactivated, the response was overwhelming. Many believed the decisions were made fairly arbitrarily.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160243" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160243" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2160243" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9351.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160243" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>“A lot of drivers are falsely being accused, deactivated, thrown out of all these rideshare companies that they invested so much money on,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>The Independent Drivers Guild &#8212; which organized today’s event along with the NYC Rideshare Club and the Chinese Delivery Association &#8212; isn’t mincing words.</p>
<p>“By helping drivers through deactivated systems, we realized only a true union can solve that problem,” Aziz Bah, IDG organizing director, told TechCrunch. “We decided to unionize. We will let the companies know what our plans are. They had better be behind our proposal. Because this is no negotiation. If this is what drivers and delivery workers want, they had better be behind it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity giant FireEye has agreed to sell its products business to a consortium led by private equity firm Symphony Technology Group for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The all-cash deal will split FireEye, the maker of network and email cybersecurity products, from its digital forensics and incident response arm Mandiant.</p>
<p>FireEye&#8217;s chief executive Kevin Mandia said the deal unlocks its &#8220;high-growth&#8221; Mandiant business, allowing it to stand alone as a separate business running incident response and security testing.</p>
<p>The move to split the two companies comes almost a decade after FireEye acquired Mandiant, and made Mandia chief executive.</p>
<p>Mandia said: &#8220;STG’s focus on fueling innovative market leaders in software and cybersecurity makes them an ideal partner for FireEye Products. We look forward to our relationship and collaboration on threat intelligence and expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>STG managing partner William Chisholm said there is an &#8220;enormous untapped opportunity for the business that we are excited to crystallize by leveraging our significant security software sector experience and our market leading carve-out expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said the deal is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>FireEye has become one of the more prominent names in cybersecurity, known for its research into hacking groups — some linked to governments — and its Mandiant unit for responding to major security incidents. Mandiant was called in to help Colonial Pipeline recover from a recent ransomware attack.</p>
<p>In December, FireEye admitted that its own networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">had been hacked</a>, a move praised across the cybersecurity industry for helping to speed up efforts that led to the discovery of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the SolarWinds espionage attack</a>, later attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">Russian foreign intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>FireEye becomes the latest cybersecurity giant to STG&#8217;s portfolio. In March, Symphony bought McAfee&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/mcafee-sells-enterprise-biz-to-symphony-technology-group-for-4b/">enterprise business</a> for $4 billion and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">bought RSA</a> for $2 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is looking to crowdsource its way out of misinformation woes with its new product Birdwatch which taps a network of engaged tweeters to add notes to misleading tweets. Today, Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1400150143693950977?s=20">announced</a> that they are starting to roll out the Birdwatch notes to pilot participants across iOS, Android and desktop.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">launched a pilot version</a> of the program back in January, describing the effort as a way to add context to misinformation in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable&#8221; Product VP Keith Coleman wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">blog post</a> at the time. &#8220;Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That time is apparently now for an early set of Birdwatch pilot participants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey there! Exciting news <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Now, when you’re browsing Twitter on Android, iOS, or <a href="https://t.co/lEjTtR4BGM">https://t.co/lEjTtR4BGM</a>, you may see Tweets with Birdwatch notes. Notes will appear in a card on the Tweet. Right now, this feature is only visible to pilot participants. <a href="https://t.co/dyMHgawLUl">pic.twitter.com/dyMHgawLUl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Birdwatch (@birdwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch/status/1400150143693950977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says that once Birdwatch notes are added to a tweet, users will have the opportunity to rate whether the feedback is helpful or not. If none of the replies are deemed helpful, the Birdwatch card itself will disappear, but if any notes are deemed helpful they&#8217;ll pop up directly inside the tweet.</p>
<p>There have been an awful lot of questions about how and whether Birdwatch will work inside the current social media framework. Using community feedback differs from more centralized efforts used by platforms like Facebook that have tapped independent fact-checking organizations. Twitter is clearly aiming to decentralize this effort as much as it can and put power in the hands of Birdwatch contributors, but with audiences of individual tweeters currently responsible for deeming the helpfulness and visibility of fact checks, it&#8217;s clear this is going to be a pretty messy solution at times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> announced its sale to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">a pair of private equity firms yesterday</a> for $5.3 billion, along with a couple of acquisitions of its own, the company detailed a new path that could help it drive back towards relevance in the big data market.</p>
<p>When the company launched in 2008, Hadoop was in its early days. The open source project developed at Yahoo three years earlier was built to deal with the large amounts of data that the Internet pioneer generated. It became increasingly clear over time that every company would have to deal with growing data stores, and it seemed that Cloudera was in the right market at the right time.</p>
<p>And for a while things went well. Cloudera rode the Hadoop startup wave, garnering a cool billion in funding along the way, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/31/intel-pours-740m-into-cloudera-in-exchange-for-an-18-stake/">stunning $740 million check</a> from Intel Capital in 2014. It then went<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/cloudera-finishes-up-20-in-stock-market-debut/"> public in 2018</a> to much fanfare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the markets had already started to shift by the time of its public debut. Hadoop, a highly labor-intensive way to manage data, was being supplanted by cheaper and less complex cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The excitement around the original promise of the Hadoop market has contracted significantly. It’s incredibly expensive and complex to get it working effectively in an enterprise context,&#8221; Casey Aylward, an investor at Costanoa Ventures told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company likely saw that writing on the wall when it merged with another Hadoop-based company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/cloudera-and-hortonworks-announce-5-2-billion-merger/"> Hortonworks in 2019</a>. That transaction valued the combined entity at $5.2 billion, almost the same amount it sold for yesterday, two years down the road. The decision to sell and go private may also have been spurred by <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2019/08/12/activist-investor-carl-icahn-shakes-cloudera/">Carl Icahn buying an 18% stake</a> in the company that same year.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Cloudera&#8217;s sale could provide the enterprise unicorn room as it regroups.</p>
<p>Patrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategies sees the deal as a positive step for the company. &#8220;I think this is good news for Cloudera because it now has the capital and flexibility to dive head first into SaaS. The company invented the entire concept of a data life cycle, implemented initially on premises, then extended to private and public clouds,&#8221; Moorhead said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="z4M8wS9EoH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/">How to ensure data quality in the era of Big Data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to ensure data quality in the era of Big Data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/how-to-ensure-quality-in-the-era-of-big-data/embed/#?secret=z4M8wS9EoH" data-secret="z4M8wS9EoH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adam Ronthal, Gartner Research VP agrees that it at least gives Cloudera more room to make necessary adjustments its market strategy as long as it doesn&#8217;t get stifled by its private equity overlords. &#8220;It should give Cloudera an opportunity to focus on their future direction with increased flexibility &#8212; provided they are able to invest in that future and that this does not just focus on cost cutting and maximizing profits. Maintaining a culture of innovation will be key,&#8221; Ronthal said.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the two purchases Cloudera also announced as part of its news package.</p>
<p>If you want to change direction in a hurry, there are worse ways than via acquisitions. And grabbing Datacoral and Cazena should help Cloudera alter its course more quickly than it could have managed on its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] two acquisitions will help Cloudera capture some of the value on top of the lake storage layer &#8212; perhaps moving into different data management features and/or expanding into the compute layer for analytics and AI/ML use cases, where there has been a lot of growth and excitement in recent years,&#8221; Alyward said.</p>
<p>Chandana Gopal, Research Director for the future of intelligence at IDC agrees that the transactions give Cloudera some more modern options that could help speed up the data wrangling process. &#8220;Both the acquisitions are geared towards making the management of cloud infrastructure easier for end-users. Our research shows that data prep and integration takes 70%-80% of an analyst&#8217;s time versus the time spent in actual analysis. It seems like both these companies&#8217; products will provide technology to improve the data integration/preparation experience,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company couldn&#8217;t stay on the path it was on forever, certainly not with an activist investor breathing down its neck. Its recent efforts could give it the time away from public markets it needs to regroup. How successful Cloudera&#8217;s turnaround proves to be will depend on whether the private equity companies buying it can both agree on the direction and strategy for the company, while providing the necessary resources to push the company in a new direction. All of that and more will determine if these moves pay off in the end.</p>

<p>For the past several months or so, I&#8217;ve been writing an accompanying post to editions of the Gillmor Gang. Due to production issues, I&#8217;m usually at least a week behind the recording session for the target show. This originally seemed like an impediment to the process of enhancing the impact of the show, but over time and various attempts to solve the out-of-sync timing problem, I began to see the delay actually produced some interesting context to the original recording. First and foremost, what seemed important weeks earlier became more nuanced as things developed — or often didn&#8217;t. Politics seemed loud and unprecedented in the moment; 10 days later, the ups and downs of the graph smoothed out the drama and accentuated the relative stability of intuitive analysis.</p>
<p>This in turn isolated some of the conflicts and pressure the media perceived as central to its ability to fund journalism, or more accurately nonfictional novelistic engagement and eyeball maintenance. And produced a wave of antagonism toward this repetitive ginned-up sawtooth of anger and despair. As the vaccines began to take root, we slowly but surely confirmed that we really didn&#8217;t have to live that way. Streaming and notifications are now in the process of moving into the mainstream, with media companies climbing into bed with tech giants and hybrid venture catalysts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cracks in this new infrastructure threaten to slow down the requisite belief that these changes will stick. Clubhouse seems to be going through a bloating effect on its gateway page; what once was a short list of 5 or 6 rooms now balloons to 20 or more entries. Topics, never my favorite mechanism for discovery, nail many of these conversations to the wall and move away from the underlying name intersections that suggest emergent themes rather than sandblasting them into the stage. Release notes of updates suggest the analytics are being mined for improvements to the differentiation with vanilla podcasts, but how they are surfaced is time sensitive to the momentum of the platform. The good news is that healthy injections from the founder and venture team will keep things afloat while we see the impact of the Android client. Competitive pressure, particularly from Kara Swisher on Twitter Spaces, will also help integrate mainstream and newsletter media with streaming audio innovation.</p>
<p>At a broader level, acquisitions and merger/alliances are recasting media companies as hybrid gorillas. Although AT&amp;T is positioned by many as backing out of their foray into content, a more interesting dynamic is the combination of WarnerMedia scripted assets with Discovery&#8217;s sports and reality programming in an ad-supported streaming bundle. It&#8217;s reminiscent of the formation of MGM in the early days of Hollywood, blending a small beleaguered studio, Metro Pictures, with Sam Goldwyn&#8217;s independent near-bankrupt studio, firing Goldwyn but keeping the name, and installing a third studio&#8217;s Louis B. Mayer and his production head Irving Thalberg as executives of the bundled company. Not so coincidentally, it was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was acquired by Amazon a few days later, bringing its library of the James Bond franchise, more than 4,000 classic films, and 17, 000 television properties to Prime&#8217;s 175 million active subscribers.</p>
<p>At various times, MGM and its United Artists acquisition have been bought and resold as power switched first from theaters to television and then to cable. Ted Turner famously bought the library and played it off on its Turner Classic Movies channel. Now the pandemic&#8217;s call to action has propelled digital transformation to the fore, and tossed yet another mix of the puzzle pieces into play. But MGM&#8217;s collapse in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s and the auctioning off of its backlot to real estate developers suggests something similar might be happening today with broadcast television networks losing out one by one when the music stops playing in this corporate game of musical chairs. Cable news may be blocked out if antitrust regulators refuse attempts to merge the new Warners Discovery with Comcast, the former now home for CNN and the latter MSNBC. Regulators will likely frown on two of the remaining 3 broadcast networks merging with a Viacom/CBS and Comcast /NBC/Universal deal.</p>
<p>Instead, the tech networks and their burgeoning social audio/newsletter platforms will virtualize the big studio model. Cable news will move from podcasts through Clubhouse and Spaces to newsletter brands, building tentpole events around technology news, innovations coverage, and startup deal flow. The scale of big incumbents like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon will produce 5,000+ executive interviews, with independent analysis from break-away blogs and newsletters looking a lot like a merger of MSNBC and CNBC. Apple and Spotify will emulate the ad-supported free tiers of their streaming networks to unbundle the music companies from their captive back catalogues and create a hybrid live performance promotional Top Forty for the play-from-anywhere crowd. The Marvel, DC, Star Wars cinematic universes will use the digital tier to promote theatrical experiences as the pandemic moves overseas and hopefully is suppressed globally over 2022. Politics, a trailing indicator, will be the arbiter of how quickly we can rearchitect in infrastructure, health care, and an equitable working majority rule of law. By then, maybe I can take a 3D VR trip through the MGM backlot and dream that this could be the start of a beautiful friendship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With wildfires becoming an ever more devastating annual phenomenon, it is in the whole planet&#8217;s interest to spot them and respond as early as possible — and the best vantage point for that is space. OroraTech is a German startup building a constellation of small satellites to power a global wildfire warning system, and will be using <a href="https://ororatech.com/2021/06/01/ororatech-successfully-closes-e5-8m-series-a-to-launch-first-satellites-to-tackle-global-wildfire-and-climate-crisis/">a freshly raised €5.8M (~$7M) A round</a> to kick things off.</p>
<p>Wildfires destroy tens of millions of acres of forest every year, causing immense harm to people and the planet in countless ways. Once they&#8217;ve grown to a certain size, they&#8217;re near impossible to stop, so the earlier they can be located and worked against, the better.</p>
<p>But these fires can start just about anywhere in a dried out forest hundreds of miles wide, and literally every minute and hour counts — watch towers, helicopter flights, and other frequently used methods may not be fast or exact enough to effectively counteract this increasingly serious threat. Not to mention they&#8217;re expensive and often dangerous jobs for those who perform them.</p>
<p>OroraTech&#8217;s plan is to use a constellation of about 100 satellites equipped with custom infrared cameras to watch the entire globe (or at least the parts most likely to burst into flame) at once, reporting any fire bigger than ten meters across within half an hour.</p>

<p>To start out with, the Bavarian company has used data from over a dozen satellites already in space, in order to prove out the service on the ground. But with this funding round they are set to put their own bird in the air, a shoebox-sized satellite with a custom infrared sensor that will be <a href="https://spire.com/press-release/leading-wildfire-monitoring-provider-ororatech-partners-with-spire-to-launch-first-satellite-in-2021/">launched by Spire later this year.</a> Onboard machine learning processing of this imagery simplifies the downstream process.</p>
<p>14 more satellites are planned for launch by 2023, presumably once they&#8217;ve kicked the proverbial tires on the first one and come up with the inevitable improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to cover even more regions in the future and to be able to give warning earlier, we aim to launch our own specialized satellite constellation into orbit,&#8221; said CEO and co-founder Thomas Grübler in a press release. &#8220;We are therefore delighted to have renowned investors on board to support us with capital and technological know-how in implementing our plans.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160456" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160456" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2160456 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg" alt="Mockup of an OroraTech Earth imaging satellite in space." width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg 1331w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mockup-Satellite.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2160456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OroraTech</p></div></p>
<p>Those renowned investors consist of Findus Venture and Ananda Impact Ventures, which led the round, followed by APEX Ventures, BayernKapital, Clemens Kaiser, SpaceTec Capital and Ingo Baumann. The company was spun out of research done by the founders at TUM, which maintains an interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely remarkable what they have built up and achieved so far despite limited financial resources and we feel very proud that we are allowed to be part of this inspiring and ambitious NewSpace project,” APEX&#8217;s Wolfgang Neubert said, and indeed it&#8217;s impressive to have a leading space-based data service with little cash (it raised an undisclosed seed about a year ago) and no satellites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only company doing infrared imagery of the Earth&#8217;s surface; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">SatelliteVu recently raised money</a> to launch its own, much smaller constellation, though it&#8217;s focused on monitoring cities and other high-interest areas, not the vast expanse of forests. And ConstellR is aimed (literally) at the farming world, monitoring fields for precision crop management.</p>
<p>With money in its pocket Orora can expand and start providing its improved detection services, though sadly, it likely won&#8217;t be upgrading before wildfire season hits the northern hemisphere this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be over, but HBO Max is still breaking new ground, and even breaking the internet &#8212; this past weekend, HBO Max </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/hbo-max-blacks-out-before-much-anticipated-mare-of-easttown-finale-1234766720/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blacked out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right before the finale of &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mare of Easttown</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; likely due to traffic. But if you haven’t hopped aboard the HBO Max train yet, it might be time to try it out. Today, the streaming platform premieres an ad-supported subscription at $9.99 per month. Its existing service &#8212; which features no ads &#8212; costs $14.99 per month. Subscribers can save 15% on their subscription, no matter which version they choose, if they pre-pay for an entire year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advertisements aren’t the only drawback of the more affordable subscription option. The ad-supported tier offers a maximum quality of 1080p, which is still pretty good for most consumers, unless you&#8217;re watching “Friends: The Reunion” in your 4K home theater. But, lower-tier subscribers won’t be able to download content to view offline, nor will they have access to same-day film premieres of Warner Bros.’s newest theatrical releases. However, these films will become available to stream months after release. On the bright side, ads will not appear on original HBO programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just four minutes of ad time per hour, the ad-supported tier “</span><a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/new-hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-available-today"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launches with a commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to maintaining the lowest volume of commercials among popular streaming services. HBO Max follows in the footsteps of Hulu, which also offers a discounted subscription with ads for $5.99 per month, as opposed to $11.99 per month. But on Hulu, a half-hour show can contain </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hulu-premium-review"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost five minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of unskippable ad time. Meanwhile, Netflix offers its most basic plan &#8212; which allows streaming on one screen at a time without HD &#8212; for $8.99 per month. Its standard plan is $13.99 a month. Now that HBO Max has a more competitively priced option, it might give these other platforms a run for their money. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kinds of ads can you expect to see on HBO Max? The company says that subscribers can expect “a greater personalization in the ads they see” over time, with “more innovation in formats to come.” This could resemble the ad experience on Hulu, which has experimented with viewer-friendly </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/hulu-launches-its-viewer-friendly-binge-watch-ads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">binge-watch ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our most exciting ad format for launch is Brand Block, which allows brands to own a block of content and consumers to delight in a limited commercial experience,&#8221; said Julian Franco, the vice president of Product Management at HBO Max. &#8220;We’re exploring a number of new formats in the future, including pause ads and a branded discovery format that allows brand partners to sponsor custom content curations.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as ad personalization goes, Franco added, &#8220;We’ve created a variety of product tools including new data ingestion pipelines to help power our dashboards and real-time reporting and the ability to test and pair specific cohorts of customers with specific ad break patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of April 2021, HBO Max and HBO reached a combined <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/hbo-max-hbo-reaches-44-2-million-subscribers-4165569/">44.2 million subscribers</a>, and in Q1 of the year, added <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/zack-snyders-justice-league-did-little-to-boost-hbo-max-subscriptions.html">2.7 million domestic subscribers</a>. By comparison, Netflix reported an increase of 4 million subscribers in the same period, bringing them to about 207 million global subscribers. However, only 450,000 of those new subscribers come from the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>On June 29, HBO Max will launch in 39 Latin American markets. Later in the year, the streaming service is expected to roll out in Europe. This will only further the platform&#8217;s rapid growth &#8212; in 2019, AT&amp;T, which owns HBO Max, set the modest goal to attain 50 million subscribers by 2025. Now, HBO Max expects it will reach between <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/att-expects-120-million-to-150-million-hbo-max-subs-by-end-of-2025.html">120 million and 150 million subscribers</a> by the same date.</p>
<p>The ad-supported subscription option for HBO Max is available now.</p>
<p><em>Update 6/2/21, 4:47 PM EST with comment from HBO Max</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Confluent became the latest company to announce its intent to take the IPO route, officially filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001699838/000119312521178773/d63025ds1.htm">its S-1 paperwork</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The company, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/confluent">raised over $455 million</a> since it launched in 2014, was most recently valued at just over $4.5 billion when it raised $250 million last April.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What we can see in Confluent is nearly an old-school, high-burn SaaS business. It has taken on oodles of capital and used it in an increasingly expensive sales model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What does Confluent do? It built a streaming data platform on top of the open-source Apache Kafka project. In addition to its open-source roots, Confluent has a free tier of its commercial cloud offering to complement its paid products, helping generate top-of-funnel inflows that it converts to sales.</p>
<p>Kafka itself emerged from a LinkedIn internal project in 2011. As we wrote at the time of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/confluent-raises-50m-to-continue-growing-commercial-arm-of-apache-kafka/">Confluent’s $50 million Series C in 2017</a>, the open-source project was designed to move massive amounts of data at the professional social network:</p>
<blockquote><p>At its core, Kafka is simply a messaging system, created originally at LinkedIn, that’s been designed from the ground up to move massive amounts of data smoothly around the enterprise from application to application, system to system or on-prem to cloud — and deal with extremely high message volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-raises-a-125m-series-d-funding-round/">wrote at the time of the funding</a> that events streaming is at the core of every business, reaching sales and other core business activities that occur in real time that go beyond storing data in a database after the fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;[D]atabases have long helped to store the current state of the world, but we think this is only half of the story. What is missing are the continually flowing stream of events that represents everything happening in a company, and that can act as the lifeblood of its operation,” he wrote.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Confluent comes in.</p>
<p>But enough about the technology. Is Confluent’s work with Kafka a good business? Let’s find out.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does an electric vehicle sound like when it goes from 0 to 60, when it signals a turn, when it’s powered down for the night? EV motors have fewer parts and are therefore incredibly silent, which presents safety concerns for drivers who recognize speed by sound and pedestrians who can’t hear an approaching vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/06/new-evs-sold-in-eu-will-be-required-to-make-warning-noises-to-alert-pedestrians/#:~:text=Back%20issues-,New%20EVs%20sold%20in%20EU%20will%20be%20required,warning%20noises%20to%20alert%20pedestrians&amp;text=From%201%20July%202019%2C%20any,pedestrians%20that%20it%20is%20approaching."><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulators in Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/16/20869035/electric-car-ev-fake-noise-nhtsa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the U.S. began requiring EVs to have warning sounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they left it up to the car manufacturers to choose those sounds. Many have taken the new legislation as an opportunity to not only create a branded sound, but also to stir up some marketing hype by enlisting famous musicians to compose the noise of an electric engine. Hans Zimmer created the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/29/bmws-ev-concept-gets-blade-runner-style-sound/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blade Runner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-esque sound concept for BMW’s i4 electric sedan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and, strangely, </span><a href="https://www.thedrive.com/article/17382/mercedes-amg-partners-with-linkin-park-to-produce-engine-sounds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linkin Park is creating EV sounds for BMW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound designer Yuri Suzuki, a partner at design consultancy firm Pentagram, recently conducted a research project into the crucial role electric car sound has on a user’s safety, enjoyability, communication and brand recognition, out of which he developed a <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/news/electric-car-sound-design">range of car sounds</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Suzuki says that while some automakers have chosen beautiful and interesting car sound designs, chasing celebrity clout is not the way to go when designing the sound behind serious machines. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really have to design carefully based on the psychological effects on a human,” Suzuki told TechCrunch. “It’s all about the relation between the human being and the machine itself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki says smart sound design can help ease the difference between human and car by providing a shared language. Based on surveys he conducted, Suzuki came up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtdWVOf2YNI&amp;t=43s&amp;ab_channel=Dezeen">two new skeuomorphic electric engine sounds</a> as well as adaptive sounds that reflect the time of day and the location of the drive. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His engine sounds are reminiscent of internal combustion engine revs, providing both drivers and pedestrians with a recognizable indication of speed increasing and decreasing. The sounds are placed at different pitches: one quite low, like a spaceship taking off; the other a bit higher, like a hovercraft vertically ascending. Audi, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover have also chosen to make futuristic copies of gasoline engines for some of their new electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki’s sound design also includes in-car sounds, like powering on, turn signals or horn honking, that use AI to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il15DQ-chsM&amp;t=29s&amp;ab_channel=Dezeen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adapt to the time of day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the morning, there’s a higher pitch and a sunnier energy to the sounds, which get progressively lower in pitch as the day wears on. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the sounds more customizable, Suzuki says he uses machine learning to help integrate the individual’s calendar so the sound can adapt to the type of activity the user is doing, from heading to work to running errands to going on a joyride. </span><a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/05/14/electric-car-sounds-yuri-suzuki-pentagram/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video game-like sounds are activated whenever the driver arrives at their destination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of manufacturers allow the driver to choose the sounds their vehicle will make, but Suzuki doesn’t think that’s the best idea because people will likely choose what sounds coolest to them, not necessarily what is most useful. Not to mention what a strange cacophony of noises cities would sound like if everyone could choose their own sounds. It would be like when people started choosing their own cellphone ringtones, but on a larger, more anxiety-inducing scale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We suggest a pre-set sound that gradually changes as it shifts to your life and activity pattern,” he said. “Our AI can slowly adjust its sound to the driver’s behavior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki’s AI-based car sounds are designed so that they’re not repetitive. So if you’re on a long road trip, rather than constantly listening to the same sound, Suzuki’s sounds are capable of creating real-time generation of bespoke sounds, a task that’s nearly impossible for a human to do. He says the constantly progressing and shifting sounds use the same data as the original engine sound, but it can stretch for hours without repetition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pentagram hasn’t yet produced a commercial application for Suzuki’s sounds, as it is more interested in sharing its research with the EV and sound design communities, as well as finding the right automaker partner to develop this project further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no strong sound guidelines yet, so that’s something we’re interested in,” said Suzuki. “The first step for us is sharing the kinds of things we can do with AI and sound design.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At today’s F8 developer conference, Facebook announced </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/spark-ar-previews-multipeer-api-for-ar-video-calling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new capabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Spark AR, its flagship AR creation software. Since Spark AR was announced at F8 2017, more than 600,000 creators from 190 countries have published over 2 million AR effects on Facebook and Instagram, making it the largest mobile AR platform, according to Facebook. If you’ve ever posted a selfie on your Instagram story with an effect that gave you green hair, or let you control a dog’s facial expression by moving your own face, then </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/instagrams-ar-filters-are-getting-more-dynamic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ve used Spark AR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, these AR effects will be available for video calling on Messenger, Instagram and Portal with the introduction of a Multipeer API. Creators can develop effects that bring call participants together by using a shared AR effect. As an example, Spark AR shared a promo video of a birthday party held over a video call, in which an AR party hat appears on each of the participants’ heads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators can also develop games for users to play during their video calls. This already exists on Facebook video calls &#8212; think of the game where you compete to see who can catch the most flying AR hamburgers in their mouth in a minute. But when the ability to make new, lightweight games opens to developers, we’ll see some new games to challenge our friends with on video calls. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These video call effects and multipeer AR games will be bolstered by Spark’s platform-exclusive </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/new-spark-ar-capabilities-arrive-for-instagram/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-class segmentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capability. This lets developers augment multiple segments of a user’s body (like hair or skin) at once within a single effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook also discussed its ongoing ambition to build AR glasses. Chris Barbour, director of Partnerships for Spark AR, said that this goal is still “years away” &#8212; but, Barbour did tease some potential features for the innovative, wearable tech. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine being able to teleport to a friend’s sofa to watch a show together, or being able to share a photo of something awesome you see on a hike,” Barbour said. Maybe this won’t sound so dystopian by the time the product launches, years down the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last October, Spark AR launched the AR Partner Network, a program for the platform’s most advanced creators, and this year, Spark launched an AR curriculum through Facebook’s BluePrint Platform to help creators learn how to improve their AR effects. Applications for the Spark Partner Network will open again this summer.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re among the growing number of people interested in cryptocurrencies, you may be interested to know that nearly 7,000 people lost more than $80 million between October 2020 and March 2021 &#8212; a 1,000% increase from a year ago, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/blog_posts/Cryptocurrency%20buzz%20drives%20record%20investment%20scam%20losses/cryptocurrency_spotlight.pdf?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202">according to the Federal Trade Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The scams include fake currency exchanges and phony “investment” websites selling the currency. More recently, more than<a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/elon-musk-snl-scammers-steal-over-10-million-in-bitcoin-ethereum-dogecoin-crypto-fake-giveaways"> $10 million was stolen in various cryptocurrencies</a> in the days leading up to Elon Musk’s appearance on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>And here’s the rub: You have no way to protect your accounts from any theft. In the world of cryptocurrency, there are no guarantees. Unlike the traditional banking world, there is no equivalent to the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> to cover any losses on your account. If your assets are stolen, you’re out of luck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			Nearly 7,000 people have lost more than $80 million between October 2020 and March 2021 &#8212; a 1,000% increase from a year ago, according to the Federal Trade Commission.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Enabling secure access to these cryptocurrency assets is absolutely critical to preventing theft &#8212; which,<a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-3-8-billion-in-122-attacks-throughout-2020"> as of the end of 2020, amounted to just over $10 million a day</a> &#8212; and/or lockout of one’s potential fortune.</p>
<p>But how can you ensure that people can always access their accounts? That depends on how the accounts are set up initially &#8212; which usually means that passwords or other knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is involved. Unfortunately, passwords simply aren’t suitable for securing high-value accounts because they can be easily compromised, either through phishing attacks or outright theft.</p>
<p>Plus, if you have a less-used cryptocurrency wallet, you might forget your initial password and might have trouble<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"> recovering</a> it &#8212; if there is even a mechanism to perform the recovery. KBA is also plagued with problems ranging from lack of recollection (what is my favorite hobby again?) to the wide availability of “personal” information on the web (for a few dollars, you can surely find my mother’s maiden name).</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency account takeovers happen<a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-3-8-billion-in-122-attacks-throughout-2020"> with increasing frequency</a>; it doesn’t help that there are few pre-established trust relationships between users and the exchange or wallet provider and that almost all transactions are finalized within minutes and not easily reversible.</p>
<p>Sadly, these takeovers make use of a very similar pattern that has been observed for years in the traditional banking world: An attacker will first try harvesting and then stuffing stolen credentials. If that doesn’t work &#8212; say a user has protected their account by requiring an SMS second factor &#8212; they will move on to popular techniques to overcome SMS, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swapping</a> or a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber">$16 SMS relay service</a> that sends that SMS code to the attacker’s smartphone, which leads to a “successful” account takeover.</p>
<p>Even highly secure tokens or dedicated authenticator apps are vulnerable to replay attacks from a motivated hacker &#8212; and with personal fortunes at stake, there is no lack of motivation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vast growth in the number of cryptocurrency exchange users coupled with this need for strong cybersecurity has resulted in terrible support experiences where users have to wait for weeks or even months to regain access to their own accounts &#8212; simply because it is so difficult for them to prove they are the rightful owner.</p>
<h2>Authentication best practices can help</h2>
<p>So how do we fix this situation? With standards-based user authentication that has been proven to be <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/">resistant to phishing</a> and account takeovers &#8212; and that is already embedded into billions of devices worldwide and available to just about <a href="https://caniuse.com/webauthn">any user on a modern browser</a>. The FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) authentication protocols were developed by a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/">who’s who of IT, payments and consumer services</a> and ensure that all cryptographic credentials are stored on a user’s device &#8212; thereby eliminating even the most advanced machine-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange Gemini was an early adopter of FIDO for both its smartphone app and for browser users, with a growing percentage of its users protecting their accounts with FIDO authentication by purchasing FIDO Certified security keys. There have been a number of other exchanges that have added FIDO authentication, such as <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/verify-my-account/security-keys-faq">Coinbase, which also supports FIDO keys</a>. Binance has FIDO for its web versions, but not on its smartphone apps yet. And <a href="https://help.stex.com/en/articles/3486981-security">STEX also has support for various FIDO devices and methods</a>. Finally, <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005198545-FIDO-U2F">Ledger hardware wallets support</a> FIDO directly in their devices.</p>
<p>Ideally, it would be better and more effective if there was broad cryptocurrency industry acceptance of FIDO’s approach to modern authentication and adoption of several related best practices, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardize authentication flows and practices across crypto exchanges</strong>. Better user authentication should be a standard practice for <em>every</em> exchange, not a competitive differentiator. If all leading exchanges moved to industry best practices for account creation, login and recovery, it would help protect customers &#8212; and their collective crypto assets.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Require users to enroll multiple authenticators to help with account recovery for each cryptocurrency exchange</strong>, whether that is two FIDO security keys or a FIDO security key and a biometric authenticator. Having multiple account recovery keys for each cryptocurrency exchange will help lessen support burdens and help users who lose a device. It will also offer users a choice of stronger authentication options.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminating less secure backup and recovery options, </strong>such as using SMS or other knowledge-based authentication factors, will also help improve overall security, particularly for account recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom line is that for the cryptocurrency market to reach its full potential, its exchanges need to collectively strike a balance between the anonymity and privacy that make crypto unique with the security of accounts and assets. Following the lead of crypto exchanges like Gemini and letting users lock down their accounts is a great step toward protecting users against phishing and account takeovers while maintaining privacy and convenience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp now has more than 2 billion users globally, and by comparison its efforts to cultivate more business usage have been quite modest: just over 175 million people message with WhatsApp Business accounts daily for things like customer support or to discuss products. Today, as part of its F8 event, Facebook is unveiling some updates to the WhatsApp API to expand that experience.</p>
<p>The news comes on the heels of Facebook unveiling the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-opens-its-messenger-api-for-instagram-to-all-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general availability of Messenger API for Instagram</a> earlier today, and forms part of a bigger series of announcements aimed at doing business more easily on the platform.</p>
<p>More generally, Facebook and its many apps are at their heart very consumer services &#8212; they are used by billions of people to keep in touch with each other, for diversion, and to stay informed about whatever matters to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Facebook the business has been gradually building out a very extensive and lucrative commercial infrastructure around that engaged audience, one that started with advertising but has extended deeper into marketing, customer service, workplace productivity, and shopping.</p>
<p>The F8 conference, hatched originally as a hackathon, had grown into a very big event. This year&#8217;s installment is a significantly more toned down affair than in recent years &#8212; no big crowds (it&#8217;s all virtual), no big product and hardware announcements (it doesn&#8217;t appear that there are any&#8230; so far), and it feels more like a Zoom conference &#8212; and today&#8217;s news about business-oriented developer tools not only resets the event back around its original developer focus, but it also bolsters that commercial strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">With WhatsApp for Business it appears that one of the sticking points has been time &#8212; from setting up WhatsApp for Business in the first place to responding to different kinds of messages. This is what Facebook is now addressing.</p>
<p class="p1">First, it&#8217;s speeding up the time it takes to set up a WhatsApp business account to five minutes (versus what it described as weeks in the past).</p>
<p class="p1">Then, Facebook is making it easier to use the Business account once it is set up. For starters, businesses will be able to respond faster to inbound messages (which previously were &#8220;difficult to follow up with customers outside of a 24-hour window&#8221;), and they can now send out messages to those who have opted in, for example around stock availability.</p>
<p class="p1">Businesses using the tool for customer care, meanwhile, will be given the option to create up to 10 pre-written messages to speed up their responses, and they can also set up reply buttons to provide pre-populated, popular replies from customers.</p>
<p>In addition to the WhatsApp news, Facebook is also adding another tool to Messenger to expand its: Facebook Login Connect.</p>
<p>Essentially, if a business has integrated Facebook Login, it will allow users to log into their app or website using their Facebook credentials, and then carry on a conversation with the company over Messenger.</p>
<p>This is useful not just because it also means that a user can keep track of any conversations from one place, but it gives the company access to the tools that it has built to carry out conversations in Messenger already, whether those are chatbots or links through to other CRM databases. Facebook said that tests of the service indicate that 70% of users opt in to use the Login Connect tool, indicating that they&#8217;re willing to use their Facebook credentials in this way.</p>
<p>This is a closed beta now but will be more widely available in coming months, Facebook said.</p>
<p class="p4">Finally, Facebook is launching a new feature in its Business Suite &#8212; a platform that can be used by businesses to manage activity across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger &#8212; that will let developers build &#8220;Business Apps.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are not apps in the app store sense, but tools made by third parties (developers) to work alongside the Facebook-built Business Suite, further integrating Facebook tools into businesses&#8217; sites and apps, and also bringing more of a businesses&#8217; content &#8212; for example items from a catalog &#8212; into their Facebook Page, or Instagram account, and so on. The platform already has some 90 developers working on it and it integrates with e-commerce platforms like Bigcommerce, Facebook said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation hit back against allegations that it misappropriated trade secrets and infringed on patents from electric aircraft rival Wisk Aero, telling a court this week that it designed its Maker aircraft with a third-party eVTOL consultant prior to any former Wisk employees joining the company.</p>
<p>Archer said it worked with consultant FlightHouse Engineering at the end of 2019, when the consultancy firm modeled a 12-rotor fixed-wing aircraft, with the front six rotors capable of tilting from a vertical to a horizontal position. This is the design that ultimately became the Maker. By the time the first Wisk employee arrived at Archer, this design had already been modeled, Archer says.</p>
<p>“Despite the breathless innuendo and baseless speculation to which Wisk devotes its entire complaint, Archer’s eVTOL aircraft design is not only the best eVTOL aircraft around, it is entirely Archer’s design,” the answer says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch that Archer’s filing changes nothing about the case. It “contains no substantive response to the allegations Archer misappropriated more than 50 specific Wisk trade secrets, which were disclosed in a court filing last month and cover multiple components, systems, and designs for the aircraft,” the spokesperson said. “We believe Archer’s business is built on Wisk’s intellectual property as detailed in our filings, and we look forward to proceeding with our case.”</p>
<p>Wisk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/">filed its lawsuit</a> with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in April, alleging that Archer perpetrated a “brazen theft” of confidential information and intellectual property. The suit came just two months after Archer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">announced it would merge</a> with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp. in a deal valued at $3.8 billion.</p>

<p>In its filing Tuesday, Archer included counterclaims alleging “tortious interference and unfair competition.” Archer stated that Wisk engaged in a “media campaign” that was timed “to maximize harm to Archer after learning of Archer’s impending financial success.”</p>
<p>In a separate motion to dismiss, Archer also said that Wisk failed to identify any specific trade secrets that it allegedly misappropriated in the April complaint.</p>
<p>Wisk, born of a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk Corp., did include a 72-page trade secret disclosure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">in a separate injunction</a> filed on May 19. That injunction could potentially bar Archer from using any of the purportedly stolen technology. An Archer spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company will file an opposition to that injunction on June 23, “which will address Wisk’s purported trade secret disclosure statement.”</p>
<p>A major part of Wisk’s suit are allegations that a former Wisk employee, Jing Xue, downloaded thousands of proprietary files from his work computer prior to joining Archer. However, Archer said in the motion to dismiss that Wisk does not allege that the former employee disclosed any such information to Archer. According to Archer, “such allegations do not suffice to show that Archer […] came into possession of the files or learned of the confidential information therein, much less that it did so knowingly, as is required to state a trade secret claim.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Why is Etsy willing to pay more than 23x Depop's 2020 revenues? It is buying Gen Z love.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The news this morning that e-commerce marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/">Etsy will buy Depop</a>, a startup that provides a secondhand e-commerce marketplace, for more than $1.6 billion may not have made a large impact on the acquiring company&#8217;s share price thus far, but it provides a fascinating look into what brands may be willing to pay for access to the Gen Z market.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What Etsy is buying is not merely a source of GMS and net losses. It&#8217;s buying access to Gen Z.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>First, a few details: Per Etsy, the Depop deal is worth &#8220;$1.625 billion consisting primarily of cash, subject to certain adjustments for Depop&#8217;s working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness, and certain deferred and unvested equity for Depop management and employees.&#8221; So, $1.625 billion, plus or minus. We&#8217;ll use that number this morning.</p>
<p>Because Etsy is a public company and the transaction is material, it provided a good deal of information on the acquisition. The key facts that relate to the scale of Depop&#8217;s business are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2020 gross platform spend, revenue:</strong> <em>&#8220;Depop&#8217;s 2020 gross merchandise sales (GMS) and revenue were approximately $650 million and $70 million, respectively, each increasing over 100% year over year.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><strong>Historical gross platform spend trend:</strong> <em>&#8220;Depop&#8217;s GMS grew at a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 80% from 2017-2020.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At $70 million in 2020 revenue, Depop is being valued at a multiple of 23.2x of the previous year&#8217;s top line. That&#8217;s rich, but not impossibly high for a company that just had a huge pandemic year. (Though it is somewhat notable that Etsy is valuing Depop as if it was a high-growth SaaS business and not a consumer marketplace.)</p>
<p>The category of e-commerce performed well during the pandemic, implying that Depop&#8217;s nonpandemic growth rate would have been lower than what it ultimately recorded. How can we tell? The company&#8217;s historical GMS spend figure of &#8220;nearly 80%&#8221; from 2017 to 2020 is <em>inclusive</em> of the 100%+ GMS growth it recorded last year. We can infer, then, that in 2017, 2018 and 2019, GMS at Depop grew at a slower pace, namely one that is under the 80% mark.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The legendary Q&amp;A website for programmers (and probably one of the most copy-and-pasted sites on the internet) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is being acquired. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-developer-community-stack-overflow-sold-to-tech-giant-prosus-for-1-8-billion-11622648400">is reporting</a> that Prosus (the primary shareholder of Chinese gaming mega co/WeChat developer, Tencent) will acquire Stack Overflow for $1.8 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Prosus confirms the $1.8 billion number <a href="https://www.prosus.com/news/prosus-to-acquire-stack-overflow-for-us18-billion/">in a press release here.</a></p>
<p>While perhaps not a name everyone recognizes, Prosus — the international assets holding arm of South Africa&#8217;s Naspers — is something of a giant. In 2001, parent company Naspers bought a 46.5% stake in Tencent for $32 million dollars. Earlier this year they sold a <em>2% </em>stake of Tencent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/investing/tencent-prosus-naspers-stock-sale-intl-hnk/index.html">for nearly $15<em> billion</em></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stack Overflow co-founders Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky shared the following shortly after the news broke:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

Prosus is an investment and holding company, which means that the most important part of this announcement is that Stack Overflow will continue to operate independently, with the exact same team in place that has been operating it, according to the exact same plan and the exact same business practices. Don’t expect to see major changes or awkward “synergies”. The business of Stack Overflow will continue to focus on Reach and Relevance, and Stack Overflow for Teams. The entire company is staying in place: we just have different owners now.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its antitrust trial with Epic Games, which has just adjourned, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">Apple</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=gni836kR">argued</a> it doesn&#8217;t evaluate its App Store profit and loss as a standalone business. But today, the company put out new figures that indicate it does have a good understanding of the money that flows through its app marketplace, at the very least. The company has now released an updated version of a study performed by the economists at the Analysis Group, which claims the App Store ecosystem facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020, up 24% from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">$519 billion seen the year prior.</a> The new report focuses on the pandemic impacts to apps and the small business developers the App Store serves, among other things.</p>
<p>It also noted that about 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store actually took place outside its walls, meaning Apple took no commission on those purchases. This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">up from the 85% figure</a> reported last year, and is a figure Apple has been using in antitrust battles to paint a picture of an App Store that facilitates a lot commerce where it doesn&#8217;t take a commission.</p>
<p>The study then broke down how the different categories of App Store billings and sales were distributed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple takes a commission on the sales of digital goods and services, which were $86 billion in 2020, or 13% of the total. But another $511 billion came from the sale of physical goods and services through apps &#8212; think online shopping, food delivery, ride hailing, etc. &#8212; or 80% of the total. These aren&#8217;t commissioned. And $46 billion came from in-app advertising, or 7% of the total.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="enlaK2j446"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">Tim Cook plays innocent in Epic v Apple&#8217;s culminating testimony</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tim Cook plays innocent in Epic v Apple&#8217;s culminating testimony&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/embed/#?secret=enlaK2j446" data-secret="enlaK2j446" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The larger point being made with some of these figures is that, while the dollar amount flowing through apps being commissioned is large, it&#8217;s much smaller than most of the business being conducted on the App Store.</p>
<p>The report also noted how much of that business originates from China, which accounted for 47% of total global billings and sales ($300 billion) versus the U.S.&#8217;s 27% ($175+ billion).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="Apple app store iOS" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/apple-app-store-ios-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The study additionally dove into how some App Store categories had been heavily impacted by the pandemic &#8212; particularly those apps that helped businesses and schools move online, those that offered ways to shop from your phone, or helped consumers stay entertained and healthy, among other things.</p>
<p>This led to a more than 40% increase in billings and sales from apps offering digital goods and services, while sales in the travel and ride-hailing sectors decreased by 30%. While the latter may gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, some of the acceleration driven by the pandemic in other categories &#8212; like online shopping and grocery delivery &#8212; could be here to stay.</p>

<p>To break it down further, general retail grew to $383 billion in 2020, up from $268 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">last year</a>. Food delivery and pickup grew from $31 billion in 2019 to $36 billion in 2021. Grocery shopping jumped from $14 billion to $22 billion. But travel fell from $57 billion in 2019 to $38 billion in 2020, and ride hailing dropped from $40 billion to $26 billion. (None of these categories are commissioned.)</p>
<p>The study then continued with a deep dive into how the App Store aided small businesses.</p>
<p>Highlighting how smaller businesses benefit from a tech giant&#8217;s ecosystem is a tactic others have taken to, as well, in order to shore up support for their own operations, which have similarly been accused of being monopolies in recent months.</p>
<p>Amazon, for example, raves about the small businesses benefitting from its marketplace<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/amazon-confirms-prime-day-will-run-june-21-22-an-earlier-than-usual-start/"> and its sales event Prime Day,</a> even as it stands accused of leveraging nonpublic data to compete with those same small business sellers. Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/facebook-vs-apple-ad-tracking/">meanwhile</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ios-14-apple-privacy-update-impacts-small-business-ads">pushed the small business impact angle</a> when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s new privacy protections</a> in iOS 14 allowed customers to opt out of being tracked &#8212; and therefore out of Facebook&#8217;s personalized ads empire.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s pointing to the fact that the number of small developers worldwide has grown by 40% since 2015. This group now makes up more than 90% of App Store developers. The study defines this group of &#8220;small&#8221; developers as those with fewer than 1 million downloads and less than $1 million in earnings across all their apps. It also excludes any developers that never saw more than 1,000 downloads in a year between 2015 and 2020, to ensure the data focuses on businesses, not hobbyists. (This is a slightly different definition than Apple uses for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">its Small Business Program</a>, we should note.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OW6z6yvqil"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">Apple dropping App Store fees to 15% for small businesses with under $1 million in revenues</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple dropping App Store fees to 15% for small businesses with under $1 million in revenues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/embed/#?secret=OW6z6yvqil" data-secret="OW6z6yvqil" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among this group, more than 1 in 5 saw at least an increase in downloads of at least 25% annually since their first full year on the App Store. And 1 in 4 who sold digital goods and services saw an earnings increase of at least 25% annually.</p>
<p>The study also connected being on the App Store with growing a business&#8217;s revenue, noting that only 23% of large developers (those with more than $1 million in earnings in 2020) had already earned more than $1 million back in 2015. Indeed, 42% were active on the App Store in 2015 but hadn&#8217;t crossed the $1 million threshold, and another 35% were not even on the App Store &#8212; an indication their success has been far more recent.</p>
<p>The research additionally identified more than 75 businesses in the U.S. and Europe, where iOS was essential to their business, that went public or were acquired since 2011. Their valuation totaled nearly $500 billion.</p>
<p>Finally, the study examined how apps transact outside their home market, as around 40% of all downloads of apps from small developers came from outside their home countries and nearly 80% were operating in multiple storefronts.</p>

<p>While the antitrust scrutiny may have pushed Apple into commissioning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">this type of App Store research last year,</a> it&#8217;s interesting to see the company is now updating the data on an annual basis to give the industry a deeper view into the App Store compared with the general developer revenue figure it used to trot out at various <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/app-store-developers-have-earned-120-billion-since-2008/">occasions</a>.</p>
<p>Like last year&#8217;s study, the updated research has been released in the days leading up to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference</a>. It&#8217;s a time of the year when Apple aims to renew its bond with the developer community as it rolls out new software development kits (SDKs), application programming interfaces (API)s, software and other tools &#8212; enhancements it wants to remind developers are made possible, in part, because of its App Store fees.</p>
<p>Today, Apple notes it has more than 250,000 APIs included in 40 SDKs. At <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-kicks-off-june-7/">WWDC 2021</a>, it will host hundreds of virtual <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/sessions/">sessions</a>, 1-on-1 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/labs/">developer labs</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">highlight App Store favorites</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers on the App Store prove every day that there is no more innovative, resilient or dynamic marketplace on earth than the app economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement about the research. &#8220;The apps we’ve relied on through the pandemic have been life-changing in so many ways — from groceries delivered to our homes, to teaching tools for parents and educators, to an imaginative and ever-expanding universe of games and entertainment. The result isn’t just incredible apps for users: it’s jobs, it’s opportunity, and it’s untold innovation that will power global economies for many years to come,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s still a bit of a legal maze, but more cities are <a href="https://civileats.com/2020/06/30/its-now-legal-for-home-chefs-in-california-to-sell-meals-will-more-cities-get-on-board/">coming around to the idea</a> of letting local home chefs bring in more income by selling homecooked meals to those nearby.</p>
<p><a href="https://shef.com">Shef</a> is a marketplace meant to help these home chefs connect with customers, handle orders and get the food delivered — and they&#8217;ve just raised $20 million to get it done.</p>
<p>The company is announcing its Series A round this morning, led by Andreessen Horowitz and backed by Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, M13 and a bevy of celebrities including Padma Lakshmi, Chef Aarón Sánchez, Katy Perry, Tiffany Haddish, Orlando Bloom and NBA All-Star Andre Iguodala.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the round, Andreessen Horowitz GP (and former OpenTable CEO) Jeff Jordan will join Shef&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Because of varying local laws, Shef works a bit differently from market to market. In some places, for example, they&#8217;re able to tap local delivery networks to get meals the last mile; in others, chefs handle deliveries themselves.</p>
<p>Across all markets, though, the ordering process boils down to: pick a chef, order what you want a few days in advance (everything is done via pre-orders so chefs know exactly what they&#8217;ll need each day — it&#8217;s not an on-a-whim kind of thing), then heat it up upon arrival.</p>

<p>But whether or not a service like this is even allowed to <em>exist</em> varies from place to place. Even in California, where a relatively new statewide law allows home cooks to sell their goods, the final say (and the details of the implementation) <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/01/17/685626391/selling-food-from-your-kitchen-is-legal-in-california-but-theres-a-catch">comes down to each county</a>. In many places, &#8220;homecooking&#8221; still requires getting access to a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>Shef co-founders Alvin Salehi and Joey Grassia don&#8217;t shy away from the legal challenges — in a chat earlier this week, they told me that they expect much of the funds they raised to go toward two things: figuring out how to get services like theirs legalized in more markets (they&#8217;ve hired Danielle Merida, former general counsel for TaskRabbit, to help there), and to onboard chefs as those new markets come online.</p>
<p>The company says they currently have more than 12,000 home chefs on their wait list, with that number ballooning as the pandemic shuttered restaurants around the country. Each chef they bring on to the platform goes through a 150-step onboarding process, including a food safety certification exam and food quality assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to expand the services to as many people as possible, because so many people need it,&#8221; Salehi tells me. &#8220;But it takes resources to be able to do that effectively, and most importantly, to do that safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shef is currently live in the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Seattle and New York, with plans to roll out in new markets&#8230; well, as soon as they can.</p>
