										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In their rush to offer alternatives to advanced western chipsets, Chinese semiconductor companies are racking up large fundings from investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/horizon-robotics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="horizon-robotics">Horizon Robotics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a five-year-old unicorn specializing in AI chips for robots and autonomous vehicles, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/hxLwKCI6WkA5ntKlvTSH7Q">announced</a> Tuesday that it has secured $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>The proceeds are the first close of an over $700 million Series C round that Horizon is seeking to raise. The partial funding is jointly led by prominent investors 5Y Capital (formerly Morningside Venture Capital), Hillhouse Capital, and Capital Today. <a href="https://www.gtja.com.hk/en/aboutus/#group_profile">Chinese brokerage Guotai Junan&#8217;s international arm</a> and South Korean conglomerate KTB.</p>
<p>The round arrived less than two years after Horizon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/horizon-robotics-raises-600m/">completed its $600 million Series B round</a>, which valued the firm at $3 billion post-money and also saw the participation of prominent Korean financiers including SK China, the China subsidiary of conglomerate SK Group, and SK Hynix, SK’s semiconductor unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, founded by a Baidu veteran, raised its Series A round of over $100 million led by Intel Capital in late 2017.</p>

<p>With the fresh capital, Horizon plans to hasten the development and commercialization of its automotive chips and autonomous driving solutions. It also aims to build an &#8220;open ecosystem&#8221; for industry partners.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, China has been striving to wean dependence on western chip giants in sectors ranging from smartphones to vehicles. Local startups like Horizon Robotics and Black Sesame Technologies, as well as telecoms titan Huawei, are pouring resources into autonomous driving processors, hoping to match or overtake the technologies from Nvidia and Intel&#8217;s Mobileye.</p>
<p>Horizon&#8217;s OEM and Tier 1 auto partners, according to the firm, include <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-assisted-audi-to-receive-its-first-test-license-for-autonomous-driving-on-public-18dc38f78e5e">Audi</a>, Bosch, <a href="https://medium.com/horizon-robotics/horizon-robotics-and-continental-sign-mou-in-the-field-of-intelligent-driving-839ce85ee486?source=collection_category---4------0-----------------------">Continental</a>, SAIC Motor and BYD.</p>
<p>75% of China&#8217;s ADAS (advanced driver-assistance system)-equipped cars and Level 3 (autonomous driving under certain circumstances) vehicles will be supported by Chinese suppliers by 2030, up from 20% in 2019, investment bank CITIC Securities <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/hyyj/2020-09-25/doc-iivhvpwy8790568.shtml">projects</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casaverdecapital.com/">Casa Verde Capital</a>, the investment fund co-founded by cannabis connoisseur Snoop Dogg (also known as Calvin Broadus), has closed on $100 million for its second investment fund,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1793392/000179339220000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml"> according to documents</a> filed<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1794686/000179468620000001/0001794686-20-000001-index.htm"> with the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>The fund, whose managing director, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/karan-wadhera" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="karan-wadhera">Karan Wadhera <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> declined to comment for this article, has managed to raise more cash just as the market for cannabis-related products seems poised for another period of expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to the public perception of the cannabis industry is not too dissimilar to the dotcom bubble of the late ’90s, where there was a lot of hype — a lot of it driven by public companies — and a lot of speculative trading and valuations that weren’t really founded in reality. [We’re talking about] projections multiple years out into the future, and then crazy revenue multiples on top of that,&#8221; Wadhera <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/">said of the last bust when he spoke to TechCrunch in July</a>. &#8220;Things just got really frothy, and that eventually burst, and last April or May was sort of the apex of that moment. It’s when things started to trade off. And it’s been those names, the public names in particular, that have been hit particularly hard.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since then, the industry has come roaring back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sitting here today, four-plus months into COVID, cannabis has really proved itself to be a non-cyclical industry. Cannabis has been deemed an essential business everywhere across the U.S. We had record sales in March, April and May, and the trend has continued,&#8221; Wadhera said in July. &#8220;And now that we are getting into an environment where governments are going to be looking for additional sources of tax revenue, the potential urgency around cannabis legalization is going to be there, which is going to be massively positive for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no indication of the target for the new venture capital fund, but with the new fundraising, Casa Verde <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/snoop-doggs-venture-firm-just-closed-its-debut-fund-with-45-million/">more than doubles the size of its initial investment vehicle</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cannabis VC Karan Wadhera on why the industry, which took a hit last year, is now quietly blazing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/cannabis-vc-karan-wadhera-on-why-the-industry-which-took-a-hit-last-year-is-now-quietly-blazing/embed/#?secret=lpZzYw7etf" data-secret="lpZzYw7etf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since Broadus, Wadhera and a third partner and the founder of Cashmere Agency and Stampede Management <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ted-chung" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ted-chung">Ted Chung launched <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> their debut fund in 2018, weed businesses have endured a roller-coaster business cycle of boom and bust.</p>
<p>In spite of those market vagaries, Casa Verde has managed to build a portfolio that is now worth at least $200 million, according to people with knowledge of the firm. That money has come through several special purpose vehicles and other fundraising mechanisms raised alongside the flagship fund.</p>
<p>The overall market for cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives is expected to hit $34 billion by 2025 according to an analyst report seen by TechCrunch from the investment bank <a href="https://www.cowen.com/">Cowen.</a></p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota all passing adult-use cannabis legalization measures in their states, the investment bank predicted roughly 30 percent growth to their total addressable market estimates.</p>
<p>For its part, Casa Verde has always taken a broad view on the potential addressable market that cannabis and its chemical compounds could capture.</p>
<p>Nowhere is that more on view than in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/">firm&#8217;s latest investment in the sleep company, Proper</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde gets into the sleep space, backing NY-based Proper&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/snoop-doggs-casa-verde-gets-into-the-sleep-space-backing-ny-based-proper/embed/#?secret=trGpcMREtB" data-secret="trGpcMREtB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Cannabis] is an input as well and its use case will go beyond how people think of cannabis stigmatically,” Wadhera said. “At its core, [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/proper-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="proper-2">Proper] <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a company that’s helping us target this sleep epidemic. We think CBD and cannabis at large can play a big role in addressing that in a way that traditional products haven’t been able to.”</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s true for sleep is true for a number of other different applications as well, Wadhera has said in the past.</p>
<p>Casa Verde has already invested heavily across the pure-play opportunities in cannabis, with investments spanning delivery, supply chain logistics, brands, and retail.</p>
<p>But the health benefits that cannabinoids could have for all kinds of ailments open up a much larger market &#8212; as do the broad consumer opportunities should Congress <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx">accede to the wishes of more than 60 percent of the American electorate</a> and legalize recreational cannabis use nationally.</p>
<p>And, as Wadhera told us in July, a Biden administration presents a potentially much more positive regulatory environment for the industry than the previous Trump administration did.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Biden will be very helpful. He has laid out many of the things that he wants, and [while] he isn’t taking it as far as full-scale legalization, he’s certainly in favor of full-scale decriminalization, [meaning] letting states have full authority over what happens with their businesses, and also the rescheduling of cannabis down from the current Schedule 1 level,&#8221; Wadhera had said. &#8220;So all of that will be incredibly helpful and will bring a lot more players who will feel comfortable investing in the space and, potentially, acquiring some of these businesses, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of companies have filed <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20433333-nso-v-whatsapp-amicus-brief-microsoft-et-al-as-filed">an amicus brief</a> in support of a legal case brought by WhatsApp against Israeli intelligence firm NSO Group, accusing the company of using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">an undisclosed vulnerability</a> in the messaging app to hack into at least 1,400 devices, some of which were owned by journalists and human rights activists.</p>
<p>NSO develops and sells governments access to its Pegasus spyware, allowing its nation-state customers to target and stealthily hack into the devices of its targets. Spyware like Pegasus can track a victim&#8217;s location, read their messages and listen to their calls, steal their photos and files and siphon off private information from their device. The spyware is often installed by tricking a target into opening a malicious link, or sometimes by exploiting never-before-seen vulnerabilities in apps or phones to silently infect the victims with the spyware. The company has drawn ire for selling to authoritarian regimes, like Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> found and patched a vulnerability that it said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">was being abused</a> to deliver the government-grade spyware, in some cases without the victim knowing. Months later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">WhatsApp sued NSO</a> to understand more about the incident, including which of its government customers was behind the attack.</p>
<p>NSO has repeatedly disputed the allegations, but was unable to convince a U.S. court to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/17/us-judge-whatsapp-lawsuit-against-israeli-spyware-firm-nso-can-proceed">drop the case</a> earlier this year. NSO&#8217;s main legal defense is that it is afforded legal immunities because it acts on behalf of governments.</p>
<p>But a coalition of tech companies has sided with WhatsApp, and is now asking the court to not allow NSO to claim or be subject to immunity.</p>
<p>Microsoft (including its subsidiaries LinkedIn and GitHub), Google, Cisco, VMware and the Internet Association, which represents dozens of tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, warned that the development of spyware and espionage tools — including hoarding the vulnerabilities used to deliver them — make ordinary people less safe and secure, and also runs the risk of these tools falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Microsoft&#8217;s customer security and trust chief Tom Burt said NSO should be accountable for the tools it builds and the vulnerabilities it exploits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Private companies should remain subject to liability when they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they’re trying to achieve,&#8221; said Burt. &#8220;We hope that standing together with our competitors today through this amicus brief will help protect our collective customers and global digital ecosystem from more indiscriminate attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for NSO did not immediately comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We look at the tech implications of the new stimulus bill, Lockheed Martin makes a big rocket engine acquisition and Google Cloud expands. This is your Daily Crunch for December 21, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Stimulus bill includes money for broadband and energy</strong></p>
<p>The $900 billion pandemic relief bill that lawmakers agreed on over the weekend includes a number of provisions that could have a significant impact on the tech industry. For one thing, it commits <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/covid-19-relief-bill-includes-1-9b-to-rip-and-replace-huawei-and-zte-equipment/">$7 billion to increase broadband access</a>, including $50 monthly payments to help qualifying families pay for broadband.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bill also includes $1.9 billion to &#8220;rip and replace&#8221; equipment from Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">there&#8217;s $35.2 billion for energy initiatives</a>, with photovoltaics, new transportation technologies and energy efficiency technologies looking like the big winners.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties have reached an agreement in principle on the stimulus, but it still needs final approval from Congress and President Donald Trump.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The demise of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> car, the technology giant&#8217;s not-so-secret secret project, was perhaps overstated. Apple&#8217;s so-called Project Titan, which last year reduced the team by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/24/apple-cuts-200-staff-project-titan/">some 200 employees</a>, is not only alive, it has plans to produce an electric passenger vehicle with &#8220;breakthrough battery technology&#8221; and automated vehicle technology by 2024, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">report from Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the vehicle will look like, who will be the manufacturing partner or if the self-driving system that Apple has been working on will be part of the car or offered as a software product to other companies. The Reuters article builds off of another report from Taiwanese media outlet <a href="https://j3onakwrnmmdhlpoecrnirxutq-adwhj77lcyoafdy-money-udn-com.translate.goog/money/story/5612/5108191">Economic Daily Times</a>, which describes Apple ramping up orders for auto parts and components from suppliers in the country. Together, the reports offer confirmation that Apple, while quiet and with a smaller team, hasn&#8217;t ditched the idea of a car after all.</p>
<p>Reuters sources describe this as a passenger vehicle, which would put Apple in a different category than autonomous vehicle technology companies like Waymo that are trying to commercialize robotaxi services. (Waymo has said that it is also interested in licensing its AV tech for passenger vehicles, but it&#8217;s not the company&#8217;s first priority.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The day-to-day operations of Apple&#8217;s Project Titan is led by Doug Field, who returned to the company in 2018 after a stint at electric automaker Tesla. Field, who was senior vice president of engineering at Tesla, was one of the key executives behind the launch of the Model 3. Under Field&#8217;s leadership, it appears the Apple car might square off more directly with Tesla than say Alphabet&#8217;s Waymo.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/apple-shifts-leadership-of-self-driving-car-division-to-ai-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple has moved Field and the rest of the Project Titan team under Apple executive John Giannandrea&#8217;s artificial intelligence and machine-learning group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here in the final few working days of 2020, a surprising number of new unicorns have come to light. The <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1340054032899948545">mad scramble</a> that investors are seeing in seed-stage startups appears to be reflected across the later stages as well.</p>
<p>That deal-making is still alive is not a surprise, but the cadence at which the market is crowning new unicorns is slightly startling, given the time of year. I&#8217;ve given up expecting a slowdown in venture capital, but I did anticipate <em>some</em> deceleration in huge rounds and resulting unicorn valuations this close to Christmas.</p>

<hr />
<p>This morning after contrasting a PitchBook-derived $500 million, post-money valuation for Bolt&#8217;s Series C that its CEO had said was roughly doubled in its Series C1, TechCrunch discovered that the online checkout software company likely landed a new valuation right around the unicorn mark. Bolt&#8217;s PR team declined to share a new valuation or grade our math, saying that its framing was &#8220;fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>One new unicorn &#8212; or near-unicorn, perhaps &#8212; was not enough for the day. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mary-meekers-vc-firm-bond-invests-in-ironclad-at-nearly-1-billion-valuation">broke news this afternoon</a> that Ironclad, which sells contract management software, put together a round worth &#8220;at least $100 million,&#8221; valuing the company at &#8220;more than $950 million.&#8221; Akin to Bolt, this unicorn-or-just-under valuation is also a doubling or better from its last private round.</p>
<p>In fact, two new unicorns were insufficient: a <em>third</em> company also made the mark today, namely Qualia, which <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/21/2148941/0/en/Qualia-Becomes-Latest-Tech-Unicorn-with-65m-Series-D-Acquires-Adeptive-Software.html">trumpeted the valuation achievement in a release</a>. Qualia builds real estate software.</p>
<p>Three unicorns in one day is busy. To see three come to light on December 21st is a little bonkers.</p>
<p>And they are hardly the only startups we&#8217;ve seen sprout horns and race about on four legs in recent days. There&#8217;s Boom, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zenoti" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zenoti">Zenoti <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and BigID also in the last week or so. That&#8217;s at least six new unicorns since roughly the mid-point of December. Wild!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the rounds and see what we can learn from them.</p>
<h2>Hello, new unicorns</h2>
<p>Starting with <strong>Bolt</strong>, there are a few lessons for us to take away. First: not every company that secures a unicorn (or a near-unicorn valuation) wants to make noise about it. We&#8217;ve known this, but the company&#8217;s currently coy attitude underscores the point. Second from Bolt is that inside investors are more than willing to crown unicorns in their own portfolio.</p>
<p>According to CEO Ryan Breslow, after his company raised its Series C, the round&#8217;s lead investor offered the company another term sheet. But WestCap was not its only lead. General Atlantic came in as well, giving the $75 million investment two leads. Bolt had already decided to call its new round a Series C1 before General Atlantic entered the deal, the addition of which brought $15 million to what was previously a $60 million investment.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s round fits neatly into a number of trends that we&#8217;ve been watching: inside rounds being bullish not bearish in 2020, the fastest-growing companies raising two rounds this year and the incredible focus by venture investors into startups that were not merely surviving COVID-19, but benefiting from how it shook up the market.</p>
<p>Turning to <strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ironclad" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ironclad">Ironclad</strong>, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> around $100 million at around a $950 million valuation is about as basic as a unicorn round can get. And because it has been more than a year since its last round, you might think that there is not that much to learn in its case.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/peloton-interactive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="peloton-interactive">Peloton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor">announced</a> that it intends to acquire Precor, one of the world&#8217;s largest suppliers of commercial fitness equipment. You probably recognize the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/precor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="precor">Precor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> brand name if you&#8217;ve ever spent time in a hotel or standalone commercial gym, which is exactly why Peloton making this purchase makes a ton of sense at this particular time for the hot home-workout brand.</p>
<p>The Precor acquisition will be made via a deal that&#8217;s valued at a total of $420 million, and in addition to expanding its commercial business, this also helps Peloton bring on a lot more manufacturing capability in a time when its order queue for its Tread and Bike hardware is deeper than ever, thanks to the increase in demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Precor already maintains a significant U.S.-based manufacturing operation, as well as dedicated research and development teams and facilities. In total, Peloton says in a press release that it&#8217;ll be adding 625,000 square feet of manufacturing facility in the U.S., between Precor facilities in both Whitsett, North Carolina and Woodinville, Washington.</p>
<p>While the near-term use of the acquisition, which is set to close in 2021 if it meets all approvals, is to speed up delivery times for customers of existing equipment, long-term this deal sets Peloton up nicely for greater commercial market expansion &#8212; once the commercial market returns to growth. While the pandemic has been a clear boon for Peloton&#8217;s at-home equipment and fitness subscription service, it&#8217;s also been devastating for gym chains and hoteliers, meaning that it&#8217;s likely Precor&#8217;s primary business was taking a considerable hit over the past few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the largest deal that Peloton has made thus far, but it&#8217;s possible it picked up Precor for a relative bargain; Precor owner Anta Sports was said to have been seeking a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/china-s-anta-sports-said-to-weigh-sale-of-fitness-brand-precor?sref=gni836kR">potential sale of the company for around $500 million</a> last November. Peloton will be installing Precor President Rob Barker as GM of Peloton Commercial as part of the new deal, and that should help it accelerate the infiltration of its connected equipment in commercial gyms globally once people feel more comfortable about returning to them safely post-pandemic.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We don't shy away from taking risks," said Spacefund's Meagan Crawford.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic might have upended the global economy, but according to Meagan Crawford at Spacefund and Chris Moran with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin-ventures">Lockheed Martin Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it didn&#8217;t dampen investment in space startups.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The space industry has enjoyed a honeymoon period with hundreds of startups popping up in the past five to seven years following SpaceX&#8217;s success.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Spacefund research conducted earlier this year found that there is almost no correlation between the global economy and the space industry, said Crawford, a managing partner at the VC firm, last Thursday at TC Sessions: Space 2020. Crawford and Moran both agreed that interest and investment in space will increase as more startups have successful exits.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We looked back historically over the last decade and a little bit more, and it turns out that even during the 2008-2009 economic downturn, the space industry continued to grow at 7% per year,&#8221; Crawford said, adding that they saw almost no correlation between the performance of the Global S&amp;P 1200 and the space industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of this has to do with a big portion of the industry coming from government budgets, which provides a lot of stability even in economically rough times, as well as the industry being in such high demand and going through such a high-growth phase right now that even the pandemic couldn&#8217;t really slow it down,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Early-stage investments did suffer at the beginning of the year, Moran noted after the event, but added that it appeared to be temporary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms were circling the wagons on their portfolios, in-person incubator programs went on hiatus, so there were fewer early-stage companies out there and less money for those companies,&#8221; he said, adding that Pitchbook data confirmed LMVC&#8217;s suspicions and showed a 25% to 27% drop in new company formation over that time.</p>
<p>Since September, LMVC has seen a spike in new companies. Meanwhile, incubators and accelerators have adapted to COVID-19 restrictions, Zoom made face-to-face meetings easy and life “as usual” started back up again, Moran added.</p>
<h2>Exits are driving investments</h2>
<p>The space industry has enjoyed a honeymoon period with hundreds of startups popping up in the past five to seven years following <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> success. Moran said this unabashed growth period will continue for a few years before narrowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So like any any industry in VC, you see a lot of people jump in and then as business models collide and the need to generate some sustainable business happens there&#8217;s a lot of winnowing and narrowing of the field,&#8221; Moran said. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably still in that growth period, but I imagine over the next few years, we&#8217;ll start seeing this winnowing and really focus on the folks who have a technology and a business model that will be successful long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the entire industry is funded on private capital, said Moran, who predicted investing is going to grow for some time as long as people see the excitement and promise of the industry. He added that easy access to public markets — notably the rise in mergers with special purpose acquisition companies — could drive even more money into space.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

		A career hacker, David "Moose" Wolpoff is CTO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.randori.com/">Randori</a>, a company building a continuous red-teaming platform.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p dir="ltr">The security industry is reverberating with news of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> breach and the announcement <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-amazoncom/exclusive-u-s-treasury-breached-by-hackers-backed-by-foreign-government-sources-idUSL1N2IT0HS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-amazoncom/exclusive-u-s-treasury-breached-by-hackers-backed-by-foreign-government-sources-idUSL1N2IT0HS&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7vwCh_QewC2t_DMstGDUePAQDiQ">that the U.S. Treasury Department</a>, DHS and potentially several other government agencies, were hacked due (in part, at least) to a supply chain attack on <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/orion-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.solarwinds.com/orion-platform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZ_4DyfnEnv9l-MJc9NarrIsejOw">SolarWinds</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These breaches are reminders that nobody is immune to risk or being hacked. I&#8217;ve no doubt that both FireEye and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> take security very seriously, but every company is subject to the same reality: Compromise is inevitable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way I judge these events is not by whether someone is hacked, but by how much effort the adversary needed to expend to turn a compromise into a meaningful breach. We’ve heard FireEye put effort and execution into the protection of sensitive tools and accesses, forcing the Russians to put stunning effort into a breach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Run a red-team security program, see how well you stack up and learn from your mistakes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p dir="ltr">More evidence of FireEye’s dedication to security can be seen by the speed with which its moved to publish <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/red_team_tool_countermeasures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/fireeye/red_team_tool_countermeasures&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGd-uDIMoafbySphETmapkXnbxToQ">countermeasure tools</a>. While the Solarwinds breach has had stunning immediate fallout, I’ll reserve opining about SolarWinds until we learn details of the whole event, because while a breach that traverses the supply should be exceedingly rare, they’ll never be stopped entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All this is to say, this news isn&#8217;t surprising to me. Security organizations are a top adversarial target, and I would expect a nation-state like Russia to go to great lengths to impede FireEye’s ability to protect its customers. FireEye has trusted relationships with many enterprise organizations, which makes it a juicy target for espionage activities. SolarWinds, with its lengthy list of government and large enterprise customers, is a desirable target for an adversary looking to maximize its efforts.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2089913" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089913" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2089913 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png" alt="SolarWinds' hackers gained access to multiple federal agencies." width="500" height="303" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089913" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Wolpoff</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hack Solarwinds once, and Russia gains access to many of its prized customers. This isn’t the first time a nation-state adversary has gone through the supply chain. Nor is it likely to be the last.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For security leaders, this is a good opportunity to reflect on their reliance and trust in technology solutions. These breaches are reminders of unseen risk debt: Organizations have a huge amount of potential harm built up through their providers that typically isn’t adequately hedged against.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People need to ask the question, &#8220;What happens when my MSSP, security vendor or any tech vendor is compromised?&#8221; Don’t look at the Solarwinds hack in isolation. Look at every one of your vendors that can push updates into your environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No single tool can be relied on to never fail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You need to expect that FireEye, SolarWinds and every other vendor in your environment will eventually get compromised. When failures occur, you need to know: &#8220;Will the remainder of my plans be sufficient, and will my organization be resilient?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What’s your backup plan when this fails? Will you even know?</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your security program is critically dependent on FireEye (Read: It’s the primary security platform), then your security program is dependent on FireEye implementing, executing and auditing its own program, and you and your management need to be okay with that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Often, organizations purchase a <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9780071771474/sec31_chap11.html#:~:text=Most%20commonly%20these%20functions%20are,traffic%20shaping%2C%20and%20so%20on." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/comptia-security-all-in-one/9780071771474/sec31_chap11.html%23:~:text%3DMost%2520commonly%2520these%2520functions%2520are,traffic%2520shaping%252C%2520and%2520so%2520on.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451597000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFpf_vRmRuAZU-xsU1xU8z098TUzg">single security solution</a> to cover multiple functions, like their VPN, firewall, monitoring solution and network segmentation device. But then you have a single point of failure. If the box stops working (or is hacked), everything fails.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From a structural standpoint, it’s hard to have something like SolarWinds be a point of compromise and not have wide-reaching effects. But if you trusted Solarwind’s Orion platform to talk to and integrate with everything in your environment, then you took the risk that a breach like this wouldn’t happen. When I think about utilizing any tool (or service) one question I always ask is, &#8220;When this thing fails, or is hacked, how will I know and what will I do?&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes the answer might be as simple as, &#8220;That’s an insurance-level event,&#8221; but more often I’m thinking about other ways to get some signal to the defenders. In this case, when Solarwinds is the vector, will something else in my stack still give me an indication that my network is spewing traffic to Russia?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Architecting a <a href="https://www.randori.com/build-security-programs-resilient-to-risk-not-the-latest-vulnerability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.randori.com/build-security-programs-resilient-to-risk-not-the-latest-vulnerability/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiyxMKF05pAyRbJr5PP2BkNc_VvQ">resilient security program</a> isn’t easy; in fact, it&#8217;s a really hard problem to solve. No product or vendor is perfect, that’s been proven time and again. You need to have controls layered on top of each other. Run through “what happens” scenarios. Organizations focusing on defense in depth, and defending forward, will be in a more resilient position. How many failures does it take for a hacker to get to the goods? It should take more than one mishap for critical data to end up in Russia&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s critical to think in terms of <a href="https://hexadecimoose.medium.com/hackers-arent-magicians-they-just-know-the-right-questions-to-ask-75ea320faf61?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hexadecimoose.medium.com/hackers-arent-magicians-they-just-know-the-right-questions-to-ask-75ea320faf61?source%3Dyour_stories_page-------------------------------------&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP-A5c64fpxryWxVsVDqeaH8K5VQ">probability and likelihood</a> and put controls in place to prevent accidental changes to baseline security. Least privilege should be the default, and lots of segmenting should prevent rapid lateral motion. Monitoring and alerting should trigger responses, and if any wild deviations occur, the fail safes should activate. Run a red-team security program, see how well you stack up and learn from your mistakes.</p>
<div>
<p>Much was made of the security impacts of the FireEye breach. In reality, Russia already has tools commensurate to those taken from FireEye. So while pundits might like to make a big story out of the tools themselves, this is not likely to be reminiscent of other leaks, such as those of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608238451598000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuz-4o1RtzkYeBOaksgwWk9LI7vQ">NSA tools</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>The exploits released from the NSA were remarkable and immediately useful for adversaries to use, and those exploits were responsible for temporarily increased risk the industry experienced after the Shadow Brokers hack  —  it wasn’t the rootkits and malware (which were what was stolen at FireEye). In the FireEye case, since it appears there were no zero-days or exploits taken, I don’t expect that breach to cause significant shockwaves.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Breaches of this magnitude are going to happen. If they’re something your organization needs to be resilient against, then it’s best to be prepared for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever heard someone refer to the idea of &#8220;working in space,&#8221; you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking they were describing a science-fiction plot. But the number of humans actively working beyond Earth&#8217;s atmosphere &#8212; and living significant chunks of their lives there, too &#8212; is about to start growing at a potentially exponential rate. Given how small that population is now, the growth might look slow at first &#8212; but it&#8217;s happening soon, and plans are in place to help it start ramping up quickly.</p>
<p>The main company leading those plans in the near-term is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/axiom-space" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="axiom-space">Axiom Space, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a private space station service provider, and eventual operator. Axiom is founded and led by people with International Space Station experience and expertise, and the company already operates R&amp;D missions on behalf of private clients on the ISS with the help of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nasa" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nasa">NASA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> astronauts. It&#8217;s planning to begin shuttling entire flights of private astronauts to the station starting in 2021, and it&#8217;s also building a new, commercial space station to ultimately replace the ISS on orbit once that one is decommissioned.</p>
<p>Axiom Space&#8217;s Chief Business Office Amir Blachman joined us at TC Sessions: Space last week on a panel that included NASA Chief of Exploration and Mission Planning <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nujoud Merancy</span>, Sierra Nevada Corporation senior vice president and former astronaut Janet Kavandi, as well as Space Exploration Architecture (SEArch+) co-founder Melodie Yashar. The panel was focused on how public and private entities are preparing for a (relatively near) future in which humans spend more time off Earth &#8212; and further away from it, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>
		<div class="embed breakout" id="vidible_div_0" data-pid="56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a" data-bcid="564f313b67b6231408bc51ee" data-video="5fdbca1ef6a45d2d1fc0680f"></div>
		<span><script type="text/javascript" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch-2017/features/shortcodes/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0"></script></span>
		</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now, it&#8217;s been now for a couple years already,&#8221; Blachman said, in response to a question about how far off humans beyond NASA astronauts living in space actually is. &#8220;Axiom, sends crews to the International Space Station today on our own missions, while we&#8217;re building the new commercial space station that will succeed ISS when it&#8217;s decommissioned. Our first mission with a crew of four astronauts launches 12 months from now, and the four crew members have already gone through medical, they&#8217;ve done their suit fittings, we&#8217;ve already integrated our medical operations and training team with our launch provider. We&#8217;ll launch that crew in 2021, another crew in 2022, two crews and 2023, four in 2024 &#8212; and it grows from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Blachman and Merancy talked about the importance of automation and robotic systems on both Axiom&#8217;s future commercial space stations and on NASA&#8217;s future habitats on the lunar surface, and on the lunar Gateway that will remain in orbit around the moon and act as a staging ground for lunar missions.</p>
<p>&#8220;ISS was meant to be tended all the time,&#8221; Merancy said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not meant to be an uncrewed station. And while the flight controllers on the ground do a lot of the actual operation of it, it&#8217;s meant to have people there to perform maintenance. We don&#8217;t have that luxury, when you start talking about the lunar architecture, the Gateway will be tended only when the crew arrives, and the stuff on the surface will be tended only for, you know, a week at first and then longer over time. But you still want to have all of those things be capable of doing useful science or useful exploration even without the crew. So the ability to do tele robotics, maintain things via ground command and things like that so that when the crew arrives, they can just throw the hatch open and get to work would be the ideal state.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working under the assumption that these habitats and critical infrastructure on Mars, and now more recently on the moon should be constructed, and should be thought of as being constructed, as autonomously as possible,&#8221; Yashar added. &#8220;So we typically design for precursor missions, which would happen even before a crew arrives, hoping that almost all of the systems through construction, materials, excavation, materials handling and all of the other systems that we&#8217;ve been looking at would more or less happen as autonomously as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kavandi, too, echoed the sentiments of the others with regards to the degree to which modern human space systems will incorporate automation. I asked whether that would introduce complexity, but she said that rather, it should accomplish the opposite. Somewhat ironically, the path forward for human activity in space actually involves a lot less human activity &#8212; at least when it comes to the business of operating and maintaining in-space infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advanced technology things can sometimes add simplicity,&#8221; Kavandi said. &#8220;As we&#8217;ve increased our capabilities over the years, with computers, for instance, they&#8217;ve become easier to use, not harder to use. The objective is to try to minimize crew time and crew maintenance so that you can concentrate your time, your time for doing research, or whatever it is that you&#8217;re supposed to do up there, whatever your mission happens to be. So the more we can simplify the interfaces, the more that we can have automation, where the crew only has to intervene when something is going wrong, but generally things go smoothly, and they don&#8217;t have to do anything, that is an ideal situation. And in that case, you have a lot more free time available to then actually do the work that you&#8217;re up there for.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This is probably the biggest energy bill we’ve seen in a decade,&#8221; said policy analyst<a href="https://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/people/leah-stokes"> Dr. Leah Stokes</a>, an Assistant Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  </span></p>
<p>The spending is split between the Energy Act of 2020 and the Energy for the Environment Act, and both include new money for big technology initiatives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[The Energy Act of 2020] is a bipartisan, bicameral energy innovation package that authorizes over $35 billion in RD&amp;D activities across DOE&#8217;s portfolio and strengthens or creates programs crucial to advancing new technologies into the market,&#8221; a summary document for the legislation reads.</p>
<p>Included in the spending package is more than $4.1 billion for new technology initiatives.</p>
<p>The biggest winners are photovoltaics, new transportation technologies and energy-efficiency technologies.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$1.5 billion for new solar technologies including modules, concentrating solar technology, new photovoltaic technologies and initiatives to expand solar manufacturing and recycling technologies. And $2.6 billion set aside for transportation technologies. Finally, energy-efficiency and weatherization programs are continuing to be supported through a $1.7 billion reauthorization of the Weatherization Assistance Program. </span></p>
<p>Energy-grid technologies get a $3.44 billion boost through $1.08 billion in support for short-term, long-term, seasonal and transportation energy storage technologies and $2.36 billion for smart utility and energy distribution technologies. <i></i></p>
<p>Another $625 million is dedicated to new research, development and commercialization for both onshore and offshore wind technologies. And $850 million is being set aside for geothermal technology development and $933 million for marine energy and hydropower tech. Finally, there&#8217;s $160 million earmarked for hydropower generator upgrades, and <span style="font-weight: 400;">upgrades to existing federal infrastructure through $180 million earmarked to the Federal Energy Management Program. </span></p>
<p>In an attempt to ensure that the money and innovation is used in the industries where decarbonization is the most technically challenging, there&#8217;s a $500 million pot for stakeholders in industries like iron, steel, aluminum, cement and chemicals as well as transportation businesses like shipping, aviation and long-distance transport that are looking to decarbonize.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By making these critical investments now, the Energy Act of 2020 will help &#8220;reduce our nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, bring good-paying jobs back to the United States, and allow us to export these technologies to growing markets abroad for years to come,&#8221; the summary report reads. </span></p>
<p>If the next generation of technologies that already have broad commercial support is one area getting a boost, then another big pool of money is going to support the commercialization of technologies whose viability has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale.</p>
<p>These include carbon capture utilization and storage technologies that are getting a $6.2 billion boost for roll out at industrial and energy sites. Congress is also approving a $447 million research and development program for large-scale commercial carbon dioxide removal projects &#8212; with a $100 million carve out grant for direct air capture competition at facilities that capture at least 50,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.</p>
<p>Nuclear technologies are also getting their day in the sun thanks to $6.6 billion in funding for the modernization of existing nuclear power plants and the development of advanced reactors. And, the nascent fusion industry can add another $4.7 billion to their calculus for available capital thanks to a carve out for basic and applied research investments.</p>
<p>All of this spending also comes with money to ensure that emerging technologies aren&#8217;t left out. There&#8217;s a $2.9 billion allocation to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arpa-e" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arpa-e">ARPA-E, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the energy advanced research arm of the government whose structure is similar to the DARPA program that was responsible for the development of the internet. And, taking a page from the NASA playbook that commercialized a number of technologies, the Office of Technology Transitions, which promotes national lab partnerships, is being codified and supporting the kind of milestone-based projects that have been effectively used by the Air Force and the Department of Defense broadly.</p>
<p>To cap it off, the new energy bill includes a directive to the Department of the Interior to target the generation of 25 gigawatts of solar, wind and geothermal production on public lands by 2025.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My understanding of it is that they’re trying to look at what the federal government has done for solar and wind and see how we can do that for other technologies,&#8221; Stokes said. </span></p>
<p>For her, what&#8217;s in other portions of the stimulus are equally important from a climate perspective. There&#8217;s a commitment to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, a huge contributor to global warming and climate change by 2035. Phasing out the use of these chemicals globally in refrigeration and other applications could reduce warming by half a degree centigrade (which is a big deal).</p>
<p>Stokes took issue with the duration of some of the tax credits, whose extensions were relatively short, and the absence of a tax credit for electric vehicles. &#8220;The tax credits for EVs are a consumer-facing benefit that are absolutely critical to adoption,&#8221; Stokes said. &#8220;That was a massive equalizer between EVs and combustion engine cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all of the good news for climate activists baked into this portion of the stimulus, Stokes warns that no one concerned about global climate change should break out the bubbly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This package is not going to solve the climate crisis full-stop,&#8221; Stokes said. &#8220;Next year if the Republicans are in control there’s going to be a new chairman and he’s not going to be as generous&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to learn to celebrate the wins and give credit but recognize what’s missing. Which is a lot.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is rolling out new features to its developer community with an update to its recently rebuilt Twitter API. One addition to the now expanded collection of API v2 endpoints will allow app developers to eventually better support Twitter&#8217;s newer conversation controls &#8212; the feature that allows users to specify who can reply to their tweets. Other endpoints allow developers to track tweets by particular accounts, those mentioning a certain account, or retrieve a list of accounts who follow a particular user.</p>
<p>The new endpoints are a continuation of Twitter&#8217;s work on <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/introducing_new_twitter_api.html">version 2 of its developer API</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/"> first introduced this June</a>. The API was rebuilt for the first time since 2012 with a goal of including features that had been missing from the earlier version, like polls, pinned tweets and spam filtering, for example, while also rolling out improvements to areas like search and stream filtering.</p>
<p>But Twitter&#8217;s API continues to be a work in progress, as Twitter adds endpoints and further fleshes out its tiered access plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1ADBwO3Dso"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/">Twitter introduces a new, fully rebuilt developer API, launching next week</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter introduces a new, fully rebuilt developer API, launching next week&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/embed/#?secret=1ADBwO3Dso" data-secret="1ADBwO3Dso" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In this release, Twitter is adding some <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/conversation-reply-settings-tweet-field/147169">support for the conversation settings</a> introduced <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you.html">earlier this year</a>. This feature allows users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">choose who can respond</a> to their tweets. On Twitter, users can opt to allow everyone to reply, or they can limit replies only to those they follow or even just the people mentioned in the tweet. These conversation controls are now partially supported in the new API as well, through a field in the Tweet object called reply_settings. The addition will allow developers to tell if the conversation reply settings have been set for a tweet, and if so, who can reply. However, Twitter has not yet writen support for these fields, which Twitter says is coming &#8220;in the future.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MHx7Lco0RS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">Twitter now lets everyone limit replies to their tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter now lets everyone limit replies to their tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/embed/#?secret=MHx7Lco0RS" data-secret="MHx7Lco0RS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Eventually, a feature like this may allow third-party apps to better mimic the first-party experience on Twitter.com and in Twitter&#8217;s own native apps. It could also help developers build out social listening apps that only pull in those tweets a social media manager is able to reply to, noted SocialOpinions developer Jamie Maguire, in a Twitter post. Twitter also suggests it could be useful for researchers looking to learn more about the public conversation.</p>
<p>The feature is fully rolled out to v2, Twitter says.</p>
<p>Another set of endpoints, <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/user-tweet-timeline-and-user-mention-timeline-endpoints-available-for-early-access-in-the-twitter-api-v2/147115">user tweet timeline and user mention timelines</a>, return a collection of tweets either composed by or those mentioning a specific Twitter user. Now, these endpoints can also specify the start_time and end_time parameters, meaning they can be used to collect tweets during a certain window of time. The &#8220;user mention timeline&#8221; endpoint also now supports application-only authentication, which Twitter says will make it easier for developers or researchers analyzing a given account.</p>
<p>The company notes these had been two of the most heavily used endpoints in the first version of the API, as they allow for tools in areas like customer support, brand analysis and those that measure a Twitter user&#8217;s sentiment over time.</p>
<p>At launch, developers can request up to 100 tweets per request. The user tweet timeline endpoint is limited to the 3,200 most recent tweets, and the user mention timeline is limited to the 800 most recent tweets. Both will count toward the monthly tweet <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview">cap</a> on Standard Basic access, which is 500,000. This limit is not permanent &#8212; Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/community/2020/future-of-twitter-developer-platform.html">has said before</a> it plans to offer Elevated access to the Twitter API v2 in the Standard product track sometime next year, and businesses can sign up for that free beta <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/business/business-beta">here</a>.</p>
<p>These are available in Early Access to the Twitter API v2.</p>
<p>Twitter also this week launched <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/introducing-the-v2-follow-lookup-endpoints/147118">two new follows lookup endpoints</a>, also in Early Access, that allow developers to retrieve a list of accounts who follow a particular person, or pull the list of accounts that someone follows. These are often used by developers who want to understand how accounts on Twitter are linked for the purpose of network analysis or in the examination of the spread of information or misinformation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Developers had told Twitter they wanted to be able to pull rich information about an account&#8217;s relationships without having to make additional calls to look up that account data. These endpoints allow developers to pull the profile information about an account&#8217;s follows in just one request, instead of numerous calls using prior versions of the Twitter API.</p>
<p>These endpoints are often used alongside the endpoints that allow you to follow and unfollow accounts, as well as block and mute accounts. However, that functionality is not yet available.</p>
<p>Twitter committed to more transparency around its API changes and updates this time, but developers may still be wary of building on the platform because of Twitter&#8217;s history. The company in past years repeatedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-client-apps/?_ga=2.28353205.886042617.1594643608-1783005191.1582664406">pulled the rug out from developers</a> building Twitter apps, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/11/twitter-cuts-off-datasift-to-step-up-its-own-b2b-big-data-analytics-business/?_ga=2.165481334.874764968.1560172608-65650910.1541640065">cutting off access to partners</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/11/13250450/twitter-flight-developer-conference-2016">canceling</a> its developer conference. These moves aren&#8217;t easily forgotten.</p>
<p>Twitter had announced the API changes through <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev">tweets</a> and <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/c/announcements/22">forum posts</a> late last week. The company&#8217;s longer-term developer platform road map is also available publicly <a href="https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-developer-platform-roadmap">here</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Silicon Valley has a unicorn problem.</p>
<p>While no one is calling for startups with high valuations to go extinct, there ought to be a lot fewer of them. At least that’s what many young founders have concluded after looking at the trials and travails of <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">billion-plus-dollar private companies</a>.</p>
<p>A unicorn is a mythical animal, so investors expect magical results: Lightning growth, near-monopolies and a record-setter IPO yielding 100x or 1,000x returns. A “zebra” company is different. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zebranow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zebranow">Zebras <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are real animals that have evolved to fill and thrive in a particular niche. Unlike unicorn companies, zebras are lean, efficient and consistent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Exponential growth is neither the best nor the only way for businesses to operate.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Too often, a company’s name or perceived cachet — rather than its actual product or realistic business prospects — becomes the thing it is selling. For the most recent, and maybe most damning, example of this trend, look at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wework-857c" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wework-857c">WeWork <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The company’s 2019 failed IPO was the corporate debacle of the decade; few businesses since Enron have fallen so far so quickly. When the market got a chance to examine the unicorn, they discovered it was really a one-trick pony with a cardboard horn. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/adam-neumann-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="adam-neumann-2">Adam Neumann <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> built his company for net worth, not actual value, and his employees and supporters paid the price. Then again, imagine if the IPO had been a success: How much of the company’s worth would have evaporated when COVID-19 rolled around in March?</p>
<p>Although most tech innovation requires venture capital in today’s economy, unicorns sometimes become case studies in taking too much of a good thing. Round after round of funding can, as in the case of WeWork, disguise rickety foundations and unsound business plans.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the mobile video unicorn <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/quibi-to-shut-down-after-just-6-months.html">Quibi folded</a> less than a year after its launch. Film and TV critics weren’t surprised, and neither were those few consumers who’d heard of the company.</p>
<p>Well before its ill-timed launch in early April, most observers knew it was a bad idea. So why did <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quibi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quibi">Quibi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> receive so much funding? The big names attached to the company, including Dreamworks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and one-time HP CEO Meg Whitman, attracted investors who somehow didn’t realize that everything about the product, from its name to its pricing, was wrong.</p>
<p>What a unicorn offers isn’t as important as the fact that it’s a unicorn. The opposite of a unicorn company, to my mind, is a zebra company. They may be a little odd, they may not get the front-page headlines or breathless news coverage, but they’re built to last and built to do something.</p>
<p>Unicorns thrive so long as they remain in the enchanted forest of endless venture rounds; zebras tough it out in the savannas of the free market. A zebra company won’t become the next behemoth like Facebook or Amazon, but neither will it become the next Quibi or WeWork.</p>
<p>The emergence of zebra companies like Handshake and Turo, and to some extent corporations like Ben and Jerry’s and Patagonia, speaks to a broader change in our business and economic understanding. Even before the coronavirus shut down much of the world, endless growth was looking less and less attractive.</p>
<p>Instead of extracting ever more value from the economy, companies like Patreon realize that the same dollar can be earned multiple times as it circulates through the economy. One-way extraction of value is replaced with a circular flow of value. Exponential growth is neither the best nor the only way for businesses to operate.</p>
<p>For most of us, the new year will be a relief: 2020, over at last. But we shouldn’t neglect the opportunity to reflect on the past and plan for the future that a new year offers. The mistakes of WeWork and Quibi are all too easy to repeat; chances are that somewhere in Silicon Valley, a venture capitalist is giving too much money to a doomed business. We’ve been too focused on the unicorns. It’s time to give the zebras the attention they deserve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups have been massively successful over the past few years. The biggest consumer startups managed to attract millions — sometimes even tens of millions — of users and have raised some of the biggest funding rounds in late-stage venture capital. That’s why they’ve also reached incredible valuations.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			After a few wild years of growth, fintech startups are starting to act more like traditional finance companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>And yet, this year’s economic downturn has been a challenge for the current class of fintech startups: Some have grown nicely, while others have struggled, but the vast majority of them have changed their focus.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, fintech startups have been drawing a path to profitability. It doesn’t mean that they’ll have a positive bottom line at the end of 2020. But they’ve laid out the core products that will secure those startups over the long term.</p>
<h2>Consumer fintech startups are focusing on product first, growth second</h2>
<p>Usage of consumer products vary greatly with its users. And when you’re growing rapidly, supporting growth and opening new markets require a ton of effort. You have to onboard new employees constantly and your focus is split between product and corporate organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is the leading peer-to-peer payments app in France. It has four million users in Europe with most of them in its home country. For the past few years, the startup has been growing rapidly; engagement drives user signups, which drives engagement.</p>
<p>But what do you do when users stop using your product? “In April, the number of transactions was down 70%,” said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lydia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lydia">Lydia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche in a phone interview.</p>
<p>“As for usage, it was obviously very quiet during some months and euphoric during other months,” he said. Overall, Lydia grew its user base by 50% in 2020 compared to 2019. When France wasn’t experiencing a lockdown or a curfew, the company beat its all-time high records across various metrics.</p>
<p>“In 2019, we grew all year long. In 2020, we’ve had very good growth numbers overall — but it should have been amazingly good during a normal year, without the month of March, April, May, November.” Chiche said.</p>
<p>In March and early April, Chiche didn’t know whether users would come back and send money using Lydia. Back in January, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mobile-payment-app-lydia-raises-45-million-round-led-by-tencent/">raised money from Tencent</a>, the company behind WeChat Pay. “Tencent was ahead of us in China when it comes to lockdown,” Chiche said.</p>
<p>On April 30, during a board meeting, Tencent listed Lydia’s priorities for the rest of the year: Ship as many product updates as possible, keep an eye on their burn rate without firing people and prioritize product updates to reflect what people want.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked hard and shipped everything related to card payments, contactless mobile payments and virtual cards. It reflected the huge boost in contactless and e-commerce transactions,” Chiche said.</p>
<p>And it also repositioned the company’s trajectory to reach profitability more quickly. “The next step is bringing Lydia to profitability and it’s something that has always been important for us,” Chiche said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobile payment app Lydia raises $45 million round led by Tencent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mobile-payment-app-lydia-raises-45-million-round-led-by-tencent/embed/#?secret=N3noeswrqV" data-secret="N3noeswrqV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Let’s list the most frequent revenue sources for consumer fintech startups such as challenger banks, peer-to-peer payment apps and stock-trading apps can be divided into three cohorts:</p>
<h3><strong>Debit cards</strong></h3>
<p>First, many companies hand customers a debit card when they create an account. Sometimes, it’s just a virtual card that they can use with Apple Pay or Google Pay. While there are some fees involved with card issuance, it also represents a revenue stream.</p>
<p>When people pay with their card, Visa or Mastercard takes a cut of each transaction. They return a portion to the financial company that issued the card. Those interchange fees are ridiculously small and often represent a few cents. But they can add up when you have millions of users actively using your cards to transfer money out of their accounts.</p>
<h3><strong>Paid financial products</strong></h3>
<p>Many fintech companies, such as Revolut and Ant Group’s Alipay, are developing superapps to serve as financial hubs that cover all your needs. Popular superapps include Grab, Gojek and WeChat.</p>
<p>In some cases, they have their own paid products. But in most cases, they partner with specialized fintech companies to provide additional services. Sometimes, they are perfectly integrated in the app. For instance, this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/paypal-to-let-you-buy-and-sell-cryptocurrencies-in-the-us/">PayPal</a> has partnered with <a href="https://www.paxos.com">Paxos</a> so that you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies from their apps. PayPal doesn’t run a cryptocurrency exchange, it takes a cut on fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space may be the final frontier, but in terms of investment, VCs are just getting started. With that in mind during TC Sessions: Space 2020 last week, we spoke to three investors who&#8217;ve been actively funding what could become tomorrow&#8217;s biggest companies to learn where they might focus next.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Sustainability is a major issue for all of their portfolio companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our guests &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tess-hatch" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tess-hatch">Tess Hatch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of Bessemer Venture Partners, who has long focused on the commercialization of space; Mike Collett of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/promus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="promus-ventures">Promus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a venture firm that invests in deep tech software and hardware companies; and Chris Boshuizen of the venture firm DCVC and a cofounder of Planet Labs &#8212; had a lot of intriguing observations on topics, including the dangers of orbital debris, the merits of space manufacturing, and how they&#8217;d rate the U.S. government when it comes to fostering space-related innovations.</p>
<p>For those who missed the event, we&#8217;ve posted a video of our conversation below.</p>
<h2>Space junk could affect long-term sustainability</h2>
<p>Hatch, who recently co-authored an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/"> informative piece</a> on the topic, said there&#8217;s little consensus about whether space junk is a critical matter that deserves more regulatory attention or an issue that will resolve itself through tech advancements, even while startups like <a href="https://astroscale.com/">Astroscale</a> and <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a> are focused on the issue. The commercial industry&#8217;s expectation seems to be that space companies can regulate themselves and launch constellations without leaving pieces of launch vehicles or rocket stages in space, she said.</p>
<p>For her part, Hatch said it&#8217;s something to potentially invest in within a &#8220;handful of years.&#8221; At the moment, she added, &#8220;it&#8217;s not at the top of my list just due to looking for a shorter return on my investment for my LPs in the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Collett and the others stressed that in the meantime, sustainability is a major issue for all of their portfolio companies. &#8220;Everybody wants to do their job as a corporate citizen to make sure they&#8217;re not leaving anything else up there that doesn&#8217;t need to be there. Indeed, Boshuizen noted that at Planet Labs, best practices were taken very seriously.</p>
<p>Still, Boshuizen noted concerns about newer capital sources that might be less focused on the issue of space debris. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think everyone necessarily has the same space background,&#8221; he said, explaining that &#8220;we&#8217;re seeing a lot of outside investment from new people joining the industry, which is exciting, but also they don&#8217;t really know how important this is [and] it&#8217;s important for people to realize that they&#8217;ve got to pay attention to this.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

To cap off the year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cloud today <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-cloud-announces-new-regions">announced</a> a new set of cloud regions, which will go live in the coming months and years. These new regions, which will all have three availability zones, will be in Chile, Germany and Saudi Arabia. That&#8217;s on top of the regions in Indonesia, South Korea, the U.S. (Las Vegas and Salt Lake City) that went live this year &#8212; and the upcoming regions in France, Italy, Qatar and Spain the company also announced over the course of the last twelve months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089793" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089793" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png" alt="" width="882" height="464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2089793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In total, Google currently operates 24 regions with 73 availability zones, not counting those it has announced but that aren&#8217;t live yet. While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Azure is well ahead of the competition in terms of the total number of regions (though some still lack availability zones), Google is now starting to pull even with AWS, which currently offers 24 regions with a total of 77 availability zones. Indeed, with its 12 announced regions, Google Cloud may actually soon pull ahead of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is currently working on six new regions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The battleground may soon shift away from these large data centers, though, with a new focus on edge zones close to urban centers that are smaller than the full-blown data centers the large clouds currently operate but that allow businesses to host their services even closer to their customers.</p>
<p>All of this is a clear sign of how much Google has invested in its cloud strategy in recent years. For the longest time, after all, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google-cloud-platform" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google-cloud-platform">Google Cloud Platform <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> lagged well behind its competitors. Only three years ago, Google Cloud offered only 13 regions, for example. And that&#8217;s on top of the company&#8217;s heavy investment in submarine cables and edge locations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bolt.com/">Bolt</a>, a startup that offers online checkout technology to retailers, announced this morning that it has added $75 million to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/bolt-5-series-c--fdcb8cc8">its Series C round</a>, bringing the financing to a total of $125 million.</p>
<p>WestCap and General Atlantic led the new tranche, which Bolt CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanBreslow">Ryan Breslow</a> told TechCrunch was raised at around twice its Series C valuation. PitchBook pegs the company&#8217;s Series C at a post-money valuation of $500 million, implying that the Series C1 values Bolt at around $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company is calling the latest check its &#8220;Series C1.&#8221; Why not just call it a Series D? According to Breslow, Bolt&#8217;s future Series D will be much larger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Bolt&#8217;s creatively demarcated Series C1 is interesting, the capital event is in line with how the checkout space is growing in aggregate right now. There&#8217;s a lot of money being put to work on solving a particular e-commerce pain point.</p>

<p>But enough talking about its market. Let&#8217;s dig into what Bolt is building and why it just took on another truckload of cash.</p>
<h2>Series C1</h2>
<p>Bolt offers four connected services: checkout, payments, user accounts and fraud protection.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s core offering is its checkout product, which it claims is both faster than comparable industry averages and has higher conversion rates. The startup&#8217;s payments and fraud services fits into its checkout universe by ensuring that transactions are real and that payments can be accepted. Finally, Bolt&#8217;s user accounts (shoppers are prompted to save their credentials when they first execute a purchase with the startup&#8217;s tech) boost the chance that someone who has checked out online using its tech will do so again in the future, helping Bolt to sell its service and ensure customers benefit from it.</p>
<p>The more shoppers that Bolt can attract, the more accounts it will have in the market feeding more data into its anti-fraud tool and checkout personalization technology.</p>
<p>And Bolt is reaching more online buyers, with the company claiming a roughly 10x gain of the number of people who have made accounts with its service this year. According to Breslow, the number was around 450,000 last December. It&#8217;s around 4.5 million now, he said, and Bolt expects the figure to reach 30 million next year.</p>
<p>Given the huge scale of its expected account creation, TechCrunch asked Breslow about his confidence interval in the number. He said 90%, thanks to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) linking up with Bolt, a deal that his company <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/authentic_brands_group_partners_with_bolt_to_power_forever_21s_online_checkout_experience/prweb17554634.htm">announced</a> last month. Breslow said that ABG has 50 million shoppers; perhaps the 30 million figure is possible.</p>
<p>(Distribution for checkout tech is like oxygen, so competing companies in the space love to chat about their availability gains. Here&#8217;s Fast talking about being <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fast-opens-up-payments-technology-to-woocommerce-enabling-one-click-checkout-for-millions-of-new-online-sellers-301191902.html">supported by WooCommerce</a> from last week, for example. Fast declined to share processing growth metrics with TechCrunch after that announcement.)</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s historical shopper growth has paid dividends for its total transaction volume. The company told TechCrunch that it processed around $1 billion in transactions this year, up around 3.5x from its 2019 gross merchandise volume (GMV). That approximate pace of growth implies a roughly $286 million GMV result for Bolt last year; how far the company can scale that figure in 2021 will be our chief measuring stick for how well its ABG deal performs.</p>
<p>Breslow told TechCrunch that Bolt expects to 3x its GMV in 2021, which we read as implying a roughly $3 billion number.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t just take that figure, apply a payment processing percentage and walk away with a revenue guess for Bolt. The company does make money from payments, but also from charging for its other services &#8212; like fraud protection &#8212; on a SaaS basis. So Bolt is a hybrid payments-and-software company, an increasingly popular model, though one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">that certain categories of software</a> are slow to pick up on.</p>
<p>Underpinning Bolt&#8217;s plans to treble GMV and greatly expand its shopper network is its new capital. The $75 million cache of new dollars is going into handling market demand, moving upmarket and engineering, the company said. In short there&#8217;s a lot of in-market demand for better checkout tech &#8212; hence all the venture activity &#8212; and larger customers need more customizations and sales support. Bolt is going to spend on that.</p>
<p>Given that Bolt just reloaded, it would not be a surprise to see Fast or Checkout.com raise more capital in Q1 or Q2 of 2021. More when that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Saturday in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I asked you last week to share your picks for the biggest stories of the year. While there was a mix, two startup-focused themes emerged: COVID-19 and the pressure it put on companies, as well as the unexpected flurry of deals that occurred despite the pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SPACs, Tesla&#8217;s skyrocketing share price, Waymo&#8217;s driverless ride-hailing service opening up to the public in the Phoenix area, Uber&#8217;s 2020 evolution (which I addressed last weekend) and Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Zoox also made the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Speaking of Zoox, I posted an article last week of my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/">interview with Jesse Levinson</a>, the co-founder and CTO of Zoox. Access to the article requires an EC subscription, so I&#8217;ll offer a nugget here that I thought was new and interesting.</span></p>
<p>I asked Levinson what his hope was at the federal level? Specifically, if he sees real guidelines being formalized? Here&#8217;s the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: Well, we&#8217;re actually in good shape from a federal perspective. We have designed our vehicle to comply with the FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) and we are crash testing our vehicle to all of those standards. We&#8217;ve actually attempted most of them and passed every one that we&#8217;ve attempted, so you know, really we&#8217;re not actually blocked on the federal level.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see what happens with the new administration and what the future of regulations brings but at this point we&#8217;re actually good to go.</p>
<p><strong>YOURS TRULY</strong>: Then you don&#8217;t need an exemption (federally)? You don&#8217;t have a steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: Yeah, we&#8217;ve designed our vehicle to be compliant with the FMVSS. And so we were not looking for an exemption approach.</p>
<p><strong>ME AGAIN</strong>: Is it because you&#8217;re going to be under 25 miles an hour? My understanding was that if you didn&#8217;t have a steering wheel that the vehicle wouldn&#8217;t comply. So how does that work?</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: I would just say that&#8217;s not our interpretation of the standards.</p>

<p>The end of 2020 has produced a string of acquisitions, mergers and fundraising rounds that seemed unlikely this spring as the COVID-19 pandemic spread volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots in 2020 was delivery. Startups focused on delivery — whether it is via trucking, autonomous bots or airborne devices like drones — managed to secure new funding while others struggled.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the pandemic didn&#8217;t delay or create obstacles for delivery startups. Take Indian food delivery company Zomato, for example.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The 12-year-old company did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">raise $660 million</a> in a Series J round this month. Tiger Global, Kora, Luxor, Fidelity (FMR), D1 Capital, Baillie Gifford, Mirae and Steadview participated in the round. Zomato now has post-money valuation of $3.9 billion.</p>
<p>However, Zomato originally anticipated to close the round 11 months ago. Several obstacles, including the current pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">delayed the fundraise effort</a>. Ant Financial, which had originally committed to invest $150 million in this round, only delivered a third of it.</p>

<p>More money appears to be headed toward Zomato, which is preparing to go public in 2021. Zomato co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said the company is also in the process of closing a $140 million secondary transaction.</p>
<p>Zomato, which acquired <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Indian-based food delivery business early this year, has good reason to stack its coffers. The company faces a fight for market share with rival Swiggy and a new emerging threat of Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AutoLeap</strong>, a six-month-old, Toronto-based startup, revealed that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">raised $5 million</a> in seed funding in September, led by Threshold Ventures. The round also included individual investors Shift co-founder George Arison, former General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner and former senior Bridgestone exec Ned Aguilar.</p>
<p><strong>Bolt</strong>, the Estonian startup that&#8217;s building an on-demand network to move food and people around in cars, on scooters and on bikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">raised €150 million</a> ($182 million at current rates) in an equity round. CEO and co-founder Markus Villig has growth on the brain. He told TechCrunch that Bolt, which already covers 200 cities in 40 countries, will use the new funds to expand geographically with an aim to become the biggest provider of electric scooters in Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Boom Supersonic</strong> raised $50 million in new funding led by WRVI Capital for a post-money valuation of more than $1 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/supersonic-jet-startup-boom-technology-is-now-a-unicorn">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo.one</strong>, the air cargo booking platform, <a href="https://www.cargo.one/press/series-b-announcement">raised $42 million</a> in a Series B funding round that was led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Existing investors Creandum, Index Ventures, Next47 and Point Nine also participated in the round. The company raised $18 million in a Series A round earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>CarGurus</strong>, the online automotive marketplace, agreed to acquire a 51% interest in Plano, Texas-based CarOffer at an enterprise valuation of $275 million. Under the deal, CarGurus has the option to buy the remaining equity interest in the company over the next three years. CarOffer is an automated instant vehicle trade platform that offers an alternative to the traditional wholesale auction model.</p>
<p><strong>GoFor Industries</strong>, a Canadian delivery company, raised CA$20 million in a Series A round that will be used to drive its expansion into the United States, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/canadian-last-mile-delivery-startup-closes-20m-cad-series-a">Freightwaves reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Motorq</strong>, the connected car API company, raised $7 million in a Series A round of funding led by Story Ventures with participation from existing investors FM Capital and Monta Vista Capital. A new strategic investor, Avanta Ventures, the investment arm of CSAA, also joined the round.</p>
<p>Motorq developed a cloud-based system that captures and then monitors embedded data from a vehicle&#8217;s onboard computers and then runs analytics and machine learning models on the data. Motorq says the system can help put those analytics into context, which can be combined with other information, and then sent to customers via application programming interfaces (APIs) and other tools. Data points include vehicle location, charge/fuel use, driver behavior, safety warnings, maintenance alerts and certain remote commands.</p>
<p><strong>Volcon ePowersports</strong> raised $2.5 million in public funding through the WeFunder platform. The company said it has raised more than $4.5 million since September through a seed round of funding and through WeFunder. The capital will be used to continue the build-out of Volcon&#8217;s production facilities and assembly lines. For the unfamiliar, Volcon is aiming to build and start deliveries of an all-electric off-road motorcycle called the Grunt in Spring 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Vroom</strong>, the online used-car company, has agreed to acquire Vast Holdings Inc., which includes Austin-based vehicle listings platform CarStory, for $120 million, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/vroom-agrees-buy-carstory-120-million?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">reported Automotive News</a>.</p>
<h2>Uber ATG-Aurora integration</h2>
<p>Autonomous vehicle company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> isn&#8217;t wasting any time integrating with Uber Advanced Technologies Group. As you might recall, just a week or so ago, Aurora announced that it was acquiring Uber&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary in a complex deal that will give the combined company a valuation of $10 billion.</p>
<p>Aurora CEO Chris Urmson sent offers via email Thursday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">more than 75% of employees</a> at Uber ATG, according to a source familiar with the post-acquisition integration process. That&#8217;s more than 850 employees. If every employee accepts, Aurora will more than double in size overnight.</p>

<p>Uber ATG Toronto, which employs about 50 people where the subsidiary conducted its research and development work, did not make the cut, according to a source. Nor has Uber ATG&#8217;s chief scientist Raquel Urtasun, who led the Uber ATG R&amp;D team. Urtasun, who is considered a leading expert in machine perception for self-driving cars, is also a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI.</p>
<p>News of the Toronto closure prompted a few venture capitalists and founders to share their surprise that Aurora wouldn&#8217;t have pinpointed Urtasun and the rest of the R&amp;D as some of the most desirable candidates to join the newly combined company. We don&#8217;t know if they did. Here&#8217;s what I can predict. If the texts and emails I received are any indication, Urtasun is already fielding offers from several other AV companies.</p>
<h2>One more policy thing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>A curious item popped up this week that certainly must have captured the attention of policy folks at any autonomous vehicle company planning to operate in the United States.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted a notice this week that offers a clarification to AV policy. Before I dig in, let me provide a brief overview of the law.</p>
<p>Today, a motor vehicle must comply with all federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), which set a minimum threshold of performance that a vehicle must meet. But once you determine that the &#8220;driver&#8221; can be a system of hardware and software (a simplification, I know) and not a human, it raises questions about whether a vehicle really needs the physical steering wheel and other traditional controls a robot simply has no use for.</p>
<p>This notice reverses prior statements that NHTSA made, most notably a letter of interpretation that the agency sent in 2016 to Chris Urmson, who at the time was heading up Google&#8217;s self-driving project.</p>
<p>The 2016 interpretation created a Catch-22 scenario for AV companies that wanted to use vehicles with novel designs like those that lacked a steering wheel or pedals. NHTSA said, at the time, that manufacturers had to certify that a motor vehicle complied with requirements of all applicable FMVSS and to design the vehicle in such a way that NHTSA would be able to conduct each element of each test procedure specified within each applicable regulation. But that was impossible because certain test conditions or procedures could not be conducted on the vehicle as specified in the FMVSS.</p>
<p>The only real path forward was for a company to ask for exemptions.</p>
<p>This notice not only acknowledges that the 2016 interpretation was too restrictive, it seems to have removed a major obstacle that will allow robotaxis to get on the road sooner.</p>
<p>And now suddenly, Levinson&#8217;s comments (yeah way back up at the top of this newsletter) make more sense. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28107.pdf">link to the notice</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> has been busy since it announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spin out its legacy infrastructure management business</a> in October, placing an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">all-in bet on the hybrid cloud</a>. Today, it built on that bet by acquiring Helsinki-based multi-cloud consulting firm <a href="https://nordcloud.com/">Nordcloud</a>. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nordcloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nordcloud">Nordcloud <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fits neatly into this strategy with 500 consultants certified in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform, giving the company a trained staff of experts to help as they move away from an <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-centric solution to choosing to work with the customer however they wish to implement their cloud strategy.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach harkens back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">the $34 billion Red Hat acquisition</a> in 2018, which is really the lynchpin for this approach, as CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC&#8217;s Jon Fortt <a href="https://www.cnbcevents.com/cnbc-evolve-summit/">in an interview last month</a>. Krishna is in the midst of trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">completely transform his organization</a>, and acquisitions like this are meant to speed up that process:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey. With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/embed/#?secret=V9tzjYrhWS" data-secret="V9tzjYrhWS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>John Granger, senior vice president for cloud application innovation and COO for IBM Global Business Services, says that IBM&#8217;s customers are increasingly looking for help managing resources across multiple vendors, as well as on premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM&#8217;s acquisition of Nordcloud adds the kind of deep expertise that will drive our clients’ digital transformations as well as support the further adoption of IBM&#8217;s hybrid cloud platform. Nordcloud’s cloud-native tools, methodologies and talent send a strong signal that IBM is committed to deliver our clients’ successful journey to cloud,&#8221; Granger said in a statement.</p>
<p>After the deal closes, which is expected in the first quarter next year subject to typical regulatory approvals, Nordcloud will become an IBM company and operate to help continue this strategy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this deal comes on the heels several other small recent deals, including <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-acquires-expertus-technologies-inc-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-digital-payment-solutions-301193468.html">acquiring Expertus</a> last week and <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-11-16-IBM-to-Acquire-SAP-Consulting-Partner-TruQua">Truqua</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">Instana</a> last month. These three companies provide expertise in digital payments, SAP consulting and hybrid cloud applications performance monitoring, respectively.</p>
<p>Nordcloud, which is based in Helsinki with offices in Amsterdam, was founded in 2011 and has raised more than $26 million, according to PitchBook data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government is one of the biggest spenders in the nascent space industry, and the man who handles the money for the Air Force&#8217;s $16 billion checkbook wants startups to know that his door is open for them.</p>
<p>In all, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/will-roper" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="will-roper">Will Roper, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, handles about $60 billion worth of budget for the Air Force &#8212; a mandate that includes spending money on the new tech initiatives the Air Force deems important.</p>
<p>Historically, the Department of Defense hasn&#8217;t been the greatest at working with startups &#8212; and many tech companies have been loath to work with the DoD. However, since much of modern civilian infrastructure is based on global positioning systems and other satellite technologies that fall under the Defense Department&#8217;s purview, those views on cooperation are changing on both sides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Space isn&#8217;t a quiet domain of communication and navigation and exploration anymore,&#8221; Roper told the audience at TechCrunch&#8217;s latest Sessions event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s increasingly becoming a hostile place&#8230; So we&#8217;re gearing up a new kind of competition on the military side that could extend to space and that&#8217;s creating a lot of new space programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roper emphasized that the interest from the Air Force and the government more broadly extends well beyond offensive capabilities and military priorities. As space becomes an economic opportunity, Roper sees the Air Force as an engine for driving technology development forward in ways that have commercial benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great, great time for innovation in new technologies that could help the military, but we want to do more than just help the military. That&#8217;s the old thinking in the Pentagon. That&#8217;s all that would help us win the Cold War in the 20th Century, but it&#8217;s not going to help us in the 21st, where technology is globalized and accelerating,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to find ways where our military mission and our funding can help accelerate commercial markets too, so it&#8217;s competing on a much bigger stage. But we think it&#8217;s where we need to aspire to be, so that we&#8217;re playing the right catalyst role in this nation and with our partners around the world,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>There are several programs that startups can tap to get those federal dollars. Two of the easiest points of entry are through the <a href="https://afwerx.com/">AFWERX</a> and its<a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2438536/spacewerx-launch-announced-during-afwerx-accelerate/"> recently announced SpaceWERX</a> arm focused entirely on space technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;These look like any tech company,&#8221; Roper told the audience at the TechCrunch event. &#8220;They&#8217;re outside our fence lines. They&#8217;re easy to walk into&#8230; Now you don&#8217;t have to know the mission, we will help you find the mission and the customer &#8212; the warfighter associated with it. It&#8217;s a great model because it keeps the company focused on what they know best, which is their tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the last three years, Roper estimated that the AFWERX program had brought 2,300 companies into the Air Force and Space Force programs, and most of them had never worked with the military before, he said.</p>
<p>Within AFWERX there are three programs that particularly relate to integrating startups into the procurement process, Roper said. One is the <a href="https://www.afwerx.af.mil/airmen-guide.html">Spark program</a>, which pairs military with private industry; one is the <a href="https://www.afwerx.af.mil/afventures.html">AFVentures</a> program, which is designed to finance new innovations coming from private industry; and finally there&#8217;s the Prime program, which helps commercialize and certify technologies.</p>
<p>Roper pointed to the recent certification the Air Force gave to Joby Aviation for its flying cars. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a new military market that will hopefully generate a new commercial market,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Prime program will expand to space technologies, according to Roper.</p>
<p>As the demand for new tech grows, there&#8217;s no shortage of innovations Roper would like to see from private industry. From new autonomous innovations that could help co-pilot spacecraft to technology for refueling and in-space maneuverability, and reusable equipment from boosters to other components that can bring costs down.</p>
<p>Roper also acknowledged that the Pentagon has a long way to go to &#8220;hack the acquisition system&#8221; when it comes to dual-use technologies.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs have pointed out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/entrepreneurs-say-regulatory-constraints-are-hampering-commercial-applications-of-space-tech/">one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of the commercial space industry has been the inability of the U.S. government to open up the technology for use by private industry</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Entrepreneurs say regulatory constraints are hampering commercial applications of space tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/entrepreneurs-say-regulatory-constraints-are-hampering-commercial-applications-of-space-tech/embed/#?secret=dwa6Bmpi2u" data-secret="dwa6Bmpi2u" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Roper hopes to change that. &#8220;We want to use our military dollars, our mission, and potentially our certifications to help get you there without changing your core product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you succeed as a commercial success, then we succeed as well, because now we&#8217;ve got a great tech partner, that hopefully we can continue to come to to solve problems in future. The thing that we&#8217;ll want to understand early on is how our military market and all those benefits I just mentioned, how can they help you get to commercial success? And what is it that we not need to do to pull you off that trajectory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Contracts with AFWERX are fixed-price and progress as companies hit certain milestones on the product roadmap. These orders increase incrementally as the technology proves itself, so a contract could start with the delivery of a prototype, then experimental usage, then a commercial contract, then broad adoption. &#8220;What we&#8217;re looking to do is see if you can move the ball forward on your technology, and if you do, then we do another contract. We step you up our process,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>Roper sees the project as nothing less than the evolution of the aerospace and defense industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of amazing companies today that helped build stealth bombers and space planes and all sorts of awesome stuff. They&#8217;re defense companies and we still need them,&#8221; Roper said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re hoping to help build in this century is a set of new companies that are just tech companies. They&#8217;re not defense, purely, and they&#8217;re not commercial purely. They&#8217;re just technology companies and they do a bit of business on both sides.&#8221;</p>
