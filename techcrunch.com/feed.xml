										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wunder Mobility built its business selling software to shared scooter, e-bike and even short-term car rental startups. Now, it&#8217;s banking on a new — and once secret — lending division to bring in more revenue that&#8217;ll giving micromobility operators another option to access capital without having pitch venture capitalists and other investors.</p>
<p>The company announced the official launch of Wunder Capital, a subsidiary that <span style="font-weight: 400;">provides micromobility operators with fleet financing solutions. Wunder Capital, which has been </span>operating in stealth mode for two years, has already provided financing to more than 25 businesses, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shared micromobility becomes the norm, the industry has the chance to scale dramatically, Gunnar Froh, Wunder Mobility’s founder and CEO, said in a recent interview. He believes traditional VC-backed funding rounds are too slow to keep up with the level of growth required to keep up with increasing demand.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Now you can now basically launch in a few weeks on our software platform and also get vehicles through us that are optimized for the sharing case, and then pay for them entirely through revenue share,&#8221; Froh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wunder Capital aims to become a one-stop-shop for shared operators looking for operational software, high-quality vehicles and the money to purchase them. Froh estimates that such a package deal would cost an operator about 40% of monthly revenue. </span></p>
<p>The founder originally saw the potential to diversify Wunder&#8217;s portfolio when he noticed how much influence his sales team had on operators&#8217; vehicle purchasing decisions. After his team would set up new operators with an app and software, operators would inevitably ask for vehicle manufacturer recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wunder Mobility said Tuesday it is also </span>partnering with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadea, a dominant manufacturer of light-duty electric vehicles in China, to co-develop an e-moped that&#8217;s been refitted for shared use. The company also intends to co-develop and finance e-bikes and kick scooters this year, but did not specify which manufacturers it would work with. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We put reseller agreements in place, so we would always recommend this Yadea moped and then get a margin on it,&#8221; said Froh. &#8220;Then we&#8217;d talk to Yadea and give them modifications to make the mopeds sharing ready, and then we&#8217;d have an opportunity to talk to the operators about how they&#8217;re going to finance this purchase, what limitations are you facing, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wunder Capital most recently added German electric moped sharing company emmy as a financing customer. Wunder Capital will finance 1,500 refitted Yadea G5L e-mopeds for emmy&#8217;s locations in Munich, Hamburg and Berlin. In contrast to Yadea&#8217;s consumer models, these mopeds will have a sturdier base, more intuitive controls, doubled range and improved battery management systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some companies go through venture capital, but it’s very costly in terms of return expectations and the control they want to have, and it’s holding people back from expanding their fleets,” Froh said. </span>&#8220;We refinance through banks that would not usually look at a single operator and feel comfortable about the resale of these vehicles. We combine several operators into one portfolio and then we have access to a liquid secondary market.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to ascertain risk and inform loan decisions, Wunder Capital uses APIs to <span style="font-weight: 400;">collect anonymized trip data from operators that compares operational efficiency between companies. This data collection also allows the division to flag if an operator isn&#8217;t doing well and is at risk of coming up short on payments, in which case Wunder Capital can proactively reach out about restructuring loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If a default happens, we can take vehicles from one operator and send them to another one somewhere else in the world,&#8221; said Froh. &#8220;So with this model, we can refinance relatively cheaply.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla&#8217;s relationship with bitcoin is not a dalliance, according to the comments made by the company&#8217;s CFO and dubbed &#8220;master of coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn during an earnings call Monday. Instead, the company believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility.</span></p>
<p>Tesla invested $1.5 <span style="font-weight: 400;">billion in bitcoin this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%, Kirkhorn said during the company quarterly earnings call. That sale made a $101 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“positive impact” to the company’s profitability in the first quarter, he added. Tesla also allows customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla bucks the trend of the more cautionary Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell who noted back in March at virtual summit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bVtzQt4Uc">hosted by the Bank for International Settlements</a> that the Fed considers crypto speculative assets that are highly</span> volatile and therefore not useful stores of value. That matters because the basic function of currency is its ability to store value. He also noted that digital currencies are not backed by anything and compared it to gold and not the dollar.</p>
<p>From Kirkhorn:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn&#8217;t being immediately used, try to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity, you know, particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that&#8217;s happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, there aren&#8217;t many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and and talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. Bitcoin seemed at the time, and so far has proven to be a good decision, a good place to place some of our cash that&#8217;s not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed till the end of the year, and be able to get some return on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tesla is watching the digital currency closely, Kirkhorn said, noting that there is a lot of reason to be optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we&#8217;ve been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our ability to build our first position happened very quickly. When we did the sale later in March we also were able to execute on that very quickly. And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able to get cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Tesla did trim its position in March, Kirkhorn added that the company&#8217;s intent is to hold what it has long term and to continue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from its customers as they purchase vehicles. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Musk, who also goes by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">Technoking</a>, announced in March that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/elon-musk-declares-you-can-now-buy-a-tesla-with-bitcoin-in-the-u-s/">Tesla would accept bitcoin</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a form of payment in the United States. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to turn every home into a distributed power plant that would generate, store and even deliver energy back into the electricity grid, all using the company&#8217;s products.</p>
<p>While the company has been selling solar and energy storage products for years, a new company policy to only sell solar coupled with the energy storage products, along with Musk&#8217;s comments Monday, reveal a strategy that aims to scale these businesses by appealing to utilities.</p>
<p>“This is a prosperous future both for Tesla and for the utilities,” he said. “If this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won’t be able to do it,” Musk said during an investor call, noting the rolling blackouts in California last summer and the more recent grid failure in Texas as evidence that grid reliability has become a bigger concern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, the company changed its website to prevent customers from only buying solar or its Powerwall energy storage product and instead required purchasing a system. Musk later announced the move <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385042598692147204">in a tweet</a>, stating “solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall&#8221; and that &#8220;Powerwall will interface only between utility meter and house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install and seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.”</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s pitch is that the grid would need more power lines, more power plants and larger substations to fully decarbonize using renewables plus storage. Distributed residential systems — of course using Tesla products — would provide a better path, in Musk&#8217;s view. His claim has been backed up in part by recent studies from the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435120305572">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, which found that the U.S. can reach a zero-carbon grid by more than doubling its transmission capacity, and another from <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/Princeton_NZA_Interim_Report_15_Dec_2020_FINAL.pdf">Princeton University</a> showing that the country may need to triple its transmission systems by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s decision to scrap its PR department could create a PR nightmare&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/embed/#?secret=CVCGrTSyM7" data-secret="CVCGrTSyM7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Musk is imagining a radically different electricity grid system than the one we have today, which is centrally controlled and run by grid operators, independent organizations such as the California Independent System Operator or the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It&#8217;s a vision that is riddled with bureaucratic and logistical challenges. Utilities and regulatory policy would need to solve how to handle a large influx of so-called &#8220;distributed energy resources,&#8221; such as solar panels on residential roofs, which may run contrary to utilities’ long-established business models.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that whether renewables-plus-storage will be alone sufficient to decarbonize the energy grid is a contentious question. Many experts believing that the land use demands, storage requirements and intermittency issues of renewables may make their role as the country’s primary electricity generator a pipe dream. But Musk has long been bullish on the renewables-plus-storage model, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1276959792876011520">tweeting</a> last July that “physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage &amp; solar/wind for energy generation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a years-long crypto winter, it been the spring of NFTs, but as digital art prices sober up after an explosion in sales, blockchain founders are looking to find more stable opportunities in the space that can grow over time even as speculative interest in NFTs shifts.</p>
<p>One particular interest has been using NFTs to reshape the creator economy in a manner that actually benefits artists more than the platforms that host their work. A new flavor of this pursuit comes from the recently launched <a href="https://sing.link/">S!NG</a> (pronounced sing), which has built a platform around simply letting users upload files to their servers and time-stamp those uploads on the Ethereum blockchain. It&#8217;s a dead-simple mechanic with an ambitious framing, ensuring that artists maintain credit for their work as they create it.</p>
<p>The team behind the app sees a future where artists use the platform as an autosave for their intellectual property during the creative process, enabling them to scribble down notes or upload a quick demo and save those moments on the blockchain, a step that they hope can eliminate or expedite rights disputes for creators that can point to a clearly time-stamped breadcrumbs trail. By virtue of the app&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s clear that they are aiming to attract songwriters and musicians in particular, but the company&#8217;s onboarding also showcases wider ambition in the creator world, enabling users to designate if they are a photographer, writer or programmer as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the best of both worlds with very public witnesses to a very private event,&#8221; says CEO Geoff Osler. &#8220;Your content is never out there, but you can have this massive attestation to the fact that it exists at a certain point in time.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=dFY7X7DxM7" data-secret="dFY7X7DxM7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The iOS app itself is pretty straightforward. After uploading a piece of media, be it a photo, video, audio or text file, users can tack on additional files, make note of additional collaborators or add notes before submitting it and christening the work on the blockchain. The file itself is private with a hash hosted on the blockchain while the encrypted files are stored on S!NG&#8217;s AWS servers, so creators don&#8217;t need to worry about their early ideas being served up to a public audience. A concern here for early adopters is what happens if the blockchain startup eventually goes under and those servers go with it, but that&#8217;s an issue facing plenty of startups that are backing the underlying media files of NFTs on centralized servers.</p>

<p>Rights disputes might be something more top-of-mind to those who have spent substantial time in their specific creative industry, compared to budding artists who are likely wholly concerned with getting their work seen in the first place. While public links allow a work&#8217;s origins to be tracked down once it&#8217;s complete and ready for public consumption, S!NG&#8217;s aim is to develop those moments earlier in the development of a work and aid artists who might be involved with more collaborative creative processes where ownership of ideas can appear more obfuscated from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get something stolen from me, I&#8217;ve got a team that&#8217;s going to defend me and they&#8217;re probably going to win or settle any claims, but if you&#8217;re a 16-year-old kid, you don&#8217;t have that ability so that&#8217;s what we want to provide, but more as a deterrent,&#8221; musician and advisor Raine Maida tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think when you see the S!NG watermark or you see that it&#8217;s saved and shared through the wallet&#8230; you don&#8217;t have to understand blockchain but you&#8217;ll know S!NG is that company that protects you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the time being, non-fungible token-based legal defenses are probably a bit unusual, but the team&#8217;s founders believe that blockchain-based ownership proofs will be entering case law organically just as technology like DocuSign has been accepted.</p>
<p>If the company can successfully push creators to weave the S!NG platform into their toolkits, the startup will have plenty of opportunities on which to capitalize in the incredibly young blockchain creator space. While many artists may see the NFT space as a speculative cash grab, the company&#8217;s founders seem publicly focused on sidestepping hype for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly I don&#8217;t give a shit about all of this crazy NFT stuff with things selling for a bazillion dollars,&#8221; Osler says. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in the small artist who has 1,000 fans who will eagerly pay up $15 to keep that person in business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What is the biggest opportunity for proptech founders? How should they think about competition, strategic investment versus top-tier VC firms and how to build their board? What about navigating regulation?</p>
<p>We sat down last week with Brendan Wallace, co-founder and general manager of Fifth Wall, and Hippo CEO Assaf Wand for an episode of Extra Crunch Live to discuss all of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Our next episode is with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura/">Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai</a>, and you can check out the upcoming schedule right <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/check-out-the-tech-leaders-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-may/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, dive into the wide-ranging conversation we had with Wallace and Wand. You can find the full video, including the EC Live pitch-off, below.</p>
<h2>Investing in the board</h2>
<p>The first step in running a useful and beneficial board is determining who should be on that board, and that starts with the first round of capital investment and carries on forever.</p>
<p>One of the strategic benefits of Fifth Wall as an investor, according to Wallace, is that the firm was built specifically with strategic LPs in the real estate realm, allowing the firm to connect portfolio companies with massive incumbent players in the industry. Incumbents get access to new tools and software, portfolio companies get big customers, and Fifth Wall gets to reap the benefits of both. It&#8217;s a rare win-win-win.</p>
<p>We asked Wand about how he chose his investors, and how to weigh the value of a top-tier VC firm and a strategic angel investor, for example.</p>
<p>He explained that there is no right answer to a question like that, but it should always be thoroughly discussed by the team. One of the benefits of having a top-tier VC firm on board is that it has a signaling effect, helping you to recruit early team members and open doors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week, another big tech hearing in Congress. With a flurry of antitrust reform bills <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">on the way</a>, Democratic lawmakers are again bringing in some of the world&#8217;s most powerful tech companies for questioning.</p>
<p>In the next hearing, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/algorithms-and-amplification-how-social-media-platforms-design-choices-shape-our-discourse-and-our-minds">scheduled for Tuesday, April 27 at 10 AM ET</a>, the Senate Judiciary&#8217;s subcommittee on privacy and technology will zero in on concerns about algorithmic amplification. Specifically, the hearing will explore how algorithms amplify dangerous content and shape user behavior on social platforms.</p>
<p>The subcommittee&#8217;s chair Sen. Chris Coons <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/18/chris-coons-facebook-twitter-hearing-477080">previously indicated</a> that he would bring in tech CEOs, but Tuesday&#8217;s hearing will instead feature testimony from policy leads at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hearing might prove a unique opportunity to hold YouTube&#8217;s feet to the fire. In spite of being one of the biggest social networks in the world — one without much transparency about its regular failures to control extremism and misinformation — YouTube seldom winds up under the microscope with Congress. The company will be represented by Alexandra Veitch, YouTube&#8217;s regional director of public policy.</p>
<p>In past big tech hearings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has generally appeared on behalf of YouTube&#8217;s parent company while YouTube’s chief executive Susan Wojcicki inexplicably escapes scrutiny. Google is a massive entity and concerns specific to YouTube and its policies generally get lost in the mix, with lawmakers usually going after Pichai for concerns around Google&#8217;s search and ads businesses.</p>

<p>In a stylistic repeat of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">last week&#8217;s adversarial app store hearing</a>, which featured Apple as well as some of its critics, misinformation researcher Dr. Joan Donovan and ex-Googler and frequent big tech critic Tristan Harris will also testify Tuesday. That tension can create deeper questioning, providing outside expertise that can fill in some lapses in lawmakers&#8217; technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Policy leads at these companies might not make the same flashy headlines, but given their intimate knowledge of the content choices these companies make every day, they do provide an opportunity for more substance. Tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey have been dragged in to so many hearings at this point that they begin to run together, and the top executives generally reveal very little while sometimes playing dumb about the day-to-day decision making on their platforms. The subcommittee&#8217;s ranking member Ben Sasse (R-NE) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/facebook-youtube-twitter-testify-senate-484456">emphasized that point</a>, stating that the hearing would be a learning opportunity and not a &#8220;show hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats have been sounding the alarm on algorithms for some time. While Republicans spent the latter half of the Trump administration hounding tech companies about posts they remove, Democrats instead focused on the violent content, extremism and sometimes deadly misinformation that gets left up and even boosted by the secretive algorithms tech companies rarely shed light on.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We haven&#8217;t seen much in the way of algorithmic transparency, but that could change. One narrowly targeted <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-eshoo-and-malinowski-introduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-liable-algorithmic">Section 230 reform bill in the House</a> would strip that law&#8217;s protections from large companies when their algorithms amplify extremism or violate civil rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also hinted that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-and-facebooks-senate-judiciary-hearing-philosophies/">different approach might be on the horizon</a>, suggesting that users could hand-pick their preferred algorithms in the future, possibly even selecting them from a kind of third-party marketplace. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Needless to say, Facebook didn&#8217;t indicate any plans to give its own users more algorithmic control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With any major changes to the way platforms decide who sees what likely a long ways off, expect to see lawmakers try to pry open some black boxes on Tuesday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, American electric car company Tesla <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22">reported its Q1 2021 financial performance</a>. The company lost modest ground on the stock market after its news broke.</p>
<p>For the broader electric vehicle and battery startup market that has pursued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">many SPAC-led combinations</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">recent months</a>, the generally positive Tesla trailing results could prove a boon, underscoring continued market demand for their category&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>Turning to the numbers, in the first three quarters of the year, Tesla generated revenues of $10.389 billion, gross profit of $2.215 billion and net income of $438 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla earned adjusted net income of $1.052 billion, leading to diluted, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93. The street had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/analysis?p=TSLA">expected</a> the company to report $10.29 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79. Shares of Tesla are off around 1% in after-hours trading, after the company reported its top and bottom-line beat.</p>
<p>Tesla grew sharply compared to its year-ago period, in which the company generated $5.985 billion in top-line revenue, leading to just $68 million worth of net income. Compared to that year-ago period, Tesla&#8217;s Q1 2021 saw its revenues expand by 74%, its automotive gross margin improve by just under 1% (95 basis points), its aggregate gross margins better themselves by slightly less (70 basis points), and its net income explode 1,850% while its adjusted net income grew by an also impressive 304%.</p>
<p>In the same three-month period, Tesla&#8217;s operating cash flow came to $1.641 billion. The company can comfortably self-fund at that pace of cash generation. That&#8217;s underscored by the fact that Tesla closed its first quarter with cash and cash equivalents worth a total of $17.1 billion.</p>
<p>Tracking neatly with its 75% revenue growth was automotive production growth of 76% in the first quarter, with the company producing 180,338 cars, far above its year-ago Q1 tally of 102,672 units. Deliveries of vehicles rose 109%, to 184,877, over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s solar and energy storage businesses also posted material growth: Solar deployments rose 163% to 92 megawatts, while storage deployment rose 71% to 445 megawatt hours.</p>
<p>Turning to outlook, Tesla told investors in its deck that &#8220;over a multiyear horizon, [the company expects] to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries.&#8221; The company added that it anticipates Tesla Semi deliveries to commence this year, adding another revenue line to the company&#8217;s product mix.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, investors expect Tesla adjusted net income to rise to $0.99 per diluted share this quarter, off of revenues totaling $11.39 billion.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a disconnect between reality and the added value investors are promising entrepreneurs. Three in five founders who were promised added value by their VCs <a href="https://forwardpartners.com/more-than-money/">felt duped</a> by their negative experience.</p>
<p>While this feels like a letdown by investors, in reality, it shows fault on both sides. Due diligence isn’t a one-way street, and founders must do their homework to make sure they’re not jumping into deals with VCs who are only paying lip service to their value-add.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Looking into an investor’s past, reputation and connections isn’t about finding the perfect VC, it’s about knowing what shaking certain hands will entail &#8212; and either being ready for it or walking away.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are increasingly demanding more than a blank check: They want mentorship, product understanding and emotional support, as well as industry connections and expertise. If VCs can’t bring that value, founders now have plenty of other funding routes to choose from, like crowdfunding, angel syndicates, tokenization and SPACs.</p>
<p>To stay competitive, VCs have to at least <em>advertise </em>that they have more than deep pockets. But what if it stops there? Founders have to know exactly what they’re looking for in a VC, which means looking past the front page and vetting their investors.</p>
<p>The ideal investor for modern startups is an operator VC &#8212; someone who was a founder or operator at a company before becoming an investor. But even then, ticking boxes isn’t enough to ensure the investor won’t come with their own<a href="https://avc.com/2017/05/investor-vcs-and-operator-vcs/"> challenges</a>, like being too hands-on or less strategically minded.</p>
<p>Looking into an investor’s past, reputation and connections isn’t about finding the perfect VC, it’s about knowing what shaking certain hands will entail &#8212; and either being ready for it or walking away. There is no single solution to this issue, but here are my recommendations to founders seeking a successful investor relationship in 2021.</p>
<h2>Have a guiding framework</h2>
<p>No founder-investor relationship can survive misalignment. Because you share responsibility on so many processes, both parties have to be on the same page. So before you even start fundraising, nail down the expectations you need your future investor to meet. What do you need the most? What does your dream investor look like?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing company Lyft has sold off its autonomous vehicle unit to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million, the latest in a string of acquisitions spurred by the cost and lengthy timelines to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>Under the acquisition agreement announced Tuesday, Lyft&#8217;s so-called Level 5 division will be folded into Woven Planet Holdings. Lyft will receive $550 million in cash, with $200 million paid upfront. The remaining $350 million will be made in payments over five years. About 300 people from Lyft Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet. The Level 5 team, which in early 2020 numbered more than 400 people in the U.S., Munich and London, will continue to operate out of its office in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, officially ends Lyft&#8217;s nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/21/lyft-launches-a-new-self-driving-division-called-level-5-will-develop-its-own-self-driving-system/">four-year effort</a> to develop its own self-driving system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction will remove a costly annual expense from Lyft&#8217;s budget. The ride-hailing company said that by offloading Level 5 it expects to be able to remove $100 million of annualized non-GAAP operating expenses on a net basis. Those savings will be critical for Lyft as it pursues profitability — a point co-founder and president John Zimmer made special note of in the announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuming the transaction closes within the expected timeframe and the COVID recovery continues, we are confident that we can achieve Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the third quarter of this year,&#8221; Zimmer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Free from this annual expense, Lyft will dedicate its resources to what the company says it was really was aiming for all along: to become the go-to ride-hailing network and fleet management platform used by any and all commercial robotaxi services. Lyft already has partnerships with AV developers, notably the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, as well as Waymo. The intent is to lock up the rest. As part of the acquisition agreement, Woven Planet signed commercial agreements to use the Lyft platform and fleet data.</p>
<p>Lyft said that the agreement with Woven Planet is not exclusive, and it will continue its partnership with Motional and others. Motional and Lyft have been partners for more than three years, a relationship that kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show (the partnership actually predated the joint venture with Hyundai.) That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional’s — self-driving vehicles, per the Lyft app. Motional announced in December plans to launch fully driverless robotaxi services in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Lyft is making some structural organizational changes to reflect this renewed focus. Lyft will retain its team of engineers, product managers, data scientists and UX designers that have been working on the consumer experience of hailing and then riding in an autonomous vehicle, which will be headed up by Jody Kelman. This team, now known as Lyft Autonomous, will be folded into the company&#8217;s fleet division that manages more than 10,000 vehicles via its rental and express drive programs. Lyft Fleet, which was founded in 2019 and is led by Cal Lankton, is also the group spearheading the company&#8217;s transition to 100% electric vehicles on the network by 2030. The idea is to bring all of these efforts — shared, electric and self-driving — under one roof.</p>
<p>Other strategic shuffling is happening over at Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet. The Level 5 workforce, researchers from Toyota Research Institute and Woven Planet will be combined into one team of about 1,200 employees. The company said the acquisition of Level 5 is a carve-out of Lyft&#8217;s self-driving division with a specific focus on accelerating the safety of automated driving technology and does not directly affect Toyota&#8217;s relationship with other partnerships such as AV startup Aurora.</p>
<p>Woven Planet Holdings is a new entity that has already made a splash. The holding company, which folded in Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. or TRI-AD, also includes an investment arm known as Woven Capital and Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Woven Capital kicked off off its new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/"> $800 million strategic fund</a> by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dating startup <a href="https://www.smoredate.com">S&#8217;More</a> has launched a new feature called S&#8217;More TV, which CEO Adam Cohen-Aslatei said could give users new ways to talk to each other. It also bringing the startup closer to his goal of becoming not just a dating app, but &#8220;a lifestyle brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The videos on S&#8217;More TV may be familiar to people who follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smoredate/?hl=en">the company on Instagram</a>, where Cohen-Aslatei has hosted dating-related interviews with celebrities like WWE stars Chelsea Green and Leah Van Dale, models Nichole Holmes and Sarah Miller and Mary Fitzgerald of &#8220;Selling Sunset.&#8221; Now, however, these videos are getting a home in the S&#8217;More app itself.</p>
<p>Cohen-Aslatei said this wasn&#8217;t the initial plan when he started filming videos for S&#8217;More Live, but eventually he and his team decided to do more with their &#8220;nearly 50 hours of exclusive celebrity content,&#8221; seeing them as &#8220;the first organic way to have content not related to a dating profile&#8221; in the app. He suggested that this isn&#8217;t just giving users another reason to open the app, but also a crucial conversation starter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After all, anyone who&#8217;s had to start a conversation in a dating app will probably remember moments when you&#8217;ve struggled to come up with something better than &#8220;Hey&#8221; or &#8220;How&#8217;s it going?&#8221; — and S&#8217;More presents unique challenges on that front, since the app blurs all user photos until you&#8217;ve had some real interaction. So Cohen-Aslatei said these videos can spur a more natural conversation, allowing users to &#8220;really talk about topics that they care about.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143935" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143935" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2143935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?w=314" alt="S'More TV" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entertainment-Patti-1.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> S&#8217;More</p></div></p>
<p>The S&#8217;More app now includes prompts directing users to watch S&#8217;More TV, where anyone can watch and comment on the videos. If you post a particularly scintillating comment, that may help to attract potential matches, and it will give them an easy starting point for the conversation.</p>
<p>In fact, Cohen-Aslatei claimed that since releasing S&#8217;More TV in beta testing, the app has seen Day One retention (the number of users who open the app one day after installation) increase by 15% to the &#8220;mid-60s,&#8221; while time in the app has doubled.</p>
<p>He also said S&#8217;More Live is quickly approaching its 100th episode, but you won&#8217;t see all of those episodes on the app right away. Instead, the company will be adding 15 new videos to the S&#8217;More app each month.</p>
<p>In addition, S&#8217;More has launched a new feature called cover photos. This is basically the one exception to the blurred photos rule (although it sounds like even this photo is subtly warped), allowing users to showcase a single image of their friends, their life or their personality even before they start a conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brex, a fintech company that provides corporate cards and spend-management software to businesses, announced earlier today that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">closed a $425 million Series D round of capital at a valuation of around $7.4 billion</a>. The new capital came less than a year after Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">raised $150 million at a $2.9 billion pre-money valuation</a>.</p>
<p>So, how did the company manage to so rapidly boost its valuation and raise its largest round to date? TechCrunch spoke with Brex CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/hdubugras?lang=en">Henrique Dubugras</a> after his company&#8217;s news broke. We dug into the how and why of its new investment and riffed on what going remote-first has done for the company, as well as its ability to attract culture-aligned and more diverse talent.</p>
<h2>More customers, more product</h2>
<p>Undergirding the company&#8217;s financial news today was its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210426005625/en/Brex-Unveils-All-In-One-Financial-Solution-For-Businesses">announcement</a> of Brex Premium, a software suite that the unicorn intends to charge for. As TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">written ad nauseam</a>, there has been an interesting rift between corporate spend-management companies regarding whether they charge for the software that they layer around their proffered business plastic. Brex has now crossed this particular Rubicon and joined those that do, at least in some cases.</p>
<p>Brex Premium will run customers $49 per month, which Dubugras described in a call as less expensive than the systems it may replace. For companies looking for integrated bill pay, expense management and the like, it could be a good fit. And the service could bolster Brex&#8217;s aggregate revenue run rate with high-margin, recurring software fees that public market investors have long coveted.</p>
<p>On the topic of investors, let&#8217;s circle back to Brex&#8217;s round. Here&#8217;s what we need to know: How quickly has Brex grown in recent months, why did the company choose Tiger as its lead investor (from over $1 billion in demand for the round), and what&#8217;s ahead for the company itself?</p>
<p>In order:</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>Per Dubugras, from March 2020 to March 2021, Brex grew its revenues and TPV, or total payment volume, by more than 100%. As Brex reached $1 billion in TPV during its first seven months of its existence, again according to its CEO, the company&#8217;s aggregate TPV add during that 12-month period was in excess of that figure. Multiples higher, by our reckoning.</p>
<p>That growth explains how Brex was able to double its valuation. It grew quickly. How it did so is worth exploring.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, autonomous driving startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">Zoox was acquired by Amazon in a deal worth $1.3 billion</a>. Since then, Zoox has continued to pursue its existing strategy of developing and deploying autonomous passenger vehicles, revealing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">design of its long-anticipated robotaxi late in December</a>. From concept to reveal, Zoox spent six years developing its built-for-purpose passenger AV, and the plan is to launch them initially with commercial deployments in Las Vegas and San Francisco following testing. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> this year on June 9, we&#8217;ll have the chance to speak to Zoox co-founder and CTO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesse Levinson</a> about the company&#8217;s progress toward those goals, and what it&#8217;s like for Zoox nearly a year on as an Amazon company.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Did you know? Early-bird ticket sales end next week! Save $100 before prices go up]</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch from last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/">Levinson told us</a> that life under Amazon at the AV company has been essentially business as usual since the acquisition — with greatly expanded access to resources, of course, and potentially with even more autonomy than before, he said, since they&#8217;re not beholden to a host of outside investors as they pursue their goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the natural assumption when considering Amazon and its interest in autonomous vehicles is package delivery — which is why it&#8217;s so interesting that Zoox is, and has always, prioritized movement of people, not parcels, in its AV development roadmap. Zoox&#8217;s debut vehicle has been designed entirely with passenger transportation in mind, though the company&#8217;s CEO Aicha Evans has acknowledged in the past that it could definitely work on package delivery in partnership with its new corporate owner in the future.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from Levinson if there are any updates to Zoox&#8217;s plan or focus, and what Amazon&#8217;s ambitions are for autonomous vehicles in the long term. We&#8217;ll also talk about the AV industry overall, and the major shifts its undergone in the years that Zoox has been operating, and what that means for growing and attracting talent. Levinson knows the industry and the state of the art in AV technology better than most, so be sure to grab tickets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=mobility2021&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=zooxpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> ASAP and check out our chat on June 9.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly four years ago, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/the-hunted-becomes-the-hunter-how-cloudflares-fight-with-a-patent-troll-could-alter-the-game/">wrote about a battle</a> between <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, the San Francisco-based internet security and performance company, and Blackbird Technologies, a firm that quickly amassed dozens of patents, then began using them to file dozens of patent infringement lawsuits against companies, including Cloudflare.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The suit was typical in every way, except how Cloudflare responded to it. Unlike many targets of similar lawsuits that opt to settle, Cloudflare fought back, asking very publicly for help in locating prior art that would not only invalidate the broad patent that Blackbird was using to sue Cloudflare, but to invalidate all of Blackbird’s patents. The public answered the call, and two years and 275 unique submissions later, the case against Cloudflare was dismissed and Blackbird&#8217;s operations were diminished.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The hunted becomes the hunter: How Cloudflare&#8217;s fight with a &#8216;patent troll&#8217; could alter the game&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/the-hunted-becomes-the-hunter-how-cloudflares-fight-with-a-patent-troll-could-alter-the-game/embed/#?secret=dFQcY1vhug" data-secret="dFQcY1vhug" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One might surmise that given the stink that Cloudflare raised, other patent trolls might choose an easier target. Yet last month, Cloudflare was sued yet again, this time by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sable-networks/about/">Sable Networks</a>, a &#8220;company that doesn’t appear to have operated a real business in nearly 10 years — relying on patents that don’t come close to the nature of our business or the services we provide,&#8221; says Doug Kramer, general counsel of Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Cloudflare isn&#8217;t going to take this newest action lying down. This morning, after revealing the lawsuit publicly, it invited the engineering community to again &#8220;<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/">turn the tables</a>&#8221; on patent trolls by inviting them to participate in a crowdsourced effort to find evidence of prior art to invalidate the &#8220;ancient, 20-year-old patents&#8221; that Cloudlflare says that Sable is &#8220;trying to stretch … light-years beyond what they were meant to cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cloudflare is also offering a $100,000 bounty to be split among entrants who provide the most useful prior-art references that can be used in challenging the validity of all of Sable’s patents, not just those being asserted against Cloudflare. The idea is to deal a big enough blow to Sable that not only is its case against Cloudflare hobbled but also future cases against other entities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel fortunate that we didn&#8217;t run into one of these cases earlier in our history, where it might have really taken us off our path,&#8221; Kramer tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Blackbird came along when we had a bit more stability,&#8221; he notes. With Cloudflare even stronger today, the company is even better positioned to &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">force [Sable] to define their claims and stand on their claims in a way that leaves something behind for other folks, particularly smaller companies that may come behind us. We want to put [Sable&#8217;s] entire patent portfolio under scrutiny.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Certainly, Cloudflare is not the only company to attract Sable&#8217;s attention. Indeed, a quick search shows that Sable has also sued the cybersecurity business Fortinet, the data platform Splunk, and networking giants Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems, among roughly a dozen other companies.</p>
<p>Eight of those cases &#8212; including with Juniper and Cisco &#8212; have already settled. The reality is that most companies see infringement cases by nonpracticing entities like Sable as a nuisance to be quickly resolved because they are a distraction and because the expense of fighting is often equal to or even more than the cost of settling.</p>
<p>The companies also lose oftentimes. Though in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that patent holders suing corporations can&#8217;t seek out a friendly court &#8212; their venue of choice was long the Eastern District of Texas, where <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/supreme-court-ends-texas-grip-patent-cases">2,500 cases</a> were brought in 2015 alone, 95% of them initiated by outfits like Sable &#8212; business remains brisk in Texas, where legal teams bring in a lot of money and often successfully cast major corporations to local jurors as villainous.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Texas-regains-title-capitol-patent-litigation-15473273.php">report in the Houston Chronicle</a> last year noted that businesses and individuals filed 747 patent complaints in Texas during the first six months of 2020 — double the number from a year earlier and twice as many as any other state. To underscore the point, it noted that while patent infringement lawsuits jumped 16% nationwide in the first six months of last year, the number of new disputes in Texas soared 96%.</p>
<p>Some of those cases landed in the Eastern District of Texas (and mostly in Marshall, Texas, which boasts a population of 23,000). Some landed in the Southern District, which covers Houston and, according to that same Houston Chronicle report, experienced a 43% jump in new patent violation cases last year.</p>
<p>But Waco, the Western District of Texas, has become the new center for patent infringement cases. That&#8217;s largely because the district encompasses Austin, where many tech companies have offices, and notably, a key piece of that 2017 Supreme Court ruling limited filings to venues where the defendants have actual operations.</p>

<p>So-called patent trolls have also found a friend, seemingly, in U.S. District Judge Alan Albright, a former trial attorney who was <a href="https://www.statesman.com/NEWS/20180123/Trump-names-Austin-lawyer-Alan-Albright-to-federal-bench">nominated</a> to become a federal judge in Waco in 2018 by former President Donald Trump. In the two years following his confirmation by the Senate, Albright has come to preside over the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/patent-lawsuits-trolls-moving-texas-waco-new-judge-big-tech-2021-4">most popular court in the country</a> to litigate intellectual property disputes, with a very high percentage of plaintiffs winning their cases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that the Sable Networks of the world continue along their path. Scoring early settlement agreements can add up to big business. (Their continued success is also why litigation finance funds continue to <a href="https://www.ipwatchdog.com/press/gls-capital-raises-345-million-litigation-finance-fund/">spring into existence</a>.)</p>
<p>Cloudflare is a much bigger quarry now, too. While Blackbird sued while Cloudflare was still viewed as an up-and-coming startup, it went public in 2019 and now boasts a market cap of $26 billion.</p>
<p>Kramer is acutely aware of the upward battle ahead. It&#8217;s why despite its resources, Cloudflare is reaching out to the public again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to sound self-serving, but we have a very intense group of engineers and people in this space who read [our] blog regularly,&#8221; Kramer says of the detailed <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/project-jengo-redux-cloudflares-prior-art-search-bounty-returns/">post </a>he published this morning relating to the case. &#8220;I also think this really strikes a nerve with some people because they are so bothered by&#8221; the practice of patent infringement suits.</p>
<p>Kramer says it&#8217;s impossible to overstate the impact of these far-flung engineers in Cloudflare&#8217;s fight against Blackbird. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just people who thought, &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s a chance to make some money and I&#8217;m gonna go do this.&#8217; There wasn&#8217;t a lot of junk in [what they submitted]. Instead, we had people saying, &#8216;Hey, listen, I worked on this back in the &#8217;90s when I was over at this company, and it&#8217;s crazy that they&#8217;re trying to say they invented this,&#8217; and they would send us articles that they had written.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had people doing research at libraries and stuff like that,&#8221; continues Kramer, &#8220;but we also had people who had worked in the industry and said, &#8216;I worked on this three years before they ever got that patent; there&#8217;s no way they should be able to create this [trouble] based something that I did.'&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether Cloudflare can again get its followers energized &#8212; and &#8220;also the exact right people, who are motivated by this and and who are very, very knowledgeable in this space,&#8221; says Kramer &#8212; will become clear soon enough. But for the company&#8217;s part, it&#8217;s very much &#8220;hoping to get the gang back together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the scale of its ambitions, Cloudflare could seemingly use the help more than ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After everything was wrapped up at <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2021-academy-awards-show-review-big-gambles-mixed-results">a very weird Oscars ceremony</a>, original films released by Netflix had won seven statuettes.</p>
<p>The streaming service&#8217;s awards include two for &#8220;Mank&#8221; (production design and cinematography), two for &#8220;Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom&#8221; (hair/makeup and costume), documentary feature (&#8220;My Octopus Teacher&#8221;), animated short (&#8220;If Anything Happens I Love You&#8221;) and live action short (&#8220;Two Distant Strangers&#8221;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Sound of Metal&#8221; won the awards for sound and editing, while Facebook&#8217;s Oculus, EA and Respawn <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/facebook-wins-oscar-colette-1234959515/">won their first Oscar for &#8220;Colette,&#8221; </a>which won in the documentary short category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This comes after a pandemic year which saw theaters closing or operating at reduced capacity, forcing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to delay the ceremony and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/oscars-streaming-coronavirus/">change its awards eligibility rules</a>. It also essentially erased the distinction between theatrical and streaming films — for example, Searchlight Pictures released Best Picture-winner &#8220;Nomadland&#8221; in theaters and on Hulu at the same time.</p>

<p>Netflix received <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/awards/netflix-oscar-nominations-2021-disney-plus-hulu-1234930905/">36 nominations total</a>, making it the most-nominated studio, with &#8220;Mank&#8221; the most-nominated film. And seven wins is a big improvement on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">the two it won last year</a>.</p>
<p>Going into the evening, &#8220;Nomadland&#8221; was seen as the frontrunner for Best Picture, but Netflix executives still had reason to be  disappointed: In a nearly unprecedented move, Best Picture wasn&#8217;t the final award of the night — instead, it was Best Actor, which was widely expected to go to the late Chadwick Boseman for his performance in &#8220;Ma Rainey.&#8221; So when Anthony Hopkins (who wasn&#8217;t in attendance) won for &#8220;The Father,&#8221; it made for a pretty deflating end to the evening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Luminar Technologies is expanding its lidar business beyond automotive and into aviation through a partnership with Airbus. The collaboration with the French aerospace giant, which was announced Monday morning, marks the latest in a string of partnership announcements between Luminar and companies like Daimler, Volvo and Mobileye. Until now, these have exclusively focused on applying its light detection and ranging radar to automated vehicles on the ground — not in the skies.</p>
<p>The partnership won&#8217;t immediately bring lidar into commercial aircraft. Unlike Luminar&#8217;s deal with Daimler, Mobileye and Volvo this is not a production contract, although the aim is that it will lead to one. Instead, the partnership is with Airbus&#8217; UpNext subsidiary, which is focused on developing and eventually applying new technological breakthroughs to aviation. The effort will be folded into Airbus Flightlab, an ecosystem that offers access to flight test platforms across Airbus&#8217; business lines, including commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense and space. Luminar and Airbus will develop and test how lidar can be used to enhance sensing, perception and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight, the companies said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re able to directly re-apply what we&#8217;ve accomplished for the automotive industry into aviation, an established nearly $1 trillion industry,&#8221; Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a statement Monday. &#8220;We believe that automation and safety enhancements will transform how we move across all modes of transport as we take our technology from roads to the skies. We look forward to accelerating our shared vision to define the future of flying.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lidar, which measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered by most in the autonomous vehicle industry critical to commercial deployment. Automakers have also begun to view lidar as an important sensor to be used to expand the capabilities and safety of advanced driver assistance systems in new cars, trucks and SUVs available to consumers.</p>
<p>Airbus is interested in how Luminar&#8217;s lidar and perception stack can be used to automatically detect obstacles, a key step toward autonomous operation of aircraft such as urban air mobility vehicles. The companies said the sensor also has the potential to &#8220;substantially improve the safety of existing aircraft applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasing helicopter safety is one of Airbus&#8217; missions. The company said Monday it will introduce a number of new features to its helicopter Flightlab through a project code-named Vertex. These technologies, which include lidar and other sensors coupled with software for obstacle detection, fly-by-wire for enhanced auto-pilot and a touchscreen and head-worn display for inflight monitoring and control, aim to reduce helicopter pilot workload and increase safety. Airbus said that when combined, the system will be able to manage navigation and route preparation, automatic take-off and landing, as well as following a predefined flight path. The incremental integration of these technologies onto the helicopter Flightlab has begun ahead of a complete demonstration in 2023. Airbus said its Urban Air Mobility project will also benefit from this technology as a step toward autonomous flight.</p>
<p>Luminar, which burst onto the autonomous vehicle scene <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/luminar-debuts-a-sensor-to-make-self-driving-cars-safer-than-human/">in April 2017</a> after operating for years in secrecy, became a publicly traded company in late 2020. The company announced in February that it would work with Volvo Cars to develop and eventually sell to other automakers an automated driving system for highways. The partnership, which is between Luminar and Volvo’s self-driving software subsidiary Zenseact, builds upon an existing relationship with Volvo. The two companies are combining their tech to create what Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell described as a “holistic autonomous vehicle stack” made for production vehicles. Volvo will be the first customer. Russell and Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson said at the time that they plan to also offer this system to other automakers.</p>
<p>Last year, ahead of its public debut, Luminar also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">locked in a supplier deal</a> to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles. Under that contract, Luminar&#8217;s lidar will be part of Mobileye&#8217;s first-generation fleet of driverless vehicles, which are being piloted in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Paris, China and Daegu City, South Korea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sign language is used by millions of people around the world, but unlike Spanish, Mandarin or even Latin, there&#8217;s no automatic translation available for those who can&#8217;t use it. <a href="https://www.slait.ai/">SLAIT</a> claims the first such tool available for general use, which can translate around 200 words and simple sentences to start — using nothing but an ordinary computer and webcam.</p>
<p>People with hearing impairments, or other conditions that make vocal speech difficult, number in the hundreds of millions, rely on the same common tech tools as the hearing population. But while emails and text chat are useful and of course very common now, they aren&#8217;t a replacement for face-to-face communication, and unfortunately there&#8217;s no easy way for signing to be turned into written or spoken words, so this remains a significant barrier.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen attempts at automatic sign language (usually American/ASL) translation for years and years. In 2012 Microsoft awarded its Imagine Cup to a student team that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/09/enable-talk-imagine-cup/">tracked hand movements with gloves</a>; in 2018 I wrote about SignAll, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/signall-is-slowly-but-surely-building-a-sign-language-translation-platform/">working on a sign language translation booth</a> using multiple cameras to give 3D positioning; and in 2019 I noted that a new hand-tracking algorithm called MediaPipe, from Google&#8217;s AI labs, could lead to advances in sign detection. Turns out that&#8217;s more or less exactly what happened.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcZbajccCdU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>SLAIT is a startup built out of research done at the Aachen University of Applied Sciences in Germany, where co-founder Antonio Domènech built a small ASL recognition engine using MediaPipe and custom neural networks. Having proved the basic notion, Domènech was joined by co-founders Evgeny Fomin and William Vicars to start the company; they then moved on to building a system that could recognize first 100, and now 200 individual ASL gestures and some simple sentences. The translation occurs offline, and in near real time on any relatively recent phone or computer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140747" style="width: 739px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2140747 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/slait-trans-asl-crop.gif" alt="Animation showing ASL signs being translated to text, and spoken words being transcribed to text back." width="729" height="292" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SLAIT</p></div></p>
<p>They plan to make it available for educational and development work, expanding their dataset so they can improve the model before attempting any more significant consumer applications.</p>
<p>Of course, the development of the current model was not at all simple, though it was achieved in remarkably little time by a small team. MediaPipe offered an effective, open-source method for tracking hand and finger positions, sure, but the crucial component for any strong machine learning model is data, in this case video data (since it would be interpreting video) of ASL in use — and there simply isn&#8217;t a lot of that available.</p>
<p>As they recently explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ1FJP7uO9Y">in a presentation for the DeafIT conference</a>, the first team evaluated using an older Microsoft database, but found that a newer Australian academic database had more and better quality data, allowing for the creation of a model that is 92% accurate at identifying any of 200 signs in real time. They have augmented this with sign language videos from social media (with permission, of course) and government speeches that have sign language interpreters — but they still need more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143831" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143831" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2143831 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deaf-Understand-Hearing-1-www.slait_.ai_.gif" alt="Animated image of a woman saying &quot;deaf understand hearing&quot; in ASL." width="400" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2143831" class="wp-caption-text">A GIF showing one of the prototypes in action — the consumer product won&#8217;t have a wireframe, obviously. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> SLAIT</p></div></p>
<p>Their intention is to make the platform available to the deaf and ASL learner communities, who hopefully won&#8217;t mind their use of the system being turned to its improvement.</p>
<p>And naturally it could prove an invaluable tool in its present state, since the company&#8217;s translation model, even as a work in progress, is still potentially transformative for many people. With the amount of video calls going on these days and likely for the rest of eternity, accessibility is being left behind — only some platforms offer automatic captioning, transcription, summaries, and certainly none recognize sign language. But with SLAIT&#8217;s tool people could sign normally and participate in a video call naturally rather than using the neglected chat function.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term, we’ve proven that 200 word models are accessible and our results are getting better every day,&#8221; said SLAIT&#8217;s Evgeny Fomin. &#8220;In the medium term, we plan to release a consumer facing app to track sign language. However, there is a lot of work to do to reach a comprehensive library of all sign language gestures. We are committed to making this future state a reality. Our mission is to radically improve accessibility for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cautioned that it will not be <em>totally</em> complete — just as translation and transcription in or to any language is only an approximation, the point is to provide practical results for millions of people, and a few hundred words goes a long way toward doing so. As data pours in, new words can be added to the vocabulary, and new multigesture phrases as well, and performance for the core set will improve.</p>
<p>Right now the company is seeking initial funding to get its prototype out and grow the team beyond the founding crew. Fomin said they have received some interest but want to make sure they connect with an investor who really understands the plan and vision.</p>
<p>When the engine itself has been built up to be more reliable by the addition of more data and the refining of the machine learning models, the team will look into further development and integration of the app with other products and services. For now the product is more of a proof of concept, but what a proof it is — with a bit more work SLAIT will have leapfrogged the industry and provided something that deaf and hearing people both have been wanting for decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disasters are, unfortunately, a growth business, and the frontlines that were once distant have moved much closer to home. Wildfires, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes — let alone a pandemic — has forced much of the United States and increasingly large swaths of the world to confront a new reality: few places are existentially secure.</p>
<p>How we respond to crises can radically adjust the ledger of mortality for the people slammed by these catastrophes. Good information, fast response and strong execution can mean the difference between life and death. Yet, frontline workers often can’t get the tools and training they need, particularly new innovations that may not wind their way easily through the government supply chain. Perhaps most importantly, they often need post-traumatic care far after a disaster his dissipated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riskandreturn.com">Risk &amp; Return</a> is a unique venture fund and philanthropic hybrid that has set its mission to seek and finance the next-generation of technologies to help first responders not only on the frontlines, but even after as they confront the strains both physical and mental from missions they undertake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The family of organizations sees a spectrum from emergency workers in the United States to U.S. military veterans, all of whom share similar challenges and need solutions today — solutions that can often be hard to finance for traditional VCs who aren’t aware of the unique needs of this community.</p>
<p>The group was founded by Robert Nelsen, who made his name as a co-founder and managing director of biotech VC leader ARCH Venture Partners, <a href="https://www.archventure.com/arch-venture-partners-announces-1-46-billion-raised-in-two-new-funds-to-invest-in-transformative-biotechnology-companies/">which last year announced a $1.5 billion pair of funds</a>. He’s joined by board chairman Bob Kerrey, the former co-chair of the 9/11 Commission as well as former governor and senator of Nebraska, and managing director Jeff Eggers, a Navy SEAL who served as senior director of Afghanistan and Pakistan on President Barack Obama’s National Security Council.</p>
<p>Nelsen had been thinking through the idea when he met Kerrey, who recalled the conversation happening during a fundraising event for Navy SEALs. “There has been a lot of suffering for those who have been on the frontlines,” Kerrey said. “Bob had this idea, and I thought it was a really smart idea, to try to take a different approach to philanthropic efforts.” They linked up with Eggers and the trio brought Risk &amp; Return to fruition.</p>
<p>The venture fund is $25 million, with about 35% of it already deployed. The fund has had a big emphasis on mental health for first responders, with 75% of the companies funded broadly in that category.</p>
<p>The fund’s first investment was into <a href="https://www.altoneuroscience.com">Alto Neuroscience</a>, which is developing precision medicine tools to treat post-traumatic stress. The fund has also invested in behavioral management startup <a href="https://www.neuroflow.com">NeuroFlow</a>; alternative well-being assessment tool <a href="https://qntfy.com">Qntfy</a>; Spear Human Performance, which is a brand-new spinout focused on connecting commercial and health data sources to optimize human performance; and <a href="https://xtremity.com">Xtremity</a>, which is designing better connection sockets for prosthetics. The fund has invested in another six startups, including Perimeter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">which I profiled a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;When wildfires rage close, Perimeter wants to tell you where to go&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/embed/#?secret=JvSg77dDCh" data-secret="JvSg77dDCh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This isn’t your typical venture portfolio, and that’s exactly what Risk &amp; Return wants to focus on. Eggers said that “We love that type of technology since it has that dual purpose: going to serve the first responder on the ground, but the community is also going to benefit.”</p>
<p>While many of the startups the firm has invested in obviously have a focus on first responders, the technologies they develop don’t have to be limited to just that market. Kerrey noted that “Every veteran is a civilian, [and] these aren’t businesses targeting the military market.” Given the last year, “it’s hard to find a human being in this pandemic that hasn’t suffered at least some PTSD,” referencing post-traumatic stress disorder. Sales to governments can be incredibly challenging, and the ultimate market for the kinds of specialized mental health services that frontline workers need may not be as commercially viable as one would hope.</p>
<p>While the government does research and innovation in this category, Kerrey sees a huge opportunity for the private sector to get more involved. “One thing that you could do in the private sector that is difficult in the public sector is look for alternative therapies for PTSD,” he said, noting that areas like psychedelics have intrigued the private sector even while the government would mostly not touch the category today. Risk &amp; Return has not made an investment in that space at this time though.</p>
<p>Half of the returns from the fund will stream into Risk &amp; Return’s philanthropic arm, which writes grants to charities along the same thesis of aiding frontline workers both on the job and after it. The organizations hope that by approaching the complicated response space with a multi-pronged approach, they can match potential needs with different sources of capital that are most appropriate.</p>
<p>We’ve increasingly seen this hybrid for-profit/nonprofit venture model in other areas. <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc">Norrsken</a> is a Swedish foundation and venture fund that is investing in areas like mental health, climate change and other categories from the UN Sustainable Development Goals. <a href="https://solve.mit.edu">MIT Solve</a> is another program that is working on hybrid approaches to startup innovation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/mit-solve-launches-global-challenge-around-health-security-and-pandemics/">such as in pandemics and health security</a>. While disasters are always looming, it’s great to see more innovation in financing this critical category of technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/mit-solve-launches-global-challenge-around-health-security-and-pandemics/">such as in pandemics and health security. </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The latest version of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system — iOS 14.5 — is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-goes-live-with-watch-unlocking-tracking-transparency-and-kissing-emojis/">launching today</a>, and with it comes a much-discussed new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency.</p>
<p>The feature was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">first announced nearly a year ago</a>, although the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/apple-delay-ios-14-privacy-ad-tracking/">delayed the launch</a> to give developers more time to prepare. Since then, support for the feature has already gone live in iOS and some apps have already adopted it (for example, I&#8217;ve seen tracking requests from Duolingo and Venmo), but now Apple says it will actually start enforcing the new rules.</p>
<p>That means iPhone owners will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/">start seeing many more privacy prompts</a> as they continue using their regular apps, each one asking for permission to &#8220;track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites.&#8221; Every app that requests tracking permission will also show up in a Tracking menu within your broader iOS Privacy settings, allowing you to toggle tracking on and off any time — for individual apps, or for all of them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What does turning tracking on or off actually do? If you say no to tracking, the app will no longer be able to use Apple&#8217;s IDFA identifier to share data about your activity with data brokers and other third parties for ad-targeting purposes. It also means the app can no longer use other identifiers (like hashed email addresses) to track you, although it may be more challenging for Apple to actually enforce that part of the policy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143772" style="width: 496px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143772" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2143772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?w=486" alt="Apple App Tracking Transparency" width="486" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-Tracking-Transparency.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been intense debate around App Tracking Transparency in the lead up to its launch. The pro-ATT side is pretty easy to explain: There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of personal information and activity that&#8217;s being collected about consumers without their consent (as Apple outlined in a report called <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf">A Day in the Life of Your Data)</a>, and this gives us a simple way to control that sharing.</p>
<p>However, Facebook has argued that by dealing a serious blow to ad targeting, Apple is also hurting small businesses that depend on targeting to affordable, effective ad campaigns.</p>

<p>The social network even took out ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">declaring that it’s “standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.&#8221;</a> (The Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">dismissed the campaign</a> as &#8220;a laughable attempt from Facebook to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook’s business.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Others have suggested that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/">these changes could do &#8220;existential&#8221; damage to some developers and advertisers</a>, while also benefiting Apple&#8217;s bottom line.</p>
<p>The full impact will depend, in part, on how many people choose to opt out of tracking. It&#8217;s hard to imagine many normal iPhone owners saying yes when these prompts start to appear — especially since developers are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">not allowed to restrict any features</a> based on who opts into or out of tracking. However, mobile attribution company AppsFlyer says that early data suggests that <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/att-opt-in-rates-higher/">opt-in rates could be as high as 39%</a>.</p>
