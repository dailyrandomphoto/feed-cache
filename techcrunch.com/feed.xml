										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is doubling down on one of the biggest strengths of Prime Video streaming service: Aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant on Wednesday launched Prime Video Mobile Edition, an even more affordable tier of the on-demand video streaming service &#8212; now also bundling additional perks.</p>
<p>Prime Video Mobile Edition, for which Amazon has partnered with Indian telecom network Airtel, will feature 28-day mobile-only, single-user, standard definition (SD) access to customers in India for Rs 89 ($1.22). This tier will also include 6GB of mobile data that customers can consume during the subscription period. To anyone who subscribes to Prime Video Mobile Edition, Amazon says it will pick the tab for the first month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095627" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095627" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2095627 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="705" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg 470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Prime-Video-Mobile-Edition-Plans-v1-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095627" class="wp-caption-text">Amazon Prime subscription costs $1.7 a month in India and includes access to Prime Video and Prime Music.</p></div></p>
<p>The new Prime Video plan is currently only available in India. Its launch comes two years after Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/netflix-launches-rs-199-2-8-mobile-only-monthly-plan-in-india/">unveiled a similar plan in India</a>.</p>
<p>Affordable pricing is key for on-demand steaming services that are looking to make inroads in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. Even as more than 700 million users are online in the country today, only a fraction of them currently pay to access digital subscriptions. In a recent report to clients, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that gaming, and video streaming market in India could clock as much as $5 billion in gross value transactions by FY25.</p>
<p>“India is one of our fastest growing territories in the world with very high engagement rates. Buoyed by this response, we want to double-down by offering our much-loved entertainment content to an even larger base of Indian customers. Given high mobile broadband penetration in the country, the mobile phone has become one of the most widely used streaming devices,” said Jay Marine, Vice President, Amazon Prime Video Worldwide, in a statement.</p>
<p>Airtel is the first roll-out partner for Prime Video Mobile Edition, and it suggested that it may tie up with other telecom giants as it looks forward to &#8220;expanding the reach of our service to the entire pre-paid customer base in India,&#8221; said Sameer Batra, Director, Mobile Business Development at Amazon. No word on when or whether Amazon plans to extend Prime Video Mobile Edition outside of India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.winnoz.com/">Winnoz</a>’s Haiim is designed to make collecting blood from fingertips easier, increasing the volume drawn so it can be used for more types of tests. The New Taipei City, Taiwan-based company’s vacuum-assisted device can collect up to 150 to 500 microliters of blood from a finger prick, depending on the person, in about two minutes.</p>
<p>Winnoz is <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/7d1a5eb1-a320-4085-955d-fa5f0cec3119?index=1">currently presenting</a> Haiim and eGGi, its molecular detection device that supports isothermal DNA/RNA amplification methods, at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion, with the goal of finding new partners and investors.</p>
<p>Haiim was inspired by founder and chief executive officer Joses Hsiung’s childhood memories of watching his mother go into clinics for regular blood testing. Since his mother’s veins were hard to see, it often took multiple punctures for phlebotomists to draw enough blood. Eventually, her veins collapsed. Hsiung began working on the device to maximize the amount of blood that can be taken from finger pricks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While finger blood draws are typically used for tests that require less than 10 microliters of blood, like glucose monitoring or cholesterol panel, Haiim can draw enough for ones that need a larger volume, potentially helping patients avoid venipuncture blood draws.</p>
<p>The device consists of two parts, the main unit and single-use cartridges that stores the blood until it is tested. Since many clinics and hospitals are understaffed, it is designed so personnel can start using it with less training than traditional blood collection methods. Haiim was approved by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in 2019 and is intended for use by health care organizations, clinics and hospitals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based TravelPerk has scooped up US-based rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/nextravel/">NexTravel</a> as the pandemic drives consolidation in one of the sector&#8217;s hardest hit by COVID-19.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not disclosing how much it&#8217;s shelling out for NexTravel, which has some 700 customers globally and has processed around 300,000 trips since being founded back in 2013, but says the deal is its largest acquisition to date &#8212; with the aim of beefing up its business in the US. (Also today it&#8217;s announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines that plugs a key gap in its US offering.)</p>
<p>The US has always been a top five market for TravelPerk, per<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir, but after the NexTravel acquisition it becomes its largest market.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;US customers, US know-how, [US-based] team,&#8221; he said, listing the drivers for the acquisition. &#8220;They&#8217;ve built an amazing product. It&#8217;s a Y Combinator company who started 2-3 years before us and they focused only or mostly on the US market so they have an expertise that is very complementary to what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meir confirmed NexTravel&#8217;s founders and team are joining TravelPerk as part of the deal. Existing customers include the likes of Yelp, Stripe and Harry’s.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a great company. I really think we have great execution and we got into the crisis with a much better cash position and COVID-19 is creating opportunities that didn&#8217;t exist before,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We had friendly competition and just the context of the situation was we were in a better position to acquire them vs them acquiring us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to migrate users of the US product onto TravelPerk&#8217;s platform over time but Meir said the NexTravel team will continue to support the product for the foreseeable future while it works on understanding and plugging any functionality gaps with the aim of ensuring a smooth, eventual transition for NexTravel customers in the future.</p>
<p>The acquisition is only TravelPerk&#8217;s second after it picked up risk management startup Albatross last summer &#8212; underlining how the coronavirus crisis is retooling priorities for businesses in the travel sector.</p>
<p>Or at least those that have enough funding to see them through the revenue crunch. And Meir confirmed TravelPerk has its eye on more acquisition targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the process of talking with a few more [potential acquisitions],&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;In a moment of crisis consolidation typically happens so I think it&#8217;s fair to expect more of this.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Three travel startups tell us how they&#8217;re responding to the coronavirus crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/three-travel-startups-tell-us-how-theyre-responding-to-the-coronavirus-crisis/embed/#?secret=UHEGUlyzU3" data-secret="UHEGUlyzU3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While a couple of years ahead of TravelPerk in starting up a business travel booking business, NexTravel has raised considerably less over its run &#8212; pulling in circa $4.5M in funding, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nextravel">Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>The younger Spain-based startup, meanwhile, grew faster and has raised orders of magnitude more (~$134M to date) &#8212; including a $60M top-up to its Series C in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/on-a-growth-tear-work-trip-saas-travelperk-adds-60m-to-its-series-c/">2019</a> when it was reporting 2,000 customers globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just happen to be in Europe,&#8221; Meir told TechCrunch, discussing how his European startup is in a position to buy a US rival (when the reverse is all too often the case in tech) &#8212; and pointing to knowledge of how to localize as a key advantage<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span>&#8220;We were never targeting the Spanish market exclusively or not even the European market.</p>
<p>&#8220;To win in business travel, one of the paradoxes is you have to build a very localized product&#8230; So we never saw ourselves as a European business we just recognize that we have to really localize deeply in order to be successful anywhere. But we have to do it across the world. So this acquisition is just another step in localizing for the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;[The acquisition] will obviously drive a lot of product development, of commercial investments, of partnerships,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In a way we&#8217;re doing it knowing that it will force us to do more of the US &#8212; so it&#8217;s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy &#8212; but it&#8217;s a $300BN business travel market so we should better make some moves around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the pandemic continuing to ravage much of the globe &#8212; including both the US and Europe &#8212; there&#8217;s likely to be considerably fewer billions of dollars on business travel value up for grabbed for a sizeable chunk of 2021. And Meir confirmed that TravelPerk isn&#8217;t expecting to see a revival in the market before the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he remains bullish that once vaccinations are rolled out to the most vulnerable groups in society business travellers will be on the move once again &#8212; predicting that Zoom fatigue and the boom in remote working will rekindle demand for face-to-face human contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;My best guess right now is everything converges to around the second half of this year &#8212; around May-June maybe &#8212; where seasonality should hopefully hit. Meaning we&#8217;ll see the same decline in hospitalizations and deaths as we saw last year. That&#8217;s my hope,&#8221; he predicted. &#8220;On top of that we have the vaccines&#8230; Within the next 4-5 months there is reason to expect that we&#8217;ll see [vaccine rollouts] accelerating and then everything converges. We just need the at risk population to be safe for the world to be open again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;ll be completely done with corona but it won&#8217;t be as deadly as it is now so we&#8217;ll be able to open up more and remove restrictions and see travel coming back again,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom earnings, remote work and a terrible but possibly bright moment for startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/zoom-earnings-remote-work-and-a-terrible-but-possibly-bright-moment-for-startups/embed/#?secret=EtW0oxSHo1" data-secret="EtW0oxSHo1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pressed on whether businesses might not have adjusted to a new, &#8216;more digital&#8217; normal after 1.5 years of living with COVID-19 &#8212; having come to rely on a suite of videoconferencing and virtual meeting tools &#8212; Meir quashes the idea of a smaller business travel market replacing the pre-pandemic industry, predicting a &#8220;roaring &#8217;20s&#8221; revival for business travel instead, fuelled by &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; and networking FOMO once social distancing restrictions can be lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you still own any Zoom shares you should sell them!&#8221; he quipped, speaking via Zoom call (obviously). &#8220;This is going down from now. Everybody is tired of this. The Zoom fatigue is real. It creates a lot of mental health concerns, social isolation&#8230; Maslow&#8217;s Pyramid of Needs is still here, and it&#8217;s even stronger than ever, I think, because we realize how bad it is when we don&#8217;t meet people in real life. When everything has to be through this weird, proxy to human connection. The virus doesn&#8217;t change human nature. We still need to meet each other face to face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first sales person who&#8217;s going to lose a sale because the competition went and took the customer to dinner and they wanted to do it via Zoom, they&#8217;re on a plane the next day. So competition will solve it &#8212; even if we put aside human nature,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I think we all recognize even more how much we need human connection.&#8221;</p>
<p>So even if some some &#8220;transactional meetings&#8221; do move permanently to Zoom, as Meir conceded &#8220;maybe&#8221; happens, he said they&#8217;re not the primary driver for the bulk of business travel anyway.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the pandemic will create new demand for business travel because of the boom in remote working creating ongoing need for distributed colleagues to travel to meet each other face to face, with Meir arguing that more flexible working is certainly here to stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;My team, like many other teams, used to be all in Barcelona in the same building &#8212; and now we allow them to work from anywhere in the world. Because why not? Many companies will stick to that I think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have recognized that people like it, the employees like it and it&#8217;s cheaper, because you don&#8217;t have to have as much office real estate &#8212; and people are more productive and they&#8217;re happier and they have a better balance between their personal and work life.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this requires a new type of travel because&#8230; you have to bring [your team] together for a week of work together. So I think the small decline in business travel due to this one hour transactional call that you can move to Zoom will be compensated even more &#8212; increased by &#8212; this new way of working that requires a new type of business travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While TravelPerk was fortunate enough to go into the pandemic well-capitalized, having topped up its Series C in 2019, investor interest in travel startups undoubtedly went on holiday for a considerable chunk of last year. But, again, Meir suggests, an uptick on that front.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to raise any time soon &#8212; we have enough cash. The expectation is for the business to go back to growing year on year sometime in Q3, Q4 of this year,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;Having said that, what&#8217;s interesting &#8212; and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the only one &#8212; is we went from [being a fast-growing company] and you get a lot of inbound from investors and then COVID-19 hit and my inbox was empty for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty sad, pretty pathetic. And then the last few weeks &#8212; since the beginning of the school year &#8212; September/October, my inbox is not empty anymore. So there is some movement in the market. There&#8217;s a lot of money looking for a home &#8212; for good investments. And I think even in an industry which is suffering obviously, the good companies can raise at good terms right now. So I&#8217;m not looking to raise but I&#8217;m always open to the opportunity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile adoption continued to grow in 2020, in part due to the market forces of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to App Annie&#8217;s annual &#8220;State of Mobile&#8221; industry report, mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, consumer spending grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Consumers also spent 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone, the report found.</p>

<p>In another shift, app usage in the U.S. surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours on their mobile device.</p>
<p>The increase in time spent is a trend that&#8217;s not unique to the U.S., but can be seen across several other countries, including both developing mobile markets like Indonesia, Brazil and India, as well as places like China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., Germany, France and others.</p>
<p>The trend isn&#8217;t isolated to any one demographic, either, but is seen across age groups. In the U.S., for example, Gen Z, millennials and Gen X/Baby Boomers spent 16%, 18% and 30% more time in their most-used apps year-over-year, respectively. However, what those favorite apps looked like was very different.</p>
<p>For Gen Z in the U.S., top apps on Android phones included Snapchat, Twitch, TikTok, Roblox and Spotify.</p>
<p>Millennials favored Discord, LinkedIn, PayPal, Pandora and Amazon Music.</p>
<p>And Gen X/Baby Boomers used Ring, Nextdoor, The Weather Channel, Kindle and ColorNote Notepad Notes.</p>

<p>The pandemic didn&#8217;t necessarily change how consumers were using apps in 2020, but rather accelerated mobile adoption by two to three years&#8217; time, the report found.</p>
<p>Investors were also eager to fuel mobile businesses as a result, pouring $73 billion in capital into mobile companies &#8212; a figure that&#8217;s up 27% year-over-year. According to Crunchbase data, 26% of total global funding dollars in 2020 went to businesses that included a mobile solution.</p>

<p>From 2016 to 2020, global funding to mobile technology companies more than doubled compared with the previous five years, and was led by financial services, transportation, commerce and shopping.</p>
<p>Mobile gaming adoption also continued to grow in 2020. Casual games dominated the market in terms of downloads (78%), but Core games accounted for 66% of games&#8217; consumer spend and 55% of the time spent.</p>
<p>With many stuck inside due to COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines, mobile games that offered social interaction boomed. Among Us, for example, became a breakout game in several markets in 2020, including the U.S.</p>

<p>Other app categories saw sizable increases over the past year, as well.</p>
<p>Time spent in Finance apps in 2020 was up 45% worldwide, outside of China, and participation in the stock market grew 55% on mobile, thanks to apps like Robinhood in the U.S. and others worldwide, that democratized investing and trading.</p>
<p>TikTok had a big year, too.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095437" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?w=608" alt="" width="608" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg 1512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=268,300 268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,859 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=608,680 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=1373,1536 1373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.15.31-PM.jpg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p>The app saw incredible 325% year-over-year growth, despite a ban in India, and ranked in the top five apps by time spent. The average monthly time spent per user also grew faster than nearly every other app analyzed, including 65% in the U.S. and 80% in the U.K., surpassing Facebook. TikTok is now on track to hit 1.2 billion active users in 2021, App Annie forecasts.</p>
<p>Other video services boomed in 2020, thanks to a combination of new market entrants and a lot of time spent at home. Consumers spent 40% more hours streaming on mobile devices, with time spent in streaming apps peaking in the second quarter in the west as the pandemic forced people inside.</p>

<p>YouTube benefitted from this trend, as it became the No. 1 streaming app by time spent among all markets analyzed except China. The time spent in YouTube is up to 6x that of the next closet app at 38 hours per month.</p>
<p>Of course, another big story for 2020 was the rise of e-commerce amid the pandemic. This made the past year the biggest ever for mobile shopping, with an over 30% increase in time spent in Shopping apps, as measured on Android phones outside of China.</p>

<p>Mobile commerce, however, looked less traditional in 2020.</p>
<p>Social shopping was a big trend, with global downloads of Pinterest and Instagram growing 50% and 20% year-over-year, respectively.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2095438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?w=552" alt="" width="552" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg 1466w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=244,300 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=768,946 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=552,680 552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=1247,1536 1247w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-12-at-5.16.26-PM.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px" /></p>
<p>Livestreaming shopping grew, too, led by China. Downloads of live shopping TaoBao Live in China, Grip in South Korea and NTWRK in the U.S. grew 100%, 245% and 85%, respectively. NTWRK doubled in size last year, and now others are entering the space as well &#8212; including TikTok, to some extent.</p>

<p>The pandemic also prompted increased usage of mobile ordering apps. In the U.S., Argentina, the U.K., Indonesia and Russia, the app grew by 60%, 65%, 70%, 80% and 105%, respectively, in Q4.</p>
<p>Business apps, like Zoom and Google Meet among others, grew 275% in Q4, for example, as remote work and sometimes school, continued.</p>
<p>The analysis additionally included lists of the top apps by downloads, spending and monthly active users (MAUs).</p>

<p>Although TikTok had been topping year-end charts, Facebook continued to beat it in terms of MAUs. Facebook-owned apps controlled the top charts by MAUs, with Facebook at No. 1 followed by WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.</p>

<p>TikTok, however, had more downloads than Facebook and ranked No. 2 by consumer spending, behind Tinder.</p>
<p>The full report is available only as an <a href="http://appannie.com/go/state-of-mobile-2021">online interactive experience</a> this year, not a download. The report largely uses data from both the iOS App Store and Google Play, except where otherwise noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Wednesday launched Amazon Academy, a service that will aim to help students in India prepare for entry into the nation’s prestigious engineering college. The American firm is the latest entrant to this market where scores of startups and institutes have launched digital offerings in recent years.</p>
<p>The e-commerce giant, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion</a> in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, said <a href="https://academy.amazon.in/">Amazon Academy</a> offers curated learning material, live lectures, mock tests, and comprehensive assessments to help students learn and practice Math, Physics and Chemistry and prepare for the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE), a government-backed engineering entrance assessment conducted in India for admission to various engineering colleges in the country. Millions of students take JEE test each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;These tests are designed to mirror the JEE experience helping students understand the nuances of the examination. Students will also benefit from shortcuts, mnemonics, tips, and tricks, equipping them with the necessary tools to retain concepts and solve questions effectively,&#8221; the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon began testing Amazon Academy, previously known as JEE Ready, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-computer-science-education-program-future-engineer-in-india/">in India in mid-2019</a>. Amazon Academy, available as an from Google Play Store and App Store and also through its website, is free and will remain so for the &#8220;next few months,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2095600" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=768,421 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=1536,842 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-academy.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>More than 260 million children go to school in India and much of the population sees education as a key to economic progress and a better life. TechCrunch reported last month that Amazon was also hiring people in India to launch Amazon Future Engineer, a program through which it aims to bring computer science education to underserved and underrepresented children and young adults, in India by this year.</p>
<p>“Amazon Academy aims to bring high quality, affordable education to all, starting with those preparing for engineering entrance examinations. Our mission is to help students achieve their outcomes while also empowering educators and content partners reach millions of students. Our primary focus has been on content quality, deep learning analytics and student experience. This launch will help engineering aspirants prepare better and achieve the winning edge in JEE,” said Amol Gurwara, Director, Education at Amazon India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s global rivals, Facebook and Google, have also made push in India&#8217;s education market in recent years. Last year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/facebook-makes-education-push-in-india/">partnered with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)</a>, a government body that oversees education in private and public schools in India, to launch a certified curriculum on digital safety and online well-being, and augmented reality for students and educators.</p>
<p>Facebook also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">invested in Unacademy</a>, a Bangalore-based startup that offers online learning classes. Google, which <a href="https://entrackr.com/2020/12/exclusive-cuemath-scores-40-mn-in-series-c-round-valuation-crosses-170-mn/">invested in Indian edtech startup</a> Cuemath, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-makes-education-push-in-india/">also partnered with CBSE</a> to train more than 1 million teachers in India and offer a range of free tools such as G Suite for Education, Google Classroom and YouTube to help digitize the education experience in the nation.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s top edtech startups &#8212; Byju&#8217;s, Unacademy, and Vedantu &#8212; also offer students classes to prepare for JEE test. Last year, these startups onboarded tens of millions of students to their platform after the coronavirus outbreak prompted New Delhi to shut down schools across the nation. Byju&#8217;s, which became the world&#8217;s most valuable edtech startup last year, is in talks to buy decades-old Aakash Educational Services Aakash Educational Services, which owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/byjus-is-reportedly-buying-indian-brick-and-mortar-institute-aakash-for-1-billion/">for $1 billion</a>, Bloomberg reported this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Megvii, one of China&#8217;s largest facial recognition startups, is gearing up for an initial public offering in Shanghai. The company is working with CITIC Securities to prepare for its planned listing, according to an <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/beijing/bjfdqyxx/bjfdqyjbqk/202101/P020210112533742962617.pdf">announcement</a> posted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The move came more than a year after Megvii, known for its computer vision platform Face++, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/megvii-the-chinese-startup-unicorn-known-for-facial-recognition-tech-files-to-go-public-in-hong-kong/">filed to go public</a> in Hong Kong in August 2019. At the time, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-megvii-ipo/chinese-ai-start-up-megvii-files-for-hong-kong-ipo-of-at-least-500-million-idUSKCN1VG05I">reported</a> that the company could raise between $500 million and $1 billion. However, the firm&#8217;s IPO application in Hong Kong has lapsed for undisclosed reasons and its focus is now on Shanghai&#8217;s STAR board, a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In 2019, China established the STAR board to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/">attract high-growth, unprofitable Chinese tech startups</a> after losing them to the U.S. for years. In the meantime, a domestic flotation is increasingly appealing to Chinese firms, especially those that count on government contracts and are caught in the U.S.-China tech competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Megvii and its rivals SenseTime, Yitu, and CloudWalk are collectively recognized as the &#8220;Four AI Dragons&#8221; of China for their market dominance and fundings from highflying investors. Megvii&#8217;s technology can be found powering smart city infrastructure across China as well as many smartphones and mobile apps. Alibaba, Ant Group and the Bank of China are among the group of investors who have pumped about <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/megvii-technology">$1.4 billion</a> into the ten-year-old company since its inception.</p>
<p>The AI Dragons are less celebrated outside their home market. Last year, Megvii, Yitu and SenseTime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">were added to the U.S. Entity List</a> for their alleged roles in enabling the government&#8217;s mass surveillance of the Muslim minority groups in western China. CloudWalk was subsequently added to the blacklist in 2020 and cut off from its U.S. suppliers.</p>
<p>According to the notice posted by China&#8217;s securities authority, Megvii plans to issue <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/china-wants-its-tech-firms-back-are-cdrs-the-answer-quicktake?sref=gni836kR">Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs)</a>, which are similar to American depositary receipts and allow domestic investors to hold overseas shares. That suggests the Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/megvii-750-million/">AI unicorn</a> has not ruled out listing outside mainland China.</p>
<p>This week, Hong Kong-listed Lenovo, one of the world&#8217;s top PC makers, has also <a href="https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/lenovo/announcement/ca210112.pdf">announced plans</a> to sell shares through CDRs on the Shanghai tech board.</p>
<p>Currently seeking guidance in the pre-application stage, Megvii&#8217;s planned listing still needs approval from Chinese regulators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.molotov.tv">Molotov</a> provides an OTT TV streaming service in France with live TV, premium channels, a cloud DVR and on-demand content. While the service has managed to attract 13 million users in France, it has yet to expand to other countries.</p>
<p>Molotov is starting its international expansion this year with a dozen countries on the roadmap. First, the service will be available in seven African countries, starting with Ivory Coast where it’s already live, Senegal in January, Cameroon in February, Burkina Faso in March, Tunisia in April, Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo after that.</p>
<p>“When it comes to features, the service is more or less the same but content is different,” co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc told me. Molotov is betting on local partnerships to launch its service in new countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In today’s case, Molotov is partnering with <a href="https://www.digitalvirgo.com">Digital Virgo</a>, a mobile payments company available in 40 countries. Digital Virgo is handling the relationships with local content owners. Molotov is taking care of operations and the tech stack.</p>
<p>There will be 15 channels at launch, such as Nina TV, Passions TV, Trace Urban, Trace Africa, Trace Urban Africa, Savannah TV, Gametoon, Africanews, Euronews, France24, Trace Sport Stars and DocuBox. Molotov will also grant access to its ad-supported on-demand streaming service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/molotov-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-mango/">Mango</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2095287" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095287" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="606" class="size-full wp-image-2095287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=768,455 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=1536,909 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-CP-Molotov-international-Janv-2021-page-3.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2095287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Molotov</p></div></p>
<p>In order to support its international expansion plans, the startup had to rework its infrastructure so that it’s more robust — it relies more on cloud hosting and it is partnering with more CDN companies. For instance, the service should work better if you don’t have as much bandwidth as before.</p>
<p>And this is just a start as Molotov is already talking with different B2B partners in Asia, South America and Europe. “Our strategy is that we lean on local players to launch Molotov in new countries,” Blanc said. So you can expect more news on the international front with new countries and new partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Glassdoor just released its annual ranking of the<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm"> best companies to work for in 2021</a>. We broke out the top 10 tech companies from the list of large businesses (1,000+ employees) as well as from the small to medium-sized business list.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">For the large business list, the rankings are based on employee feedback from companies with more than 1,000 employees. Through Glassdoor, employees rate companies based on things like their CEO, career opportunities, compensation and benefits, culture and values, and work-life balance. To be considered for the large list, each employer needed at least 75 ratings across each of the workplace attributes. For the SMB list, companies needed at least 75 ratings to be considered.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the top 10 tech companies to work for in the U.S., according to Glassdoor. In parentheses, you&#8217;ll find each company&#8217;s overall ranking on the list of the 100 best companies along with the average employee rating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.yokaiexpress.com/">Yo-Kai Express</a> is known for autonomous restaurant technology for venues like office campuses, malls and hotels. As people continue staying home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the company is introducing a smart home cooking appliance with multiple functions. Called Takumi, it includes a coffee maker, high induction cooktop and a steamer for sanitizing utensils and baby bottles. Takumi is connected by RFID to an app with preprogrammed recipes, which also sends alert when its water container is running low.</p>
<p>The company is currently <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/3ed249c2-dceb-4649-9aa8-2697dbd1cb6d?index=1">presenting Takumi</a> at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena.</p>

<p>If you live in the Bay Area, you might have seen Yo-Kai Express’s Octo-Chef, a vending machine that serves hot noodle dishes (ramen, udon and pho), in venues like the San Francisco International Airport, the Metreon mall in San Francisco and corporate campuses. But the company is adapting as people stay home. In April, it launched a <a href="https://www.yokaiexpress.com/homemealkit">home meal kit delivery service</a> that is now available in all states.</p>
<p>Created for people who want a home-cooked meal but are short on time (and space), the Takumi’s pre-programmed recipes have cooking times of just two to eight minutes. Yo-Kai Express is known for noodle dishes, but the Takumi’s menu will also include rice bowls, dim sum, dumplings and pasta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The spread of misinformation and fake news online has a dangerous impact on public well-being. Misinformation is difficult to fight, and 73% of Americans <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/09/few-americans-are-confident-in-tech-companies-to-prevent-misuse-of-their-platforms-in-the-2020-election/">surveyed by Pew Research</a> ahead of the presidential election expressed little or no confidence in the ability of major tech companies to keep their platforms from being misused. The open-source <a href="https://vimeo.com/494323381">Starling Framework for Data Integrity </a>was launched to protect the veracity of online content using blockchain technology, creating “birth certificates” for photos and videos and tracking any changes made to them. <a href="https://numbersprotocol.io/">Numbers Protocol</a>, a Taipei, Taiwan-based startup, founded by Startling Framework collaborators, is now commercializing its tech to make it more widely available.</p>
<p>Numbers is currently presenting its blockchain camera, Capture App, <a href="https://livetour.istaging.com/f61536ff-5b81-49fd-ba52-8564c2fb8ad7?index=1">during CES at the Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion</a>. The app is available for download in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/capture/id1536388009">App Store </a>and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.numbersprotocol.capturelite">Google Play</a>.</p>
<p>While journalism, especially citizen journalism, is an obvious use case for Capture App, it can also be used by people who want to prove that they created images that are being shared online. Numbers will add more features to the app, including a video camera.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2095006" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2095006" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2095006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?w=680" alt="A screenshot of blockchain camera app Capture App by Taiwan startup Numbers Protocol" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EqGQjfdUUAABbW0.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2095006" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of blockchain camera app Capture App by Taiwan startup Numbers Protocol</p></div></p>
<p>All photos taken by the Capture App have their metadata <a href="https://medium.com/numbers-protocol/securing-our-data-with-numbers-starling-capture-54dbad4bedc2">certified and sealed on the blockchain</a> (users can adjust privacy settings if they, for example, don’t want to share their precise location). Then any changes to the photo, including ones made with editing software, are traced and recorded.</p>
<p>Numbers plans to add a video function to the app and create a channel where people can publish certified content, with the goal of changing the information industry, co-founder Tammy Yang told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Before launching Numbers, Yang worked with the Starling Framework, an initiative by Stanford University and <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/">the USC Shoah Foundation</a>. The Shoah Foundation’s work includes preserving testimonies from survivors of genocide and mass violence and the Starling Framework&#8217;s technology was created to help them safeguard photos and videos. The Starling Framework was also<a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/starling-framework/"> used by Reuters journalists</a> to capture, verify and store photos taken during the U.S. presidential primaries in March. (The Starling Framework’s other collaborators include Filechain, Hala Systems and Protocol Labs).</p>
<p>The Starling Framework worked with the Shoah Foundation and Reuters to integrate its technology into their workflows, since many photojournalists use digital SLRs and programs like Adobe Photoshop. Capture App was created to allow wider access to the same technology.</p>
<p>Fake news and misinformation has created more public awareness of the need to preserve photo integrity, said Yang. While there are other companies that use blockchain tech to protect data and content, Numbers focuses on certifying photos at their point of origin, and then continuing to record any alterations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We focus very much on the camera itself, so at the time the photo is taken, the integrity is already preserved,&#8221; said Yang. &#8220;If content is captured on a camera app and then copied to a content platform, it’s already very difficult to verify its origin. If I take a photo from Facebook and register it on the blockchain, it means nothing. It’s very different if I take a photo with Capture App and immediately create a registration on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As expected, this year’s (virtual) CES has brought with it a new flood of smart home gadgets. The technology has been a major presence over the last several CES events, and with a world stuck at home for the foreseeable future, a lot of this tech has become all the more appealing.</p>
<p>Nobi stands out from the pack, not so much because of any flashy features, but rather a kind of practicality it brings to the table. Created by a Belgian startup of the same name, the ceiling-mounted smart light features motion sensors and infrared detection.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lapF6eiWzo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the user sits up, the top light illuminates. If they stand up to walk, it illuminates the ground. More interestingly, it can detect irregular motions in the user, as well as falls. If the user does the latter, the on-board speaker will ask, “did you fall.”</p>
<p>If the answer is “no,” nothing happens. If the answer is anything else, it will send a notification to a caregiver, which may include a photo, depending on the specific settings. The lamp is currently undergoing a testing period and will be available for sale by year&#8217;s end. Users can buy them outright, or rent them, along with a subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Acton is crossing paths again with Facebook. Over more than a decade of building and operating WhatsApp, the company&#8217;s co-founder first competed against and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/?_ga=2.110338893.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut</a>. Only a few years ago he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton-is-leaving-to-start-a-non-profit/">parted ways with the company</a> that made him a billionaire in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/whatsapp-founder-brian-acton-says-facebook-used-him-to-get-its-acquisition-past-eu-regulators/">bitter split over messaging and privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Now Acton says the ongoing outrage over what Facebook has done to the messaging service he helped build is driving people to his latest project &#8212; Signal. Acton, who serves as the executive chairman of the privacy-conscious messaging app&#8217;s holding company, told TechCrunch in an interview that the user base of Signal has “exploded” in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Acton on a video call. “We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“It’s a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going,” he said.</p>
<p>The event Acton is referring to is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">recent change</a> in <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">data-sharing policy disclosed by WhatsApp</a>, an app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/">serves more than 2 billion users</a> worldwide.</p>

<p>Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share their personal data with Facebook. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.</p>
<p>Acton said WhatsApp is grappling with incorporating monetization features while still protecting people’s privacy. And its new “complicated policy” has forced WhatsApp and the media to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification/">scramble for explanations</a> and “everyone is confused.”</p>
<p>Acton did not disclose how many users Signal has amassed in recent weeks, but he said the app currently ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries. (Signal is not the only app that users have explored in recent days as their new home. Telegram said on Tuesday noon that more than 25 million users had joined the platform in the last 72 hours. The app now has over 525 million monthly active users.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WhatsApp hits 2 billion users, up from 1.5 billion 2 years ago&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/whatsapp-hits-2-billion-users-up-from-1-5-billion-2-years-ago/embed/#?secret=cNZZIN8Rbx" data-secret="cNZZIN8Rbx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2018, Signal has promised that it won’t sell its users’ data and that it won’t show its users ads. In 2018, Acton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/">invested $50 million in Signal Foundation</a>, a check that he said helped get the ball rolling. But how does the messaging app plan to stay afloat in the future?</p>
<p>Signal today also relies on donations to bankroll the business &#8212; and more users mean more donors, he said. “If Signal gets to a billion users, that’s a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That’s a better relationship in my opinion,” he said.</p>
<p>Acton said this model has worked for the business, which keeps a small staff of below 50. Between its frugal spending and the foundation&#8217;s largesse, Signal still has some money in the bank.</p>
<p>Signal Foundation has also previously said that messenger is its first product, and like Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation, it intends to expand to more categories. Acton said in the coming years, the team will take a call on whether they want to work on email and storage products, but he said the current focus remains on the messaging app.</p>
<p>Even as Acton has publicly urged users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/after-selling-his-company-to-facebook-for-19-billion-brian-acton-joins-deletefacebook/">get off Facebook</a>, in our conversation he did not suggest that people should stop using WhatsApp. On the contrary, Acton said he envisions people relying on Signal for conversations with their family and close friends, and using WhatsApp for other chats. &#8220;I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does. My desire is to give people a choice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Otherwise, you&#8217;re locked into something where you have no choice. It&#8217;s not strictly a winner take-all scenario.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the criticisms that WhatsApp often receives is that it does not do enough to curb the spread of false information on its platform, which has resulted in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/whatsapp-destroyed-village-lynchings-rainpada-india">real-life casualties</a>. I asked Acton what Signal, which also protects its users&#8217; conversations with end-to-end encryption, would do if people started to use his app for a similar purpose. Acton said it&#8217;s a difficult challenge and while technology and platform have their own share of responsibilities, they can only do so much especially when you can&#8217;t look at the content of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be teaching your children good digital responsibility. Don&#8217;t just immediately take the information that you get. Understand its source. Understand who are trusted sources. As a society, teach every member how it works,&#8221; he said, pointing to earlier days of the internet when email scams were rampant and with time and education people learned how to identify them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime has changed its corporate travel policy to ensure not a dime of its money ends up in the coffers of the Trump Organization&#8217;s hotels and other properties in response to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that led to several deaths.</p>
<p>The micromobility startup wants to take that action further and has asked TripActions, the Palo Alto-based corporate travel booking service that it uses, to encourage other customers to do the same. TripActions has not returned emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Lime asked TripActions to remove Trump properties from showing up in a search if one of its employees is booking corporate travel, according to an internal email written by Lime CEO Wayne Ting and sent to the rest of the staff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lime has not made any political contributions to date, according to the email. (TechCrunch confirmed with Lime that it hasn&#8217;t made any federal political contributions.) Ting wrote that the company will never support any elected <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. He then went further, extending it to the Trump Organization, a real estate portfolio that includes hotels, golf properties and resorts as well as residential holdings like Trump Tower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families,&#8221; Ting wrote. &#8220;In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.&#8221;</span></p>
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Here&#8217;s the complete email, which TechCrunch has viewed:<br />
</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I know many of us watched last week’s events in Washington DC in shock and horror. The bedrock of any democracy is the peaceful transfer of power based on the will of the people. It was horrific to see a mob of insurrectionists &#8212; including white supremacists, neo-nazis, and conspiracy theorists &#8212; spurred on by the President, storm the halls of Congress to undermine and overturn that most sacred democratic ritual through violence and intimidation. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The day was made even more disturbing by the stark contrast in police response between last week’s violent riots and last summer’s overwhelmingly peaceful protests for racial justice. If the rioters last week had been black and brown and held high the flag of Black Lives Matter instead of Donald Trump and the Confederacy, would they have been allowed to overrun the Capitol, ransacked offices, and walked back out the front door in their own volition? The unfortunate thing is the answer is self-evident.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">As more information became available over the last few days, it’s also clear that President Trump and certain Members of Congress still do not comprehend the gravity of their offenses, show appropriate remorse for inciting such unbelievable violence, or commit to ensure they never happen again. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political. We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions &#8212; and dollars &#8212; don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We signed on to <a href="https://pfnyc.org/news/new-york-business-leaders-issue-statement-to-certify-electoral-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pfnyc.org/news/new-york-business-leaders-issue-statement-to-certify-electoral-vote/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610548332691000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVwv1sWUxC9SXo4l6C0n0QPZY9ig">PFNYC’s letter</a> calling for Congress to certify the results of the Presidential election ahead of the unrest. And while we have not made political donations to date, we are committing now to never support any elected official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families. In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I know these events have been difficult to watch, painful to comprehend, and deeply hurtful on the most personal level for many of our colleagues. Please always know, we are here to support you and each other. And if it is helpful, you can find mental health support services <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4FYwA4fewa1JL-oaOlOfe7TnpXHJsRli1KP3PWDYGI/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4FYwA4fewa1JL-oaOlOfe7TnpXHJsRli1KP3PWDYGI/edit&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610548332691000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8g93vNUTsIsFk-TJWjYsU0NZUug">here</a> for US employees, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ypi1B_vCwVaHUEuhY6WoSVUUB69y6G68/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ypi1B_vCwVaHUEuhY6WoSVUUB69y6G68/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610548332691000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4emUV3PYXzla-_MqAhgeTScYrLQ">here</a> for those in other countries. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">One of Dr. King’s quotes that has always given me great strength in hard times is that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” The road ahead will feel long and winding, but I truly believe when we all do our part, the righteous cause slowly, begrudgingly, and eventually triumphs. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regulatory action prompts Visa to back off a fintech acquisition, Uber and Moderna partner and Checkout.com is valued at $15 billion. This is your Daily Crunch for January 12, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Visa calls off Plaid acquisition</strong></p>
<p>The deal, valued at $5.3 billion, was first announced just over a year ago. However, the Department of Justice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">filed suit to block the acquisition</a> in November, arguing that it would &#8220;eliminate a nascent competitive threat.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In today&#8217;s announcement, Visa said it could still have made things work, but the threat of &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">prompted it to call things off</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The year of the first-ever all-virtual CES is, unsurprisingly, the year of the virtual gym. The past 12 months have seen most of our fitness routines completely transformed &#8212; speaking for myself, my Apple Watch step count shows two big empty spots where March and April are.</p>
<p>Fitness startups have seen unexpected windfall in all of this. In June, Lululemon announced plans to acquire Mirror for $500 million, while competitors like Tonal saw a 7x increase in sales for the year. In December, Apple launched Fitness+, its own on-demand service designed to take on the Pelotons of the world.</p>
<p>It’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re starting to see a streaming service-style land rush on the fitness side of things. It’s a massive industry, of course, and odds are things will never return exactly to “normal” in the wake of all of this, but unlike movie services, it’s hard to imagine people subscribing to more than one at a time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Perhaps the biggest name to enter the market thus far at CES is Samsung. The electronics giant announced Smart Trainer, an addition to its growing line of fitness-focused apps. The system is designed specially for Samsung’s Smart TVs, using a webcam to track exercises. On that front, at least, it seems to be a bit more in-depth than Apple’s Watch-only tracking, which relies on an accelerometer and heart-rate monitor for feedback. Like Fitness+, it will employ trainers to lead exercises, including workout celebrity Jillian Michaels.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman is another major fitness video platform making its debut this week. The startup recently closed an $8 million round. Like Fitness+, its biotracking is built around the Apple Watch, showcasing heart rate and calories burned, among other metrics. The service compares its offering to a “masterclass” for fitness.</p>
<p>Partners include leading athletes and celebrities like Crossfit champion Kara Saunders, fitness celebrity Amanda Cerny, coach Johannes Bartl, hybrid athlete and coach Kris Gethin and MindSize CEO Christian Straka to name a few. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app also integrates biofeedback via its Apple Watch integration to measure and improve the efficacy of meditation and workouts. Compared to Calm and Headspace&#8217;s celebrity content approach, Ultrahuman uses a technology platform-based approach to improve experience and long-term results.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/fitness-wont-replace-the-gym-but-it-will-help-you-break-a-sweat/embed/#?secret=PG9spLbhpH" data-secret="PG9spLbhpH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These services set themselves apart from the likes of Mirror, Peloton and new offerings from the likes of NordicTrack, in that these technologies ditch the heavy exercise equipment, lowering the barrier of entry (though I suppose Samsung’s does require a big, expensive TV). The fact is that demand will decrease when people feel more comfortable going to the gym. That will certainly shake out the industry to a certain extent.</p>
<p>For many people, however, once the secrets of home fitness have been unlocked, they may never want to visit the gym again.</p>

In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://future.ventures/">Future Ventures</a> &#8212; cofounded by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko, a colleague of Jurvetson at his last firm, DFJ, as well as an investor previously with Airbus Ventures and Khosla Ventures &#8212; has closed its second fund with $200 million in capital commitments, say the pair.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday afternoon, Jurvetson characterized the fund as &#8220;dramatically oversubscribed in a fairly short period of time,&#8221; adding that roughly one-third of its investors are venture capitalists or other investors, that the &#8220;second largest bucket [comprises] tech executives, CEOs, and former CEOs of enormous companies of relevance to our ecosystem&#8221; and that the last third of the firm&#8217;s capital is coming from institutions, including one university endowment. (He didn&#8217;t specify which.)</p>
<p>As with Future&#8217;s $200 million debut fund, which closed two years ago, the outfit&#8217;s newest vehicle has a 15-year time horizon, giving it more leeway to make longer-term bets. Jurvetson also confirmed that as with that debut fund, Future features fairly standard economics, including charging 2.5% in management fees and 25% in so-called carried interest (meaning the share of the profits that Future keeps from its investments).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We tell our LPs, &#8216;Look, this is a long game, these companies take longer than five to seven years to come to full maturity,'&#8221; said Jurvetson, who has been on the board of SpaceX since 2009 and, along with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/business/tesla-directors-resign.html"> three other directors</a>, left the board of Tesla in September, following a 13-year run as a director. &#8220;They may go public in that timeframe. But as you can see with Tesla and SpaceX and some of the greatest tech stories of our day, you really would regret having feel pressured to punch out early when they&#8217;re really in the greatest phases of torrid growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Future&#8217;s new fund could have been bigger. Jurvetson has been doing business with Elon Musk for more than 20 years, and beyond his early involvement with SpaceX and Tesla, Future participated in the first round of Musk&#8217;s tunnel-based transportation system, Boring Company.</p>
<p>The firm also wrote the first check to Musk&#8217;s neurotechnology startup, Neuralink, which last summer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/take-a-closer-look-at-elon-musks-neuralink-surgical-robot/">unveiled its progress</a> toward developing implantable brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes that Musk helps will eventually help to cure conditions like Alzheimer’s and dementia, among other things.</p>
<p>Though SpaceX is now an 18-year-old company, Future has a stake in that business, too. In fact, Future&#8217;s first check went to Space X, and the firm last year raised a $100 million SpaceX SPV (special purpose vehicle) in just five days &#8212; capital that Saenko said came from most of the fund&#8217;s investors, who were given the option of participating if they wanted.</p>
<p>These pop-up type funds won&#8217;t happen routinely, according to Jurvetson. &#8220;We communicated in our fundraising that a special situation, maybe two, would occur where we do a later-stage, large check, single investment in a company we have immense conviction in, and we didn&#8217;t anticipate that to happen right away, but the opportunity to reopen the prior year&#8217;s round [in SpaceX] and join an extension of that close made it very tempting to do on behalf of the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>The broader plan is to continue committing smaller amounts to startups &#8212; $3.8 million on average &#8212; and for that funding to be the first that the teams raise. Future intends to invest in roughly 20 companies altogether from the new fund &#8212; as with the last &#8212; and to take a more relaxed view on board seats than might other firms.</p>
<p>Part of that owes to necessity, suggests Saenko, noting that she and Jurvetson only have so much bandwidth. But she also said she could &#8220;not think of a single situation where we&#8217;re not fully in the information flow of the company&#8221; even without a director role, which is often why VCs insist on one.</p>
<p>In the meantime, well beyond its Musk-related bets, Future has been assembling a portfolio that&#8217;s wide-ranging, with investments tied to cellular manufacturing, longevity, and edge AI, among other things.</p>
<p>It just led a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/sensei-gets-uma-thurman-tesla-board-member-as-investors">follow-on round</a> in <a href="https://senseibio.com/">Sensei Biotherapeutics</a>, a 21-year-old, Boston-based developer of personalized cancer drugs that&#8217;s planning a public offering this year and which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a> to induce an adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>Future &#8212; which is also investor in the lab-grown meat producer <a href="https://www.memphismeats.com/">Memphis Meats</a> &#8212; is also very focused right now on regenerative agriculture and permaculture, which is an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>Said Saenko, &#8220;I think it would behoove all of us to look at our food industry and ask what are the ways in which we are currently feeding our global population that are unsustainable in the future, given the number of people that we have and are going to continue having on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>What doesn&#8217;t interest the pair remotely are other trends sweeping the venture industry right now, from space investing to moving from California.</p>
<p>On space investing, Jurvetson &#8212; who led DFJ&#8217;s investment in both SpaceX and the satellite company Planet &#8212; said it&#8217;s far too crowded now (&#8220;though I&#8217;m going to be a space tourist one day for sure&#8221;).</p>
<p>As for moving &#8212; as Musk did recently to Austin &#8212; Saenko isn&#8217;t going anywhere, she said. Neither is Jurvetson, who spent 12 years in Texas, including in high school, and has no interest in returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly,&#8221; he said yesterday, &#8220;many of my friends have punched out and gone to Texas or Florida.&#8221; He berates them for it, too, he said, explaining: &#8220;If you become wealthy enough as an investor or an entrepreneur such that you could choose to live anywhere you want in your life, why in the world would you pick up and go to some godforsaken place now? Just to avoid capital gains tax? How about, for example, donate to charity instead and avoid that capital gains tax?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a &#8220;different way to look at the world rather than just trying to do wealth transfer and preservation across generations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That just feels so short-sighted to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get them started on the blank-check companies that have come into vogue as a path for more automotive companies in particular to become publicly traded. For example, Lucid Motors, the California EV startup that gave up majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund last year in exchange for $1.3 billion, is reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/lucid-motors-said-to-be-in-talks-to-list-via-michael-klein-spac">in talks to go public</a> through a merger with one of the special purpose acquisition vehicles of Wall Street veteran Michael Klein.</p>
<p>Faraday Future, another electric vehicle startup, is <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/faraday-future-spac-targeting-3-billion-public-debut-electric-vehicles-2021-1-1029956718">reportedly looking to go public</a> via a merger with a separate SPAC sponsor.</p>
<p>Asked what Future Ventures makes of the trend, Jurvetson &#8212; who experienced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/confirmed-six-months-after-leaving-dfj-steve-jurvetson-is-starting-new-venture-firm/">high-profile split</a> from DFJ in 2017 (DFJ has continued on as <a href="https://dfjgrowth.com/">DFJ Growth</a>) &#8212;  did not mince words about the electric vehicle category especially. &#8220;It would be really refreshing if a decent company was included in the mix, but it is just a rogue&#8217;s gallery of horrific companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mostly, he continued, &#8220;these are companies that are unable to raise a penny from any other source&#8221; at this point in their trajectory.</p>
<p>Saenko was more diplomatic if no more optimistic about some of the related deals being struck right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not saying that every SPAC company is a terrible company,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think what we&#8217;re saying is that everyone should be very wary of these companies because of Steve&#8217;s point that they&#8217;re early-stage companies and the SPAC is solely a fundraising system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Public market investors &#8220;expect a particular level of maturity and progress and meaningful forecasting from the companies that are on the public markets,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and that&#8217;s just not going to be true of the vast majority of the companies that have gone through SPACs. And that could have a potentially terrible blowback on the entire tech industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Visa and Plaid called off their agreement this afternoon, ending the consumer credit giant&#8217;s takeover of the data-focused fintech API startup.</p>
<p>The deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/">valued at $5.3 billion at the time of its announcement</a>, first broke cover on January 13, 2020, or nearly one year ago to the day. However, the Department of Justice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/doj-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visas-5-3-billion-acquisition-of-plaid/">filed suit to block the deal in November of 2020</a>, arguing that the combination would &#8220;eliminate a nascent competitive threat that would likely result in substantial savings and more innovative online debit services for merchants and consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time Visa argued that the government&#8217;s point of view was &#8220;flawed.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, today the two companies confirmed the deal is officially off. In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112006080/en/Visa-and-Plaid-Announce-Mutual-Termination-of-Merger-Agreement">a release</a> Visa wrote that it could have eventually executed the deal, but that &#8220;protracted and complex litigation&#8221; would take lots of time to sort out.</p>
<p>It all got too hard, in other words.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret: &#8216;Every company is a fintech company&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/plaids-zach-perret-every-company-is-a-fintech-company/embed/#?secret=RFLE9k44VS" data-secret="RFLE9k44VS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Plaid was a bit more upbeat in its own notes, writing that in the last year it has seen &#8220;an unprecedented uptick in demand for the services powered by Plaid.&#8221; Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">the fintech boom that 2020 saw</a>, as consumers flocked to free stock trading apps and neobanks, that Plaid saw growth last year is not surprising. After all, Plaid&#8217;s product sits between consumers and fintech companies, so if those parties were executing more transactions, the API startup likely saw more demand for its own offerings.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Plaid for comment on its plans as an independent company, also asking how quickly it grew during 2020. <em><strong>Update: </strong>Plaid responded to TechCrunch noting that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. If we presume even moderate net dollar retention amongst its customer base, Plaid could have grown by triple-digits last year, in percentage terms.</em></p>
<p>While the Visa-Plaid deal was merely a single transaction, its scuttling doesn&#8217;t bode well for other fintech startups and unicorns that might have eyed an exit to a wealthy incumbent. The Department of Justice, in other words, may have undercut the chances of M&amp;A exits for a number of fintech-focused startups or at least created more skittishness around that possible exit path.</p>
<p>If so, expected exit valuations for fintech upstarts could fall. And that could ding both fintech-focused venture capital activity, and the price at which startups in the niche can raise funds. If the Visa-Plaid deal was a huge boon to fintech companies that used it as a signpost to help raise money at new, higher valuations, the inverse may also prove true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sono Motors wants to bring technology it developed for its solar electric car to the masses. And it&#8217;s starting with autonomous shuttle startup EasyMile.</p>
<p>The German-based startup said Tuesday during a presentation at the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that it will license its solar body panel technology to other companies. EasyMile, which provides electric autonomous shuttle buses to governments, universities and other companies, will be the first to integrate the solar body panels onto its vehicles, according to Sono Motors co-founder and CEO Laurin Hahn, who made the announcement after the company&#8217;s next-generation Sion solar electric car was revealed.</p>
<p>From afar, the Sono Motors&#8217; electric Sion vehicle looks like a compact car with black paint. Upon closer inspection, the entire exterior of the vehicle is actually comprised of hundreds of solar cells that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This makes them <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lighter, robust, cheaper and more efficient than any other technology available at the present in the markets, according to Arun Ramakrishnan, senior solar integration manager at Sono Motors, who added that they can be integrated into almost any object. </span></p>
<p>The solar body panels are lightweight — comparable to traditional body panels on today&#8217;s modern cars — and the polymer coating prevents the cells from splintering, the company said.</p>
<p>These solar cells convert sunlight into energy, which is stored in the vehicle&#8217;s battery. The solar cells, which work if a vehicle is driving or parked, can add up nearly 21.7 miles of range per day on the Sion car, the company said, noting that these stats are based on average weather in Munich.</p>
<p>The aim is to make vehicles less dependent on charging infrastructure, Hahn said.</p>

<p>The solar body panels aren&#8217;t designed to replace traditional charging methods. However, it can reduce how often the vehicle needs to be plugged in. Sono Motors noted that the solar integration in the Sion car extends the need to plug in from once a week to every four weeks, stats based on an average daily commute in Germany of 10 miles.</p>
<p>Sono Motors showed Tuesday a trailer outfitted with the solar body panels, just one use case for the technology. The trailer, which is just a prototype, is capable of generating up to 80 kilowatt hours per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just imagine the massive potential,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ramakrishnan said, noting that the tech could be used by </span>refrigerated trucks or other fleets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/">Techstars</a>, a network of startup accelerators and a venture capital fund, announced that <a href="https://twitter.com/maellegavet?lang=en">Maëlle Gavet</a> is its new CEO. Former CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Brown</a> will stay on Techstars&#8217; board, while the group&#8217;s other co-founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcohen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">David Cohen</a>, will become the chairman of its board.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Gavet this morning about her new job, the timing of the change, the company&#8217;s plans for expansion and her goals in the role.</p>
<p>Gavet, who said she was brought aboard to help Techstars grow, detailed her work experience at prior roles in companies of greater scale and multiple geographies, including Compass and Booking.com.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch was curious how large the startup market is, and how much space is left in different geographies and niches for Techstars and others to expand into. Gavet said that she had asked the same question to Techstars when she was being recruited for her new role. She said there is a wealth of overlooked talent and underinvested geographies that could be empowered and unlocked with capital and help. Techstars wants to go find those founders and invest in them. <em><strong>Update:</strong> The language in this paragraph was edited after publication for clarity.</em></p>
<p>That means, we presume, more accelerators in more places investing in more founders.</p>
<p>Gavet told TechCrunch that Techstars has invested in over 2,300 companies and is putting capital into around 500 yearly.</p>
<p>The new CEO explained that she believes it is possible to generate strong returns for her investors while providing lots of support for entrepreneurs and having a positive social impact. That&#8217;s an ambitious list of things to execute at once, but if she succeeds her effort could help diversify the world of tech entrepreneurs, something that has long been needed.</p>
<p>Seeing a startup exchange leaders to optimize for different, and larger-scale, operating experience is not rare. For a meta-startup, an accelerator-and-investing concern, to do the same is not surprising.</p>
<p>TechCrunch regularly covers accelerator cohorts, including Techstars (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/five-favorite-techstars-startups-ahead-of-its-next-rush-of-demo-days/">some recent</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/10-favorite-startups-from-techstars-october-2020-class/">notes here</a>) and Y Combinator, among other programs. Some of tech&#8217;s biggest names have come out of such accelerator groups, historically, including Airbnb (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">now public</a>) from<a href="https://twitter.com/mwseibel?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Michael Seibel</a>-led <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>, TalkDesk (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/talkdesk-series-c--500e9b13">worth over $3 billion</a>) from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinesltsai/">Christine Tsai</a>-led <a href="https://500.co/">500 Startups</a>, and Techstars&#8217; own SendGrid (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/twilio-acquires-email-api-platform-sendgrid-for-2-billion-in-stock/">bought by Twilio for $2 billion</a>).</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where Techstars takes its accelerator model next &#8212; the group sometimes partners with companies, or groups like the United States Air Force to sponsor and support tailored programs &#8212; in terms of location and focus. But if it can successfully help diversify the founder pool at the same time as making itself money, it will underscore how others in its market could do better.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the initial shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided for businesses, one of its main legacies is how it ushered in a tidal wave of accelerated digital transformation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/covid-19-digital-engagement-report">A recent Twilio survey</a> revealed that 97% of global enterprise decision-makers believe the pandemic sped up their company’s digital transformation, and on top of that, 79% of the respondents said that COVID-19 increased the budget for digital transformation.</p>
<p>As technology becomes the driving force of competitive differentiation, cloud plays a key role in making this a reality and impacts everything from data and analytics to the modern workplace. Cloud-based infrastructure promises more flexibility, scale and cost-effectiveness, as well as enables enterprises to have more agile application development and keep up with service demand.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			What’s clear is that despite shortfalls in security, innovation in cloud and infrastructure will charge ahead.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Even with all of the hype and excitement around cloud’s potential, it is still early days. In his recent keynote at AWS re:Invent, the <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/cloud/andy-jassy-speed-is-not-preordained-its-a-choice/d/d-id/1339571?">AWS CEO Andy Jassy mentioned</a> that spending on cloud computing is still only 4% of the overall IT market. And <a href="https://twitter.com/jaminball/status/1318675611557056512">a Barclays CIO survey</a> found that enterprises have 30% of their workloads running in the public cloud, with the expectation to increase to 39% in 2021.</p>
<p>It’s become clear that the movement to cloud has its barriers and that large enterprises are often skittish to make the jump. <a href="https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020">Flexera’s State of the Cloud 2020 report</a> outlined some of these top cloud challenges, citing security as #1. This has been widely apparent in conversations that I’ve had with Fortune 500 CISOs and security teams, who are wary of the shift from their current state of security operations. Some of the major concerns brought up include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer your own master. When working with the public cloud providers, companies must relinquish control to some aspects of back-end management. This is tough for large enterprises who have a history of customizing products because you can’t completely tailor the environment to your liking and are limited to what’s on the cloud service provider’s platform.</li>
<li>Lack of standardization. Each cloud provider has their own solutions and own intricacies. Add to that other pitfalls, like an unknown cadence of updates, there is an opaqueness to interoperability and policies can’t be uniformly applied across environments.</li>
<li>Requires a new skill set. Lack of resources/expertise ranks among the top challenges for enterprises.<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/86-of-it-decision-makers-believe-shortage-of-talent-will-slow-down-2020-cloud-projects-301004464.html"> A recent report on challenges in cloud transformation</a> found that 86% of IT decision-makers believe shortage of talent will slow down 2020 cloud projects.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
