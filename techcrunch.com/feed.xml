										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salespeople have more tools than ever these days to help them with their work, whether they are tools to source new leads, keep those leads interested or informed about what&#8217;s being sold, to track how the sales process is going, to manage those relationships once they are secured, or accounting tools to manage how and where sales are actually coming in. Today, a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help manage the data entry that powers all of that is announcing a swift round of funding to build on momentum and interest in its technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dooly.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a> &#8212; which has built a set of AI-based tools to automate the busywork that goes into updating data in sales software, specifically apps like Salesforce, in order to get the most out of that software &#8212; has closed $80 million in funding. Sources tell us that the money values the Vancouver-based startup at over $300 million.</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;swift&#8221; round in that efforts to raise and close the funding happened quickly, and come not two months after the company had announced a Series A and seed round totaling $20 million. (In fact, we got wind of this round a couple of weeks ago, so arguably it was less than two months since the previous announcement.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest Series B is being led by Spark Capital, with Greenspring, Tiger Global, Lachy Groom, boldstart ventures, BoxGroup and Addition also participating. Several of these are repeat investors.</p>
<p>Investor interest in the company is coming in part because of what Dooly is adding to the bigger mix of sales tools; and in part because of the traction it has already picked up for that.</p>
<p>While there are indeed a number of apps that salespeople can use these days, that has presented something of a predicament for many salespeople: tending to the data in each of these, updating records and helping them tick along, can be a very time-consuming task that takes people away from doing what they do best.</p>
<p>That predicament has perhaps been heightened in the last year, as organizations push for &#8220;digital transformation&#8221; &#8212; investing in newer IT &#8212; to better adapt to workforces that are not in the office all the time, and in many cases haven&#8217;t been in an office together for a year and with some perhaps never to return again. That&#8217;s in many cases translated to using a ton more software to manage those people, what they do, and how they engage with each other when in-person is not an option.</p>
<p>Dooly&#8217;s proposition is that it uses AI tools like natural language processing to let people take notes on meetings and other work which it then intelligently can feed into other applications to let them work as they should.</p>
<p>Kris Hartvigsen, Dooly&#8217;s CEO himself experienced these pain points firsthand as a top salesperson for a number of other companies and this served as his motivation for building Dooly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was born out of pain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I was in a previous role as a top sales performer, I was constantly in this mode that eroded my time. The headwinds now are for remote working, but not everyone is benefitting from this remote world as much as Zoom is. Some are finding it harder to hit their numbers so you want to spend more time, not less, speaking to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">He describes his business as &#8220;the table cloth that goes over the table that no one wants to sit at&#8221; and more seriously, &#8220;a clean overlay to systems&#8221; that is very aware of the challenges salespeople face on a practical, operational level. &#8220;We are always mindful of thinking of workflows that hinder users from peak value mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>The the app, in his words, &#8220;plays nice&#8221; with a <a href="https://www.dooly.ai/product/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of services</a> both to ingest information &#8212; these, for example, include tools like Gong that among other things monitor voice-based sales calls to provide real-time feedback and transcripts), as well as those that are used to record what is going on, like Salesforce. It also integrates with Slack and G-Suite and other popular apps.</p>
<p>Then, in addition to being able to use and populate relevant data easily across multiple apps, Dooly also provides some guidance, based on the data it is seeing, to give suggestions on closing deals.</p>
<p>This is music to many salespeople&#8217;s ears, it seems. It now has some 500 businesses as customers, and says the list includes revenue teams at Asana, BigCommerce, Contentful, Figma, Intercom, Lessonly, and Procore, and more.</p>
<p>Up to now, the company has been growing organically, through word-of-mouth &#8212; which is perhaps the best kind of sales pitch and success that any company can hope for. Ironically, now that it&#8217;s model has been well proven out, it will quite possibly be using its own tools to expand its reach even more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Dooly</span> is building one of the most consequential enterprise companies of the next decade,” said Will Reed, a general partner at Spark Capital. “We are thrilled to support <span class="il">Dooly</span> as it continues to power the most forward-thinking revenue teams, and believe it will ultimately define the connected workspace category via its relentless focus on customers and product-led growth.&#8221; Reed is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumers are moving into investing to complement &#8212; or in some cases, offset &#8212; less good returns from things like traditional savings accounts with low interest rates or pensions, and today one of the bigger &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; in Europe helping to open up that opportunity is announcing a monster round of funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://traderepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic</a>, which lets people buy and sell shares, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), derivatives and (most recently) cryptocurrency by way of a mobile app that does not charge commissions (but does have a <a href="https://traderepublic.com/en-de/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fee structure for various services</a>), has raised $900 million in a Series C round of funding that values the Berlin startup at over $5 billion.</p>
<p>The funding has a very strong bench of investors behind it. It is being led by Sequoia, with new backers TCV and Thrive Capital, as well as previous backers Accel, Founders Fund, Creandum and Project A, also participating. Accel and Founders Fund co-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/trade-republic-a-german-robinhood-raises-67m-led-by-accel-and-founders-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Republic&#8217;s Series B a year ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment catapults the Berlin-based startup into being of the biggest privately-held fintech businesses in the region, and while Trade Republic is currently only active in Germany, Austria and France, Christian Hecker (who co-founded the company with Marco Cancellieri and Thomas Pischke) said the startup will be using the funds to expand to many more countries (which will include not just sorting out licenses to do so, but implementing larger regional operations, hence the large round of funding).</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our ambition to be present across the entire Eurozone in the next four months,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch. That might logically start with the biggest markets in the region, which would mean Spain and Italy, followed by Benelux, Ireland, and Finland.</p>
<p>Hecker&#8217;s view is that what Trade Republic provides is a resource that everyone should be able to access. &#8220;It really hurts me to see that the those demographic or macroeconomic factors [that are impacting users in Germany, France and Austria] are basically burning all continental European countries. So I think that&#8217;s really, really important we launch in all of those nations.&#8221; The UK is also on the target list, he noted, but Brexit has definitely thrown a proverbial spanner into the works on sorting that one out.</p>
<p>The turning tides of consumer habits, and economic trends, are indeed playing in favor of apps like Trade Republic that are giving people a crack at investing, an area of financial services that has traditionally been reserved for wealthier individuals with large sums of money and access to brokers to help them manage that.</p>
<p>For more ordinary people in Europe, interest rates have been at an all-time low, making traditional savings a less-compelling way of growing money; and given the rate of inflation, there are concerns that state pensions &#8212; Social Security, as it&#8217;s known in the U.S. &#8212; will not be enough for average consumers to live on in their later years without a supplement, while private pension plans are not widely used to supplement that already.</p>
<p>Enter &#8220;neo-brokers&#8221; who are leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones and mobile apps, and a growing acceptance of carrying out financial services like payments or banking using them, to build a new approach to investing, one that is far more accessible to a wider pool of consumers by splitting the stock investing into increments or making way to invest in funds that are composites of many stocks; or indeed giving users a way of investing into alternative areas like cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Or, as Hecker sums it up: &#8220;We have negative interest rates, and we have inflation, and we have a huge pension gap. All three factors demand that you need to do something for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has meant a massive shift in stock trading that has led to the rise of a number of new players, including Robinhood in the U.S. (which has tried but has yet to make a move into Europe); eToro, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in March</a> announced it was going public by way of a SPAC valuing it at $10 billion; Bux, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bux-a-european-robinhood-raises-80m-to-expand-its-neo-broker-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $80 million</a> just last month; and neo-bank Revolut, which also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/revolut-launches-stock-trading-in-limited-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides stock trading services</a>. It is also leading to the growth of completely new approaches to the concept, such as Rally creating a new market for investing in collectibles, and most recently NFTs to turn &#8220;everything&#8221; into an investible asset. Rally too <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005143/en/Rally-Raises-30-Million-Series-B-Led-by-Accel-To-Make-Everything-in-the-World-a-Tradable-Asset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $30 million led by Accel this week</a>.</p>
<p>All those trends, and the wider rise of services to let you trade by phone, has led to a huge boost for Trade Republic. Last year when announcing its Series B, Trade Republic said it had more than €1 billion under management. Now, that figure has ballooned to €6 billion, coming from just 1 million customers in the three markets where the startup is active: Germany, Austria and France.</p>
<p>Doing the math on that, customers on average are putting some €6,000 per account into Trade Republic, although in practice &#8212; and as a mark of the &#8220;democratization&#8221; that the company touts as part of its mass-market appeal &#8212; some are putting significantly less, and some significantly more, than that amount.</p>
<p>Hecker said that some users are earmarking as much as 20-30% of their salaries or savings on a monthly basis, and the idea is not so much about quick returns from quick trades, as it is about people looking longer-term gains.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve never been a trading platform,&#8221; Hecker said, referring to the fact that many people tread their Trade Republic accounts as a savings plan. And for that reason, he wouldn&#8217;t really be drawn out on what kind of returns people could expect from the investments except to say that they are in line with how the general market provides gains, and would depend on what you invest in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what&#8217;s very exciting about being a savings plan is that it&#8217;s not only bound to short term returns,&#8221; he said, noting that a recent customer survey found that 70% of Trade Republic&#8217;s customers &#8220;are not looking for short-term gains, or investing with the sole purpose to benefit from the average buying effect.&#8221; Users, he said, &#8220;believe in trends, like sustainability, or the ability of the U.S. technology industry to really grow for the next 10 to 30 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding and valuation, and the story that the company likes to tell about its potential to help the average consumer have a better financial outcome with what money they have to hand, certainly seem to set up the startup to begin positioning itself as a more permanent part of the financial fabric, although as we have unfortunately seen, that can be a slippery idea not just in the world of financial services, but in the world of startups, too.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the fact that the company has a banking license comes in handy: it means that customers get deposit insurance of up to €100,000 per account (similar to how the FDIC backs banks in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Sequoia has been a strong investor in fintechs, backing the likes of Klarna and Nubank, and this comes as the firm is expanding its reach in the region after opening its first European office, in London.</p>
<p>“The democratization of financial markets will be one of the most important consumer trends of the next decade,&#8221; says Doug Leone, partner at Sequoia, in a statement. &#8220;Trade Republic is on the leading edge of this trend and has attracted an untapped generation of European savers who demand increased financial accessibility. We’re thrilled to partner with Christian, Thomas, Marco and their team as they deliver a product and experience that customers love.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments are going mainstream around the world. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 mobile money providers with over 100,000 active users, according to a <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf">report</a> published by GSMA, an industry association for mobile network operators. Altogether, over 300 million mobile money accounts were active every month around the world.</p>
<p>Mobile money providers &#8212; more commonly known as e-wallets &#8212; are used to transfer money, pay and receive payments through mobile phones without the need for a traditional bank. They are useful so long as they enjoy wide adoption and a strong network effect. But even a popular service like Ant Groups&#8217;s Alipay, which has over one billion annual users, is practically unusable outside China due to its low penetration in most countries.</p>
<p>The problem is there is no interoperability between most wallets as there is between traditional banks, suggested Xue Zhixiang, who worked on the basic infrastructure for Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit and Alipay before starting <a href="https://walletsclub.com/">WalletsClub</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Registered in Hong Kong in 2019 with a small operational team in mainland China, WalletsClub sets its sights on becoming the Visa for digital wallets, making money transfers possible between the world&#8217;s hundreds of electronic money services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are like a clearinghouse for digital wallets,&#8221; said Xue, the company&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>A clearing system is an intermediary for two parties engaged in a financial transaction. It&#8217;s designed to ensure the efficiency and security of a transfer by validating the availability of the funds and logging the transfer between two transacting parties. Payments can be sent and received in real-time using WalletsClub, Xue claimed, and its technology is based on the &#8220;ISO 20022&#8221; standard, a common language for financial institutions to exchange data across the globe.</p>
<p>In other words, WalletsClub is going after the hundreds of e-wallets around the world rather than individual end-users. Its vision is to let people pay with any mobile wallet anywhere as long as the sender&#8217;s service provider or financial institution and the receiver&#8217;s equivalent services are members of WalletsClub, similar to how Visa and Mastercard process credit cards issued by different banks that are in their networks. The company plans to monetize by charging a flat fee per transaction.</p>
<p>By adding interoperability to electronic wallets, even small, regional players can thrive because they gain compatibility wherever a clearing system is in place.</p>
<p>Instead of challenging the traditional financial system, WalletsClub wants to provide a way for unbanked individuals to easily move money around through digital wallets, which are easier to obtain than a bank account. A big demand will come from overseas migrant workers who need to send money back to their home countries, such as the millions of Southeast Asian workers abroad.</p>
<p>WalletsClub is potentially encroaching on the territory of a few players. Expatriate workers sending money home currently revert to longstanding remittance services like Western Union or MoneyGram, which have large networks of &#8220;agent&#8221; locations where users go send or collect money. In 2018, Alipay began allowing users in Hong Kong to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180625005561/en/AlipayHK-and-GCash-Launch-Cross-Border-Remittance-Service-Powered-by-Alipay%E2%80%99s-Blockchain-Technology">send money to GCash accounts</a> in the Philippines, but &#8220;the focus of Ant Group is payments rather than remittance,&#8221; Xue observed.</p>
<p>In 2019, money sent home from diaspora workers became the largest source of external financing in low- and middle-income countries excluding China, <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/money-sent-home-workers-now-largest-source-external-financing-low-and-middle-income">according to World Bank data</a>. The money flows amounted to over $500 billion and surpassed the levels of foreign direct investment in these regions.</p>
<p>The other type of business that a clearinghouse for mobile wallets could threaten is cross-border payment aggregators, which save merchants from having to integrate with various digital payment methods.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge for the nascent startup is to establish trust with clients. At this stage, WalletsClub in talks with electronic money services founded by Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada. Chinese-made wallets are especially plentiful in emerging markets, thanks to these founders&#8217; learning from China&#8217;s fintech boom over the decade. Many of them found it hard to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">compete with behemoths like Tencent and Ant</a>, let alone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">China&#8217;s tightening regulations around fintech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we reach 20 members and have several hundreds of transactions between every pair of members on a daily basis, we are basically profitable,&#8221; said Xue, adding that the goal is to onboard a dozen customers by this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We live in a world where companies have to send out ‘gifts’ to individuals. Chocolate bars. Bottles of wine. You name it. Companies are gifting it. But right now, that operation is buried in a marketing department on a spreadsheet, as is mostly pretty disorganized.</p>
<p>A handful of startups realized it could be done better and at scale, among them Sendoso (which has raised $52.7M) and ReachDesk ($6M).</p>
<p>Joining this clan is a startup with the tortuous name of “&amp;Open” (yes, ‘ampersand open’, pronounced ‘And Open’ for those of you at the back).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suffice it to say, that despite its name it’s raised $7.2 million to makes it easier for brands to send carefully gifts to customers to boost loyalty and engagement. First Round Capital and LocalGlobe led the Seed round along with participation from angel investors including Andrew Robb (Farfetch), Des Traynor (Intercom) and Liam Casey (PCH). The funds will be used to scale to Europe and the US. Currently &amp;Open claims to deliver more than 3,500 gifts every week.</p>
<p>Dublin-based &amp;Open launched in 2017 and was founded by Ciara Flood, formerly buyer at Net-a-Porter and part of the founding team at Mr Porter, together with her husband Jonathan Legge, and her and brother-in-law, Mark Legge. The brothers previously founded the high-end gift and homeware venture Makers &amp; Brothers.</p>
<p>&amp;Open (please God, take me now&#8230;) counts Airbnb, Spotify, and Peloton among their customers.</p>
<p>Gifting can be powerful. According to one <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-retail-study-shows-marketers-under-leverage-emotional-connection-300720049.html">study</a> which the company cites, customers who feel emotionally connected to a brand have been shown to create a 306% higher lifetime value. This is in stark contrast to existing, traditional Meanwhile, Schemes like corporate gifts, branded merchandise, loyalty programmes, and vouchers <a href="https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Forrester-Future-of-CX.pdf">don’t work</a>, claims &amp;Open.</p>
<p>Jonathan Legge said: “Customers will choose brands who prioritize care and connection over transactional relationships. A thoughtful gift can make all the difference — both for a customer’s experience and their advocacy and loyalty to a brand.”</p>
<p>Hayley Barna, Partner at First Round Capital, said: “Gone are the days of relying on a points-based loyalty scheme to keep your customers engaged and happy. Brands increasingly need to work harder to retain customers and &amp;Open provides an elegant solution to this conundrum.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cervest.earth/">Cervest</a> &#8211; a startup with a platform that claims to quantify climate risk across multiple decades and threats down to the asset level &#8211; has raised a  $30 million Series A round led by Draper Esprit. Previous investors Astanor Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital (Chris Sacca), and Future Positive Capital also participated in the round, and were joined by new investors UNTITLED, the venture fund of Magnus Rausing, and TIME Ventures, the venture fund of Marc Benioff. Cervest’s total funding now stands at $36.2 million. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/cervest-raises-3-7m-for-earth-science-ai-platform-to-predict-climate-effects/">previously</a> raised $5.2M in 2019.</p>
<p>Cervest’s competitors include Jupiter Intelligence, which has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jupiter-intelligence">raised</a> $35M to Series B level,  but Cervest claims it has a more data + AI approach.</p>
<p>The company will use the new funding to expand in the U.S. and European markets through its freemium model<br />
It’s widely accepted now, with unpredictable weather patterns and clear climate “weirding” that these weather events are of huge risk to trillions of dollars of physical assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cervest says its &#8220;Climate Intelligence” platform has been built through peer-reviewed research over the five years and combines public and private data sources (i.e. NOAA, ECMWF, CMIP6), machine learning, and statistical science to come up with a view of climate risks to assets.</p>
<p>&#8216;EarthScan&#8217; will be its first product, giving enterprises and governments a view on how flooding, droughts, and extreme temperatures can impact the assets they own or manage,going back 50 years and looking forward 80 years.</p>
<p>Iggy Bassi, Founder and CEO of Cervest said: &#8220;Climate Intelligence is Business Intelligence for managing climate risk. Climate volatility has thrown us into a new era where Climate Intelligence needs to be integrated into all decisions. Organizations that fail to do so risk being blindsided by climate events such as the recent floods and fires in Australia, the droughts in Europe, and the winter freeze in Texas. Much of the spotlight is on decarbonization today. While this is absolutely necessary, it is not sufficient to build asset-level resilience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vinoth Jayakumar, Partner and Fintech Practice Lead at Draper Esprit added: &#8220;Climate Tech has grabbed a lot of attention recently, with good reason… Cervest&#8217;s pioneering approach to quantifying risk, in a way that was never before possible, means we can better understand the economics of the problem and bring real-world market solutions to bear.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy US startup Pipe — which claims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue” — has just raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation? The secret for the hype? It gives SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by &#8220;pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts&#8221;, as my colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Mary Ann Azevedo so eloquently put it</a>.</p>
<p>Virtually the same model is about to hit Europe in various guises, and the newest of the crop will be  <a href="https://www.weareuncapped.com/">Uncapped</a>, a London-based startup that plans to extend the model not just to SaaS companies but also to the booming sector of E-commerce.</p>
<p>It’s now raised an $80 million combined funding round of debt and equity to launch a suite of banking services tailored to the needs of this new wave of tech-driven companies. The round was led by Lakestar. Uncapped’s previous investors include All Iron Ventures, White Star Capital, Global Founders Capital, and Mouro Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company plans to use the cash to move into the banking space, with new products and services. Last year, the company began issuing Visa cards.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Uncapped is positioned as an alternative to traditional debt financing and venture capital, providing companies with growth finance for a flat fee which goes down to 6%, and fast-released capital. Businesses repay the capital as they make revenue. There is no set repayment and no compounding interest, equity, or personal guarantees. There are even no credit checks or business plans required.</p>
<p>Uncapped arrives at an opportune moment. The pandemic has led to an e-commerce boom, but the sector requires much more capital than existing VCs can provide. Legacy banks don’t ‘get&#8217; new entrepreneurs. Neo Banks are trying to provide it, but can still be slow.</p>
<p>Piotr Pisarz, Co-Founder of Uncapped, said: “Digital companies are innovating and evolving faster than ever before, but their legacy banking providers are not keeping up with the pace. We want to help digital entrepreneurs with quick access to funding, insights that help their business grow, rewards they actually care about, and modern integrations that will save them time and money.”</p>
<p>“The reality is that legacy banks don’t really understand the needs of digital entrepreneurs, and their dated infrastructure is not up to the standards required to help their business grow. So it’s no surprise that 82% of business owners say they are unhappy with their bank,” Asher Ismail, Co-Founder of Uncapped, added.</p>
<p>Nicolas Brand, Partner at Lakestar, said: “The composition of our economies is changing, with digital native businesses contributing an ever-increasing share to overall GDP. Uncapped uses real-time data provided by its clients across APIs to offer bespoke credit and other novel banking services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, better known as a VC which, in its time, has backed the likes of Digg, launchrock, Meero, Summly, and Tier, among others, is moving into the hot world of crypto and blockchain with a new $50M Digital Asset Fund.</p>
<p>The special-vehicle fund will specialize in investing in crypto-networks and blockchain-enabled businesses and was previously going to be $30 million before raising more backing. Both Bpifrance and Ubisoft are among those institutions backing the new fund.</p>
<p>The fund will be run by New York-based General Partner Sep Alavi and supported by Principals Thomas Klocanas in New York and Sanjay Zimmerman in Toronto. The will deploy between $500,000 and $3.0 million in initial investments into 15-20 companies with a focus on North America and Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alavi said: “We are hyper-focused on this space and we expect to see further innovative use cases such as crypto credit, DeFi, NFTs, metaverses and more manifesting at an accelerated pace… With this fund, We are actively investing in crypto protocols, infrastructure, privacy, financial, gaming, and social use cases.”</p>
<p>The fund has already made six investments including; dfuse, Multis, Paraswap, Rally, Safello, a European crypto brokerage that went public on the Nasdaq First North stock exchange on May 12, and Ledn, a global digital asset savings, and credit platform.</p>
<p>Yoann Caujolle, managing director of Bpifrance said: &#8220;It’s critical that emerging crypto and blockchain-enabled startups receive investment from firms and professionals who have the experience and knowledge to help drive their businesses forward,” said “We’re pleased to partner with the Digital Asset Fund team for bringing their support and vision into the French and European blockchain and digital asset ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Over a call, Alavi told me: “White Star is investing across three funds, obviously our fund one, fund two, and in this new specialized Digital Asset Fund. Historically we&#8217;ve invested in enterprise and consumer businesses, we’ve not done any, any blockchain, but for two years ago we&#8217;ve been looking at this sector. And we believe that this merits its own dedicated vehicle. I&#8217;ve been personally been investing in blockchain the blockchain ecosystem since 2015 and bring your five-plus years of domain expertise and then I was able to build a team around this new fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are, we&#8217;re looking at the three main verticals in this sector. The protocol layer, the infrastructure layer, and the application layer. That&#8217;s the kind of high-level thesis. The protocol layer is where we invest in tokens, because it’s important to mention that the fund will also hold tokens as investments as well as equity. On top of that, we&#8217;re pretty much agnostic and opportunistic. We see great use cases in decentralized finance. We see some great use cases in the NFT space and have made investments there as well. As long as we&#8217;re true to those three verticals that I mentioned, we will capture great value there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car ownership has become pricey and untenable in many towns and cities in Europe: between congestion charges to reduce emissions, parking fees, and traffic, many consumers opt instead to use public transportation, two wheels, cabs or their own legs to get around. To add to that mix for longer journeys, today a startup that&#8217;s building a new take on car rental is announcing some funding to scale out its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.govirtuo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtuo</a>, a Paris-based startup that has built a very streamlined, all-digital approach for those who want to rent a car for a few days, or up to a few months, has picked up $96 million, money that it will be using to invest in its tech; to expand to more markets beyond France (12 cities including Paris), UK (London, Manchester and Edinburgh) and Spain (Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia); to add in a tier for business users; and to add more vehicles into the mix. The company currently has 150,000 active users, and grew 100% (2x) this last year, said co-founder Karim Kaddoura.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise of the &#8216;staycation&#8217; boosted our business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we saw a surge in the average duration of a rental.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All-digital and streamlined in the case of Virtuo means exactly that: currently there are only two models to choose from outside of France &#8212; either a Mercedes Benz A-Class or a Mercedes GLA SUV &#8212; but there is no paperwork, with everything handled through an app, and you have the option of getting a car delivered to and picked up from you, meaning no lines in airports or hotel garages, and you get a virtual key to operate it.</p>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a $60 million Series C and $36 million in asset financing. AXA Venture Partners, the strategic investment arm of the insurance giant, led the equity round, with new investors Bpifrance, Alpha Intelligence Capital and H14; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/virtuo-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous backers</a> Balderton Capital, Iris Capital and Raise Ventures, also participating. Natixis, members of Banque Populaire and Caisse d&#8217;Epargne Group handled the asset financing.</p>
<p>While companies like Zipcar, Getaround or Turo (which has, interestingly acquired Virtuo as a Google search, and even writes &#8220;Virtuo&#8221; on its search resultshave made it easy to rent cars for a day or as little as a few hours in cities, Virtuo provides a modern take on the more traditional use case for renting cars: when you need a vehicle for longer journeys that can take up to several days, and specifically in the case of Virtuo between one and 90 days.</p>
<p>As Kaddoura &#8212; who co-founded Virtuo with Thibault Chassagne &#8212; notes, traditional car rental companies serving that market are typically still pretty rigid with how they do things.</p>
<p>Even if you initiate a process online, there is usually still paperwork that needs to be filled out in person; and you need to go to a rental hub &#8212; in an airport or a hotel, but not necessarily in your neighborhood &#8212; to pick up the car. The process for checking them out and in can also be tedious and the costs for all of this quite high, with many moments where the rental company might upsell you to make a basic price suddenly quite premium.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car rental industry itself is huge but consumers in it are completely underserved,&#8221; Kaddoura said.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the equation, there is a growing case for not owning a car if you live in a city or large town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aha-moment was when we looked into the numbers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In Paris, there are 700,000 cars parked in the streets, with twice that in London. The average European spends €7,500 per car per year when you calculate parking, insurance, damage, taxes, and the price of the car averaged out. That&#8217;s €5 billion spent by Parisians, yet those cars are idle 95% of the time. Forget the financial part and look at the impact cars have on our lives and livelihoods, occupying 50% of our urban space.&#8221; It&#8217;s all the more ironic, Kaddoura noted, given that his father is a car dealer who completely expected his son to go into business with him one day.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly because of this environmental angle that Virtuo is also going to be expanding its fleet to include more electric vehicles: it already inludes Hyundai&#8217;s Kona Electric vehicles in its fleets in France, and the plan is to expand to have 50% of its fleet electrified by 2025, with 100% of it covered by electric vehicles by 2030. It also has been offsetting 100% of its carbon footprint since January of this year.</p>
<p>The funding round being announced today comes after what has been a challenging period for any company with a business model predicated on people leaving their homes to do things, not least to do things in spaces others have recently occupied. That is to say, Covid-19 has encourage people to stay home and socially distance, so a car rental &#8212; which encourages travel and specifically travel in a vehicle someone else has been in &#8212; may be a challenging sell.</p>
<p>Although revenues grew in 2020, it&#8217;s perhaps partly because of the bigger market conditions that Virtuo somewhat slowed down its roll. When we covered its last round of funding, in 2019, the company said the money would be used to expand to Spain and Germany, and more markets in the UK, that year, and it was also live in Belgium. Now, Kaddoura confirms that now Germany will only be coming online in 2022. Milan will be as soon as later this month, he said, with the bigger plan being to be live in 10 countries by 2025. (And Belgium is no longer online, it seems.)</p>
<p>Added to its own scaling ambitions, however, the opportunity that Virtuo is targeting is not one that others have ignored. In addition to others like Getaround (which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a big round</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/uks-drover-raises-26m-for-to-take-its-car-subscription-marketplace-to-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drover</a> out of the UK, Zipcar and Turo providing more streamlined rental and car-sharing experiences, recently Uber also <a href="https://www.cartrawler.com/ct/company-news/cartrawler-partners-with-uber-to-expand-car-rentals-with-uber-rent-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded a car rental offering in partnership</a> with a third party called CarTrawler. This is not a fully integrated service like Virtuo&#8217;s, nor a peer-to-peer offering like Getaround, but something that appears to aggregate and search across the same traditional car rental companies that Virtuo is competing against. That makes it, potentially, a direct competitor.</p>
<p>“We are very proud and excited to be part of the Virtuo adventure alongside the Virtuo team, led by Karim and Thibault,” said Benoit Fosseprez, general partner at AXA Venture Partners, in a statement. “Virtuo has quickly become a tech leader disrupting the car rental space, with a clear long-term vision and strong ambitions for growth into new markets. We have been impressed by the Virtuo team and look forward to working closely together on the next stages of their development. With this investment in Virtuo, the first for our Growth II fund, we are confirming our ambition in the tech-led high growth companies segment.”</p>
<p>“We are delighted to support Virtuo in its development,&#8221; said Caroline Lebel of Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund, in a separate statement. &#8220;The company offers a true alternative to owning private cars for city dwellers who wish to use more sustainable shared mobility solutions. Born in the digital era, Virtuo’s 100% digital experience is backed by powerful technology and artificial intelligence to optimize its operations. We are convinced that the mobility of tomorrow must be built with strong technology at its core, addressing new behaviors and with the freedom of choice of a multimodal offer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The real estate market in South Korea is very fragmented, which means people often have to work with dozens of brokers before they find a new home. Founded in 2020 by a former WeWork executive, <a href="https://www.dongnae.com/">Dongnae</a> wants to create a centralized base for brokers, serving as a multiple listing system (MLS). Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/dongnae-raises-4-1-million-to-digitize-real-estate-in-south-korea/">first seed round</a> last year, Dongnae has increased its brokerage partners to more than 70. Today the startup announced it has raised a seed extension of $4.1 million, doubling its total raised to $8.2 million.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by investment fund NFX, with participation from returning investors Flybridge and MetaProp, who led Dongnae’s first seed round. NFX general partner Pete Flint, who co-founded Trulia and is a former Zillow board member, will join Dongnae’s board. The startup’s other investors include Goodwater Capital, Maple VC and strategic angel investors in South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>“It’s an exciting time of growth at our company, and we want to make sure that we are executing our go-to-market plan,” founder Matthew Shampine, who formerly ran WeWork Asia, told TechCrunch about the seed extension. “Pete Flint and [principal] Brittany Yoon at NFX bring an amazing combination of real estate expertise and Korean startup experience that will be invaluable to Dongnae.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Dongnae also announced the release of its Android app today. The company’s Android and iOS apps let potential renters and buyers look at listings and book tours of properties in the Seoul metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Shampine said that Dongnae now has more than 8,000 listings. Since its last funding announcement five months ago, Dongnae has increased its closed deal volume by more than 65% and revenue by 150%.</p>
<p>Shampine added that the new funding will be used to grow Dongnae’s brokerage network across the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for almost half of South Korea’s population, and the development of its technology and brokerage teams.</p>
<p>“At the time of our seed funding, we had just launched our brokerage partner program so we actually had one partner. The name of our first partner is Global Real Estate, based in Yongsan, and they were actually the brokerage that helped me find my personal apartment around the time we started Dongnae,” said Shampine. “They’ve been a wonderful and patient partner as our organization has grown this year, and we’ve already worked together to help a number of our customers find great homes.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Flint said, “The executive team at Dongnae is uniquely qualified considering their global backgrounds and deep local real estate expertise, and I believe the timing is perfect for Dongnae and the market need they are addressing in Korea.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zhang Yiming, the storied co-founder of ByteDance, is stepping down from his role as the CEO and passing the torch to Liang Rubo, another co-founder of the TikTok parent and one of the world&#8217;s most valuable internet juggernauts.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://bytedance.com/en/news/60a526af053cc102d640c061">internal letter</a> to employees, 38-year-old age Zhang said he is making the transition to spend more time on &#8220;long-term strategy, corporate culture, and social responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zhang will work side by side with Liang, currently ByteDance&#8217;s head of human resources and his college classmate, over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition. Zhang will remain as a member of the board at ByteDance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the sound of the letter, Zhang reminisces about the period between college and starting ByteDance in 2012 when he spent ample time thinking about the future. That led him to conclude that machine learning would revolutionize the way people encountered information and the idea laid the foundation for ByteDance’s algorithm-driven content distributors such as Toutiao and TikTok. But acting as a CEO, he said, he was preoccupied with “listening to presentations, handling approvals, and making decisions reactively.”</p>
<p>“Innovation and success are rooted in years of exploring and imagining what is possible. However, few people have real insight into the future, preferring to model on current and past achievements,” the founder wrote, citing American tech giants as role models.</p>
<p>“People are amazed by the success of electric cars, but they forget that Tesla is 18 years old and first experimented with laptop batteries to power its vehicles. People know about Apple&#8217;s software management tool HomeBrew, but few realize that computer geeks were discussing the Apple I in the HomeBrew Club in the 1970s.”</p>
<p>Zhang also recognized that he’s not the ideal manager type, saying he’s “more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles, and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work, rather than actually managing people.”</p>
<p>“Similarly, I&#8217;m not very social, preferring solitary activities like being online, reading, listening to music, and daydreaming about what may be possible.”</p>
<p>Liang appears to be a better fit for wearing the CEO hat for his experience leading R&amp;D and Lark, which started as an internal work collaboration tool and later evolved into a full-flung SaaS product sold to other enterprises.</p>
<p>Another high-profile Chinese tech boss who recently resigned from day-to-day operations was Colin Huang, founder of Alibaba’s arch rival Pinduoduo. Huang took a step back so he could allocate his energy to food and life sciences, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">areas that the e-commerce firm hopes could fuel its future growth</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power of a pickup truck is not all about torque, horsepower, towing and hauling. Ford’s newest electric F-150 Lightning, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">unveiled Wednesday</a>, is trying to change the meaning of truck power with a system that can provide energy to a customer&#8217;s home in the event of an outage.</span></p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t alone in its effort to show consumers the benefits of an all-electric vehicle. Others, such as Lucid Motors have also touted this capability.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severe winter storms in February caused a massive power outage in Texas, with more than 4.5 million homes and businesses left without power for days. 151 people were killed as a result. The F-150 Lightning&#8217;s 9.6 kW of Back Up Power can provide full home power for up to three days on a full charge of battery.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your F-150 Lightning is plugged in when your outage occurs, intelligent backup power will automatically kick in to power your home,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s energy services lead, in a video briefing prior to the reveal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When power is restored, the truck automatically reverts to charging its battery.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar, battery storage and energy services provider Sunrun has partnered with Ford to install the 80-amp Ford Charge Station Pro and home integration system, which comes standard with the extended range battery, to power the intelligent backup power system. While they’re in the neighborhood, Sunrun will also give customers the option of installing a solar and battery system for their home. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155195" style="width: 8810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155195" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2155195 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg" alt="Ford F-150 EV lightning" width="8800" height="4950" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg 8800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/8_16x9.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8800px) 100vw, 8800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2155195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who want to spend time away from home, an additional 9.6 kW Pro Power Onboard battery source, which is up from 7.2kW in the F-150 hybrid, can power anything from loudspeakers and TVs to electric dirt bikes, circular saws and jackhammers. The truck features 11 outlets in the bed, the cabin interior and the mega power “frunk” AKA front trunk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery also distributes power intelligently. So if a driver is at a worksite powering tools and the battery level falls below a third of its total range, the driver will get a notification so they can decide if they want to keep at it or save the juice for driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers also don’t need to think too much about where the nearest charging station is. They can set it and forget it, letting the truck handle switching off pro power onboard if the battery level approaches the distance it takes to get to the nearest charge. Charge information both for the Back Up Power and the Pro Power are reflected on the Ford app and the car&#8217;s infotainment screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the F-150 Lightning currently can give your home the backup power it needs, in the future, the aim is for subsequent models to be used as a home management tool, according to a Ford spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-150 Lightning is reinventing the idea of vehicle power,” said O’Gorman.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Ford F-150, the profitable cornerstone of the U.S. automaker&#8217;s business, now has an all-electric sibling.</p>
<p>Ford unveiled Wednesday the F-150 Lightning, an all-electric pickup truck that is a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $22 billion investment into electrification. The vehicle is one of a trifecta of Ford EV debuts and launches in the past year. And it is possibly the most meaningful in terms of the bottom line. The Ford F-150 Lightning, which will be built at the automaker&#8217;s Rouge factory in Dearborn, Michigan, follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and the E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers.</p>
<p>Ford had a challenging gig with the F-150 Lightning. The truck would need everything that has made its gas-powered counterpart the best-selling vehicle in North America as well as new benefits that come from going electric. That means torque, performance, towing capability and the general layout has to meet the needs of its customers, many of whom use it for commercial purposes. The vehicle specs suggest that Ford has delivered on the torque and power, while keeping the same cab and bed dimensions as its gas counterpart.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That last detail is notable because by keeping the same dimensions, it is able to accommodate the thousands of F-150 truck accessories that exist today. If Ford has any hope of converting its current customer base, decisions like this one matter. It should be noted that, for now, the Lightning is only offered as a Supercrew four-door with a 5.5-foot bed.</p>
<p>Will it convert or will the F-150 Lightning attract a whole new group of customers? It&#8217;s a question that won&#8217;t be answered until it comes to market in spring 2022.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe the Lightning has the makings to be a hit for Ford.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ford went well beyond installing a battery pack in a traditional F-150,&#8221; iSeeCars.com executive analyst Karl Brauer said. &#8220;The automaker&#8217;s comprehensive approach to the Lightning&#8217;s design, performance, and advanced features would make it a desirable truck with a traditional engine. The electric powertrain, and the instant torque and increased cargo and towing capacity that come with it, along with the ability to seamlessly power a house for multiple days, are additional benefits beyond the Lightning&#8217;s sleek styling, rapid acceleration, and high-tech amenities. It&#8217;s obvious Ford recognizes both the opportunity and risk presented by the shift toward electric vehicles, and the automaker has clearly committed to keeping the F-150 viable in a battery-powered world.&#8221;</p>
<p><div style="width: 2160px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2155171-1" width="2160" height="2160" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_Lightning.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<h2>Nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will be offered in four trims, which includes the base, XLT, Lariat and Platinum series, and two battery options. The truck, which has an aluminum alloy body, is powered by two in-board electric motors, comes standard with four-wheel drive, and has an independent rear suspension. Ford is only releasing two prices at the moment. The base version will be priced at $39,974 before any federal or state tax credits, while the mid-series XLT model will start at $52,974. According to the reservations site, a fully loaded Lightning will go for $90,474. All of these prices exclude the destination fees and taxes.</p>
<p>The overall length of the standard-range battery model (specs from other trims are yet to be published) is 232.7 inches, one inch longer than the gas-powered F-150. The Lightning&#8217;s wheelbase is essentially the same, with just one-tenth of an inch separating it from its combustion engine and hybrid cousins.</p>
<p>One notable difference between the electric and gas 4&#215;4 versions of the F-150 is the ground clearance. The Lightning has ground clearance of 8.9 inches compared to 9.4 in the original F-150. That half-inch loss is possibly caused by the metal skid plates that are meant to protect the battery and inboard motors from the terrain.</p>
<p>The standard battery range truck delivers a targeted 426 horsepower and 775 pound-feet of torque. The F-150 Lightning equipped with the extended-range battery helps push the horsepower to 563 (or 420 kW) and has the same torque, which Ford says is the most of any F-150 ever.</p>
<p>The vehicle&#8217;s battery has a targeted range of 230 miles in the standard and pops up to 300 miles in the extended version. One question remains: how will the range be affected by towing a boat or trailer?</p>
<p>Ford doesn&#8217;t provide that information, and until the EPA gives its estimated range and people start towing cars, boats and snowmobiles, it might not clear.</p>
<p>Ford does point to two features meant to help drivers understand just how far they can travel before charging. The first is called &#8220;onboard scales,&#8221; which uses sensors on the truck to estimate payload so drivers know the weight of what they&#8217;re hauling. Now, payload &#8212; the weight a truck can carry &#8212; is different from towing capacity, which is the weight it can tow. But &#8220;onboard scales&#8221; work alongside yet another feature called &#8220;intelligent range,&#8221; which takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather and more, according to Ford.</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t backing away from payload and towing capacity. Ford notes that the new frame on the truck uses the strongest steel ever put in an F-150 frame and supports a maximum 2,000-pound payload and up to 10,000-pound towing capacity.</p>
<h2>Inside the Lightning</h2>
<p>Just like the newly refreshed gas-powered F-150, the Lightning is filled with connected car tech and advanced driving assistance features. The higher level trims of the Lightning — the Lariat and Platinum versions — will come with Ford&#8217;s Sync 4A infotainment system that can support over-the-air software updates. That means the system rollout upgrades to the vehicle, such as adding or improving driver assistance features and keeping maps up to date. SYNC 4 will offer third-party apps through its AppLink system, including Waze and a version of Amazon&#8217;s Alexa called Ford+Alexa.</p>
<p>The Sync 4A system, which will feature natural voice control and real time mapping, will be displayed on a 15.5-inch touchscreen that looks a lot like what is inside the new Mustang Mach-E electric crossover. In front of the driver is a 12-inch instrument cluster that can be customized. This digital cluster will also relay important information to the driver on how the battery is operating, the regenerative braking and the advanced driver assistance system functions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really is the smartest F-150 we&#8217;ve ever made,&#8221; said Darren Palmer, general manager of battery electric vehicles at Ford Motor Company. &#8220;F-150 Lightning offers an immersive touch screen,<br />
giving our customers all the info they want in an instant &#8212; a real-time view of where they&#8217;re going, what they&#8217;re hauling or how much real-world range they&#8217;ve got banked. And with Ford<br />
Power-Up software updates, the experience is only going to get better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will also offer Blue Cruise, the automaker&#8217;s new hands-free driving feature, which will also be available on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. That hands-free capability &#8212; which uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition &#8212; has undergone some 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford emphasized in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">announcement in April</a>. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p>The hands-free system will be available on vehicles equipped with Ford&#8217;s Co-Pilot360 Technology and will only work on certain sections of divided highways. The system, which will be rolled out via software updates later this year, will initially be available on more than 100,000 miles of highways in North America.</p>
<h2>Charging and power</h2>
<p>Charging is of course critical to driving any electric vehicle. But it isn&#8217;t just about having the ability to plug in. Communicating how, when and where is the crux. Ford said customers will receive a<br />
notification if their truck&#8217;s battery falls below one-third of its total range. The intelligent range, which as noted above takes into consideration towing info, payload, weather, is also communicated to the driver. The accompanying FordPass app also gives customers information on charging locations. Inside the vehicle, a driver can use the infotainment system to identify and navigate to charging stations.</p>
<p>The truck also has onboard power source, which in the standard trim offers 2.4 kilowatts of power while Lariat and Platinum series come standard with 9.6 kilowatts of power — a combination of up to 2.4 kilowatts available through the truck&#8217;s so-called &#8220;mega power frunk&#8221; and up to 7.2 kilowatts through outlets in the cab and bed.</p>
<p>Ford also touted its<span style="font-weight: 400;"> 9.6 kW of back up power, which it says can provide energy to a home during a blackout for three days and as many as 10 with rationing. </span></p>

<p>Founded in 2014, <a href="https://www.greatdealscorp.com/">Great Deals </a>is an e-commerce enabler that helps brands like Abbot, L’Oréal and Unilever build their online retail operations in the Philippines. The startup announced today that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding led by <a href="https://www.fastlogistics.com.ph/">Fast Group</a>, one of the Philippines’ biggest logistics firms, with support from CVC Capital Partners. Navegar, which <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/great-deals-e-commerce">led Great Deals&#8217; Series A</a>, also returned for this round.</p>
<p>The transaction was advised by Rocket Equities. The investment by Fast Group, which has a fleet of more than 2,500 vehicles and 90,000 stores in its distribution network, marks the beginning of a strategic partnership. Great Deals will use part of the new capital to build an automated fulfillment center, and the deal will help it increase its penetration outside the Greater Manila Area and offer more Instant Commerce, or deliveries under one hour.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In a statement, Fast Group president and chief executive officer William Chiongbian II said, “The Fast Group sees a lot of synergies with Great Deals in building capacity. We are privileged to contribute to the growth of Philippine e-commerce, as it relies heavily on a strong supply chain backbone.”</p>
<p>Some of Great Deals’ other clients include Nestlé, Samsonite, GSK, Bayer and Fila. In addition to serving as an e-commerce distributor, it offers an end-to-end services for brands, including digital content production, marketing campaign coordination and management of marketplace listings (Great Deals’ partners include Lazada, Shopee, Zalora, Zilingo, Shopify and Magento).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Happy Wednesday, friends! It was another super-busy day in the tech world. I had my sights on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/as-q2s-lull-fades-unicorn-ipos-are-revving-up/">Squarespace’s public debut</a>, as well as the value of Coinbase’s stock, which may be tracking the price of bitcoin a bit more literally than some folks expected. And if you are a long-term crypto holder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/bitcoin-crashes-as-investors-fear-crypto-bull-market-could-be-nearing-its-end/">congrats on the buying opportunity</a>. If you are a short-term crypto holder, yes, you can have a drink now regardless of what time it is. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/india-tells-whatsapp-to-withdraw-its-new-policy-terms/">Whatsapp v. India</a>:</strong> The scrap between <strong>Facebook’s Whatsapp</strong> service and the Indian government continued today as the nation-state “once again directed the Facebook-owned company to withdraw the planned update.”</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">Telehealth + fertility</a>:</strong> Famous for its initial men’s health products, <strong>Ro</strong> (née Roman) purchased <strong>Modern Fertility</strong> today, a fertility-focused startup founded in 2017. Our question is how Ro’s telehealth approach will fit with reproductive health.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace flops</a>:</strong> <strong>Squarespace’s</strong> direct listing set a reference price of $50, valuing the company sharply lower than its final private price ($10 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation/">set earlier this year</a>). Then its stock fell further.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>From the <strong>TechCrunch Events</strong> side of things, Tess Hatch, a vice president and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, is </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/bessemers-tess-hatch-will-join-us-as-a-judge-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/"><em>coming to Disrupt</em></a><em>. Which is very hype.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We’re shaking things up today and talking about product first and venture capital rounds second. Sound good?</p>
<p>First up is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/otter-ais-new-assistant-can-automatically-transcribe-your-zoom-meetings/"><strong>Otter.ai’s</strong> new product: Otter Assistant</a>. It can transcribe your <strong>Zoom</strong> calls. For reporters, this is <em>huge</em> as a note-taking tool. But it will likely find even broader remit in the business world. Don’t forget that Otter raised $50 million just a few months ago. (For more on the voice transcription space, check out <strong>Deepgram’s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/deepgram-raises-12m-for-enterprise-speech-recognition/">2020-era funding round.</a>)</p>
<p>Second in the product category, <strong>Liquid Instruments</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/liquid-instruments-raises-13-7m-to-bring-its-education-focused-8-in-1-engineering-gadget-to-market/">raised $13.7 million</a> to bring its <strong>Moku:Go</strong> product to classrooms and labs everywhere. What does the Go do? It “combines several commonly used tools into one compact package, saving room on your workbench or classroom while also providing a modern, software-configurable interface,” TechCrunch reported.</p>
<p>Moving onto some purely financial coverage from startup-land, here are four neat rounds we dug into more deeply:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/construction-tech-startup-assignar-raises-20m-in-fifth-wall-led-series-b/"><strong>$20M for Assignar</strong></a>: Construction tech is a busy sector, not merely because the construction sector is itself rather active; the digital transformation push that we’ve seen around the business is also touching down in the world of mortar and bricks. Its software helps contractors and subcontractors “connect to the field and vice versa,” according to its CEO Sean McCreanor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Fellow construction tech player <strong>Procore</strong> is going public as we speak. So the market that Assignar is playing in is active in both early- and late-stage terms.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/formlabs-raises-150m/"><strong>$150M for Formlabs</strong></a>: 3D printing has come of age, it appears, as Massachusetts-based Formlabs closed a nine-figure round for its printing tech. SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the round, which values the company at around $2 billion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Formlabs wants to improve 3D printing machines while also making them cheaper. If it can pull that off, whole sectors could be shaken up.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/super-raises-50m-to-cover-home-repairs-and-maintenance-via-a-subscription-model/"><strong>$50M for Super</strong></a>: If you own a home, you are familiar with how rapidly entropy will ensure that you have a regular stream of repair bills. Why not convert those into a monthly subscription? That’s what Super is working to do, and now it has cash to pursue its vision after growing 7x since last April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care</em></strong><em><strong>?</strong> The subscription push is far more than merely an enterprise-software affair, or something related to consumer entertainment. Anything as a service is where we are in 2021.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/"><strong>$250M for Pipe</strong></a>: Pipe is a platform that allows companies to sell their future, predictable revenue streams to investors. It’s best known for working with SaaS companies, but is expanding into other business types as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Why do we care? </em></strong><em>Pipe has been growing at a torrid pace, and raising capital at a similar clip. It’s either onto something super huge, or the market for financial products is just bonkers for now. Either way, it’s an interesting option for software startups hunting for cash.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>5 innovative fundraising methods for emerging VCs and PEs</h2>
<p>According to David Teten, founder of Versatile VC, five new strategies are gaining traction among fund managers looking to raise capital from family offices and high-net-worth individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities and virtual events.</li>
<li>Platforms that help other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Soliciting under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launching a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfunding from retail investors into a general partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a summary of a class he taught for the Oper8r VC fund accelerator, Teten offers actionable advice for anyone who wants to connect with pre-qualified investors.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today from the world of Big Tech, we’re pausing to listen to our own Editor in Chief <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Matthew Panzarino</a> discuss the new iPad Pro, which he thinks has amazing hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen:</strong> “The mini-LED-driven Liquid Retina XDR display is probably the best display that’s ever shipped on a mobile computer. It’s just fantastic.”</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> “The M1 chip is absolutely blistering.”</li>
<li><strong>Imaging: </strong>“The new iPad Pro cameras are pretty fantastic; both front and back are now very usable and the new front camera especially benefits from an increase in resolution and new wide-angle optics.”</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard: </strong>“The overall feel of the keyboard is still great, a really nice typing experience.”</li>
</ul>
<p>But then there’s the software. Which Panzarino is not stoked about. It’s aging, he argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other side of this coin that isn’t so shiny is the iPad’s aging software. It’s just as good as it was when I wrote my review of the iPad Pro in 2020 — at which point my conclusions were “you can adapt to it but it could be better.” That was a year ago. As someone who has used it as my only portable machine for the last two and a half years, I can tell you that this is a very long time to wait for a big leap forward in capability.</p>
<p>I have a very simple ask for the iPad’s software: I want to feel the same energy, vivacity and pure performance for the sake of peak performance that the hardware side exhibits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has now come to the crossroad that Microsoft tried to meet with Windows 8 and failed; how do you build an OS that serves either two form factors (touch and mobile, and desktop) well, or two OSs that can share enough third-party software so that neither is neglected? We’ll know more at WWDC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I would also count myself as a serial entrepreneur because I've been doing this for more than 20 years."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle company Arrival wants to break the current auto manufacturing model. Instead of one giant factory and an assembly line, Arrival’s commercial electric vans, buses and cars are robotically built in small, regional microfactories, of which the company wants to open 31 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you want to achieve something radically more efficient, you have to go deeper, into complex, high-level computational algorithms that are not normally used in consumer-facing products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The London-based company, founded in 2015, joined the ranks of EV companies going public via SPAC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/">merging with blank-check company CIIG Merger Corp</a>. in March. UPS has already ordered 10,000 of Arrival’s robotically engineered vans, and the company recently signed a deal with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/">Uber to create purpose-built EVs for ride-hail drivers</a>.</p>
<p>Arrival founder Denis Sverdlov has been at the intersection of technological advancement and societal change before. Born in the nation of Georgia, Sverdlov founded his first company at 22 selling IT consulting software to enterprise customers. Since then, he has built and exited multiple companies, most notably telecommunications operator Yota Group. Founded in 2007, the same year the iPhone came out, Yota eventually launched a 4G network across Russia, coupling it with an HTC smartphone that would facilitate the use of the network. Sverdlov sold the company in 2012 for $1.5 billion, did a brief stint as the Russian deputy communications and mass media minister, and then went on to start Arrival. Oh, and he founded electric autonomous car race <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/1457671/">Roborace</a> in 2015, too, just ‘cause.</p>
<p>With the same sense that fast, mobile internet and big screens would change the telecoms industry back in 2007, Sverdlov began to see a perfect storm brewing in the EV world over the last decade. In 2015, he founded Arrival in anticipation of a switch to electric as well as advancements happening in material, research and development in the robotics industry. He predicts this will have an even bigger impact on the automotive industry than 4G had on telecommunications.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Denis, your first company was a telecom operator and you were behind the creation of Roborace. Now you&#8217;re trying to change the way the auto industry makes cars with Arrival. Are you a serial entrepreneur who is already thinking about the next thing? Or are you pretty involved in this one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dennis Sverdlov: </strong>Yeah, I&#8217;m quite involved with Arrival, and I expect to see many new technologies and enablers come out of this journey. For example, if you take our robotic technologies, which we use for microfactories, you can easily see how that will be used in other industries, as well, so it&#8217;s not going to be used only for automotive.</p>
<p>But as a company, we need to focus on what we do today because we need to achieve a lot here, and I think it&#8217;s important to focus on that. But, yeah, I would also count myself as a serial entrepreneur because I&#8217;ve been doing this for more than 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think that your past business decisions have informed your current strategy with Arrival?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric aviation company Wisk Aero filed a motion for a preliminary injunction Wednesday in its ongoing lawsuit with rival electric air travel startup Archer Aviation. The injunction could put a serious wrench in Archer’s operations should the courts approve it.</p>
<p>Wisk has asked the court to immediately prohibit Archer from using 52 trade secrets that it alleges were stolen by former employees who were later hired by Archer. The trade secrets “span the gamut of systems within the aircraft and processes for development,” a Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“This a baseless motion in a baseless lawsuit,&#8221; an Archer spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Archer independently designed its aircraft, before any employees from Wisk joined Archer, and Archer looks forward to demonstrating that in court. Archer is moving forward with its business plans, including the development, certification and production of its proprietary aircraft.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the widespread subject matter of the trade secrets, an injunction would likely limit Archer&#8217;s operations. The courts have not yet ruled on whether Archer misappropriated trade secrets, as Wisk alleged in its original filing on April 6. Wisk says it discovered the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/"> trade secret theft</a> after it sent the work laptops of a departing employee to an outsider investigator, who discovered that the employee had downloaded nearly 5,000 files. This employee is now a senior power electronics engineer at Archer.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate federal investigation into a former Wisk employee who now works for Archer, based on Wisk&#8217;s trade secret allegations.</p>
<p>Archer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1824502/000110465921047190/tm2112310d1_8k.htm">said in a filing</a> with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission that it had &#8220;placed an employee on paid administrative leave in connection with a government investigation and a search warrant issued to the employee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The injunction hearing has not been scheduled. It will likely occur within the next few days due to the nature of the request. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under case no. 5:21-cv-2450.</p>
<p><em>The story was updated to include Archer&#8217;s comments and to reflect that a former Wisk employee who now works at Archer, not Archer or its senior management, is the subject of the FBI&#8217;s investigation. </em></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our startup employs several individuals who are on work visas or have employment authorization. Many of them have been waiting for quite a while for the government to tell them their applications have been received. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why? When will things be back on track? We have a few employees who are waiting for green cards, and a few F-1 visa holders who will be extending their OPT to STEM OPT. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything we can do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Patient in Pasadena</strong></p>
<p>Dear Patient,</p>
<p>Thanks for your questions. Last September, an increase in applications submitted to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) amid COVID-19-related staff reductions created a substantial backlog and subsequent delay in USCIS sending out receipt notices.</p>
<p>My law firm partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, and I provided an update on receipt notices on a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/071-where-is-my-receipt-notice/">podcast</a>. Dedicating an entire episode to receipt notices was unthinkable a year ago because applicants usually received receipt notices within one to three weeks after USCIS received their application.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, USCIS sends a letter called a receipt notice to applicants when it receives an application. The receipt notice — also known as a Notice of Action or Form I-797 — contains information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the application was accepted, in which case you will be notified of how it will be processed, or rejected if it was not filed appropriately, such as not using the latest form or forgetting to check a box on the application form.</li>
<li>A receipt number, which can be used to check the status of your case either <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do">online</a> or by phone.</li>
<li>The date your application was received, which for most green card applications is the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/028-all-about-priority-dates/">priority date</a>. (Priority dates for the EB-2 and EB-3 green cards are when the Labor Department received the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/020-sponsoring-employees-for-perm-green-cards/">PERM Labor Certification</a> application.) A priority date determines your place in line for a green card number to become available based on the green card category and the green card candidate’s country of birth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What caused the backlog?</h2>
<p>Before the pandemic, applicants would typically be notified in less than one month after USCIS received their application. Currently, applicants are receiving their receipt notice as long as eight to nine weeks after USCIS received their application, and sometimes longer.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, coronavirus-related staffing reductions at USCIS coupled with a substantial jump in the number of applications submitted prompted huge delays that began in September. Application submissions surged primarily due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticipation of fee hikes that were slated to go into effect on October 2, 2020, before being blocked by a federal court judge.</li>
<li>Rapid forward movement in the monthly Visa Bulletin for some green card categories, which meant green card numbers became available to many waiting in line.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 17, DC-based startup iCE Neurosystems </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ice-neurosystems-announces-fda-510-173000465.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a version of FDA approval for a subcutaneous electrode called iCE-SG, designed to monitor the brain’s electrical activity from beneath the skin of the scalp. That electrode comes on the back of a 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for iCE Neurosystems’ software platform called iCEWav, which was used in a D.C. area hospital to monitor the brain activity of patients in medically-induced comas during the Covid-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iCE Neurosystems electrode and software are, essentially, a new take on traditional EEG. The electrode is designed to sit beneath the scalp for days and analyze brain activity, and the software component is designed to integrate that data with vital signs like heart rate or blood pressure. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time we&#8217;ve got this massive, high-fidelity, continuous, integrated data set from both brain and body,” says Alan Waziri, a neurosurgeon and company co-founder. “That allows us to really understand what&#8217;s happening in the brain to drive timely clinical decisions, and fundamentally change outcomes for these patients.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">iCE was founded by Waziri and colleagues from his time as a resident at Columbia University Medical Center in 2017. As of 2021, the company has nine full</span><b>&#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">time employees, and has raised a total of $4.5 million, including a recent round of $2.95 million from private investors in April 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subcutaneous electrode and software combination is part of iCE Neurosystems bigger picture: to create a full platform for continuous monitoring of the brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are examples of use cases where continuous monitoring may prove beneficial. For instance, a 2019 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England Journal of Medicine</span></i> <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812757"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggested that specialized EEG monitoring might detect signs of consciousness in otherwise unresponsive patients. That study was authored by </span><a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/jan-claassen-md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan Claassen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the director of Critical Care Neurology at Columbia who is also co-founder and minority shareholder at iCE Neurosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span><a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/92/1/e9"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2019 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that continuous monitoring via EEG was associated with fewer deaths in hospitals. But only 22,728 of the over 7 million people analyzed in the study had access to continuous EEG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waziri’s aim is to increase that number. Subcutaneous electrodes, he’s betting, are a first step. The iCE-SG electrodes should be easy to install and don’t require the technical expertise usually required to prepare and administer an EEG, explains Waziri. </span><a href="https://jintensivecare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40560-018-0310-z"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other scientists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also noted technical expertise needed to use and interpret traditional EEG is cumbersome and has stood in the way of long-term EEG monitoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FDA approval documents note that the iCE-SG devices are approved to remain beneath the skin for 14 days, but Waziri says he’s obtained continuous monitoring of brain activity for up to 35 days. A long-term EEG analysis, by comparison, might last several days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s almost like placing an IV,” Waziri says. “Basically a routine clinician at the bedside can place these in under five minutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the platform alone can’t address the need for expertise to interpret this data. Waziri’s answer to that question is to make this data shareable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a hospital, data collected by platform is stored on the cloud. However, a hospital could opt into sharing data on another platform iCECloud Knowledge with other medical institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From participating institutions, all the data we collect gets put in there and is made available to anyone who is using our system,” he says. “Our goal is to almost kind of crowdsource the analysis of the data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, iCENeurosystems has pursued two forms of FDA approval for the software and the electrode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electrode and the full platform have received FDA premarket approval through the 510(k) pathway – a type of pre-market approval that allows a medical device to go to market without additional FDA review because it’s substantially similar to other products already on the market (In this case, that tech is a traditional EEG). The iCEWav system was granted 510(k) approval in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K191868.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the electrode received it in </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201678.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pathway is one of the </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0653-6#:~:text=The%20US%20Food%20and%20Drug,among%20purveyors%20of%20new%20devices."><span style="font-weight: 400;">most expedient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to get a medical device onto the market, but has also </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955380/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">faced criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it doesn’t require a device to be tested for safety or efficacy through clinical trials. Waziri says there “haven’t been any complications” from the devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, iCEWave </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done time in the clinical setting in a major D.C. hospital, though Waziri won’t disclose which one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, the DC based startup iCE Neurosystems was in the midst of testing iCEWav when the pandemic hit. Some Covid-19 patients required intense cardiopulmonary support that required use of medically induced comas. Technicians typically use EEG to monitor these patients, but iCE Neurosystems also received a trial run, says Waziri, as the hospital was looking for long-term methods of monitoring patients brain activity without having technicians visit multiple times per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had our system in place because we were running a clinical trial in patients with cardiac arrest, and they asked us if they could use the system for monitoring their critically ill COVID patients. They actually applied to the FDA and the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the software,” Waziri says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far Waziri and iCENeurosystems hasn’t published any peer-reviewed data from that trial at the D.C. area hospital, but he says the company has two forthcoming manuscripts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Waziri says that iCE Neurosystems is working towards getting more devices into more hospitals. He says they’re in talks with an additional five hospitals, with the goal of beginning a Series A funding raise in mid 2022. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How are mom-and-pop self-storage facilities meant to keep up with the tech offered by the massive, ever-growing chains?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a key part of the idea behind<a href="https://www.openunit.com"> OpenUnit</a>, a team I first wrote about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/openunit-aims-to-be-shopify-for-self-storage-facilities/"> in August of last year</a>. You bring the storage units, they bring the website, payment processing and backend tools you need to manage them. They don&#8217;t charge facility owners a monthly subscription fee, instead taking a cut of each payment as the payments processor.</p>
<p>OpenUnit has now raised a $1 million seed round, and acquired the IP of a fellow YC company along the way.</p>
<p>Since we last heard from OpenUnit, they&#8217;ve been expanding to locations around the U.S. and Canada, and now have a waitlist over 800 facilities deep, the team tells me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2034720" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2034720" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2034720" style="border: 1px solid grey;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="595" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg 2574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=768,446 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=680,395 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=1536,893 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=2048,1190 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OpenUnit.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2034720" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenUnit</p></div></p>
<p>OpenUnit co-founder Taylor Cooney was quick to point out that this seed round is as much about strategic partnerships as it is about the money. Neither Taylor nor co-founder Lucas Playford had much to do with the storage industry until a knock at the door led them down a rabbit hole. As<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/openunit-aims-to-be-shopify-for-self-storage-facilities/"> I wrote back in August</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Taylor’s landlords came to him with an offer: they wanted to sell the place he was renting, and they’d give him a stack of cash if he could be out within just a few days. Pulling that off meant finding a place to keep all of his stuff while he looked for a new home, which is when he realized how antiquated the self-storage process could be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the 20+ investors participating in the round, six are from the self-storage industry, from prior/current facility owners to the director of the Canadian Self Storage Association. For some of them, it&#8217;s their first time investing in a tech or software company — but all potentially bring something to the table beyond money.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OpenUnit aims to be Shopify for self-storage facilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/openunit-aims-to-be-shopify-for-self-storage-facilities/embed/#?secret=I342GdJka3" data-secret="I342GdJka3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;re just letting that money sit around. They&#8217;ve grown the team from just Taylor and Lucas up to five, and are still looking to grow. Meanwhile, Taylor tells me the company has acquired the IP of fellow Y Combinator W20 batchmate Affiga, a product that aimed to automatically provide insights about a new customer after a transaction is made.</p>
<p>Writes Taylor: &#8220;As self-storage companies move services like rentals, leases, and payments online, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult for them to &#8216;know&#8217; their customers. We see the integration into our product as a way to help self-storage operators bridge the gap between their online and in-store customer experiences, where the personal touch tends to be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Affiga initially shut down its operations back in 2020. After OpenUnit realized they wanted something similar in their product, they set out to buy rather than build. &#8220;With a decade in e-commerce under their belt,&#8221; Taylor tells me, &#8220;their founder had a much better approach to this then we would&#8217;ve come up with.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Besides getting more people off the waitlist and onto the platform, they&#8217;re exploring other opportunities, including potentially providing loans to facilities looking to expand or renovate. Because OpenUnit is both the management platform and the payments provider, they have deep insights on how a facility is doing; they know how much a location makes, how punctual their customers are with payments, etc. Take that data and mash it up with insights on what improvements can increase revenue, and it seems like a pretty straightforward formula.</p>
<p>This round includes investment from Garage Capital, Advisors Fund, Insite Property Group, SquareFoot co-founder Jonathan Wasserstrum, and a number of angel investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Approaching institutions to raise capital for your venture capital or private equity fund is relatively transparent, but what if you’re targeting family offices and high-net-worth individuals? I see five innovative new methods for raising capital that emerging managers such as <a href="http://versatilevc.com">Versatile VC</a> are using, which I’ve ranked in roughly descending order of popularity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate.</li>
<li>Use a platform that helps other investors access your fund.</li>
<li>Generally solicit under the 506(c) designation.</li>
<li>Launch a rolling fund.</li>
<li>Crowdfund from retail investors into your general partnership.</li>
</ol>
<p>Will Stringer, CEO of <a href="https://www.chisos.io/">Chisos</a>, feels most family offices won’t respond to cold outreach. &#8220;You need to build a true relationship with family office investors or other general partners that can make warm intros to family office decision-makers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Family offices, more than any other allocator, rely on trust. [It&#8217;s] not always the case (and always changing), but today it&#8217;s still the majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When you’re raising capital for a fund, you’re fundamentally selling a luxury good, which is seen as more valuable because it’s scarce. That’s part of the secret of the hedge fund industry’s success in gathering assets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The obvious solution therefore is to get in touch with your friends who have earlier raised or pitched to the family offices. You may also find professional intermediaries who are willing to make an introduction to family offices.</p>
<p>That said, the five methods I outline below may be faster and more efficient.</p>
<h2>Join online communities and virtual conferences where investors participate</h2>
<p>To meet other VCs (some of which may become LPs), among your options are <a href="http://confluence.vc/">Confluence</a>, <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/shr1LP3zhjgLY2vZC?utm=website">InnovatorsRoom</a> (European focus) and <a href="https://www.techaviv.com/">TechAviv</a> (Israeli focus). To find others, see: <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2021/02/24/how-to-find-the-right-online-communities/">How to find the right online communities</a>. I maintain a proprietary database of the communities I’ve found most valuable, which I share with other members of the Versatile team.</p>
<p>These venues allow you to efficiently get in front of many pre-qualified investors and follow up with those who seem like a tight fit. Unsurprisingly, the best online communities are limited strictly to LPs. Ideally, you’d partner with an anchor/friendly LP who can pass the word on your fund to other potential investors.</p>
<p>In general, at virtual conferences, I recommend first fill out your online profile with all possible keywords and your photo. Side-channeling is powerful and is the equivalent of going into a corner at a conference and talking privately. Look up the profiles of all the people attending a conference or in an online community and send the relevant folks a customized message introducing yourself.</p>
<p>This is one of the primary advantages of virtual events versus traditional face-to-face conferences, where people do not conveniently wear a hat with their LinkedIn profile visible.</p>
