										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s plain to see that electric vehicles are the future, but there&#8217;s more to making that change happen than swapping out a gas motor for a battery-powered one — especially in aircraft. <a href="https://www.h3x.tech/">H3X</a> is a startup that aims to accelerate that future with a reimagined, completely integrated electric motor that it claims outperforms everything on the market.</p>
<p>The small founding team — CEO Jason Sylvestre, CTO Max Liben, and COO Eric Maciolek — met in college while participating in an electric vehicle building and racing program. After stints in the tech and automobile industry (including at Tesla), the crew came back together when they saw that the Department of Energy was offering a bounty for improved high power density electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem was uniquely suited to our abilities, and passions too — we&#8217;re excited about this stuff. We care about decarbonization of the different transit sectors, and aviation is going to become a growing part of the global carbon footprint over the next few decades as electric improves ground vehicles,&#8221; said Liben. &#8220;We just kinda decided to take a leap of faith, and applied to Y Combinator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Electric flight isn&#8217;t so much a wild idea as one that&#8217;s in its early, awkward stages. Lightweight craft like drones can do a great deal with the batteries and motors that are available, and <a href="https://www.harbourair.com/harbour-air-and-magnix-announce-successful-flight-of-worlds-first-commercial-electric-airplane/">converted small aircraft</a> like seaplanes are able to make short flights, but that&#8217;s about the limit with the way things are today.</p>
<p>The problem is primarily a simple lack of power: the energy required to propel an aircraft fast enough to generate lift grows exponentially as the size and mass of the plane increase. A handful of kilowatt-hours will serve for a drone, and a few EV-scale batteries will work for a light aircraft&#8230; but beyond that the energy required to take flight requires batteries the bulk and weight of which make flight impractical.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2127737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png" alt="The H3x lab with someone working on a motor the size of a toaster." width="450" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png 682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=680,577 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-lab.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a>Of course, it doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to be like that. And there are two general avenues for improvement: better batteries or better motors. So either you can fit more energy in the same mass or use what energy you have more efficiently. Both are being pursued by many companies, but H3x claims to have made a huge leap forward in power density that could unlock new industries overnight. While even an improvement of 10 or 20 percent in power per kilogram (e.g. a 50-pound motor putting out 120 horsepower rather than 100) would be notable, H3x says its motor is performing at around 300 percent of the competition&#8217;s output.</p>
<p>How? It&#8217;s all about integration, Liben explained. While the pieces are similar in some ways to motors and power assemblies out there now, the team basically started from scratch with the idea of maximizing efficiency and minimizing size.</p>
<p>Electric motors generally have three main sections: the motor itself, a power delivery system, and a gearbox, each of which may have its own housing and be sold and mounted separately from one another. One reason why these aren&#8217;t all one big machine is temperature: the parts and coolant systems of the gearbox, for instance, might not be able to operate at the temperatures generated by the motor or the power system, or vice versa. Put them together and one may cause the other to seize up or otherwise fail. The different sections just have different requirements, which seems natural.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127750" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-xray.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127750" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127750" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-xray.gif" alt="Animated image of an electric motor rendered to be see-through." width="640" height="406" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127750" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> H3x</p></div></p>
<p>H3x challenges this paradigm with a novel integrated design, but Liben was careful to clarify what that means.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just taking the inverter box and slapping it on top and calling it <em>integrated</em>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All the components are all intimately connected to the same housing and motor. We&#8217;re making a truly integrated design that&#8217;s one of the first of its kind at this power level.&#8221;</p>
<p>And by &#8220;one of the first&#8221; he doesn&#8217;t mean that Airbus has one in some powertrains, but rather that there have been research projects along these lines — nothing intended for production.</p>
<p>The idea that no one else has gone this far in putting everything in the same box at scales that could be used commercially may sound suspicious to some. One would think that the existing players in aerospace would have been barking up this tree for years, but Liben said large companies are too slow to innovate and too invested in other methods, while smaller ones tend to avoid risk by improving incrementally on successful existing designs and competing among themselves. &#8220;No one is targeting the level of performance we&#8217;re looking at right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2127738" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=1536,966 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-rl.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t like H3x stumbled over a single advance that magically tripled the performance of electric motors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not relying on one big tech or something — there&#8217;s no magic bullet,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;There are a few improvements that have very significant gains, like 50 percent better than the state of the art, and lots of areas that add 10-20 percent. It&#8217;s good from the technical risk side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went into considerable detail on a lot of those improvements, but the less technical-minded among our readers, if they&#8217;ve even read this far, might close the tab if I tried to recount the whole conversation. To be brief, it amounts to combining advances in materials, manufacturing, and electric components so that they act synergistically, each enabling the other to be used to best effect.</p>
<p>For instance, recently improved power switching hardware can be run at hotter temperatures and handle higher loads — this raises performance but also allows for shared cooling infrastructure. The shared infrastructure can itself be improved by using new pure-copper 3D printing techniques, which allow more cooling to fit inside the housing. Using 3D printing means custom internal geometries so that the motor, gearbox, and power delivery can all be mounted in optimal positions to one another instead of bolted on where existing methods allow.</p>
<p>The result is an all-in-one motor, the HPDM-250, that&#8217;s smaller than a lot of the competition, yet produces far more power. The best production motors out there are around 3-4 kilowatts per kilogram of continuous power. H3x&#8217;s prototype produces 13 — coincidentally, just above the theoretical power density that would enable mid-range passenger aircraft.</p>

<p>There is the risk that stacking cutting edge techniques like this makes the cost rise faster than the performance. Liben said that while it&#8217;s definitely more expensive in some ways, the smaller size and integrated design also lead to new savings in cost, time, or material.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think, &#8216;3D printing copper, that&#8217;s expensive!&#8217; But when you compare it to the super high performance windings you&#8217;d need otherwise, and the different ways that you manufacture them, that can require a lot of manual steps and people involved&#8230; it can be a lot simpler printing something,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It can be counterintuitive, but at least from my BOM [bill of materials] cost, when you&#8217;re selling something three times smaller than the other guy, even if it&#8217;s high performance materials, it&#8217;s actually not as expensive as you&#8217;d think. Based on the customers we&#8217;ve talked to so far, we think we&#8217;re in a good spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Servicing a fully integrated motor is also fundamentally more complex than doing so for an off the shelf one, but Liben noted that they were careful to think about maintenance from the start — and also that, while it may be a little harder to service their motor than an ordinary electric one, it&#8217;s much, much simpler than servicing even the most reliable and well-known gas-powered motors.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2127739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg 1477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/h3x-side.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Despite the huge gains H3x claims, the target market of passenger aircraft is hardly one that they, or anyone, can just jump into. Heavily regulated industries like air travel require years of work and technology proving to change a fastener style, let alone the method of propulsion.</p>
<p>So H3x is focusing on the numerous smaller, less regulated industries that could use vastly improved electric propulsion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">Cargo drones</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">electric boats</a>, and air taxis might still be rare sights on this planet, but a big bump to motor power and efficiency might be what helps tip them from niche (or vaporware) to mainstream. Certainly all three of those applications could benefit hugely from improved range or payload capacity.</p>

<p>Graduating to passenger flights isn&#8217;t a distant dream, exactly, suggested Liben: &#8220;We&#8217;re already on our way — this isn&#8217;t 20-years-out type stuff. In the last few years the timelines have shrunk drastically. You could have a full battery electric vehicle soon, but it isn&#8217;t going to cut it for longer flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a role for motors like H3x&#8217;s in hybrid aircraft that use jet fuel, batteries, and perhaps even hydrogen fuel cells interchangeably. Like the switch to electric cars, it doesn&#8217;t happen all at once and it doesn&#8217;t need to for the purposes of their business. &#8220;That&#8217;s the great thing about motors,&#8221; Liben said. &#8220;They&#8217;re so ubiquitous.&#8221;</p>
<p>H3x declined to disclose any funding or partners, although it&#8217;s hard to believe that the team could have gotten as far as it has without some kind of significant capital and facilities — this sort of project outgrows the garage workbench pretty fast. But with Y Combinator&#8217;s demo day happening tomorrow, it seems likely that they&#8217;ll be receiving a lot of calls over the next few weeks, after which it may be reasonable to expect a seed round to come together.</p>
<p>If H3x&#8217;s prototypes perform as well in the wild as they do on the bench, they may very well enable a host of new electric transportation applications. We&#8217;ll be watching closely to see how the startup&#8217;s play affects the future of electric mobility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW Group and California utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric are rolling out the next phase of a pilot that aims to test — and learn — how electric vehicles could support the integration of renewable energy on the electric grid.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ChargeForward program, now entering its third phase, is open to PG&amp;E customers who drive a BMW electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Around 3,000 drivers can sign up to voluntarily to allow their vehicle to be “smart charged” when electricity demand is low and renewable energy availability is high. Drivers will earn incentives for participating in the program, including $150 at sign-up and an additional $250 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is one of the longest-running partnerships between an electric utility and an automaker. The first two phases had only 100 and 400 participants respectively, so this latest phase presents a marked expansion for the collaboration. It’s a sensible alliance for two industries that are preparing for the gradual decline in sales of internal combustion engines. For electric utilities, this means planning for a drastic increase in customer demand on a grid that is increasingly powered by renewable resources like solar and wind.   </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2128487" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128487" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2128487 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?w=314" alt="bmw chargeforward electric" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png 381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2128487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s assume someone plugs in at home on a Saturday morning at 9am and sets their departure time for 4 pm that day,&#8221; Adam Langton, BMW’s Energy Services manager who oversees the ChargeForward program, explained. &#8220;The ChargeForward software system communicates with the vehicle and determines that the vehicle is more than half full, needing 2 hours of charging to fill up the battery. The system then evaluates the person’s home electricity rate, renewable energy availability and congestion on the grid in their neighborhood. On this day, there is no congestion on the grid and solar energy will be very high in the afternoon. The ChargeForward system directs the vehicle to start charging at 1 pm and complete charging by 3 pm. This allows the driver to get a full battery prior to their departure time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electricity demand tends to follow a “duck curve” shape, peaking in the early evening as people return home from work – right as solar energy resources go off line. And people tend to charge their EVs overnight. To meet this demand, fossil fuel-emitting resources like natural gas ramp up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result? More greenhouse gas emissions. A</span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c02312"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by MIT researchers in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Science and Technology </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that in California overnight EV charging produces around 74% more GHGs than midday charging. (Variations in the grid mix matter here – in wind-heavy regions in the Midwest or Texas, overnight EV charging may make the most sense as lots of wind tends to be generated overnight.)  </span></p>
<p>The ChargePoint program aims to take advantage of the ample renewable resources available during the day and reduce GHG emissions in the process. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Participating customers will enter their charging preferences and departure times on a BMW ChargeForward mobile app. BMW will also receive real-time information about the grid, such as the availability of renewable energy relative to the customer’s location, and it will use this data to calculate an optimal charging window and send it automatically to the vehicle. Customers will be able to opt-out of the charging shift at any point through the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While California is known for pursuing ambitious clean energy goals – including codifying into law a landmark target of achieving 100% renewable and zero-carbon electricity by 2045 – the state has also set a goal of getting 5 million EVs on the road by 2030.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social audio app Clubhouse has now promised a time frame of sorts for the launch of its anticipated Android version, following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/clubhouse-hires-android-developer-work-on-android-app-has-begun.html">its recent hire</a> of an Android software developer last month. In its weekly Townhall event on Sunday, Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison remarked that the company was working &#8220;really hard&#8221; to come to Android, but said it&#8217;s going to take a &#8220;couple of months&#8221; to make that happen. That seems to indicate a time frame that&#8217;s closer to late spring or summer 2021.</p>
<p>Clubhouse had previously said <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices">in a late January blog post</a> that it would begin work on its Android version &#8220;soon,&#8221; but had not yet promised any sort of time frame as to when it would be able to bring that version to the public. Instead, most of its statements about Android have been vague mentions of the importance of supporting the Android user base and making its app more accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Clubhouse&#8217;s biggest rival, Twitter Spaces, has been taking advantage of Clubhouse&#8217;s delay to address the sizable Android user base by rapidly rolling out support to more people across platforms. This month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter Spaces opened up to Android users</a>, allowing anyone on Android to join and talk inside its live audio rooms. Shortly thereafter, Twitter said that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/twitter-spaces-to-launch-publicly-next-month-may-include-spaces-only-tweets/">plans to publicly launch Twitter Spaces</a> to the general public in April. That would be well ahead of Clubhouse, unless the latter rapidly speeds up development and drops its invite-only status in the weeks ahead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzOsJxnLeI8">Sunday&#8217;s Clubhouse Townhall,</a> co-founder Davison explained the company&#8217;s approach to scaling to a larger market &#8212; like one where Android users participate &#8212; as an effort that requires a slower pace, when it comes to opening up access to more users. He noted that when Clubhouse grows, the discovery experience inside the app can be negatively impacted as a result. Users today are seeing more foreign language groups in their feeds, for instance, and are having a harder time finding friends and some of the best content, he said.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Clubhouse plans to make several changes, including tweaks to the app&#8217;s Activity feed, tools to give users more control over their push notifications, and the launch of more personalization features &#8212; like showing users a personalized list of suggested rooms that appear on screen when you first open the app. These sorts of improvements are necessary to make Clubhouse succeed even as it scales its app to a larger user base, the company believes.</p>
<p>That said, Davison also spoke of dropping Clubhouse&#8217;s invite-only status as something it hopes to do &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221; He noted that he wants the app to open up to everyone, because there are &#8220;so many incredible creators not yet on Clubhouse, who have an audience elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be really important that we just open up to everyone,&#8221; Davison said. &#8220;Android&#8217;s going to be really important. Localization is obviously going to be very important.&#8221; Plus, making Clubhouse more accessible was important, too, he said.</p>
<p>The lack of an Android version of Clubhouse has already caused some complications for the company.</p>
<p>A number of Android app developers have taken advantage of the hole left in the market to hawk their &#8220;Clubhouse guides,&#8221; which intentionally aim to confuse Android users looking for Clubhouse by using the same app icon. (Google apparently doesn&#8217;t bother to weed out low-value and/or infringing content like this from the Play Store.)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>More recently,<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fraudsters-jump-on-clubhouse-hype-to-push-malicious-android-app/"> cybercriminals have gotten in on the action</a>, too. They&#8217;ve created fake versions of Clubhouse that even pointed to a well-executed copy of the Clubhouse website in order to trick users into downloading their malicious app. One of these apps has been <a href="https://threatpost.com/android-clubhouse-app-malware/164915/">found to be spreading BlackRock malware</a>, which steals users&#8217; login credentials for over 450 services, including Facebook, Twitter and Amazon.</p>
<p>Davison addressed this issue during the Townhall, warning users that if they see anyone trying to impersonate Clubhouse on Android, not to use that app because &#8220;it could be harmful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly not the real Clubhouse. Same thing with PC. There&#8217;s no PC app for Clubhouse,&#8221; he said, adding that a desktop version of Clubhouse is not a high priority for the company.</p>
<p>The company made a number of other announcements, as well, the most notable being its plans for more creator tools. These will be focused on helping creators grow their own audiences for their shows, and even monetize their events, if they choose, through things like direct payments, subscriptions, brand sponsorships, and even &#8220;paid events.&#8221; Clubhouse will also offer tools for managing memberships and tracking metrics around listeners and retention, but overall, details were light on what specific tools would be available or when they would roll out.</p>
<p>Clubhouse hasn&#8217;t responded to a request for further comment on the statements made during its Townhall event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With Y Combinator Demo Day kicking off tomorrow morning, startups in the current batch are hurrying to make a little news before they show off their recent growth to investors. The list includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/rent-the-runways-first-ios-team-launches-runway-an-easier-way-to-coordinate-app-releases/">Runway</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">Pangea</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">Flux</a>.</p>
<p>Add <a href="https://www.chums.co/">Chums</a> to the mix. Chums is a social shopping service that helps friends suggest products to their pals. And the startup has put together a total of $3.5 million across two pre-seed investments.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-elion-338579100/">Noah Elion</a>, one of Chums&#8217; founders, about the round. He said that his company closed $1 million in December, later looking to raise another $1.5 million. Interest ran high for shares in the startup, so Chums wound up raising $1 million more than its latter target, for a combined total of $3.5 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="R4R9tMxJUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/">These undergraduates left university to build Flux, a payments startup now in YC</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;These undergraduates left university to build Flux, a payments startup now in YC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/these-undergraduates-left-university-to-build-flux-a-payments-startup-now-in-yc/embed/#?secret=R4R9tMxJUo" data-secret="R4R9tMxJUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company declined to share the cap at which the funds, raised via a SAFE, were secured.</p>
<p>The $1.5 million target was based on the amount of capital that his company would need for the next 18 months, Elion said. The final sum came from Ludlow, Shrug, Contrary Capital and Fuel Capital, among other firms and individuals.</p>
<p>How did a company in the midst of Y Combinator manage to raise an old-school Series A round of capital despite launching its product just a few weeks ago? The background of its founding team helps some. Co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dick-fickling-580b1842/">Dick Fickling</a> was an early engineer at Honey, for example, another shopping-focused startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">had a material exit</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d1bapSH2u6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pregame-y-combinator-with-equity/">Pregame Y Combinator with Equity</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pregame Y Combinator with Equity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/pregame-y-combinator-with-equity/embed/#?secret=d1bapSH2u6" data-secret="d1bapSH2u6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s service is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chums-get-the-right-stuff/id1548842488">mobile app</a> that allows users to follow product-types that they may want to purchase, and suggest goods to one another that might fit their friends&#8217; needs. It made its way to market three weeks ago, or as Elion explained, right before his company went out fundraising. TechCrunch asked about early traction, to which Elion said that it was too soon to say much, though his team has seen &#8220;encouraging&#8221; levels of engagement thus far.</p>
<p>The startup is four people today, which its website describes as a group of friends. This is mostly true. Elion and Fickling teamed up after the former built a predecessor to Chums &#8212; called <a href="https://chumsreferral.com/">Chums Referral</a> &#8212; becoming friends in the process. Fickling was previously colleagues and friends with the folks who comprise the rest of the team, namely <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-williams-72a83968/">Lauren Williams</a> (director of engineering) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenagasilina/">Lena Gasilina</a> (product).</p>
<p>The team is looking for a designer and a front-end developer, but after that is done hiring. It intends to stay at six people until its next round. Why? It wants to reach product-market fit with a half-dozen staff. If it does, it should be able to raise more money at a comfortable valuation. There&#8217;s some sense in the idea, though it was slightly odd to hear a startup plan measured growth to preserve capital in 2021.</p>
<p>Chums makes money on commissions from recommended products, splitting the revenue with users. Elion declined to share the network, or networks, his company is working with to secure commercial ties with retailers, but did note that in time Chums will go direct to secure better deals.</p>
<p>With a closed round, most of its team in place and an app in the market, it&#8217;s now up to Chums to prove Elion&#8217;s view Google is overly gamed and Amazon is best when you know what you are looking for. In the co-founder&#8217;s view, people liked malls for their &#8220;diversity of content&#8221; and as a space for &#8220;spontaneous shopping.&#8221; Perhaps Chums can fit that niche, and, in the process, generate some serious coin.</p>

Seven Seven Six and Unshackled followed suit this morning, releasing subsequent statements that they plan to donate any potential profits from investments to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Spark Capital decides to “sever all ties” with David Dobrik’s Dispo app weeks after leading deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/embed/#?secret=VaCOICb40b" data-secret="VaCOICb40b" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Seven Seven Six, an early-stage venture capital firm founded by Reddit&#8217;s Alexis Ohanian, released a statement on Monday morning saying that the allegations against Dobrik are &#8220;extremely troubling&#8221; and are &#8220;directly at odds&#8221; with the firm&#8217;s core values.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have made the decision to donate any profits from our investment in Dispo to an organization working with survivors of sexual assault. We have believed in Dispo’s mission since the beginning and will continue to support the hardworking team bringing it to life,&#8221; according to the firm&#8217;s statement. Ohanian has retweeted the statement from his personal account but has offered no separate statement.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s language suggests that it will still support Dispo, unlike Spark, which has left its board position at the company.</p>
<p>Unshackled Ventures similarly tells TechCrunch that the firm will donate any profits from the investment in Dispo to organizations focused on survivors of sexual assault. The firm pointed to <a href="https://maitri.org/new-page-3">Maitri</a>, an organization that supports women survivors, as one place it plans to donate to.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a female majority team that does not take this lightly. We are in full support of their decision to part ways with David,&#8221; per the statement. The firm did not say whether or not it would continue supporting Dispo as a company beyond Dobrik.</p>

<p>It is unclear how Spark Capital, which similarly is in the process of making sure it doesn&#8217;t profit from Dispo, will be handling its financial stake as well. Spark was unable to be reached for clarification.</p>
<p>The company was last valued at $200 million with Spark Capital-led $20 million Series A financing just weeks ago. Dispo released a statement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/?tpcc=ECTW2020">last night stating</a> that Dobrik has stepped down from the board of Dispo and leave the company. It is unclear if Dobrik still has a financial stake in the company through ownership and if he plans to divest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sideinc.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a real estate technology company that works to turn agents and independent brokerages into boutique brands and businesses, announced Monday that it has raised $150 million in Series D funding.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coatue.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coatue Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led the round, which brings San Francisco-based Side’s valuation to $1 billion and total funding raised to over $200 million since its 2017 inception. Existing backers Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures and Sapphire Ventures also participated in the new financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is notable in that the amount raised is significantly higher than the $35 million Side raised in a Series C round in November 2019. Valuation too increased nearly 7x compared to the $150 million valuation at the time of its Series C. Sapphire Ventures led that investment and managing director </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Levine, who was previously president and COO of Trulia (through its IPO and multibillion-dollar acquisition by Zillow), joined the company’s board of directors at that time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup pulled in between $30 million and $50 million in revenue in 2020, and expects to double revenue this year. In 2019, Side represented over $5 billion in annual home sales across all of its partners. Today, the company&#8217;s community of agent partners represents over $15 billion in annual production volum<i>e.</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side was founded by Guy Gal, Edward Wu and Hilary Saunders on the premise that most real estate agents are “underserved and underappreciated” by traditional brokerage models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Gal said existing brokerages are designed to support “average” agents and as such, the top-producing agents end up having to do “all of the heavy lifting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Side’s white label model works with agents and teams by exclusively marketing their boutique brand, while also providing the required technology and support needed on the back end. The goal is to help partner agents &#8220;predictably grow&#8221; their businesses and improve their productivity.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The way to think about Side is the way you think about what Shopify does for e-commerce&#8230;When partnering with Side, top-producing agents, teams and independent brokerages, for the first time in history, gain full ownership of their own brand and business without having to operate a brokerage,&#8221; Gal said. &#8220;When you spend years solving the problems of this very specific community of agents, you are able to use software to drive enormous efficiency for them in a way that has never been done before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Existing brokerages, he argues, actively discourage agents from becoming top producers and teams, because agents who serve fewer clients can be forced into paying much higher commission fees on every transaction, which means the incentives between brokerages and top agents and teams are misaligned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Top producers want to grow and differentiate, and brokerages want them to do less business at higher fees and be one more of the same under the same brand,&#8221; Gal said. &#8220;Side, rather than discouraging and competing with top producing agents and teams, enables them to grow and scale their own business and brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, Side supports more than 1,500 partner agents across California, Texas and Florida.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to spend its new capital on “significant hiring” and toward an expansion outside of California, Texas and Florida &#8212; the three markets in which it currently operates. It also plans to boost its 300-plus headcount by another 200 employees. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's rewind back through TechCrunch's ironSource coverage during its life as a private company and then examine its financial results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.is.com/?referrer=ironsrc.com">ironSource</a>, an app-monetization startup, is going public via a SPAC.</p>
<p>But before you tune out to avoid reading about yet another blank-check company taking a private company public, you&#8217;ll want to pay attention to this one.</p>
<p>For starters, this is the second SPAC-led debut from an Israeli company in recent weeks worth more than $10 billion. And secondly, ironSource is actually a pretty darn interesting company from a financial perspective.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/what-etoros-investor-presentation-and-10b-valuation-tells-us-about-robinhood/">follows eToro in announcing its combination</a> with a public entity designed to help startups get over the private-public divide. Valued at just over $11 billion by <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ironsource-announces-combination-with-thoma-bravo-advantage-to-create-a-publicly-traded-business-platform-for-the-app-economy-301252534.html">the deal</a>, it will best eToro&#8217;s valuation by several hundred million. Combined, both companies will bring more than $20 billion in liquidity to their founders, backers, ecosystems, employees and SPAC teams associated with their impending debuts.</p>

At the end, we&#8217;ll ask ourselves whether its new valuation makes any damn sense.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Monday, and that means it&#8217;s time to strap in and get to work. Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<h2>ironSource&#8217;s past, performance and future</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered ironSource for years, including a piece on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/ironsource/">its 2014-era $85 million investment</a>. At the time, we noted that the company &#8220;support[s] about 5 million installs per day and [has] more than 50,000 applications using [its] SDK.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2019, ironSource raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/ironsource-a-mobile-adtech-startup-confirms-400m-raise-at-1-valuation/">more than $400 million</a> at a valuation of more than $1 billion, though details were fuzzy at the time. TechCrunch wrote about the company <em>last month</em> when it announced its <em>second</em> acquisition of the year; ironSource <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/11/ironsource-acquires-ad-measurement-firm-soomla/">bought Soomla</a> &#8212;  app monetization tracking &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ironsource-acquires-luna-labs/">and Luna Labs</a> &#8212; video ad tooling &#8212; toward the end of its path to a public debut.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company was worth an estimated $1.56 billion when it closed its 2019-era round. That ironSource intends to go public with a valuation of $11.1 billion means that it is shooting for a commanding increase in value in just a few short years.</p>
<p>Is the company worth the new number? Let&#8217;s find out, starting with a look at its revenue growth over time:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128317" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128317" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2128317 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="224" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png 922w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?resize=300,99 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?resize=768,253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?resize=680,224 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-10.13.01-AM.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128317" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ironHorse</p></div></p>
<p>First, observe ironSource&#8217;s historical performance in 2020 compared to 2019; posting 83% revenue growth from a nine-figure base is impressive. The company only expects to grow a hair over 37% in 2021, however, though it doesn&#8217;t anticipate further revenue growth deceleration in percentage terms the following year.</p>
<p>The chart on the right is useful as well. Note how the company&#8217;s 2019 saw strong growth from its Q1 to its Q4. But also note its flat summer, in which sequential growth came to a near halt. Comparing that lackluster middle period with the rapid growth ironSource posted in every quarter of 2020 is stark. Sure, the pandemic boosted screen time for all of us, but my gosh, did ironSource have a great year on the back of the pandemic.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of another big tech vs Congress &#8216;grab your popcorn&#8217; grilling session, scheduled for March 25 &#8212; when US lawmakers will once again question the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter on the unlovely topic of misinformation &#8212; a coalition of organizations across the privacy, antitrust, consumer protection and civil rights spaces has <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com">called for a ban on &#8220;surveillance advertising&#8221;</a>, further amplifying the argument that &#8220;big tech&#8217;s toxic business model is undermining democracy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The close to 40-strong coalition behind this latest call to ban &#8216;creepy ads&#8217; which rely on the mass tracking and profiling of web users in order to target them with behavioral ads includes the American Economic Liberties Project, the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, the Center for Digital Democracy, the Center for Humane Technology, Epic.org, Fair Vote, Media Matters for America, the Tech Transparency Project and The Real Facebook Oversight Board, to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As leaders across a broad range of issues and industries, we are united in our concern for the safety of </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">our communities and the health of democracy,&#8221; they write in the </span><a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6037bac32729e03c425791a6/605789d32e8de8a73441e1a7_Coalition%20Letter.pdf">open letter</a>. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Social media giants are eroding our consensus reality and threatening public safety in service of a toxic, extractive business model. That’s why we’re joining forces in an effort to ban surveillance advertising.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The coalition is keen to point out that less toxic non-tracking alternatives (like <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">contextual ads) exist, while arguing that greater transparency and oversight of adtech infrastructure could help clean up a range of linked problems, from junk content and rising conspiracism to ad fraud and denuded digital innovation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no silver bullet to remedy this crisis – and the members of this coalition will continue to pursue a range of different policy approaches, from comprehensive privacy legislation to reforming our antitrust laws and liability standards,&#8221; they write. &#8220;But here’s one thing we all agree on: It’s time to ban surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="c5EZXpW3ja"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">EU parliament backs tighter rules on behavioural ads</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU parliament backs tighter rules on behavioural ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/embed/#?secret=c5EZXpW3ja" data-secret="c5EZXpW3ja" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>&#8220;Big Tech platforms amplify hate, illegal activities, and conspiracism &#8212; and feed users increasingly extreme content &#8212; because that’s what generates the most engagement and profit,&#8221; they warn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their own algorithmic tools have boosted everything from white supremacist groups and Holocaust denialism to COVID-19 hoaxes, counterfeit opioids and fake cancer cures. Echo chambers, radicalization, and viral lies are features of these platforms, not bugs &#8212; central to the business model.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coalition also warns over surveillance advertising&#8217;s impact on the traditional news business, noting that shrinking revenues for professional journalism is raining more harm down upon the (genuine) information ecosystem democracies need to thrive.</p>
<p>The potshots are well rehearsed at this point although it&#8217;s an oversimplification to blame the demise of traditional news on tech giants so much as &#8216;giant tech&#8217;: aka the industrial disruption wrought by the Internet making so much information freely available. But dominance of the programmatic adtech pipeline by a couple of platform giants clearly doesn&#8217;t help. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">Australia&#8217;s recent legislative answer to this problem</a> is still too new to assess for impacts but there&#8217;s a risk its news media bargaining code will merely benefit big media <em>and</em> big tech while doing nothing about the harms of either industry profiting off of outrage.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook and Google’s monopoly power and data harvesting practices have given them an unfair advantage, allowing them to dominate the digital advertising market, siphoning up revenue that once kept local newspapers afloat. So while Big Tech CEOs get richer, journalists get laid off,&#8221; the coalition warns, adding: &#8220;Big Tech will continue to stoke discrimination, division, and delusion &#8212; even if it fuels targeted violence or lays the groundwork for an insurrection &#8212; so long as it’s in their financial interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among a <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com/real-costs-of-the-business">laundry list of harms</a> the coalition is linking to the dominant ad-based online business models of tech giants Facebook and Google is the funding of what they describe as &#8220;insidious misinformation sites that promote medical hoaxes, conspiracy theories, extremist content, and foreign propaganda&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning surveillance advertising would restore transparency and accountability to digital ad placements, and substantially defund junk sites that serve as critical infrastructure in the disinformation pipeline,&#8221; they argue, adding: &#8220;These sites produce an endless drumbeat of made-to-go-viral conspiracy theories that are then boosted by bad-faith social media influencers and the platforms’ engagement-hungry algorithms &#8212; a toxic feedback loop fueled and financed by surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other harms they point to are the risks posed to public health by platforms&#8217; amplification of junk/bogus content such as COVID-19 conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation; the risk of discrimination through unfairly selective and/or biased ad targeting, such as job ads that illegally exclude women or ethnic minorities; and the perverse economic incentives for ad platforms to amplify extremist/outrageous content in order to boost user engagement with content and ads, thereby fuelling societal division and driving partisanship as a byproduct of the fact platforms benefit financially from more content being spread.</p>
<p>The coalition also argues that the surveillance advertising system is &#8220;rigging the game against small businesses&#8221; because it embeds platform monopolies &#8212; which is a neat counterpoint to tech giants&#8217; defensive claim that creepy ads somehow level the playing field for SMEs vs larger brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Facebook and Google portray themselves as lifelines for small businesses, the truth is they’re simply charging monopoly rents for access to the digital economy,&#8221; they write, arguing that the duopoly&#8217;s &#8220;surveillance-driven stranglehold over the ad market leaves the little guys with no leverage or choice&#8221; &#8212; opening them up to exploitation by big tech.</p>
<p>The current market structure &#8212; with Facebook and Google controlling close to 60% of the US ad market &#8212; is thus stifling innovation and competition, they further assert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of being a boon for online publishers, surveillance advertising disproportionately benefits Big Tech platforms,&#8221; they go on, noting that Facebook made $84.2BN in 2020 ad revenue and Google made $134.8BN off advertising &#8220;while the surveillance ad industry ran rife with allegations of fraud&#8221;.</p>
<p>The campaign being kicked off is by no means the first call for a ban on behavioral advertising but given how many signatories are backing this one it&#8217;s a sign of the scale of the momentum building against a data-harvesting business model that has shaped the modern era and allowed a couple of startups to metamorphosize into society- and democracy-denting giants.</p>
<p>That looks important as US lawmakers are now paying close attention to big tech impacts &#8212; and have a number of big tech antitrust cases actively on the table. Although it was European privacy regulators that were among the first to sound the alarm over microtargeting&#8217;s abusive impacts and risks for democratic societies.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">2018</a>, in the wake of the Facebook data misuse and voter targeting scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, the UK&#8217;s ICO called for an ethical pause on the use of online ad tools for political campaigning &#8212; penning a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/2259369/democracy-disrupted-110718.pdf">report </a>entitled <em>Democracy Disrupted? Personal information and political influence. </em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no small irony that the self-same regulator has so far <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">declined to take any action</a> against the adtech industry&#8217;s unlawful use of people&#8217;s data &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">warning in 2019</a> that behavioral advertising is out of control.</p>
<p>The ICO&#8217;s ongoing inaction seems likely to have fed into the UK government&#8217;s decision that a dedicated unit is required to oversee big tech.</p>
<p>In recent years the UK has singled out the online ad space for antitrust concern &#8212; saying it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">establish a pro-competition regulator</a> to tackle big tech&#8217;s dominance, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">a market study of the digital advertising sector</a> carried out in 2019 by its Competition and Markets Authority which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">reported</a> substantial concerns over the power of the adtech duopoly.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, the European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor urged not a pause but a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking internet users’ digital activity &#8212; calling on regional lawmakers&#8217; to incorporate the lever into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">major reform of digital services rules</a> which is intended to boost operators’ accountability, among other goals.</p>
<p>The European Commission&#8217;s proposal had avoided going so far. But negotiations over the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act are ongoing.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">Last year</a> the European Parliament also backed a tougher stance on creepy ads. Again, though, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">Commission&#8217;s framework for tackling online political ads</a> does not suggest anything so radical &#8212; with EU lawmakers pushing for greater transparency instead.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what US lawmakers will do but with US civil society organizations joining forces to amplify an anti-ad-targeting message there&#8217;s rising pressure to clean up the toxic adtech in its own backyard.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement on the <a href="https://www.bansurveillanceadvertising.com/what-people-are-saying">coalition&#8217;s website</a>, Zephyr Teachout, an associate professor of law at Fordham Law School, said: &#8220;Facebook and Google possess enormous monopoly power, combined with the surveillance regimes of authoritarian states and the addiction business model of cigarettes. Congress has broad authority to regulate their business models and should use it to ban them from engaging in surveillance advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surveillance advertising has robbed newspapers, magazines, and independent writers of their livelihoods and commoditized their work &#8212; and all we got in return were a couple of abusive monopolists,&#8221; added David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Ruby on Rails, in another supporting statement. &#8220;That&#8217;s not a good bargain for society. By banning this practice, we will return the unique value of writing, audio, and video to the people who make it rather than those who aggregate it.”</p>
<p>With US policymakers paying increasingly close attention to adtech, it&#8217;s interesting to see Google is <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1373972755360649217">accelerating</a> its efforts to replace support for individual-level tracking with what it&#8217;s branded as a &#8216;privacy-safe&#8217; alternative (FLoC).</p>
<p>Yet the tech it&#8217;s proposed via its Privacy Sandbox will still enable groups (cohorts) of web users to be targeted by advertisers, with ongoing risks for discrimination, the targeting of vulnerable groups of people and societal-scale manipulation &#8212; so lawmakers will need to pay close attention to the detail of the &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; rather than Google&#8217;s branding.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, in a word, <i>bad</i> for privacy,&#8221; warned the EFF, writing about the proposal back in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1">2019</a>. &#8220;A flock name would essentially be a behavioral credit score: a tattoo on your digital forehead that gives a succinct summary of who you are, what you like, where you go, what you buy, and with whom you associate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;FLoC is the opposite of privacy-preserving technology,&#8221; it added. &#8220;Today, trackers follow you around the web, skulking in the digital shadows in order to guess at what kind of person you might be. In Google’s future, they will sit back, relax, and let your browser do the work for them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Prime Wardrobe has been a key way for the e-commerce giant to expand its reach selling clothing and other apparel: giving shoppers an easy way to try on several items, return what they don&#8217;t want, and pay for what they keep has helped it cross the virtual chasm by bringing the online experience a little closer to what it&#8217;s like to shop for fashion in physical stores. Now, a startup that&#8217;s built &#8220;Prime Wardrobe as a service&#8221; to help smaller competitors offer its shoppers the same experience is announcing some funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trynow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TryNow</a> &#8212; which provides technology to online retailers that use Shopify Plus to let their customers receive and try out apparel, return what they don&#8217;t want and pay only for what they keep &#8212; has raised $12 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p>The startup, based out of San Francisco, already works with around 50 up-and-coming online retailers doing between $10 million and $100 million in revenues, with Universal Standard, Roolee, Western Rise, and Solid &amp; Striped among its customers. Founder and CEO Benjamin Davis said in an interview that it has seen business grow six-fold in the last year as more shopping has shifted online from brick-and-mortar due to the pandemic. TryNow claims that using its service can help brands grow average order value by 63%, conversion rates by 22% and return on ad spend by 76%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fashion has been a primary focus for &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; services online, but the the model is not limited to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparel is a core category for us,&#8221; said Davis, but he also said he believes that the model can be applied to improve the unit economics of selling online to other categories, like cookware. &#8220;Prime Wardrobe has solidified the power of that model for fashion, but we believe it&#8217;s much larger. We think that any purchase that is discretionary should be tried before it is bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a Series A, is coming from a very notable list of backers that speaks to the opportunity in this space. Investors in the round include Shine Capital, Craft Ventures, SciFi VC (the venture firm co-founded by Max Levchin, founder and CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Affirm), Third Kind, and Plaid co-founders Zachary Perret and William Hockey.</p>
<h2>As-a-service, at your service</h2>
<p>TryNow sits as part of a bigger wave of commerce and finance services that have emerged over the years to provide technology to entrepreneurs where the commerce technology they are using is not the core of the business they are building.</p>
<p>The thinking goes: building payments or related features is complex and not something that a company not focused on payments would build itself (much like most businesses would not build their own accounting software, or the computers that they use). And as the biggest competitors &#8212; eg, Amazon &#8212; continue to grow and build their own technology in-house to keep their competitive edge, a demand for more tech-enabled tools only grows and becomes more sophisticated with the competitive threat. These in turn get delivered as a service, since smaller competitors will lack the funds and human capital to build these themselves.</p>
<p>Davis said that TryNow chose to work solely with Shopify (and specifically Shopify Plus, the version of the service with more features, designed for retailers with more than $1 million in revenues) and its platform for letting retailers build and operate e-commerce storefronts, because of how it has become such an integral player in that ecosystem.</p>
<p>He said that there has been demand from retailers using other platforms such as Big Commerce and Adobe&#8217;s Magento &#8212; as well as the platforms themselves. And it will look to expand to these over time, but for now, &#8220;we think Shopify is the most powerful, and growing the fastest, with the biggest opportunity at checkout,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;It&#8217;s a multibillion opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>TryNow has whittled down its core functionality in the e-commerce space to a very specific role.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t handle checkout &#8212; that&#8217;s Shopify; nor transactions &#8212; that&#8217;s payment companies, or indeed by-now-pay-later companies (like TryNow, another kind of tech helping people defray the payment part of procurement); nor returns &#8212; it integrates with Happy Returns, Loop Returns and Returnly; nor email-based communications and marketing with customers &#8212; that&#8217;s Klaviyo.</p>
<p>What TryNow provides are analytics to manage the risk around any deal, and technology to integrate and manage the payments and returns experience, so that procuring doesn&#8217;t trigger a payment, returning triggers a payment for what is kept, and I suppose not returning triggers a different kind of payment (plus flagging the customer for future try-now-pay-later attempts).</p>
<p>Within the wider space of e-commerce, apparel has had a particularly tricky ride among those trying to bring the experience into the online world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise when you think about it: shopping for apparel is an inherently physical activity, involving trying things on, browsing around big stores with wide selections, and only paying for what you actually take away with you.</p>
<p>That has given rise to a lot of different startups, leaning on new innovations in computer vision and other areas of artificial intelligence, better cameras on phones, new manufacturing techniques and more to try to sew up the gap between what you do online and how you would shop in the brick-and-mortar world.</p>
<p>(And these startups are seeing their own opportunities and demand in the market: just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap Inc acquired Fit Analytics</a>, one of the tech companies building better tools to improve how online shoppers can estimate what size they might need to buy of an item: the social media company&#8217;s interest is to use the technology to expand how it works with its advertisers and to build out a bigger shopping experience on Snapchat and beyond.)</p>
<p>Before try-now-pay-later, the basic idea of selling fashion online has been to assume it&#8217;s okay to skip all the physical aspects of buying apparel before paying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a credit card, and I&#8217;ll charge you for what you are getting, and if you don&#8217;t like it, you can get a refund? We would never operate a brick-and-mortar store that way, charging people before going into fitting rooms,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;It&#8217;s unnatural and restricts growth.&#8221; And high-ticket items can be even harder to sell in that environment, he added.</p>
<p>While companies like Le Tote, Stitch Fix, and Wantable have built out fashion businesses on the premise of try first, and then pay only for what you keep, there are fewer companies out there that have distilled this idea into a standalone, B2B service. (And indeed, the try-before-you-buy service can be a tricky one to manage as a viable business, with Le Tote, now in Chapter 11, and now-defund Lumoid pointing to some of the challenges.)</p>
<p>“Ben and the TryNow team are taking what they&#8217;ve learned from Affirm and Stitch Fix and launching the ultimate checkout option: try now, buy later. This translates into more order volume and more profit. We all want to try before we buy: it&#8217;s only a matter of time before TryNow&#8217;s checkout solution becomes the standard,” said Brian Murray, managing director at Craft Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, there are others that compete more directly. <a href="https://www.blackcart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackCart</a> out of Canada, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/blackcart-raises-8-8m-series-a-for-its-try-before-you-buy-platform-for-online-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised funding earlier this year</a>, also provides try-now-pay-later as a service for apparel and other goods, and it integrates with other storefront platforms beyond Shopify. (It seems to take a different approach to offsetting the risk for retailers, essentially making up-front payments for goods itself and then reconciling directly with the retails around returns.) And it seems like a no brainer that Amazon might try to offer Wardrobe as a service to more retailers, as it does with so many of its other features.</p>
<p>Along with the funding, TryNow is also announcing a couple of new executive appointments that speak to where it sees itself competing and sitting longer term. Jessica Baier, formerly of Stitch Fix, is now VP of growth strategy; and Jonathan Kayne, a former head of product partnerships for Affirm, is now TryNow’s VP of platform.</p>
<p>The investors in this round are a pretty interesting set of backers that also point to possible directions for the company.</p>
<p>Shine is a relatively new firm co-founded by Mo Koyfman and Josh Mohrer to focus on early stage investments, with Koyfman previously backing a lot of interesting e-commerce companies at Spark; Craft is another early stage firm co-founded by David Sacks and Bill Lee; SciFi VC is Max and Nellie Levchin&#8217;s venture fund (and Max has a long and impressive track record in e-commerce, most recently as the founder and CEO of another startup in the flexible payment space, buy-now-pay-later business Affirm).</p>
<p>Third Kind, meanwhile, has been a prolific backer of e-commerce tech as part of its bigger investment thesis. And while Plaid&#8217;s founders are investing here as financial backers, it&#8217;s notable that they are both providing financial features as a service to third party businesses: diversification for Plaid might one day come in the form of providing tools for specific verticals, which would likely take them into the realm of more flexible payment and procurement options.</p>
<p>“At Shine, we are attracted to businesses with simple yet powerful insights that can ultimately lead to massively scalable new platforms,” said Koyfman in a statement. “TryNow’s understanding that a lack of tactility restricts e-commerce growth has opened the opportunity to create and scale the Try Now Buy Later category. It is rare to find such a strong team attacking such a simple but big idea. We are delighted to partner with Benjamin and the entire TryNow team as they scale their elegant platform and help e-commerce brands close the conversion gap with brick and mortar retail.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigerian startup <a href="https://xend.finance/">Xend Finance</a> uses <span style="font-weight: 400;">decentralized finance (DeFi) to address currency devaluation. DeFi aims to bridge the gap between decentralized blockchains and financial services. <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ugochukwu-aronu-4477a59b">Aronu Ugochukwu</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chima-abafor-56801a90">Abafor Chima</a> founded the startup in 2019, and Ugochukwu is quite familiar with currency devaluation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency devaluation is a common economic nightmare faced in most African countries and other developing countries worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has become imperative for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> organisations like credit unions to hedge their collective funds against their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nigerians-turn-to-stablecoins-for-protection-against-inflation">local currency&#8217;s devaluation</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve experienced three massive currency devaluations in the last three years in Nigeria, and this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different economies in the world with unstable economies,&#8221; Ugochukwu said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My mother and I belong to different cooperatives where we save and make monthly contributions to help one another in the cooperative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Realizing that despite saving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we were losing more value for our money. This gave birth to Xend Finance.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company announced its mainnet launch, opening up the ability for credit unions to access DeFi for their members by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using decentralized stablecoins such as DAI and BUSD.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is Xend Finance trying to protect credit unions from fluctuation, but it is also changing how they operate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these unions, groups of individuals contribute to informal savings for their different mutual benefits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are often limited by three factors. One is in its size &#8212; only a small knit of people in a particular locale can access the service. The second</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is lack of insurance which means people don&#8217;t have the confidence to join saving cycles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third has to do with how credit union members default in payments, affecting how much </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is paid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128352" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128352" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2128352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png 3372w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/App-Homepage.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xend Finance</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xend Finance is plugging these gaps using blockchain technology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform allows credit unions to have over 1,000 members who don&#8217;t stay in the same geographical location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also employs smart contracts to lock each member&#8217;s contribution and enable flexible payouts when a payment cycle is due, which reduces default payment rates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also says it offers decentralized insurance to protect members against any form of asset loss that results from contract failures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, this isn&#8217;t a traditional insurance contract from an insurance company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the company says credit union members can earn interests in their savings by exchanging their crypto or fiat currency for stable cryptocurrencies and locking crypto assets on lending platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, there&#8217;s a possible 15% available annual percentage yield on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to be the world’s first decentralized finance (DeFi) credit union platform and the first DeFi company to launch out of Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its technology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a blockchain for developing high-performance decentralized applications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the startup based in Enugu, Nigeria, took part in the</span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/09/12-startups-selected-for-4th-google-launchpad-africa-accelerator/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Launchpad Africa accelerator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/06/4-african-startups-graduate-from-binance-incubation-programme/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Incubation Programme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has since secured $2.2 million from Binance, Google Launchpad, NGC Ventures, Hashkey, and AU21 Capital, amongst others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From December 2020 to January 2021, Xend Finance executed a testnet with over 1,500 participants in 75 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helped them find product-market fit, and last week, the company did a beta launch of its mainnet where it received over $500,000 in deposits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also signed a credit union <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-backed-defi-credit-union-platform-secures-partners-funding-before-launch">partnership</a> with a software service provider, TechFusion Africa and its 5,000 members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128353" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128353" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2128353" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png 3032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=2048,1205 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Traction-3-days-after-prelaunch.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128353" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xend Finance</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company intends to onboard a lot of customers now and focus on revenue later, Ugochukwu says. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when it does, the play will be to charge a commission (not more than 5%) on the return on investment when members of cooperatives or regular individuals save or perform contributions on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having run some tests and passed several iterations, Xend Finance is fully going public today, and Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao, CEO of Binance, expects the platform to show what can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on BSC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Africa is one of the most important continents, representing the future and emergence of DeFi and blockchain capabilities,” said Zhao</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very excited about the mainnet launch of Xend Finance, with a team we backed early on that has a strong foothold in Africa and have been strong advocates for what Binance Smart Chain can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accomplish</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their platform, they can bring stable currency and DeFi investment opportunities to those who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wouldn’t have them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the mainnet launch, Xend Finance will introduce the $XEND token through a Token Generation Event (TGE) on <a href="https://balancer.exchange/">Balancer</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says the token will reward users for performing different operations in &#8220;the protocol, as well as allows a decentralized governance of the Xend Finance ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Ugochukwu, Xend Finance presents people with the opportunity to channel their savings into stablecoins without worry that their money will devalue overnight and earn higher interest rates through DeFi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We are very excited that blockchain will have a positive impact on the people of Africa,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B. Before I forget, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the newsletter, if you&#8217;re interested in attending our upcoming early-stage conference. I have a gift for you.</p>
<p>Um, there is a #$@% ton of mobility news to get to, including a few scoops, some investment news, and a new &#8220;market map&#8221; that takes a deep look into the business of Mobility-as-a-service apps. Buckle up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First up, here&#8217;s the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/maas-transit-the-business-of-mobility-as-a-service/">market maps story</a> (I just mentioned) from writer Jason Plautz. The upshot: As transit agencies seek to win back riders, a flurry of platforms &#8212; some backed by giants like Uber, Intel and BMW &#8212; are offering new technology partnerships. Whether it&#8217;s bundling bookings, payments or just trip planning, startups are selling these mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings as a lifeline to make transit agencies the backbone of urban mobility. Third-party platforms have become more appealing to transit agencies as they scramble to keep buses, trains and rail full of customers.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Bird peeped up this week (they&#8217;ve been sorta quiet lately) and announced it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">investing $150 million</a> into a European expansion plan that will include launching in more than 50 cities this year, a move that it says will double its footprint in the region.</p>
<p>According to Bird, this growth plan is already underway, with the shared micromobility company recently bringing its scooters to Bergen, Norway; Tarragona, Spain; and Palermo, Italy.</p>
<p>Bird emphasized that its European expansion will be more than just a geographic one. The company said it is adding more scooters to its existing fleets and made several other promises as part of its announcement, including plans to launch new mobility products and safety initiatives, &#8220;the next generation of recycling and second-life applications for vehicles,&#8221; investing in equity programs and &#8220;securing partnerships across the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>I might have raised an eyebrow or two when I first read this announcement. Why? Welp, for one it isn&#8217;t clear what these new mobility products or initiatives around safety or recycling will be. A Bird spokesperson told me these will be new vehicles and “transport modes” in the region. Bird didn’t provide details about what it means by “securing partnerships,” a phrase that could mean an extension of its franchise program called the Bird Platform or some other kind of arrangement with local governments or operators.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the bit about that $150 million. A Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch it’s using “existing resources” to fund these various initiatives. However, the pandemic, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/bird-confirms-acquisition-of-berlin-scooter-competitor-circ/">acquisition of Circ</a> and its effort to launch operations in new cities while maintaining existing fleets have depleted its funds. (Last June, Bird <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/bird-shuts-down-circ-operations-in-middle-east-scraps-as-many-as-10000-scooters/">shut down scooter sharing</a> in several cities in the Middle East, an operation that was managed by Circ.) The company’s last public fundraising announcements were more than a year ago. The company raised $275 million in a Series D round back in September 2019. That round was later extended to $350 million.</p>
<p>Now, this could be the $100 million in convertible debt that Bird reportedly was close to finalizing (per The Information&#8217;s reporting back in January). But something tells me there is more to this. Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>A few other interesting micromobbin&#8217; nugs for you &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong> appear to have secured a license that will allow the companies to exclusively operate scooter and bike share services in Denver. The city&#8217;s Department of Transportation &amp; Infrastructure said it is moving two licensing agreements through the Denver City Council approval process. On March 23, he DOTI will present the licensing agreements to Denver City Council&#8217;s Land Use, Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee  for approval before heading to full council for consideration.</p>
<p>The &#8220;license&#8221; term is important here and marks a shift in how Denver is thinking about dockless shared scooters and bikes. A license would replace how dockless electric scooter and bike companies currently operate in Denver, which is through a permit. If the licenses are approved by Council, Lyft and Lime would be the only two companies operating vehicles in Denver under the new bike and scooter share program. The license would be valid for 5 years.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Superpedestrian</strong>, the startup that makes e-scooters equipped with self-diagnostic software, is upgrading its product as it prepares for a major expansion into 10 new cities within the next two weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan reported</a>. Superpedestrian might not be a household name, but it is an up-and-coming player in the micromobility world. The company has developed AI — which is integrated into the vehicle — that monitors and corrects scooter safety issues in real time.</p>
<p>The next-generation operating system that will provide those upgrades, codenamed “Briggs,” will be uploaded to its global fleet of LINK e-scooters.

<p>The company&#8217;s &#8220;METL tire&#8221; came out of its work with NASA&#8217;s Glenn Research Center, where NASA engineers Dr. Santo Padula and Colin Creager first developed their so-called &#8220;shape memory alloy&#8221; (SMA) technology. SMA allows for a tire constructed entirely of interconnected springs, which requires no inflation and is therefore immune to punctures, but which can still provide equivalent or better traction when compared to inflatable rubber tires, and even some built-in shock-absorbing capabilities, TechCrunch&#8217;s Darrell Etherington reports.</p>
<p>SMART&#8217;s  co-founders, Survivor: Fiji” champion Earl Cole and engineer Brian Yennie, are targeting the cycling market first with their METL tire, which is set to become available to the general public by early next year. SMART intends to bring SMA tires to the automotive and commercial vehicle industries.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Typically, my &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; has a financial figure tied to it. This time, I don&#8217;t have those terms. (Feel free to share,  if you do.) This deal made it to the top of the list because of its importance in the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>I am, of course, talking about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/cruise-acquires-self-driving-startup-voyage/">Cruise acquiring Voyage</a>, a four-year-old autonomous vehicle startup that is well-known in the industry despite its size relative to other major players. Voyage had 60 employees and raised about $52 million compared to giants like Cruise that has a nearly 2,000-person workforce and is valued at $30 billion. But Voyage made an indelible mark on the industry, in large part because of its co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron. The company, which spun out of Udacity in 2017, is best known for its operations in two senior living communities. Voyage tested and gave rides to people within a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, California, as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told the majority of Voyage’s team will move over to Cruise and Cameron will take on a new role as vice president of product. Basically, Cameron will be in charge of anything that touches the customer.</p>
<p>Importantly, Voyage&#8217;s ride-hailing service (which always included a human safety driver behind the wheel) at the two senior communities, one in California and the other in Florida, will be ending before summer. The Villages community in Florida is massive and its where Voyage scaled up and at one point had &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of riders. The shuttering of this service would seem to open up the opportunity to other AV companies; my guess is that Cameron has already fielded a few inquiries.</p>
<p>Voyage’s partnership with FCA, now called Stellantis, will also end once the acquisition with Cruise closes.</p>

<p>Lots. of. news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles and robotics</h2>
<p><strong>Ford Motor </strong>announced plans to embed 100 of its researchers and engineers in a new $75 million robotics and mobility facility on the University of Michigan&#8217;s Ann Arbor campus. The arrangement will give Ford space to conduct robotics research and access to students &#8212; and vice versa &#8212; from the top floor of the four-floor, 134,000 square-foot building. In addition to its fourth-floor lab, Ford will have access to a high-bay garage space to test autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Shortly after the event wrapped up, TechCrunch hardware editor Brian Heater hopped on the phone with Ford’s Technical Expert Mario Santillo, who will help head up the expanded robotics efforts. Here&#8217;s what<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/robotics-roundup-4/"> Santillo had to say.</a></p>
<h2>Electric</h2>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> is expanding customer deliveries via electric cargo vehicle to San Francisco, making the Bay Area the second of 16 total cities the company expects to bring its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/">Rivian-sourced EVs</a> to in 2021. San Francisco&#8217;s unique terrain and climate were a couple of the reasons Amazon said it chose the city for its second round of testing. Its EVs, which were designed and built in partnership with Rivian, can last up to 150 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><strong>BMW</strong> takes the wraps off of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/bmw-takes-the-wraps-off-the-i4-its-first-all-electric-sedan/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">all-electric i4 sedan</a>. The German automaker also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bmw-debuts-the-next-generation-of-its-idrive-operating-system/">version 8 of its iDrive operating system</a>, which will feature a new dashboard layout and visual design, with two curved screens. It will make its debut in the i4 and iX.</p>
<p><strong>Chanje</strong>, EV startup that emerged from stealth in 2017 and is owned by Chanje is owned by Chinese automotive company  FDG, is being sued by truck rental company Ryder for alleged failing to deliver 100 of the 125 vans it was promised, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337230/ryder-chanje-lawsuit-fedex-electric-vans-startup-delivery">The Verge reported</a>. Ryder says it&#8217;s owed nearly $4 million. <a href="http://www.autonocast.com/blog/2018/1/2/40-joerg-sommer-of-chanje">Chanje was on The Autonocast</a> waayyyyy back in 2018. At the time, I was impressed by the idea and the van, which I drove with co-host Alex Roy around downtown Los Angeles. But it seems that Chanje is riddled with problems — and lawsuits. The Verge reported that Chanje has been sued more than once in Los Angeles Superior Court by former employees who say they&#8217;re owed tens of thousands in back pay and bonuses. The company has also been hit with liens from the California Secretary of State for not paying taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Motors</strong>, which is already experimenting with energy storage systems for commercial and residential customers, is also eyeing ways to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/lucid-motors-sees-a-second-life-for-its-ev-batteries-in-energy-storage/">repurpose batteries from its electric vehicles</a>, according to this scoop by TechCrunch&#8217;s Aria Alamalhodaei. While Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson has previously discussed plans to eventually build energy storage systems like Tesla that uses new batteries, this is the first time the company has talked about second-life applications for the product.</p>
<p>This is interesting because Lucid is still years from having to contend with a large number of used batteries. After all, its first EV, the luxury Lucid Air sedan, isn&#8217;t coming to market until the second half of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> is offering owners of the 2021 Kona Electric and Ioniq Electric access to 250 kWh of complimentary charging (approximately 1,000 miles of EPA estimated driving range) on the  Electrify America fast-charging network.</p>
<p><strong>Rivian </strong>plans to install more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/rivian-to-install-more-than-10000-ev-chargers-by-end-of-2023/">10,000 chargers by the end of 2023</a>. The network will have a dual purpose: quickly power its electric vehicle models with fast chargers installed along highways and provide Level 2 chargers at further afield locations next to parks, trailheads and other adventurous destinations. The company said that its so-called Rivian Adventure Network will include more than 3,500 DC fast chargers at over 600 sites, which will only be accessible to owners of its electric vehicles. Each site will have multiple chargers and located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops.</p>
<p>Rivian is also installing thousands of &#8220;waypoint&#8221; Level 2 AC chargers throughout the United States and Canada. These waypoint chargers will have a 11.5 kW charging speed, which should be able add up to 25 miles of range every hour for its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The waypoint chargers will be strategically located along and near routes that Rivian customers are likely to take. They will be found at shopping centers restaurants, hotels, campsites and parks.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen AG</strong> revealed how it aims to seize the top spot as the world&#8217;s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, outlining plans to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/volkswagen-will-bring-240-gigawatt-hours-of-battery-production-capacity-to-europe-by-2030/">six 40 gigawatt hour (GWh) battery cell production plants</a> in operation in Europe by 2030. To get there, the automaker put in a 10-year, $14 billion order with Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt &#8212; and that&#8217;s only one of the six planned factories. A second plant in Germany will commence production in 2025.</p>

<h2>Ride-hailing</h2>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> says that drivers in the U.K. who use its ride-hailing app will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">treated as workers</a>, a designation that will give them some benefits such as holiday pay. However, even as Uber seemingly concedes to a Supreme Court ruling last month, a new fight could already be brewing over the company&#8217;s decision to calculate working time from the point a trip commences &#8212; rather than when drivers log on to the app.</p>
<p>All drivers in the U.K. will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, which will be paid out every two weeks. Drivers will also be paid at least the minimum wage after accepting a trip request and after expenses. Eligible drivers in the U.K. will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber. These contributions will represent approximately 3% of a driver&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p><em>However</em> &#8230; Uber will only guarantee that drivers&#8217; working time and other benefits will accrue once they accept a trip and not based on when they have signed into the app to begin working. That already has labor activists fuming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber’s use of facial recognition technology for a driver identity system is being challenged in the U.K., where the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE) have called for Microsoft to suspend the ride-hailing giant’s use of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/">B2B facial recognition</a> after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>The union said it has identified seven cases of “failed facial recognition and other identity checks” leading to drivers losing their jobs and licence revocation action by TfL, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">TechCrunch reporter Natasha Lomas writes.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/poshmark/">Poshmark</a> has come a long way over the last decade. Launched in 2011, the social fashion marketplace has raised upwards of $150 million, and has now listed on the public markets. It&#8217;s valued at $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>But well before all the success, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/goshposh-its-been-a-ten-year-journey-to-ipo-tales-from-partnering-with-poshmark/">Navin Chaddha saw the potential</a>, leading the Series A for the company.</p>
<p>On our next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Chaddha and Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra to discuss going from Series A to public company. (Registration info is at the bottom of this post.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chandra is a triple-threat executive. He has degrees in marketing, business and computer science, and is a serial entrepreneur who sold his previous company, Kaboodle, to Hearst in 2007. The introduction of the iPhone inspired him to think about the coming shift in consumer behavior, paving the way for an idea like Poshmark to thrive. As is so often the case, what seems obvious in hindsight was incredibly insightful at the time.</p>
<p>The brilliance wasn&#8217;t at all lost on Chaddha, an entrepreneur in his own right. Now, Chaddha leads Mayfield, a firm with $2.5 billion in assets under management. Of the 50 companies he&#8217;s invested in during his venture capital career, 17 have gone public and 24 have been acquired. In other words, it makes sense that he has made an appearance on the Forbes Midas list 12 times.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Chandra and Chaddha about the process of fundraising from the early stage to the growth stage and beyond. But more importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about how a company has to adapt in order to be successful over time.</p>
<p>Plus, Chandra and Chaddha will take a look at pitch decks submitted by the audience and give their live feedback. If you&#8217;re wondering how to perfect your deck, there may be no more valuable resource than the advice of this founder/investor duo. (Also, if you want to submit your deck to be featured on this show, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">smash this link</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space startup Astroscale has launched ELSA-d, the demonstration mission for its End-of-Life Services by Astroscale (ELSA) technology, which aims to dock with, and then safely remove, orbital debris. Astroscale&#8217;s demonstrator package includes two separate payloads, a servicer that represents its future production spacecraft, and a &#8216;client&#8217; satellite that&#8217;s meant to represent the debris satellites it&#8217;ll be de-orbiting on behalf of customers in future.</p>
<p>The Astrocale payload was launched via a Soyuz rocket that took off early this morning from Kazakhstan carrying 38 commercial satellites from 18 countries. It&#8217;s the first Astroscale spacecraft to reach orbit, since the startup&#8217;s founding in 2013 by Japanese entrepreneur Nobu Okada. Astroscale had launched a micro satellite designed to measure small-scale debris in 2017, but all 18 of the satellites on that particular mission failed to reach orbit, due to human error in the launch vehicle&#8217;s programming.</p>
<p>This ELSA-d mission is a much more ambitious effort, and involves what amounts to an active on-orbit demonstration of the technology that Astroscale ultimately hopes to commercialize. The mission profile includes repeat docking and release maneuvers between the servicer satellite and the simulated client satellite, which is equipped with a ferromagnetic plate to assist the servicer with its magnetic docking procedure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Maxar CTO Walter Scott thinks now is the time to address the orbital traffic boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/why-maxar-cto-walter-scott-thinks-now-is-the-time-to-address-the-orbital-traffic-boom/embed/#?secret=NAXaX7JIma" data-secret="NAXaX7JIma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Astroscale hopes to prove out a range of its advertised capabilities with this demonstration, including the servicer&#8217;s ability to search out and located the client satellite, inspect it for damage, and then dock with it as mentioned, in both non-tumbling and tumbling scenarios (ie., a payload that&#8217;s maintaining a stable orbit, and one that&#8217;s spinning end-over-end in space with no ability to control its own attitude).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot riding on this mission, which will be controlled from a ground center established by Astroscale in the UK. Aside from its long-term commercial ambitions, the startup is also contracted to partner with JAXA on the Japanese space agency&#8217;s first orbital debris removal mission, which aims to be the first in the world to remove a large object from orbit, representing the spent upper stage of a launch rocket.</p>

		Howard Boville is the senior vice president of IBM Hybrid Cloud. He directs IBM’s global network of more than 60 cloud data centers across 19 countries and 18 availability zones across six regions.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent testimony before Congress on the massive SolarWinds attacks served as a wake-up call for many. What I saw emerge from the testimony was a debate on whether the public cloud is a more secure option than a hybrid cloud approach.</p>
<p>The debate shouldn’t surround which cloud approach is more secure, but rather which one we need to design security for. We — enterprise technology providers — should be designing security around the way our modern systems work, rather than pigeonholing our customers into securing one computing model over the other.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The SolarWinds attack was successful because it took advantage of a vast, intermixed supply chain of technology vendors. While there are fundamental lessons to be learned on how to protect the code supply chain, I think the bigger lesson is that complexity is the enemy of security.</p>
<h2>The &#8220;Frankencloud&#8221; model</h2>
<p>We’ve seen our information technology environments evolve into what I call a “Frankenstein” approach. Firms scrambled to take advantage of the cloud while maintaining their systems of record. Similar to how Frankenstein was assembled, this led to systems riddled with complexity and disconnected parts put together.</p>
<p>Security teams cite this complexity as one of their largest challenges. Forced to rely on dozens of vendors and disconnected security products, the <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/cybersecuritylandscape/Marketing">average security team</a> is using 25 to 49 tools from up to 10 different vendors. This disconnect is creating blind spots we can no longer afford to avoid. Security systems shouldn’t be piecemealed together; an organization’s security needs to be designed with one single point of control that provides a holistic view of threats and mitigates complexity.</p>
<h2>Hybrid cloud innovations</h2>
<p>We’re seeing hybrid cloud environments emerging as the dominant technology design point for governments, as well as public and private enterprises. In fact, a recent study from Forrester Research found that 85% of technology decision-makers agree that on-premise infrastructure is critical to their hybrid cloud strategies.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud model combines part of a company’s existing on-premise systems with a mix of public cloud resources and as-a-service resources and treats them as one.</p>
<p>How does this benefit your security? In a disconnected environment, the most common path for cybercriminals to compromise cloud environments is via cloud-based applications, representing 45% of cloud-related incidents analyzed by our IBM X-Force team.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, your cloud-based systems that authenticate that someone is authorized to access systems. A login from an employee’s device is detected in the middle of the night. At the same time, there may be an attempt from that same device, seemingly in a different time zone, to access sensitive data from your on-premise data centers. A unified security system knows the risky behavior patterns to watch for and automatically hinders both actions. If these incidents were detected in two separate systems, that action never takes place and data is lost.</p>
<p>Many of these issues arise due to the mishandling of data through cloud data storage. The fastest-growing innovations to address this gap are called Confidential Computing. Right now, most cloud providers promise that they won’t access your data. (They could, of course, be compelled to break that promise by a court order or other means.) Conversely, it also means malicious actors could use that same access for their own nefarious purposes. Confidential Computing ensures that the cloud technology provider is technically incapable of accessing data, making it equally difficult for cybercriminals to gain access to it.</p>
<h2>Creating a more secure future</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has brought critical innovations to the world, from the distribution of workloads to moving with speed. At the same time, it also brought to light the essentials of delivering IT with integrity.</p>
<p>Cloud’s need for speed has pushed aside the compliance and controls that technology companies historically ensured for their clients. Now, those requirements are often put back on the customer to manage. I’d urge you to think of security first and foremost in your cloud strategy and choose a partner you can trust to securely advance your organization forward.</p>
<p>We need to stop bolting security and privacy onto the “Frankencloud” environment that operates so many businesses and governments. SolarWinds taught us that our dependence on a diverse set of technologies can be a point of weakness.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it can also become our greatest strength, as long as we embrace a future where security and privacy are designed in the very fabric of that diversity.</p>

<p>Because some of the most profitable NFTs are produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/lilmiquela/status/1329976205538324480">celebrities</a> with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/shawn-mendes-andrew-gertler-nft-marketplace-sturdy-exchange-1135558/">teams</a>, it makes sense that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/tech/9535765/nft-music-gold-rush-sales-timeline-grimes-3lau">music corporations, </a><a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/the-cryptocurrency-boom-will-luxury-fashion-brands-jump-in">fashion brands</a> and designers are venturing into the NFT market as well. Just this month, sneaker brand RTFKT Studios garnered <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/3/rtfkt-studios-fewocious-sale-nfts">$3.1 million </a>in seven minutes by selling crypto collectibles. In December 2020, NFT startup Enjin partnered with Netherlands-based fashion house <a href="https://www.thefabricant.com/">The Fabricant</a> on a <a href="https://enjin.io/blog/atari-the-fabricant-digital-fashion">virtual collection</a>. Real-life fashion brands use NFTs for marketing in virtual worlds like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-enjin-microsoft-nfts">Minecraft</a>, plus several <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Atari-Inspired-Virtual-Fashion-Line-Designed-By-The-Fabricant-Rolls-Ou">Atari</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-teams-up-with-enjin-to-offer-crypto-collectible-rewards">Microsoft</a> video games.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The fundamental value NFTs offer to bridge virtual fashion items with video games is the option to secure custody of the item for use in other games or mobile apps.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“Brands are coming up with some creative solutions because the pandemic is persistent, and fashion is something that is so close to our identities,” said Bryana Kortendick, Enjin’s VP of operations and communications. “You can snap a photo of yourself wearing your Atari-branded NFTs. You’ll also be able to wear them in video games.”</p>
<p>Breakout NFT star Beeple said he imagines a future where fashion NFTs could be redeemed for specific items in physical stores, especially at luxury retailers like his former client Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>“You can relate NFTs to clothing in new and interesting ways,” he said. “This will be seen as the next chapter of digital art history. This is a continuation of digital art history that started decades ago, by that I mean art made on a computer and distributed through the internet.”</p>
<p>Fashion designers like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/polygondressing/">Schirin Negahbani </a>are already creating NFTs that represent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKTttyqjD5r/">actual clothing</a>. Precisely because multimillion-dollar NFT sales are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/arts/design/beeple-nonfungible-nft-review.html">breaking records</a>, spectators have been prompted to question the role speculative trading plays in this trend.</p>
<p>Textile designer <a href="https://www.amberjdickinson.com/">Amber J. Dickinson</a> says fashionable NFTs shouldn’t primarily be viewed as speculative trading opportunities. “The way I think fashion translates to the digital world is to view an NFT as a collectible piece of the garment for history,” said Dickinson, known for hand-made silk scarves and her work with Alexander McQueen. “I would only buy art as a piece that I liked. Whether digital or in the real world, I don’t take an investor’s point of view.”</p>
<p>There are many fashion fans who disagree with Dickinson, preferring to invest through assets like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/your-money/birkin-bag-racehorse-invest.html">Birkin bags</a>. They may have a different approach to NFTs. The <a href="https://digitalax.medium.com/introducing-digitalax-the-digital-fashion-engine-42801a431283">DIGITALAX </a>crypto fashion platform, for example, is being built with a plethora of trading features. As for Dickinson, she said she is still looking for her tribe of crypto-savvy artists on Twitter.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lost item finder Tile, the maker of the popular Bluetooth-powered tracker that can help you find your misplaced keys, bag, wallet or more, is bringing its tracking service to a wearable device for the first time with the launch of its <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit partnership</a>. Starting today, all new and current Fitbit Inspire 2 users will gain access to Tile&#8217;s Bluetooth-finding technology at no extra cost, the company says.</p>
<p>As a result of the deal, existing Inspire 2 users will soon be prompted to update their device&#8217;s software via the Fitbit app, which will make the new Tile feature available. Once updated, users will be directed to download Tile&#8217;s mobile app for access to the lost item-finding features. From the Tile app, Inspire 2 users will then be able to locate their misplaced Fitbit when they&#8217;re within Bluetooth range &#8212; for example, if the device has been lost somewhere inside their home. If the device is farther away, users will be able to tap into Tile&#8217;s broader finding network which leverages the Tile app installed on all Tile users&#8217; smartphones. When anyone with the app is near the lost item, its location is shared back through the network to the original owner.</p>
<p>At present, Tile says it&#8217;s locating up to 6 million unique items per day across 195 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tile&#8217;s service is made available for free to <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/inspire2">Fitbit users</a> and other customers, but it monetizes through a combination of device sales, in-app subscriptions and other partnerships. The <a href="https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004254653-Tile-Premium-Features">Tile Premium subscription</a> will also be available to Inspire 2 users as an optional upgrade from within the Tile app at $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. This service, originally targeted toward Tile tracker owners, includes free battery replacements for Tile devices, access to 30-day location history, item reimbursements and smart alerts that remind you when you&#8217;ve left home without important things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now with Tile technology, we’re adding even more convenience and helpful tools to Inspire 2, our accessible, easy-to-use activity and sleep tracker,&#8221; said Larry Yang, director of Product Management of Fitbit Devices at Google, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/googles-fitbit-acquisition-is-official/">finalized its Fitbit acquisition in early 2021</a>. &#8220;We’re excited to partner with Tile so our users can focus on building healthy habits without worrying about not being able to find their misplaced device, with the potential to bring Tile’s finding technology to more Fitbit devices in the future,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Tile&#8217;s partnership with Fitbit is now one of <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/partners">over 20 partners</a> leveraging Tile&#8217;s technology in some way across audio, travel, smart home and PC categories. And while technically Fitbit is the first &#8220;wearable&#8221; partner, Tile has worked with others in the consumer electronics space, including headphone makers like Skullcandy, Bose and Sennheiser.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s ability to expand its reach through industry partners may become even more critical to its future in the face of new competition from Apple, and to some extent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Samsung</a>. Apple has been developing its own Tile competitor, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags,</a> which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">accidentally disclosed</a> in a YouTube video last year. These will leverage both Bluetooth and newer ultra-wideband technology to more precisely locate lost items. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsung-unveils-its-newest-tile-competitor-the-galaxy-smarttag/">Samsung&#8217;s newest Tile competitor</a>, the Galaxy SmartTag, will also come in an UWB-powered version later this year.</p>

<p>This competition, specifically from Apple, could spell trouble for Tile, which has become a vocal participant in the U.S. antitrust investigations against Apple. The company has testified against Apple<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-apple-tile/tile-says-apples-behavior-is-anticompetitive-and-has-gotten-worse-not-better-idUSKBN21J72V"> in congressional hearings</a> about how its business has been negatively impacted by Apple in the past, and it pushed for third-party access to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; app as a means of evening the playing field between Apple&#8217;s upcoming trackers and its own. Tile also joined the Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that&#8217;s now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/08/arizona-bill-apple-google-app-fees-antitrust-challenge">pushing for legislation to regulate the app stores</a> in various U.S. states.</p>
<p>Partnering with Apple&#8217;s competitor, Google (by way of Fitbit), could be seen as another way for Tile to shore up a position for itself within a key section of the wearables market before AirTags arrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> has announced that it is applying for a bank charter in the U.S. The company has submitted a draft application with the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.</p>
<p>If the company manages to get a charter in California, it would let the company operate throughout the U.S. as an independent bank. The discussions are still ongoing, which means it could take a while before the authorities grant a charter to the company.</p>
<p>After obtaining a charter in the U.S., Revolut could start offering more financial services. In particular, it would open up more opportunities when it comes to lending and savings products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, Revolut partners with Metropolitan Commercial Bank in the U.S. — they handle your deposits and they are insured by the FDIC. They also issue cards for Revolut.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Revolut is also launching <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business">Revolut Business</a>. These accounts let a company send and receive international payments more easily. Companies can also use the service for payments with virtual and physical debit cards. Revolut Business is available across all 50 states. There are 500,000 companies using Revolut Business in Europe.</p>

<p>Revolut currently has 15 million customers for its financial super app — most of them are in the U.K. and the European Union. The company recently announced that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/revolut-applies-for-uk-banking-license/">applying for a banking license</a> in the U.K., its home country and its biggest market. In Europe, Revolut has a specialized license from the Bank of Lithuania — some customers are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/revolut-lets-customers-switch-to-revolut-bank-in-10-additional-countries/">moving their account to Revolut Bank</a>.</p>
<p>Revolut isn’t the only fintech startup applying for a bank charter in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Last month</a>, Brex announced that it would apply for a bank charter in Utah. Varo Bank also obtained its own bank charter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>It proves that leveraging another bank’s charter is great for growth. But at some point, if you want to launch new products and generate more revenue from those products, you have to get your own charter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear sign of a maturing platform is when the company exposes to other developers the services it uses for its own tools. <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> has been doing that for some time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">introducing Zoom Apps</a> last year and the Marketplace to distribute and sell these apps. Today, the company introduced a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers embed Zoom video services inside another application.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Video SDK enables developers to leverage Zoom’s industry-leading HD video, audio, and interactive features to build video-based applications and desktop experiences with native user interfaces,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Natalie Mullin wrote in a <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/bring-industry-leading-video-to-your-application-with-zooms-video-sdk/">blog</a> post announcing the new SDK.</p>
<p>If you want to include video in your app, you could try and code it yourself, or you could simply take advantage of Zoom&#8217;s expertise in this area and use the SDK to add video to the application and save a lot of time and effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company envisions applications developers embedding video in social, gaming or retail applications, where including video could enhance the user experience. For example, a shop owner could show different outfits to an online shopper in a live video feed and discuss their tastes in real time.</p>
<p>Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson said the SDK is actually part of a broader set of services designed to help developers take advantage of all the developer tooling that the company has been developing in recent years. As part of that push, the company is also announcing a central developer portal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development, so we&#8217;re launching <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a> as that central hub for all developer resources,&#8221; Ittelson told me.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom launches its events platform and marketplace, brings apps to your calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/embed/#?secret=FIZgxukDUR" data-secret="FIZgxukDUR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition, the company said that it wanted to give developers more data about how people are using the Zoom features in their applications, so they will be providing a new analytics dashboard with usage statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are adding additional tools and actually providing developers with analytic dashboards. So folks that have developed apps for the Zoom ecosystem are able to see information about the usage of those apps across the platform,&#8221; Ittelson said.</p>
<p>He believes these tools combined with the new video SDK and existing set of tools will provide developers with a variety of options for building Zoom functionality into their applications, or embedding their application into Zoom as they see fit.</p>
