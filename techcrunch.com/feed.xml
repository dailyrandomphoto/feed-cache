										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook just announced plans to pay content creators more than $1 billion by the end of next year through new bonus programs designed to keep creatives plugged into its app ecosystem. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced the new funding to &#8220;reward creators for great content&#8221; on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113607549897721">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>The company will pay creators through a series of new bonus initiatives across Facebook and Instagram which are &#8220;seasonal, evolving and expanding over time.&#8221; The bonus programs will have a dedicated hub within the Instagram app later this summer and in the Facebook app later this year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bB7SUS4d1s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">TikTok unveils $200 million fund for U.S. creators</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok unveils $200 million fund for U.S. creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/embed/#?secret=bB7SUS4d1s" data-secret="bB7SUS4d1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company will offer the first new bonuses to creators making videos on Facebook with in-stream ads enabled. Facebook is also expanding bonuses through its Stars system, which invites viewers to send streamers tips in exchange for fan perks. Creators making videos or livestreaming games will be eligible for monthly bonuses based on how many viewers send them payments via Stars through October.</p>
<p>Instagram will introduce its own bonuses, which will be invite-only to begin with. Within the next few weeks, U.S. creators can collect a one-time bonus for enabling IGTV ads. Other bonuses will reward creators for making Reels, Instagram&#8217;s answer to TikTok&#8217;s short-form video success, and for hitting certain milestones in Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s foray into creator payments is just the latest effort to jump-start TikTok competitor products with cold hard cash. Snapchat hands out $1 million each day to the most popular videos in its short-form video product Spotlight. YouTube has its own $100 million fund for YouTube Shorts, the company&#8217;s own TikTok clone.</p>
<p>TikTok itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">launched a $200 million creator fund last year</a>, though the app doesn&#8217;t seem to have much to worry about (yet, anyway). According to<a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion"> data from SensorTower</a>, TikTok just surpassed 3 billion global downloads. The only other apps to have crossed that milestone are WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook and Instagram — all owned by Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has joined Amazon in a show of alarm at the sudden rise of antitrust hawk Lina Khan to the position of FTC Chair by asking that she be recused from all decisions relating to the company. The argument, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/">more or less identical to Amazon&#8217;s</a>, is that before her appointment, Khan was too outspoken about her professional opinion that companies like these are in violation of antitrust rules.</p>
<p>In a letter filed with the FTC <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-recusal-of-ftc-chairwoman-in-antitrust-case-11626267605">and obtained by the WSJ</a>, which the agency could not provide and declined to comment on, Facebook explained that Khan&#8217;s last few years of academic publications and articles in other media amount to cause for recusal from decisions about the company. (I have asked Facebook for a copy of the petition and will update this post if I receive it.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Chair Khan has consistently made public statements not only accusing Facebook of conduct that merits disapproval but specifically expressing her belief that the conduct meets the elements of an antitrust offense. When a new commissioner has already drawn factual and legal conclusions and deemed the target a lawbreaker, due process requires that individual to recuse herself,&#8221; reads the petition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Neither the FTC nor Khan in any other capacity have responded to the recusal requests from Facebook and Amazon. She did note in her nomination proceeding that recusal requests like these do happen, and are resolved on a case-by-case basis (unlike automatic recusals for things like financial or personal interest). Perhaps even now she is meeting with the ethics experts at the agency.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SRwIvGZa2M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/">9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/embed/#?secret=SRwIvGZa2M" data-secret="SRwIvGZa2M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Khan has, however, certainly made her policy positions known in numerous articles and papers, many of which have argued that antitrust regulators have been highly conservative in their interpretation and deployment of their legal powers, and equally permissive in their oversight of the current crop of enormous tech companies. Things like acquiring competitors, artificially lowering prices to pressure a market, or misrepresenting the collection and use of customer data have gone either unchallenged or minimally punished.</p>
<p>In particular she acted as counsel for the House&#8217;s Investigation of Competition in Digital Markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/steps-from-the-house-judiciary-committee-are-too-little-too-late-when-it-comes-to-big-tech/">an antitrust report issued last fall</a>. Amazon and Facebook lean on cases from 1966 and 1970 where an FTC Commissioner was recused for &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; of a case during a Congressional investigation in which he participated. It&#8217;s a promising hook to hang a case on to be sure, but the circumstances are by no means equivalent. I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but it seems to me that no case or even specific allegations have been prejudged, only the general idea that Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon all either have monopolies or otherwise possess market power. (They didn&#8217;t care much when the report was issued.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ak5yabjty"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/">Big tech blows a collective raspberry at the House&#8217;s antitrust report</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Big tech blows a collective raspberry at the House&#8217;s antitrust report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/big-tech-blows-a-collective-raspberry-at-the-houses-antitrust-report/embed/#?secret=9ak5yabjty" data-secret="9ak5yabjty" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The main finding of the House report, in fact, was arguably that there could be no legal case because existing laws and regulations are insufficient. Certainly Khan has shouted this from the rooftops for some years now — but the conclusion is a legislative matter, not an FTC one. It would be mighty difficult for Khan to have prejudged an antitrust case predicated on laws that haven&#8217;t yet been written.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s FTC has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/ftcs-antitrust-case-against-facebook-falters-but-doesnt-quite-fall-in-federal-court/">suffered an early setback</a> on her watch though not of her making in the dismissal of some complaints in the agency&#8217;s current antitrust case against Facebook. It was for lack of evidence that the company exerts monopoly control over social media that the judge told the FTC to come back and try again. Perhaps Khan intends to remedy that with a supplemented filing, or perhaps she will take the loss and muster her forces for another go in a year or two — but either way it is probably best to resolve the question of her alleged &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; before that decision is announced. (The FTC declined to speculate as to whether the recusal request would affect the current proceedings.)</p>
<p>But the agency also has explicit backing from the White House in the form of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/biden-executive-order-tech-antitrust/">President Biden&#8217;s request</a> that it prioritize &#8220;dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‘free’ products, and the effect on user privacy.&#8221; So Khan probably isn&#8217;t feeling the sting of the aforementioned legal challenge.</p>
<p>The petitions filed by Amazon and Facebook have near-zero risk for the companies and an outside chance at provoking a recusal, so it makes sense strategically to file them. They also provide breadcrumbs later for their inevitable objections to the FTC&#8217;s (under Khan, equally inevitable) allegations of monopolistic practices. The legal repercussions are hard to predict but it is usually better to have a complaint on the table already rather than bring it out late in the process.</p>
<p>Given Chair Khan&#8217;s position that the FTC itself needs to be overhauled and empowered in order to bring actions like this against companies like Facebook, it seems clear that all these are merely the opening gambits in a long, long game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been fascinating to watch the development of <a href="http://Eventtus.com">Eventtus</a>, a startup I came across many years ago on my travels in the Middle East, finding them at the Rise-Up Summit in Cairo in 2012. Then, it was two young women who’d taken the Silicon Valley startup culture to heart and created their own take on event ticketing. But today it’s my genuine pleasure to write that Eventtus has reached a well-deserved exit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bevy.com/">Bevy</a>, an enterprise event platform for virtual, hybrid, and in-person events has acquired Eventtus for an undisclosed sum. Bevy has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bevy-a4a3">raised</a> $61.4M in VC.</p>
<p>The acquisition means Eventtus’ 20 engineers will now join the Bevy team, alongside Egyptian founders Mai Medhat and Nihal Fares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The purchase will add to Bevy’s event technology stack with the addition of a mobile in-person conference app, and several other engagement tools for attendees, enabling Bevy to offer a more comprehensive, end-to-end event management solution, especially as events now stretch from virtual to hybrid to, &#8211; as the world opens up again &#8211; in-person event programs.</p>
<p>Derek Andersen, CEO, and co-founder of Bevy said: “Enterprises have invested in creating connected communities for their customers, employees, and partners. Events are not only an extension of these communities but also provide an important channel for driving ongoing engagement. With this acquisition, we can now further advance our leadership role in enterprise events.”</p>
<p>Medhat and Fares did an incredible job of navigating the crazy startup world, but they did it from Egypt, and during interesting political times in that country, to put it extremely mildly. And a global pandemic to boot.<br />
Speaking to TechCrunch, Medhat said: &#8220;We competed against companies such as Hopin, Attendify, Bizzabo, and Swapcard within the mobile event application space, but we won when it came to delivering a white-labeled experience built for organizers.”</p>
<p>She told me Eventtus was acquired due to its tech stack and its expertise within event technology: “Derek Andersen and I met a few years back and we were the event application of record for Startup Grind and CMX Summit. Bevy is focused on enabling businesses to build community, and the acquisition allows for us to meet attendees where they are at and how they prefer to experience events.”</p>
<p>Medhat now becomes VP of Innovation while Fares will be Director of Product Management.</p>
<p>I asked Medhat if the exit was prompted by the pandemic in some way?: “It wasn’t. Across the world, we’re seeing so much exciting innovation and demand within the event tech space, with Bevy recently fundraising $40M during its Series C round. This acquisition is the union of our shared vision of being the community event engine powering community globally and we are excited to grow together.”</p>
<p>As for its ramifications for the Egyptian ecosystem, the news is nothing but good. Eventtus was one of the rising stars of the MENA region’s tech scene, and no doubt its founders will continue to champion that, going forward.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many watchers expected an uptick in merger and acquisition activity when the world began to emerge from the pandemic in 2021, but the current spike is record-breaking, topping <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/02/mergers-acquisitions-2021-m-and-a-record-year-spacs/">$2.4 trillion</a> in the first half of the year. That’s more than a 150% increase over last year’s M&amp;A activity level.</p>
<p>Coming out of the pandemic, there’s a worker shortage that has complex causes, which has increased the competition for talent. On top of that, we’re experiencing what has been coined the “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit">Great Resignation</a>,” with 4 million people quitting their jobs in April alone.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The good news is that with the right leadership approach and preparation, you can address uncertainty and keep your valuable talent on board.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Business leaders everywhere have a greater appreciation of the value of their people as a competitive asset. So, if you’re contemplating a merger or acquisition at this critical juncture, you know it’s important to retain talent and keep employees happy during the M&amp;A process. It’s simple — you need them.</p>
<h2>The war for talent is real</h2>
<p>Companies — especially startups looking for highly skilled talent— were locked in a war for talent before the pandemic. COVID-19 intensified it, and if employers thought they had the upper hand when workers were getting hammered with layoffs and furloughs, they know better now. A report published earlier this year cited this startling statistic: <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/turnover-tsunami-expected-once-pandemic-ends.aspx">More than half</a> of workers in North America said they plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>Money alone won’t solve the problem for employees who are motivated by purpose. Employees who are invested in your company put their heart and soul into it, which is invaluable. But employers have to work harder to keep that loyalty, and M&amp;A situations threaten the status quo.</p>
<p>Acquisitions add an element of uncertainty, and workers who feel uncertain about a company’s future and their role in it are more likely to look elsewhere. The good news is that with the right leadership approach and preparation, you can address that uncertainty and keep your valuable talent on board. Here’s some advice for keeping employees top of mind during M&amp;A:</p>
<p><strong>Communicate, communicate, communicate<em>: </em></strong>If you’re steering a startup or established tech company through an acquisition, the most important thing you can do is share your vision of what the new company will look like and how employees will be a part of its success. Employees today have a more entrepreneurial mindset than previous generations. They are purpose-driven, and they need to feel like they have a stake in the business. In a situation where uncertainty is driving anxiety (and causing employees to eye an exit), it’s hard to overcommunicate, and undercommunicating can be disastrous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stories that disappear after a period of time are where the action is on social platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook. But when it comes to Twitter, it looks the product itself is going to be going away in a matter of days. Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1415362983065051137" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Fleets &#8212; its own take on ephemeral Stories that it launched into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general availability just nine months ago</a> &#8212; is shutting down on August 3.</p>
<p>The company said the reason for the move is a lack of activity &#8212; specifically, among the more hesitant Twitter users who it said it was trying to target with Fleets in the first place. Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter&#8217;s head of consumer product, <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1415362985527169026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the company would be building other products, but didn&#8217;t say whether they would be bringing in any more ephemeral aspects to any of them.</p>
<p>Spaces, the company&#8217;s answer to Clubhouse, currently sits in the same strip at the top of the app as Fleets and it will become the sole occupant of that horizontal carousel when Fleets disappears.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the company noted in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> from Ilya Brown, VP of Product, that some of what it built for Fleets &#8212; such as the veritical, full-screen advertising test that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitter-to-begin-pilot-testing-fleet-ads-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran only as recently as June</a> &#8212; would possibly reappear in other places on the app.</p>
<p>The announcement shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise, given that the most we&#8217;ve heard about Fleets has been when Twitter launched them, or made some kind of product iteration on them, or found itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitters-new-stories-feature-fleets-is-already-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing a technical glitch</a>. Yet in terms of viral traction, or high profile Fleets, there hasn&#8217;t been much.</p>
<p>Most of all, though shut-down also underscores how Twitter continues to struggle to make its product accessible in a more mainstream way to a wider pool of users; and how it struggles to boost engagement by tapping users who are there but just to sit back with their popcorn and watch the action.</p>
<p>Back when Twitter first started testing Fleets in limited markets in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/twitter-starts-testing-its-own-version-of-stories-called-fleets-which-disappear-after-24-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 2020</a>, its bet had been that some people weren&#8217;t tweeting as much as others because the permanent format of Twitter put them off. Make the tweets disappear, they thought, and more people would get talking&#8230; not least because the format was proving so popular on other social platforms. (Before it made its move last year, Twitter was, indeed, one of the few social media sites that had yet to launch a stories format.)</p>
<p>Initial rollout of the feature looked promising — at least, if you consider it a positive indicator that Fleets <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitters-new-stories-feature-fleets-is-already-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crashed</a> from the surge of people using it when it first became a available worldwide.</p>
<p>But longer term, it turns out those quiet Twitter users weren&#8217;t much interested in Fleets, either, and that the only people really posting stories as Fleets were already pretty active on the platform.</p>
<p>To be clear, we don&#8217;t know how many of power users were using Fleets, either. Twitter declined to provide any usage numbers or other stats on Fleets when asked.</p>
<p>There were other issues that Twitter never quite resolve with the user experience of Fleets. For example, was it an issue or confusing at all that when Twitter launched Spaces they appeared in the same place as Fleets? Or was that lack of clarity the writing on the wall for Fleets?</p>
<p>And with Fleets, it was never completely clear how Twitter decided what to put in the space. Some people follow thousands of accounts, and there was never a way to specifically follow people for their Fleets, so what you saw became a question of Twitter&#8217;s algorithms.</p>
<p>It seems that Twitter is not closing the door on trying more experiments, even if it&#8217;s had a lacklustre track record in getting some of them into wider use. &#8220;Bg bets are risky and speculative, so by definition a number of them won’t work,&#8221; Beykpour noted. &#8220;If we’re not having to wind down features every once in a while, then it would be a sign that we’re not taking big enough swings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As concerts and live events return to the physical world stateside, many in the tech industry have wondered whether some of the pandemic-era opportunities around virtualizing these events are lost for the time being.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="https://www.flymachine.com/">FlyMachine</a> is aiming to seek out the holy grail of the digital music industry, finding a way to capture some of the magic of live concerts and performances in a live-streamed setting. The startup hopes that pandemic era consumer habits around video chat socialization combined with an industry in need of digital diversification can push their flavor of virtual concerts into the lives of music fans.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s ambitions aren&#8217;t cheap, FlyMachine tells TechCrunch it has raised $21 million in investor funding to bankroll its plans. The funding has been led by Greycroft Partners and SignalFire, with additional participation from Primary Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Red Sea Ventures, and Silicon Valley Bank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The virtual concert industry didn&#8217;t have as big of a lockdown moment as some hoped for. Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature/">experimented</a> with virtual events. Meanwhile, startups like Wave<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/wave-opens-the-door-for-musicians-looking-for-a-metaverse-beyond-fortnite/"> raised huge bouts of VC funding</a> to turn real performers into digital avatars in a bid to create more digital-native concerts. And while some smaller artists embraced shows over Zoom or worked with startups like <a href="https://oda.co/">Oda</a> who created live concert subscriptions, there were few mainstream hits among bigger acts.</p>

<p>To make FlyMachine&#8217;s brand of virtual concerts <em>a thing</em>, the startup isn&#8217;t trying to convert potential in-person attendees of a show into virtual participants, instead hoping to create an attractive experience for the folks who would normally have to skip the show. Whether those virtual attendees were too far from a venue, couldn&#8217;t get a babysitter for the night, or just aren&#8217;t jazzed about a mosh pit scene anymore, FlyMachine is hoping there are enough potential attendees on the bubble to sustain the startup as they try to blur the lines between &#8220;a night in and a night out,&#8221; CEO Andrew Dreskin says.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s strategy centers on building up partnerships with name brand concert venues around the US &#8212; Bowery Ballroom in <span class="xn-location">New York City</span>, Bimbo&#8217;s 365 Club in <span class="xn-location">San Francisco</span>, The Crocodile in <span class="xn-location">Seattle</span>, Marathon Music Works in <span class="xn-location">Nashville </span>and Teragram Ballroom in <span class="xn-location">Los Angeles, among them &#8212; and live-streaming some of the shows at those venues to at-home audiences. FlyMachine&#8217;s team has deep roots in the music industry, Dreskin founded Ticketfly (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/07/pandora-acquires-ticketfly-for-450m-in-a-bid-to-sell-tickets-to-live-music-shows/">acquired by Pandora</a>) while co-founder Rick Farman is also the co-founder of Superfly which puts on the Bonnaroo and Outside Lands music festivals.</span></p>

<p>In terms of actual experience &#8212; and I had the chance to experience one of the shows (pictured above) before writing this &#8212; FlyMachine has done their best to recreate the experience of shouting over the tunes to talk with your buddies nearby. In FlyMachine&#8217;s world this is attending the show in a &#8220;private room&#8221; with your other friends live-streaming in video chat bubbles from their homes. It&#8217;s well-done and doesn&#8217;t distract too much from the actual concert, but you can adjust the sound levels of your friends and the music when the time calls for it.</p>
<p>FlyMachine&#8217;s platform launch earlier this year, arriving as many Americans have been vaccinated and many concert-goers are preparing to return to normal, might have been considered a bit late to the moment, but the founding team sees a long-term opportunity that COVID only further highlighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren’t in a mad dash to get the product out the door while people were sequestered in their homes because we knew this would be part of the fabric of society going forward,&#8221; Dreskin tells TechCrunch.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciminoanthony/">Anthony Cimino</a>, head of policy at <a href="http://www.carta.com/">Carta</a>, works with policymakers and innovators to drive economic opportunity through expanding equity ownership and private market liquidity.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The increasing regulation of ESG (environmental, social, governance) disclosure reporting may have started in the public markets, but will almost certainly have downstream effects for private market actors — for founders, companies and investors.</p>
<p>Since his confirmation as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April, Gary Gensler has made reforming ESG disclosures concerning climate change risk and human capital a top priority. The SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-99">regulatory agenda</a> confirms as much. And Gensler is not alone in his focus on ESG at the federal level.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/">issued an executive order</a> encouraging regulators to assess climate-related financial risk. At the end of March, <a href="https://twitter.com/secyellen/status/1395520116339662848">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote on Twitter</a> that “our future livelihoods … depend on the financial sector to build a more sustainable and resilient economy.” Congress is considering measures that would require increased ESG disclosures, including the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1277?s=1&amp;r=2">Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2123">Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act</a> and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2570">Climate Risk Disclosure Act</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This renewed federal focus on ESG issues will bolster the SEC’s effort to create disclosure practices for public companies and mutual funds. Regardless of whether these federal policies around ESG come to pass, they reflect a momentum that will almost certainly impact private markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms that want to go public — whether via SPAC, direct listing or traditional IPO — may have to seriously consider board diversity or environmental reporting in conjunction with — or well in advance of — their debuts.</li>
<li>Private companies seeking to align with public companies as vendors or partners may be expected to meet specific ESG requirements before the engagement.</li>
<li>Startup founders and venture funds raising capital may work to maintain the largest target market by proactively scoping ESG engagements to ensure they meet criteria for investors who may have their own ESG-focused investment requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In his confirmation hearing before the Senate in early March, Gensler said, “Markets — and technology — are always changing. Our rules have to change along with them.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies. These requirements are a response to the changing markets — demands from consumers, scrutiny from investors and a general insistence for higher corporate standards from society at large.</p>
<p>Private markets aren’t immune to these forces. Already, three-quarters of investors in a <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_2020_Sustainable_Investment_Survey.pdf">2020 survey</a> said it was very important to measure the success of sustainability initiatives, but they also said there’s been a lack of clarity on how to define and measure outcomes.</p>
<p>To be sure, private markets are not headed toward full-scale adoption of ESG regulations. They will not be subject to the same reporting or disclosures framework as their public counterparts. Not today, and possibly not for some time.</p>
<p>But we may begin to see private investors, funds and companies adapting to get ahead of ESG regulation and position themselves to effectively operate in a new — albeit adjacent — regulatory environment. In their case, the rules may not change — but the game could.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea’s LG Chem has earmarked ₩6 trillion ($5.2 billion) over the next four years to build out its battery materials business. The investment comes as automakers and state regulators set targets to transition away from internal combustion engine vehicles, in a shift that will likely be the most transformative to the mobility industry since the invention of the car.</p>
<p>The investments will focus on boosting the production of anode materials, separation membranes, cathode binders, and other essential battery components. This includes plans to build a massive cathode plant in the South Korean city of Gumi, that will increase the industrial giant’s anode production capacity by seven-fold, from 40,000 tons to around 260,000 tons by 2026. LG Chem had already agreed to invest ₩500 billion ($424 million) in the plant, which was announced in July 2019.</p>
<p>LG is also planning to expand its production capacity of carbon nanotubes (CNT), an advanced material used to enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries, from 1,700 tons this year to triple or more by 2025. To get there, it’s planning on scaling output at its CNT Plant 2 and commencing construction on a third CNT plant this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the supply chain front, LG said its preparing a joint venture with a mining company for the supply of metals and other raw materials for battery components. The company will “actively pursue cooperation in various ways with companies possessing mining, smelting and refining technologies to strengthen its metal sourcing competitiveness,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>LG Chem is already one of the largest manufacturers of batteries and battery materials, with customers including Volkswagen, General Motors, and Tesla. And the company only sees the global battery materials market expanding – from ₩39 trillion ($34 billion) in 2021 to ₩100 trillion ($87 billion) by 2026.</p>
<p>Along with the battery investment, LG said it will pour an additional ₩3 trillion ($2.6 billion) into sustainable petrochemicals, like biodegradable polymers and plant-based bio-materials, and ₩1 trillion ($872 million) into its drug development business line.</p>
<p>CEO Hak Cheol Shin said the company is examining even more opportunities to shift toward an sustainable business portfolio. “This will be the most revolutionary change since the establishment of the company that will upgrade the value and sustainability of LG Chem, and tangible achievements will become available from the second half of this year,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to tough environments to build new technology, firefighting has to be among the most difficult. Smoke and heat can quickly damage hardware, and interference from fires will disrupt most forms of wireless communications, rendering software all but useless. From a technology perspective, not all that much has really changed today when it comes to how people respond to blazes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qwake.tech">Qwake Technologies</a>, a startup based in San Francisco, is looking to upgrade the firefighting game with a hardware augmented reality headset named C-THRU. Worn by responders, the device scans surrounding and uploads key environmental data to the cloud, allowing all responders and incident commanders to have one common operating picture of their situation. The goal is to improve situational awareness and increase the effectiveness of firefighters, all while minimizing potential injuries and casualties.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2015, just <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001871374/000187137421000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">raised about $5.5 million in financing this week</a>. The company’s CEO, Sam Cossman, declined to name the lead investor, citing a confidentiality clause in the term sheet. He characterized the strategic investor as a publicly-traded company, and Qwake is the first startup investment this company has made.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(Normally, I’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">ignore fundings without these sorts of details</a>, but given that I am <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">obsessed with DisasterTech</a> these days, why the hell not).</p>

<p>Qwake has had success in recent months with netting large government contracts as it approaches a wider release of its product in late-2021. It <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2020/12/02/qwake-technologies-funded-to-fight-fires-with-ar-tech/">secured a $1.4 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security</a> last year, and also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qwake-technologies-awarded-air-force-contract-to-adapt-ar-solution-for-smokejumpers-and-special-operations-301260333.html">secured a partnership with the U.S. Air Force along with RSA in April</a>. In addition, it raised a bit of angel funding and participated in Verizon’s 5G First Responder Lab as <a href="https://www.5gfirstresponderlab.com/cohort1/">part of its inaugural cohort</a> (reminder that TechCrunch is <i>still</i> owned by Verizon).</p>
<p>Cossman, who founded Qwake along with John Long, Mike Ralston, and Omer Haciomeroglu, has long been interested in fires, and specifically, volcanos. For years, he has been an expeditionary videographer and innovator who climbed calderas and attempted to bridge the gap between audiences, humanitarian response, and science.</p>
<p>“A lot of the work that I have done up until this point was focused on earth science and volcanoes,” he said. “A lot of projects were focused on predicting volcanic eruptions and looking at using sensor networks and different things of that nature to make people who live in those regions that are exposed to volcanic threats safer.”</p>
<p>During one project in Nicaragua, his team suddenly found itself lost amidst the smoke of an active volcano. There were “thick, dense superheated volcanic gases that prevented us from navigating correctly,” Cossman said. He wanted to find technology that might help them navigate in those conditions in the future, so he explored the products available to firefighters. “We figured, ‘Surely these men and women have figured out how do you see in austere environments, how do you make quick decisions, etc.’”</p>
<p>He was left disappointed, but also with a new vision: to build such technology himself. And thus, Qwake was born. “I was pissed off that the men and women who arguably need this stuff more than anybody — certainly more than a consumer — didn&#8217;t have anywhere to get it, and yet it was entirely possible,” he said. “But it was only being talked about in science fiction, so I&#8217;ve dedicated the last six years or so to make this thing real.”</p>
<p>Building such a product required a diverse set of talent, including hardware engineering, neuroscience, firefighting, product design and more. “We started tinkering and building this prototype. And it very interestingly got the attention of the firefighting community,” Cossman said.</p>

<p>Qwake at the time didn’t know any firefighters, and as the founders did customer calls, they learned that sensors and cameras weren’t really what responders needed. Instead, they wanted more operational clarity: not just more data inputs, but systems that can take all that noise, synthesize it, and relay critical information to them about exactly what’s going on in an environment and what the next steps should be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Qwake built a full solution, including both an IoT device that attaches to a firefighter’s helmet and also a tablet-based application that processes the sensor data coming in and attempts to synchronize information from all teams simultaneously. The cloud ties it all together.</p>
<p>So far, the company has design customers with the fire departments of Menlo Park, California and Boston. With the new funding, the team is looking to advance the state of its prototype and get it ready for wider distribution by readying it for scalable manufacturing as it approaches a more public launch later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Superhuman co-founder and CEO Rahul Vohra joined us last week at TechCrunch Early Stage to provide an in-depth look at how he and his company worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of &#8220;growth hacking&#8221; that would not only help Superhuman attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too. Vohra articulated a system that other entrepreneurs should be able to apply to their own businesses, regardless of area or focus.</p>
<h2>The only good hack isn&#8217;t a hack at all</h2>
<p>Vohra started off by explaining that he&#8217;s happy to discuss anything relating to the early stages of startup growth (and welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulvohra?lang=en">DMs to his Twitter</a> if you have any specific questions). He identified a number of key areas of concern early on in company-building, including growth, pricing and even traditional growth hacking, but he noted that one area of focus is more important than any other:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">The</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">most</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">important</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">these</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">product-</span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">market</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">fit.</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">And</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">this</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">sort</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">standard</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">disclaimer</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">anyone</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">who</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">would</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ever</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">talk</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">about</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">growth</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">would</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ever</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">give</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">which</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">shouldn&#8217;t</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">try</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">grow</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">thing</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">isn&#8217;t</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">yet</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ready</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">to </span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">grow.</span><em><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word"><strong>(Timestamp: 01:11)</strong></span></em></p>

<p>Strong stuff, but Vohra backs up this assertion with endorsements from startup industry heavyweights like Paul Graham, Sam Altman and Marc Andreessen underlying the key importance of product-market fit &#8212; and prioritizing it early in a startup&#8217;s existence. Also, he points out that it can be easy to mistake the &#8220;feeling&#8221; of having good product-market fit as a leading indicator, when in fact it&#8217;s usually a lagging one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>

<p>The financing signals yet another cadre of investors betting on a company within the world of virtual HQs, a cohort that includes dozens of startups that believe distributed employees are ready to graduate from Zoom and into &#8220;metaverses&#8221; built with productivity and gamification in mind. This is Kevin Hartz&#8217;s second investment in a virtual HQ, with his first in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">Gather.</a> As of today, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Menlo, Battery Ventures, Index Ventures, Y Combinator, Homebrew and Floodgate all have stakes in different virtual HQ startups.</p>
<p>In other words: Even with investors pouring money in, Nooks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">has its work cut out for it</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nooks was launched in May 2020 by Stanford students Daniel Lee, Rohan Suri, Nikhil Cheerla, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Andrew Qu. Like nearly every other person unexpectedly flung into the world of remote work, the trio experienced Zoom fatigue through school and classes. They soon saw a necessity to build a space for higher-performing teams and like-minded communities to enjoy working together.</p>

<p>The co-founders first piloted Nooks within Stanford, giving it to teaching assistants to use as an engaging layer to summer virtual classes. The initial use case for Nooks looked like office hours, and homework parties, says Lee. Since initially piloting in schools, Nooks has grown to focus more on helping distributed teams work, but the ethos has stayed consistent.</p>
<p>“There should be this persistent space where, instead of just being in an ephemeral space like a meeting, you can go somewhere to create more spontaneous connections,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<h2><b>Nooks&#8217; hooks</b></h2>
<p>When a user enters Nooks, they are greeted by a Slack-like interface. Instead of a panel of channels on the left, though, employees are invited to enter “spaces.” Each space can vary in purpose, from a front-desk mock-up to a beach hangout or a design huddle. Nooks has a space dedicated to bashing bugs that show up in code. Upon first entry into the platform, the Nooks UX stood out as different from some of its competitors. While companies like Branch and Gather look like video games with a productivity element, Nooks skips the avatar feel altogether, looking closer to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/"> Teamflow</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">Tandem.</a> The company uses a video API to let each person take up little orbs of space, and adds integrations of platforms like Google Docs, YouTube, Asana or GitHub.</p>

<p>Co-founder Suri said that the company decided to go for a simpler aesthetic to promote conversation, not more clicking.</p>
<p>“We don’t actually believe that in order to talk to someone you need to be a video gamer, have your avatar around and go walk up to them,” he said. “It should be as simple as seeing them in a room, and entering that room.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177432" style="width: 773px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177432" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png" alt="nooks-social-space" width="763" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nooks</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, the company is working to balance that simplicity with an engaging environment, and includes customization of spaces and background music. There’s a “whisper feature” that allows peers to talk to each other during a presentation, virtual sales floors where Nooks creates leaderboards of top sellers and co-working spaces to promote cross-pollination of ideas.</p>
<p>Simplicity can come at the cost of spontaneity. While other virtual HQ platforms use spatial audio to create the feeling of a “bump in” &#8212; voices get louder when you are near other co-workers and quieter when you toggle away &#8212; Lee said that Nooks promotes impromptu collaboration and casual conversations by always making it so that there’s only “one click to talk to anyone.”</p>
<p>While frictionless communication is an important feature, it can’t be Nooks’ only hook. Platforms like Slack, Hangouts and even Twitter DMs only require one click (max two!) for a user to communicate with someone. Not to mention that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">Slack is releasing a series of communication</a> tools around spontaneity and live communication.</p>
<p>Still, Nooks currently has thousands of weekly active users from teams and organizations like Stanford, Embroker and Workato. Teams using Nooks spend an average of six hours a day on the platform, the company said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Do we need so many virtual HQ platforms?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/do-we-need-so-many-virtual-hq-platforms/embed/#?secret=vWpYTYRzZS" data-secret="vWpYTYRzZS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Hybrid work’s virtual growing pains </strong></h2>
<p>As the pandemic fades in parts of the world, startups like Nooks will need to figure out ways to adapt to the return of hybrid teams after a long stint of mostly remote work. The new challenge for these startups is how they position themselves to embed well into the new culture of work.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/proximity-bias-hybrid-work">proximity bias might make that hard to do.</a></p>
<p>Proximity bias is the idea that employees who go in-person are valued higher than employees who work virtually. It’s one of the realities that make hybrid work so hard to pull off at scale: Equity suffers when a group of employees is positioned as more important or prized only because they can travel to an office.</p>
<p>Virtual workspace startups, especially the ones that want to bring work culture online, could accidentally overly fragment those who work from home versus those who work in-person. The fragmentation will disproportionately impact historically overlooked individuals, which include minorities and women. Notably, of the virtual HQs out there, most have been built, run and funded by men.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v1e05bWxvs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/">3 views on the future of meetings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 views on the future of meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/embed/#?secret=v1e05bWxvs" data-secret="v1e05bWxvs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When asked about how they are combating proximity bias, Lee said that “more frequent, fluid and casual conversation with remote employees helps them build stronger bonds with the rest of the team.” Sure enough, there’s an argument that many virtual HQ startups launched to extinguish proximity bias by bringing everyone in an office to the same digital world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, equalizing the playing field will require aggressive intention. How can a startup make sure virtual HQ employees have access to a spontaneous, in-person stand-up in Conference Room A? How does a platform give any employee, regardless of location, the chance to give input, disagree or share post-meeting banter? Can avatars, or floating video orbs, start to give subtle physical cues beyond a clap or thumbs up?</p>
<p>I’d wager that these features are the moonshot, and survival hack, for virtual HQ startups long-term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital price discipline is <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1414953528162988032">out the window</a>; venture funds are looking to make faster, earlier deals; and more unicorns were minted in the last three months than during any quarter in history. It&#8217;s a busy time for startups and their financial backers. Now weeks into July, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that 2021 is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">shaping up to be a record-setter for venture capital investment</a>. And investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">don&#8217;t expect the frenetic pace to slow</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But while the dollars flowing into global startups are setting all-time records, deal volume is not tracking similar extremes. Global deal volume reached a record in the second quarter, but it just barely eked out a win over several quarters from 2018 and Q1 2021.</p>
<p>A flood of money invested against more modest deal flow has helped drive up startup valuations this year, along with deal sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021/">data indicates</a>, for example, that median Series A valuations rose to $42 million thus far in 2021. That&#8217;s far above 2020&#8217;s median Series A valuation of $33 million, also beating the previous record set in 2019 of $39 million. The same dataset indicates that Series B, C, D and E rounds also reached new highs in 2021 compared to years going back to at least 2015.</p>
<p>So startups are getting larger checks, earlier. Does that mean that many startups are landing investments with smaller revenues than their stage (or capital base) would normally require? Yep.</p>
<p>Yesterday in a public discussion of startups valued at $1 billion or more &#8212; unicorns, in our modern parlance &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/shomikghosh21">Boldstart Ventures&#8217; Shomik Ghosh</a> said something that matched what The Exchange has heard from other investors, albeit in more private conversations. The Exchange estimated that the percentage of unicorns with valuations between $1 billion and $2 billion with $100 million in revenue was small. <a href="https://twitter.com/shomikghosh21/status/1414983568544120833">Ghosh took note of that approximation and wrote the following</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2177384" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png" alt="" width="520" height="193" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png 520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-14-at-9.23.38-AM.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p>Let me translate: Here the Boldstart investor is saying that it&#8217;s now common to invest in startups at a valuation that works out to 40 to 50 times those companies&#8217; annual recurring revenue, or ARR. LTM stands for <em>last 12 months</em>, indicating in a somewhat slang fashion that we&#8217;re not discussing <em>forward</em> numbers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what NTM means: <em>next 12 months</em>. Ghosh&#8217;s statement indicates that some startups are actually able to raise capital at even higher multiples of their current revenue, enjoying pricing that can work out to 100 times their ARR for <em>next year</em>.</p>
<p>This yields some questions. For example, The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/status/1414976566480752640">Christopher Mims asked</a> if low startup revenues compared to their valuations indicates that there are a great many houses of cards set to fall in time. The answer is maybe, but probably not. Let&#8217;s talk about why the math<em> can</em> work out for startups with minimal revenues, rich valuations and lots of cash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and 2021, we all became well-acquainted with nasal swabs. But small sticks we stuck up our noses, it turns out, were </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/853930147/despite-early-warnings-u-s-took-months-to-expand-swab-production-for-covid-19-te"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harder to come by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than anyone could have predicted. A May 2020 survey of </span><a href="https://www.amp.org/AMP/assets/AMP_SARS-CoV-2_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf?pass=98"><span style="font-weight: 400;">118 labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the US found that 60 percent reported limited swab supplies – making lack of swabs the most commonly reported supply-chain problem.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small company that stepped into the fray of swab production was the two year old OPT Industries, a Massachusetts-based company with fifteen employees involved in additive manufacturing (think 3D printing) of dense microfiber structures. The company’s printers and software can print more than just swabs, but the first product the company has focused on since 2020 is the InstaSwab – a 3D printed swab used in COVID-19 tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In four months in 2020, OPT Industries manufactured 800,000 nasal swabs for commercial partners like Kaiser Permanente and medical products distributor Henry Schein. After that trial run, the company foresees an uptick in production capability. Using newer, modular machines, Ou notes that each machine can now produce about 30,000 swabs per day. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the pandemic has given us an opportunity to show a specific medical area where our technology can shine,” Ou tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic is still a global disaster, the vaccines have changed the game when it comes to testing. OPT Industries is betting that it will survive a </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downturn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in COVID-19 testing in the US by creating a superior swab, and pivoting to a home-testing market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic was an early test-run for OPT, which at this point, has raised about $5 million in seed funding. The company is currently not seeking investment, notes founder Jifei Ou, but rather has moved into another testing phase for their swab products, the results of which were released today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics released today by OPT Industries, the company reports that on average their 3D printed nasal swabs were able to transfer 63 percent of viral genes into detection assays. Meanwhile in those tests, flocked fiber swabs transferred 36 percent and polyester swabs about 14 percent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests were performed at Boston University Medical Center, but the results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal (though Ou has more studies that are striving for this). They were also not conducted in human COVID-19 patients, but in vitro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the InstaSwabs are better at picking up traces of the virus in the back of the nose and throat. Ou’s argument is that with the right type of swab, specifically, one designed with his dense microfiber structures, may help capture more of the virus and help prevent false negatives – Especially in the early days of infection, when there’s a lower viral load in the body to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless studies looking to estimate the false negative rates for the litany of COVID-19 tests used. Case in point: </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242958#sec018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one systematic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 34 studies found estimates ranging from a 2 percent false negative rate to a 29 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also evidence linking low viral load to false negatives. </span><a href="https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-021-01489-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted at the Public Health Laboratory in Alberta Canada, analyzed 100,001 COVID-19 tests taken from about 95,000 patients (some patients were tested two or three times). Of that group, the authors were able to confirm five false negative test results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The false negatives were attributed to low amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the authors note, was a factor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the samples were collected. It’s not that the swabs missed the virus, it’s that there wasn&#8217;t much virus there to pick up in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to analyzing how the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">swabs themselves </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">influenced test results, the authors found that both swab types used by the laboratory had produced false negative results. Though that may imply that swab type didn’t influence false negative rate, the authors argue that more data was needed to reach that conclusion definitively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that improving the way that samples are collected and stored can’t influence testing accuracy. One </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jso.26561"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2021 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argued that using less transport medium fluid (which would result in less dilution of samples) and redesigning swabs to pick up more virus and spend less time in patients’ noses could also help optimize testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What OPT will need to prove is that a superior swab can truly pick up significant amounts of viral RNA in the early stages of disease </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that this greater pickup rate actually has an impact on false negatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While OPT Industries’ study (not peer-reviewed) seems to suggest the swabs can collect more virus, it doesn’t have enough information to prove that secondary thesis: that these swabs improve the accuracy of COVID-19 tests done in humans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are right now working with two clinical partners to do clinical research on that,” Ou notes.  “The result of this study and the result of the coming one will be combined together and we are preparing a manuscript to be published in a peer-reviewed publication.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should OPT prove that they can 3D print a superior swab, the bigger question is what market they’ll be poised to enter. As vaccines began to proliferate in early Spring of 2021, demand for Covid-19 tests plunged by about 46 percent nationwide, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal </span></i><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/entrepreneurs-are-betting-big-on-nyc-covid-19-testing-businesses-11615903201"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (strangely, this didn’t seem to slow the explosion of testing startups, though). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US is conducting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an average of 504,048 new COVID-19 tests per day as of July 2021, down from an average of about 1,992,273 in January. (Even with the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant upon us, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC still notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that vaccinated people can refrain from routine testing.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ou still sees potential growth in the world of at-home testing – in this case, for COVID-19, though Ou notes that the company can 3D swabs for pretty much any bodily excretion that needs swabbing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we&#8217;ll observe is that in the US, the majority of testing is shifting from a point of care or at a hospital to home testing. So this is our current focus and we&#8217;re looking at partnering and collaborating with the home testing kit company,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has secured “several” partnerships with home-testing companies, though an NDA prevents him from naming the companies, says Ou. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home testing in general (for both COVID-19 and other maladies) does have some interesting players entering the market, </span><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/what-amazon-s-potential-move-into-at-home-medical-tests-could-mean-for-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recently, Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Amazon plans to offer at-home testing kits for COVID-19 as well as STIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps OPT will be able to ride a new at-home swab wave beyond the pandemic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybereason/">Cybereason</a>, a US-Israeli late-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that provides extended detection and response (XDR) services, has secured $275 million in Series F funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The investment was led by Liberty Strategic Capital, a venture capital fund recently founded by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/steve-mnuchin/">Steven Mnuchin</a>, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary under the Trump administration. As part of the deal, Mnuchin will join Cybereason&#8217;s board of directors, along with Liberty advisor Gen. Joseph Dunford, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump until his retirement in 2019.</p>
<p>Lior Div, CEO and co-founder of Cybereason, tells TechCrunch that the startup&#8217;s decision to work with Liberty Strategy Capital came down to the firm’s “massive network&#8221; and the &#8220;understanding of the financial and government markets that Mnuchin and Gen. Joseph Dunford bring to our team.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For example, the executive order on cybersecurity put out by the Biden Administration recommends that endpoint detection and response solutions be deployed on all endpoints,” Dior added. “This accelerates the importance of solutions like ours in the public market, and Liberty Strategic Capital has the relationships to help accelerate our go-to-market strategy in the federal sector.”</p>
<p>This round, which will be used to fuel “hypergrowth driven by strong market demand,&#8221; follows $389 million in prior funding from SoftBank, CRV, Spark Capital, and Lockheed Martin. The company didn’t state at what valuation it raised the funds, but it is estimated to be in the region of $3 billion.</p>
<p>Cybereason’s recent growth, which saw it end 2020 at over $120 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/the-100m-arr-club/">annual recurring revenue</a>, has been largely driven by its AI-powered platform. Unlike traditional alert-centric models, Cybereason&#8217;s Defense Platform is operation-centric, which means it exposes and remediates entire malicious operations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The service details the full attack story from root cause to impacted users and devices, which the company claims significantly reduces the time taken to investigate and recover from an enterprise-wide cyber attack. </span></p>
<p>The company, whose competitors include the likes of BlackBerry-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cylance/">Cylance</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/crowdstrike/">CrowdStrike</a>, also this week expanded its channel presence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>with the launch of its so-called Defenders League, a global program that enables channel partners to use its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>technology and services to help their customers prevent and recover from cyberattacks. Cybereason claims its technology has helped protect customers from the likes of the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">SolarWinds supply-chain attack</a> and other high-profile ransomware attacks launched by DarkSide, REvil, and Conti groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s $275 million funding round is likely to be Cybereason&#8217;s last before it goes public. Div previously said in August 2019 the company planned to IPO within two years, though he wouldn’t be pressed on whether the company is gearing up to go public when asked by TechCrunch. However, the company did compare its latest investment to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cybersecurity-sentinelone-ipo/">SentinelOne</a>&#8216;s November 2020 Series F round, which was secured just months before it filed for a $100 million IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twilio/">Twilio</a>, a company best known for its tools that help developers build text message/phone call-powered apps, is branching out into a new category: live streaming.</p>
<p>This morning the company announced<a href="https://www.twilio.com/live"> Twilio Live</a>, a platform meant to help developers more easily integrate live video/audio features into their apps.</p>
<p>Details are still a bit light, but here&#8217;s what we know so far:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Twilio Live is launching today but in invite-only Beta mode — so not everyone will get access immediately.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support iOS, Android, and all &#8220;major browsers&#8221;.</li>
<li>In addition to the content streaming tools, Twilio is also building out interactivity features to support things like text chat, audience polling, screen sharing, and bringing audience members up as speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We saw a massive rush of Clubhouse clones hit the market after that app&#8217;s spike in popularity, with even huge names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> rushing to replicate its best features. With Twilio effectively turning that feature set into a plug-and-play SDK here, I&#8217;d expect to see a lot more of that.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of reinventing the wheel when it comes to live streaming is one of scaling; what might work beautifully for one hundred viewers could grind to a halt when you have that viral moment that brings a sudden influx of ten thousand. Twilio has spent the last decade figuring out infrastructure scaling and latency — chances are, they&#8217;re starting on pretty good footing here.</p>
<p>No details seem to be available currently as to how Twilio Live&#8217;s pricing will work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is hardly new, but this sector — pretty much the default business model for B2B and B2C startups — just keeps growing along with a rapidly expanding ecosystem. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupexhibitor&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupexhibitorpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, a day-long focused look at the current state and future generations of SaaS, takes place on October 27, and it’s designed to help startup founders, investors and developers keep tabs on this increasingly sophisticated industry.</p>
<p>It also provides a huge opportunity for startups to demo their SaaS tech and talent to the industry’s top movers, shakers and unicorn makers. We have a limited number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupexhibitor&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupexhibitorpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Startup Exhibitor Packages</a> available, and procrastination is not your friend.

<p>Here’s another great reason to exhibit. You might connect with and impress the SaaS equivalent of Rachael Wilcox. Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, attended TC Sessions: Mobility 2020 (along with both Disrupt and Early Stage that same year). Here’s why:</p>
<p>“I go to TechCrunch events to find new and interesting companies, make new business connections and look for startups with investment potential. It’s an opportunity to expand my knowledge and inform my work.”</p>
<p>As for the conference programming, we’re busy building out our agenda. But like every TechCrunch event ever created, you can count on hearing from the leading experts, icons, founders and investors.</p>
<p>Speaking of investors, we can share that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/sarah-guo-kobie-fuller-casey-aylward-headline-investor-panel-at-tc-sessions-saas/">Sarah Guo, Kobile Fuller and Casey Aylward</a> will join us to talk about what they look for in SaaS startups. We’ll announce other exciting speakers in the weeks to come, so watch this space.</p>
<p>Yes, you’ll be busy exhibiting and networking, but you’ll also have time to take in some of the presentations. Come ready to engage because these presentations will be highly interactive. That’s just one of the benefits of a virtual event — more time to get those burning questions asked and answered.</p>
<p>So, bottom line: Exhibiting at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupexhibitor&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupexhibitorpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> on October 27 is your chance to place your innovative, ground-breaking SaaS startup in front of a very targeted, very influential audience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupexhibitor&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupexhibitorpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your Startup Exhibitor Package</a> now and get ready to impress for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc, an artificial intelligence company that develops triage and analysis software, is about to double its funding. On Tuesday, the company announced a round of $66 million. Before that the company had raised about $67 million in its five-year lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc develops “decision support” software based on artificial intelligence. This software can read images like CT scans, detect certain abnormalities, and advise radiologists on what to do with certain patients. So far, the company’s algorithm, called BriefCase, has been approved by the FDA to evaluate patients with </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K180647.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intracranial hemorrhage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K192383.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large vessel occlusion </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a type of stroke), </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K190896.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cervical spine injuries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K203508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulmonary embolisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incidental pulmonary embolisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K193298.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intra-abdominal free gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K202992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rib fractures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The algorithms were approved via the FDA’s 510(k) premarket pathway – which allows for fast adoption of technology that is substantially similar to other products on the market. </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most algorithms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are approved via that pathway, as there is </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30292-2/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no specific regulatory pathway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for these products in the US (though the FDA is </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/145022/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously workshopping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its oversight of AI and machine learning). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s really unique about us as a company is the breadth and scope of what we do. Instead of building one solution we spend the time building a platform that can accelerate AI development at a really rapid pace,” says Elad Walach, the company’s founder and CEO. “This is why today we have the most FDA cleared solutions on the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current funding round was led by the New England VC firm General Catalyst. Chris Bischoff, a managing director of General Catalyst, says the firm was convinced by the strength of the Aidoc’s team, and the seven FDA clearances. However, they were most attracted to the company’s larger approach: create an algorithm (or series of them) that addresses many different conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the company aims to help hospitals build an entire A.I strategy that can be applied to different conditions over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s this sort of consultative approach, that they’re going in as a partner rather than a vendor,” says Bischoff. “It’s not just effectively a point solution, it’s a workflow tool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest question facing Aidoc, or any other startup in the field of artificial intelligence, though, is whether it can convince hospitals and clinics to adopt an AI strategy in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc is a software made for radiologists – a group that is dwindling faster than most would like to see. Though the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 7 percent increase in need for radiologists by 2029 as the population grows older, The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts the country will experience a shortfall of specialists – a group which includes radiologists. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Aidoc, the AI solution for medical imaging analysis, raises $27M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/aidoc-b/embed/#?secret=CkgajMHuVy" data-secret="CkgajMHuVy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That shortfall </span><a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/press-releases/new-aamc-report-confirms-growing-physician-shortage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could range from 17,100 to 41,900</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (these numbers include radiologists among other specialities, but the report doesn’t break down exactly how many radiologists are included in that count). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK, however, is already struggling with a radiologist shortage that ranges from </span><a href="https://www.rcr.ac.uk/posts/new-reports-put-uk-radiologist-shortages-focus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27 to 37 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has been proposed as one solution to the widening radiologist shortage – per the American Medical Association’s report: “advances in artificial intelligence could improve the productivity of radiologists, pathologists, and others,” </span><a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/45976/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it notes.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only a partial solution. Though we might be able to make each individual radiologist more productive with A.I., even Walach notes that A.I software can’t really diagnose a patient all on its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely a radiologist needs to confirm the findings,” he notes.  “That the AI solution doesn&#8217;t do anything without the radiologist.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the pitch for AI in the world of radiology is that it’s a tool, not a replacement for a trained radiologist. And there’s been a lot of academic work done to develop these AI tools: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were an estimated 596 papers on the topic in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2010 and 12,422 by 2019</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, AI has yet to truly become a go-to for radiologists. </span><a href="https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(21)00293-3/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done by American College of Radiology found that just 30 percent of radiologists were using A.I in their practices – the authors called the penetration of the technology “moderate.” Only 20 percent of those not using A.I said they had plans to purchase it in the next one to five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may be poised to see a bit of an uptick in the use of A.I. in clinics or hospitals post-coronavirus. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/23/1000410/ai-triage-covid-19-patients-health-care/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hospitals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned to A.I facing shortages of staff and high patient loads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Walach says that it wasn’t a major boon to Aidoc. If anything he says it slowed the company’s growth (though it was still trending upwards anyway – Walach estimates the company increased contracted annual recurring revenue seven-fold between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 2021). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he attributes the growth to a wave of research on A.I’s impact on patient welfare beyond initial diagnosis. He points to studies that have found </span><a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(19)41342-5/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.I can reduce length of hospital stays by identifying which patients to send home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the biggest trends in this market is that one more and more evidence is starting to come up that AI has significant downstream benefits,” Walach says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite barriers to widespread adoption of AI, Aidoc has a long list of commercial partners. The company has almost 600 partnerships with hospitals and clinics including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radiology Partners, Yale New Haven Medical Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UMass, University of Rochester Medical Center, LucidHealth, 4ways Healthcare, Telemedicine Clinic, Grupo Fleury, University Hospital of Basel, Sheba Medical Center, Hadassah Medical Center, and Global Diagnostics Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the company projects that it will be used in 10 percent of US hospitals within two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some extent, Bischoff argues that the adoption of Aidoc at other high profile health centers could help drive this growth. That could perhaps signal that the company may overcome the slower-than-expected leak of A.I from lab to clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That ability to drive high levels of trust – that would allow that deeper integration,” he says. “There&#8217;s a little bit of a lighthouse type dynamic in healthcare where if the leaders do certain things others follow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc is headquartered in New York, with a research branch in Israel and has about 200 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees. With this new round of funding, the company plans to invest heavily into R&amp;D and has plans to double the amount of conditions evaluated by the company’s algorithms.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/07/14/microsoft-unveils-windows-365-ushering-in-a-new-category-of-computing/">launched</a> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365">Windows 365</a>, a service that gives businesses the option to easily let their employees access a Windows 10 desktop from the cloud (with Windows 11 coming once it&#8217;s generally available). Think game streaming, but for your desktop. It&#8217;ll be available for business users (and only business users) on August 2, 2021.</p>
<p>Announced through a somewhat inscrutable press release, Windows 365 has been long expected and is really just an evolution of existing remote desktop services.</p>
<p>But hey, you may say, doesn&#8217;t Microsoft already offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/microsofts-windows-virtual-desktop-is-now-azure-virtual-desktop/">Azure Virtual Desktop</a> that gives businesses the option to let their employees access a Windows PC in the cloud? Yes, but the difference seems to be that Windows 365 is far easier to use and involves none of the complexity of setting up a full Azure Virtual Desktop environment in the Azure cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKG8r1NERl4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But couldn&#8217;t Microsoft have made Azure Virtual Desktop easier to use instead of launching yet another virtual desktop service? Yes, but Azure Virtual Desktop is very much an enterprise service and by default, that means it must play nicely with the rest of the complexities of a company&#8217;s existing infrastructure. The pandemic pressed it into service in smaller companies because they had few alternatives, but in many ways, today&#8217;s launch is Microsoft admitting that it was far too difficult to manage for them. Windows 365, on the other hand, is somewhat of a fresh slate. It&#8217;s also available through a basic subscription service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft also continues to innovate in Azure Virtual Desktop for those organizations with deep virtualization experience that want more customization and flexibility options,&#8221; the company says. At least we know why the company renamed Windows Virtual Desktop to Azure Virtual desktop now. That would&#8217;ve gotten quite confusing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177463" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177463" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2177463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg 1814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=1536,979 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/monas-cloud-pc.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2177463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>This also gives Microsoft the opportunity to talk about &#8220;a new hybrid personal computing category&#8221; its CEO Satya Nadella calls a &#8220;Cloud PC.&#8221; It&#8217;s a bit unclear what exactly that&#8217;s supposed to be, but it&#8217;s a new category.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, providing organizations with greater flexibility and a secure way to empower their workforce to be more productive and connected, regardless of location,” Nadella explains in today&#8217;s <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/07/14/microsoft-unveils-windows-365-ushering-in-a-new-category-of-computing/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t that just <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/thin-client">a thin client</a>? Maybe? But we&#8217;re not talking hardware here. It&#8217;s really just a virtualized operating system in the cloud that you can access from anywhere &#8212; and that&#8217;s a category that&#8217;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>“Hybrid work has fundamentally changed the role of technology in organizations today,” said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president, Microsoft 365. “With workforces more disparate than ever before, organizations need a new way to deliver a great productivity experience with increased versatility, simplicity and security. Cloud PC is an exciting new category of hybrid personal computing that turns any device into a personalized, productive and secure digital workspace. Today’s announcement of Windows 365 is just the beginning of what will be possible as we blur the lines between the device and the cloud.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As mobile developers build apps, they push them out into the world and problems inevitably develop, which engineers have to scramble to fix. <a href="https://www.mobile.dev/">Mobile.dev</a>, a new startup from a former Uber engineer, wants to flip that story and catch errors before the app launches. Today, the company emerged from stealth with a beta of their solution and a $3 million seed investment led by Cowboy Ventures with participation from multiple tech luminaries.</p>
<p>While he was at Uber, company CEO and co-founder Leland Takamine says that he observed this workflow where an app was put out in the world, a company set up tooling to monitor the app and then worked to fix the problem as users reported issues or the monitoring software picked them up. At Uber, they began building tooling to try to catch problems pre-production.</p>
<p>When he started mobile.dev with COO Jacob Krupski, the goal was to build something like this, but for every company regardless of the size. &#8220;The insight that we had was that anything we could do to catch problems before releasing an app was 100 times more valuable than anything that you can monitor in production,&#8221; Takamine told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s what the company aims to do.&#8221;Our mission at mobile.dev at a high level is to empower companies to deliver high quality mobile applications. And more specifically, stop sacrificing users and start catching issues before you release,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He says that when he speaks to app developers about a solution like this, they are intrigued because as he says &#8220;it&#8217;s really a no-brainer&#8221; question, but unless you have the scale of a company like Uber and vast engineering resources there hasn&#8217;t been a solution like this available for the average company or individual developer. And it was that deep technical expertise he built at Uber that laid the groundwork for what they are building at mobile.dev.</p>
<p>The two founders launched the company a year ago and have been working with design partners and initial customers, particularly Reddit. The product goes into beta today. For now, they are the only two employees, but that is going to change with the new capital as they look to add more engineering talent.</p>
<p>With a very specific set of skills required to build a solution like this, it makes it even more challenging to hire diverse employees, but Takamine says that the goal is to build a diverse team. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s making sure that we look beyond just our immediate network and making sure that we&#8217;re looking at diverse sources,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company launched during the pandemic and with just the two founders involved have been fully remote up until now, and they intend to keep it that way as they add new employees in the coming months.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be fully remote, I think we have a great advantage that we&#8217;re starting from remote, and it&#8217;s much more difficult to transition from an office to remote. So we&#8217;re starting from first principles here and building our culture around remote work,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie, </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a postdoc engineer who started STEM OPT in June after failing to get selected in the H-1B lottery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A colleague suggested that I apply for an EB-1A for extraordinary ability green card, but I have not won any major awards, much less a Nobel Prize. Would you tell me more about the EB-1A? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Bashful in Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Bashful,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to me! Most people who get green cards through the EB-1A process are far from achieving a Nobel Prize &#8212; don’t worry, it’s still possible!</p>
<p>My law partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, recently talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanie-denslow-worldwise/">Lanie Denslow</a>, a cultural competence and business protocol consultant who helps companies and professionals navigate cultural differences in today’s complex, fast-moving and global business environment. In the Immigration Law for Tech startups <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/079-cultural-competence-and-immigration-cases-with-lanie-denslow/">podcast episode</a>, they talked about how culture drives behavior and how we need to understand the culture an individual comes from in order to understand their actions and approaches.</p>

<p>Along those lines, I often find that many international professionals and students who qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-1A</a> are extremely modest and underestimate their abilities and achievements. In American culture, professionals are expected to promote their abilities and accomplishments or personal branding. While that practice is accepted in the United States, it’s frowned upon in many other countries, where modesty is more culturally valued.</p>
<p>That means many international professionals and students — perhaps even you — may feel out of their comfort zone when submitting an application for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A extraordinary ability green card</a> and gathering the five to eight recommendation letters from individuals who are qualified to assess their work and achievements.</p>
<p>Before I dive in further, I suggest you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can assess whether you would be a strong candidate for an EB-1A or if other options would better suit your situation and goals. You should consider talking to your employer about sponsoring you for a green card, and know that you can also file a petition on your own. The EB-1A and EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) are two employment-based green cards for which the beneficiaries can self-petition (without an employer sponsor).</p>
<h2>Qualifications for an EB-1A</h2>
<p>To qualify for an EB-1A, you must meet any <em>three </em>of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have received nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence. These awards should be post-university level and might be able to include such things as VC funding, pitch competitions and international hackathons.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
