										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric truck startup Rivian released Thursday details of its in-house Rivian Insurance program, which it says will be integrated into its digital ordering process.</p>
<p>The insurance will initially be available in 40 states. Keeping in line with the company’s marketing as an “adventure vehicle” company, customers will also have the option to cover their home and recreational equipment, such as boats, dirt bikes, and campers. Rivian&#8217;s plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/rivian-is-building-an-in-house-insurance-agency/">start an insurance program</a> first leaked more than a year ago after a job posting was spotted.</p>
<p>What makes the insurance offering stand out, however, is its integration with the Rivian vehicle platform and Driver+ safety suite, which the company said in a <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/rivian-insurance">blog post</a> will help deliver “tailored, data-driven coverage.” Customers who choose Rivian Insurance will get Driver+ rate reductions, with more details to come. Drivers can additionally opt in to a separate program that offers savings for using Rivian’s Active Driver Assistance software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s a clever move for the company, which plans to bring its first electric pickup to market later this year. Like Tesla, Rivian intends to have Rivian Collision Centers and Service Centers performing the work – and by keeping everything in-house, the company is likely thinking customers will be attracted to a seamless insurance program. Rivian Insurance is another instance of the newer entrant following in the veteran’s lead, but with one big advantage: Tesla Insurance is only available to owners in California.</p>

Well, then the <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-fifth-wall-and-hippo">next episode of Extra Crunch Live</a> is for you.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve hung out with us on an ECL before, you know we start with a bit of top news, chat with our speakers about how to successfully fundraise, and then finish with the Pitch Deck Teardown, where we take a look at decks submitted by you, the audience members, and give live feedback.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, with the help of Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand, we&#8217;re going to shake things up a bit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Folks who attend the live event will be able to virtually &#8216;raise their hand&#8217;, come on screen, and give a 60-second pitch of their startup. No demoes. No videos. No visual aids of any kind. It&#8217;s the ultimate elevator pitch, and it&#8217;ll be done before a live audience.</p>
<p>Wallace and Wand (that&#8217;s catchy, eh?) will give their feedback and ask questions at the end of every pitch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscription pricing is landing on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Store, giving VR developers another way to monetize content on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest headset.</p>
<p>Developers will be allowed to add premium subscriptions to paid or free apps, with Facebook assumedly dragging in their standard percentage fee at the same time. Oculus and the developers on its platform have been riding the success of the company&#8217;s recent Quest 2 headset, which Facebook hasn&#8217;t detailed sales numbers on but has noted that the months-old $299 headset has already outsold every other Oculus headset sold to date.</p>
<p>Subscription pricing is an unsurprising development but signals that some developers believe they have a loyal enough group of subscribers to bring in sizable bits of recurring revenue. Facebook shipped the first Oculus Rift just over five years ago, and it&#8217;s been a zig-zagging path to finding early consumer success during that time. A big challenge for them has been building a dynamic developer ecosystem that offer something engaging to users while ensuring that VR devs can operate sustainably.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, there are already a <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/discover-premium-content-with-subscriptions-on-the-oculus-quest-platform/">few developers</a> debuting subscriptions for a number of different app types, spanning exercise, meditation, social, productivity and DJing. In addition to subscriptions, the new monetization path also allows developers to let users try out paid apps on a free trial basis.</p>
<p>The central question is how many Quest users there are that utilize their devices enough to justify a number of monthly subscriptions, but for developers looking to monetize their hardcore users, this is another utility that they likely felt was missing from the Oculus Store.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">More than half a decade ago, my Battery Ventures partner Neeraj Agrawal penned a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">widely read post</a> offering advice for enterprise-software companies hoping to reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p>His playbook, dubbed “T2D3” — for “triple, triple, double, double, double,” referring to the stages at which a software company’s revenue should multiply — helped many high-growth startups index their growth. It also highlighted the broader explosion in industry value creation stemming from the transition of on-premise software to the cloud.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and many of T2D3’s insights are still relevant. But now it’s time to update T2D3 to account for some of the tectonic changes shaping a broader universe of B2B tech — and pushing companies to grow at rates we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One of the biggest factors driving billion-dollar B2Bs is a simple but important shift in how organizations buy enterprise technology today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I call this new paradigm “billion-dollar B2B.” It refers to the forces shaping a new class of cloud-first, enterprise-tech behemoths with the potential to reach <em>$1 billion</em> in ARR — and achieve market capitalizations in excess of $50 billion or even $100 billion.</p>
<p>In the past several years, we’ve seen a pioneering group of B2B standouts &#8212; Twilio, Shopify, Atlassian, Okta, Coupa*, MongoDB and Zscaler, for example &#8212; approach or exceed the $1 billion revenue mark <em>and</em> see their market capitalizations surge 10 times or more from their IPOs to the present day (as of March 31), according to CapIQ data.</p>
<p>More recently, iconic companies like data giant Snowflake and video-conferencing mainstay Zoom came out of the IPO gate at even higher valuations. Zoom, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zoom-earnings-roared-to-nearly-1-billion-in-2020-and-the-stock-is-rising-again-11614633824">2020 revenue of just under $883 million</a>, is now worth close to $100 billion, per CapIQ data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past year has been a devastating one for the conference industry. It’s certainly an issue we’ve grappled with here at TechCrunch, as we’ve worked to move our programming to a virtual setting. Clearly each individual case calls for an individual solution, dependent on geography, attendance and a variety of other factors.</p>
<p>IFA has proven itself bullish on the in-person element. The Berlin tech show was one of a small handful of these sorts of events to go on with the show in Europe. The organization held an in-person event in September, albeit at a dramatically scaled-back rate.</p>
<p>“To be a little poetic, usually in the late summer, there’s a special air in Berlin and you go out in the morning, you feel this air,” director Jens Heithecker told me of last year’s event, which scaled back to around 170 exhibitors from 2,300.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the organization is planning to come back big this year, in spite of prolonged concerns around COVID-19 and its variants. A press release announcing the show’s fall return is downright celebratory.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fv1SqVXlwJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/ifas-executive-director-discusses-why-the-tech-show-must-go-on/">IFA&#8217;s executive director discusses why the tech show must go on</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IFA&#8217;s executive director discusses why the tech show must go on&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/ifas-executive-director-discusses-why-the-tech-show-must-go-on/embed/#?secret=Fv1SqVXlwJ" data-secret="Fv1SqVXlwJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“With the world on course to emerge from the pandemic, IFA Berlin is set to take place as a full-scale, real-life event from 3 &#8211; 7 September 2021,” the company writes. “Huge interest from brands, manufacturers and retailers across all industry sectors to exhibit, network and co-innovate on location in Berlin.”</p>
<p>The organization highlights some health and safety measures that are being carried over from last year’s event. But while it’s not quite ready to talk scale yet, the organization is highlighting a number of new tracks for the conference.</p>
<p>“As always, keeping our visitors and exhibitors safe is our top priority,” it said in a statement. “Of course, with all our precautions to ensure everybody’s good health, we don’t expect IFA Berlin 2021 to set new records. However, the trend is clear: IFA Berlin is set for a full-scale comeback, to lead our industry once more.”</p>
<p>Over in Spain, the GSMA is still working on its messaging as a number of large companies have already announced they intend to only attend the show “virtually.”</p>
<p>Organizers offered TechCrunch the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We appreciate that it will not be possible for everyone to attend MWC Barcelona 2021, but we are pleased that exhibitors including Verizon*, Orange and Kasperksy are excited to join us in Barcelona. To ensure everyone can enjoy the unique MWC experience, we have developed an industry-leading virtual event platform. The in-person and virtual options are provided so that all friends of MWC Barcelona can attend and participate in a way that works for them. We respect the decisions that have been made by some exhibitors and are working with them to move their participation to the virtual platform.</p></blockquote>
<p>[*Disclosure: Verizon owns TechCrunch]</p>
<p>Google, IBM, Nokia, Sony, Oracle and Ericsson have already announced they won’t be attending the show in person. Other large names are seemingly undecided. The whole thing is reminiscent of the lead-up to last year’s event, which was ultimately canceled.</p>
<p>The necessity of these large events was called into question prior to the pandemic, but the shift to virtual events has truly brought the topic into sharp relief. It’s true that there’s still value in an in-person event for hardware, specifically, but many have learned to adapt to a virtual setting. Even though if the last CES taught us anything, it’s that there are still a whole lot of kinks to work out with the system, especially as it pertains to prioritizing content all effectively being channeled through the same funnel.</p>
<p>People’s willingness to attend these events is based on a broad range of factors. At the very base level, there’s a question of personal comfortability (I can&#8217;t be the only one who has a visceral reaction every time they see crowded photos from past events). For many, it will be a bit of a shock to the system to suddenly attend a large indoor conference. There are factors like vaccinations and a particular region’s handling of the pandemic (all of which can wildly swing in the course of several months).</p>

<p>Just today, Germany’s Health Minister <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/german-covid-19-cases-jump-by-most-since-early-jan-2021-04-15/">sounded the red alert</a>, asking states to tighten restrictions. &#8220;We know from last autumn what happens when we don&#8217;t act quickly,&#8221; Jens Spahn warned the media.</p>
<p>There are a slew of other factors, including a potential attendee’s location and their workplace’s willingness to approve travel. Many companies have restricted business travel to all but the most essential trips. Depending on what you do for a living, your definition of “essential” may vary. But given how much can potentially change in that time, the soundest strategy for many is planning to tackle things remotely.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the GSMA sent out its own email to previous attendees titled, “Why do you believe MWC Barcelona 2021 will take place?” The note seems to be a direct response to stories about exhibitors opting for a virtual presence.</p>
<p>“Depending on when you are reading this, we will be about 12 weeks away from the doors opening for MWC21 in Barcelona,” CEO John Hoffman wrote. “To say that the last year has been disruptive is an understatement and my thoughts are with anyone who has been impacted by COVID-19. I am not only hopeful about the future, but I am also excited about convening our ecosystem at MWC21. We recognise that not everyone will be able to attend in person and that is fine as we will augment our physical event with our MWC virtual program bringing you content from the show.”</p>
<p>Canceling a flagship show one year could have been utterly devastating. For many of these organizers &#8212; and the local governments who rely on tourism money &#8212; two years might seem unthinkable. MWC’s virtual strategy in year one of the pandemic was, understandably, undercooked.</p>
<p>More than a year into this, however, the GSMA and organizations like it hopefully have more robust strategies in place. The fact of the matter is that going virtual isn’t a one- or two-off. For many companies and people profoundly impacted by the pandemic, this is what the future looks like.</p>

Almost a<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/individual-investor-boom-reshapes-u-s-stock-market-11598866200"> fifth</a> of U.S. equity trading in 2020 was driven by mom-and-pop investors &#8212; up from around 15% in the previous year. With such <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/30/how-the-pandemic-drove-massive-stock-market-gains-and-what-happens-next.html">impressive returns</a> to be made, many are deciding to set up a full-fledged investment business.</p>
<p>With the fundraising world becoming more democratic and accessible, we should help people find the right path to setting up a venture capital firm and also make sure the right people are entering the VC sphere. Startups are changing, and any new investment manager will have to adapt to the shifting landscape. VCs today have to provide more than money to get the best portfolio, and they must have a strong focus on impact to get the best institutional investors into their funds.</p>
<p>Startup investors can be the financial backbone for mass disruption. That’s why, at Founder Institute, we believe in the need for more VCs with strong values: Because they will prop up the companies that will build a brighter future for humanity. We’re not the only ones &#8212; our first “accelerator for ethical VCs” was oversubscribed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			VCs today have to provide more than money to get the best portfolio, and they must have a strong focus on impact to get the best institutional investors into their funds.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So if you want to lead your own VC fund in 2021, here are the main questions aspiring investors need to ask themselves.</p>
<h2>Are you doing this for the right reasons?</h2>
<p>Investing in startups is not just about making money. In selecting the startups that will become future industry leaders, VCs have a lot more power than most to do good (or harm). If you’re only interested in money, you likely won’t go too far. Identifying the greatest businesses means seeing beyond their capital into the longevity of their vision, their real-life impact on society, and how much consumers will love or hate them.</p>
<p>After all: Most startup founders pour their blood, sweat and tears into building a business not just to make money, but also to make an impact on the world and build products that align with their mission. Any new venture capitalist looking to attract the best founders needs to think about the vision and mission of their fund in the same terms.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What I wish I&#8217;d known about venture capital when I was a founder&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/what-i-wish-id-known-about-venture-capital-when-i-was-a-founder/embed/#?secret=BiUin5bv8a" data-secret="BiUin5bv8a" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Although VC firms have been slow on the uptake when it comes to environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, there are signs that times are changing. Some firms are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/european-vc-funds-are-building-community-around-esg-initiatives/"> forming a community</a> around implementing ESG, not only because of the external impact but because it <em>furthers their business goals</em>. To help accelerate this trend, we asked our<a href="http://fi.co/vc"> VC Lab</a> participants to take<a href="https://fi.co/insight/the-mensarius-oath"> The Mensarius Oath</a> (Latin for &#8220;banker&#8221; or &#8220;financier&#8221;), a professional code of conduct for finance professionals to create an ethical, prosperous and healthy world.</p>
<h2>What value do you bring to the table?</h2>
<p>The number of VCs are growing and the industry is increasingly<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/there-are-more-vc-funds-than-ever-but-capital-concentrates-at-the-top/"> becoming concentrated</a>. This means that simply offering large sums of money won&#8217;t get you traction with the best startups. Founders are looking for <em>value </em>over volume &#8212; they usually want mission alignment, connections, value-added services and industry expertise more than a blank check.</p>
<p>Remember that the best founders get to choose their VCs from a menu of options, not the other way around. To convince them that you’re the right match, you&#8217;ll need a proven track record in the same industry (or transferable experience from another industry) and referrals from credible people. You&#8217;ll also need a strong value proposition or niche that sets you apart from other funds. For example,<a href="http://untapped.vc/"> Untapped Capital</a> invests in “unexpected” and “undernetworked” founders, while<a href="https://www.r42group.com/"> R42 Group</a> invests in AI and longevity-focused businesses.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve got the profile to offer value to founders just yet, it&#8217;s worth taking some time to lay out exactly who you are. That is: what you hope to achieve as a fund manager, the vision you have for your portfolio companies and how you alone can help them get there.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s your secret sauce?</h2>
<p>As a new VC fund without historical data points, limited partners (LPs) will naturally be cautious to invest in your fund. So, you have to build a brand that tells your story and proves your reputation.</p>
<p>Go back to the basics and pinpoint exactly what your strengths are. If you&#8217;re having trouble finding inspiration, use statements like, “I can get the best deal because I have X,” or, “I help grow my portfolio companies by X” to get the ball rolling. Be wary of saying that the amount of money you have is your strength &#8212; at this stage, your bank balance isn&#8217;t your competitive edge. Focus instead on what makes you unique, credible and relevant. Having a high number of strategic contacts, extensive industry experience or a backsheet of successful exits could be your secret ingredients. For extra guidance, check out this resource my team put together to help fund managers consolidate their niche in an “<a href="https://fi.co/insight/template-for-creating-a-vc-investment-thesis">investment thesis</a>.”</p>
<p>Once you have a list, choose your top three strengths and write a followup sentence detailing how each of them can be enriched by your network and expertise. Ideally, share these with a test group (friends, family or fellow entrepreneurs) and ask them which is the most compelling. If there&#8217;s a general consensus toward one point, you know to make that a large chunk of your VC fund&#8217;s thesis.</p>
<h2>Do you have a solid network?</h2>
<p>Who you know is just as important as what you know, and the most prominent VCs tend to be in the middle of a flow of information and people. Your network tells founders that you&#8217;re respected and reassures them that they will probably be brought into the fold to connect with future mentors, customers, investors or hires.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a thought leader, the alumni of a well-known company like Uber or PayPal, or if you&#8217;ve started a community around an emerging vertical, you&#8217;re more likely to form a positive deal flow. But this status and these relationships have to be established <em>before</em> you launch your fund &#8212; if you try to network from zero, you&#8217;ll be spinning too many plates and won&#8217;t have the social proof to back yourself up.</p>
<p>Don’t just rely on your gut to tell you whether your network is satisfactory. Map out your personal ecosystem, sorting people based on familiarity (close contacts or acquaintances) and defining characteristics (consumers, finance, ex-CEOs, etc.). That “map” can be as basic as an Excel sheet with a column for each category, or you could use more attractive visual tools like<a href="https://www.canva.com/graphs/"> Canva</a> &#8212; great for sharing with your future team and encouraging them to fill any network gaps.</p>
<h2>What size fund do you want to launch?</h2>
<p>A VC fund runs like any other business &#8212; you have to develop a vision, recruit a team, form an entity, raise money, deliver value and report to stakeholders. To kick things off, you need to consider what size fund you want, and then secure significant commitments from LPs &#8212; at least 10% of your total fund. LPs can be corporations, entrepreneurs, government agencies and other funds.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that most LPs will want you to personally invest at least 1% of the total fund size so that you have “skin in the game.”</p>
<p>For that reason especially, it&#8217;s best to start small, somewhere between $5 million and $20 million, and use this “training fund” to demonstrate returns and create a launchpad for bigger raises to follow.</p>
<h2>Can you help founders from launch to exit?</h2>
<p>Your partnership with companies will be for the long haul, so you can&#8217;t rely just on offering value when you wire the money. Founders need consistent support across the full startup lifecycle, meaning you need to be conscious not to overpromise and fail to deliver. Think of the startups you&#8217;d most like to work with: How could you help them now? How could you help them in the future? And how could you help them exit?</p>
<p>You can take a skills-centric approach, where you reserve different resources and connections based on marketing, hiring, fundraising and culture-creation that can be applied as the startup grows. Alternatively, you might want to make sprint-like plans, where you check in with founders on a repeating basis and iterate the support you offer based on their progress. Whatever way you chose to structure your support, ensure that you&#8217;re realistic about what you can bring to the table, your availability, preferred involvement and how you&#8217;ll document it.</p>
<p>The future of VC will be driven by venture capitalists with strong values who have built funds with the new needs of founders in mind. VC may once have been exclusive and mysterious, but 2021 could be the year VC becomes a more open and fair space for businesses and investors alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A coalition of 35 consumer advocacy groups along with 64 experts in child development have co-signed a letter to Facebook asking the company to reconsider its plans to launch a<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"> version of Instagram for children under the age of 13,</a> which Facebook has confirmed to be in development. In the letter, the groups and experts argue that social media is linked with several risk factors for younger children and adolescents, related to both their physical health and overall well-being.</p>
<p>The letter was written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, an advocacy group that often leads campaigns against big tech and its targeting of children.</p>
<p>The group stresses how influential social media is on young people&#8217;s development, and the dangers such an app could bring:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A growing body of research demonstrates that excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to adolescents. Instagram, in particular, exploits young people’s fear of missing out and desire for peer approval to encourage children and teens to constantly check their devices and share photos with their followers,&#8221; it states. &#8220;The platform’s relentless focus on appearance, self-presentation, and branding presents challenges to adolescents’ privacy and wellbeing. Younger children are even less developmentally equipped to deal with these challenges, as they are learning to navigate social interactions, friendships, and their inner sense of strengths and challenges during this crucial window of development,&#8221; the letter reads.</p>
<p>Citing public health research and other studies, the letter notes that excessive screen time and social media use can contribute to a variety of risks for kids including obesity, lower psychological well-being, decreased quality of sleep, increased risk of depression and suicide ideation, and other issues. Adolescent girls report feeling pressured to post sexualized selfies for attention from their peers, the letter said, and 59% of U.S. teens have reported being bullied in social media, as well.</p>
<p>Another concern the groups have is the use of the Instagram algorithm which could suggest what kids would see and click on next, noting that children are &#8220;highly persuadable.&#8221;</p>
<p>They also point out that Facebook knows there are already children under 13 who have lied about their age using the Instagram platform, and these users will be unlikely to migrate to what they&#8217;ll view as a more &#8220;babyish&#8221; version of the app than the one they&#8217;re already using. That means Facebook is really targeting an even younger age group who don&#8217;t yet have an Instagram account with this &#8220;kids version.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns being raised, Instagram&#8217;s plans to compete for younger users will not likely be impacted by the outcry. Already, Instagram&#8217;s top competitor in social media today &#8212; TikTok &#8212; has developed an experience for kids under 13. In fact, it was forced to age-gate its app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/musical-ly-tiktok-fined-5-7m-by-ftc-for-violating-childrens-privacy-laws-will-update-app-with-age-gate/">as a result of its settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</a>, which had <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/318207/musically-referred-to-ftc-for-allegedly-violating.html">investigated</a> Musical.ly (the app that became TikTok) for violations of the U.S. children’s privacy law <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook, too, could be in a similar situation where it has to age-gate Instagram in order to properly direct its <em>existing</em> underage users to a COPPA-compliant experience. At the very least, Facebook has grounds to argue that it shouldn&#8217;t have to boot the under-13 crowd off its app, since TikTok did not. And the FTC&#8217;s fines, even when historic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/ftc-sells-kids-privacy-cheap/">barely make a dent</a> in tech giants&#8217; revenues.</p>
<p>The advocacy groups&#8217; letter follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/markey-letter-instagram-kids/">a push from Democratic lawmakers,</a> who also this month penned a letter addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to express concerns over Facebook&#8217;s ability to protect kids&#8217; privacy and their well-being. Their letter had specifically cited Messenger Kids, which was once<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20706250/facebook-messenger-kids-bug-chat-app-unauthorized-adults"> found to have a design flaw</a> that let kids chat with unauthorized users. The lawmakers gave Facebook until April 26 to respond to their questions.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/zuckerberg-confirms-instagram-for-kids-plans-at-congressional-hearing-on-misinformation/ar-BB1eYg9Y">confirmed Facebook&#8217;s plans</a> for an Instagram for kids at a Congressional hearing back in March, saying that the company was &#8220;early in our thinking&#8221; about how the app would work, but noted it would involve some sort of parental oversight and involvement. That&#8217;s similar to what Facebook offers today via Messenger Kids and TikTok does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">via its Family Pairing parental controls</a>.</p>
<p>The market, in other words, is shifting towards acknowledging that kids are already on social media &#8212; with or without parents&#8217; permission. As a result, companies are building features and age gates to accommodate that reality. The downside to this plan, of course, is once you legitimize the creation of social apps for the under-13 demographic, companies are given the legal right to hook kids even younger on what are, arguably, risky experiences from a public health standpoint.</p>
<p>The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood also today launched a <a href="https://ccfc.salsalabs.org/noinstagramforkids/index.html">petition</a> which others can sign to push Facebook to cancel its plans for an Instagram for kids.</p>

<p>Facebook, reached for comment, offered the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve just started exploring a version of Instagram for younger teens. We agree that any experience we develop must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it. In addition, we will not show ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13. The reality is that kids are online. They want to connect with their family and friends, have fun, and learn, and we want to help them do that in a way that is safe and age-appropriate. We also want to find practical solutions to the ongoing industry problem of kids lying about their age to access apps. We’re working on new age verification methods to keep under-13s off Instagram and we’re exploring an Instagram experience for kids that is age-appropriate and managed by parents.</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there less risk and more opportunities for VCs who are looking to back crypto and fintech startups?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">direct listing</a> was a massive finance, startup and cryptocurrency event that impacted a host of public and private investors, early employees, and crypto-enthusiasts. Regardless of where one sits in the broader tech and venture world, Coinbase storming north of a $100 billion valuation during its first day of trading was the biggest startup happening of the year.</p>
<p>The transaction&#8217;s effects will be felt for some time in the public market, but also among the startups and capital that comprise the private market.</p>
<p>In the buildup to Coinbase’s flotation — and we’d argue especially after it released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">its blockbuster Q1 2021 results</a> — there was a general expectation that the unicorn’s direct listing would provide a halo effect for other startups in the space. Anthemis’ <a href="https://twitter.com/foxe_news">Ruth Foxe Blader</a> told The Exchange, for example, that “the Coinbase listing shows this great inflection point for crypto,” with another “wave” of startup work in the space coming up.</p>
<p>The widely held perspective raised two questions: Will the success of Coinbase’s direct listing bolster private investment in crypto-focused startups, and will that success help other areas of financially focused startup work garner more investor attention?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Presuming that Coinbase’s listing will positively impact its niche and others around it is not a stretch. But to make sure we weren’t misreading sentiment, and to get deeper into the <em>why</em> of the concept, The Exchange reached out to venture capitalists who invest in the broader fintech world to get their take. We even roped in an analyst or two to round out our panel.</p>
<p>The answer is not a simple yes. There are several ways to approach investing in the cryptocurrency space &#8212; from buying coins themselves, to investing in mainstream-ish institutions like legal exchanges, to the more exotic, like supporting efforts on the forefront of the decentralized blockchain world. And while it is somewhat clear that most folks expect more capital to be available for crypto projects, it’s not clear where it may end up inside the market.</p>

<p>After yesterday&#8217;s examination of how blazingly hot the venture capital market looked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">in the first quarter</a>, we’re again trying to gauge the private market’s temperature. Let’s talk to some folks on the ground and hear what they are seeing.</p>
<h2>Are crypto startups less risky now?</h2>
<p>Coinbase’s direct listing floated a company that is worth more than all but two major blockchains, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin. Several other chains have aggregate coin values in the 11-figure range, but a 12-digit worth is still rare among crypto assets.</p>
<p>The scale of Coinbase’s valuation post-listing matters, according to <a href="https://markets.chainalysis.com/">Chainalysis</a> Chief Economist <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell">Phillip Gradwell</a>. Gradwell told The Exchange that “Coinbase’s $100 billion valuation today demonstrates that venture investors can make great returns from putting money into crypto companies, not just cryptocurrencies. That proof point is good for the entire ecosystem.”</p>
<p>More simply, it is now eminently reasonable to invest in the companies working in the crypto space instead of merely putting capital to work hard-buying coins themselves. The other way to consider the comment is to realize that Coinbase’s share price appreciation is steep enough since its 2012 founding to rival the returns of some coins over the same time frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cleocap.com/">Cleo Capital</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahKunst">Sarah Kunst</a> expanded on the point, telling The Exchange in an email that “it&#8217;s now credible to say you&#8217;re a crypto startup and plan to IPO [versus] having acquisition or ICO be the only proven exit paths in the U.S.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/">Samurai Incubate</a>, a Tokyo-based venture capital firm, announced today it has closed its &#8220;Samurai Africa 2nd General Partnership&#8221; fund, totalling 2.026 billion yen (~$18.6 million)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the firm, the fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was oversubscribed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it targeted 2 billion (~$18.4 million) and a total of 54 investors joined as LPs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One notable LP is the Toyota Tsusho Corporation, which has a diverse network across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm founded <a href="https://www.mobility54.com/profile">Mobility 54</a>, a corporate venture capital (CVC) looking to invest $45 million into African mobility, logistics, and fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/kentarosakakibara">Kentaro Sakakibara</a> founded Samurai Incubate,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in 2018, the firm began investing in Africa by establishing a subsidiary called Leapfrog Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From August 2018, Samurai Incubate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested $2.5 million in 20 African startups via the newly established firm. Then in June 2019, renamed itself Samurai Incubate Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Throughout our journey, we have focused on refining and optimizing our operating approach to maximize our value proposition to founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not always have been perfect. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the value we bring should go beyond capital and access to Japanese investors and corporations,&#8221; the firm said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sector-agnostic fund, Samurai Incubate Africa has already invested in 26 companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six from this second fund include Eden Life, a tech-enabled home service startup; online loan marketplace Evolve Credit; energy startup Shyft Power Solutions; microfinance services for car lenders FMG; freight forwarding company Oneport; and online grocery platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricepally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of Samurai&#8217;s companies are from three African countries &#8212; Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that will change going forward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/rena-yoneyama-b27ba021">Rena Yoneyama</a>, the managing partner at the firm, Samurai Incubate Africa is joining Egypt to the list of countries it will target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018, Egypt has been witnessing outstanding ecosystem growth and is producing talent, startups and indigenous investors at a breathtaking pace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Samurai Incubate Africa, it&#8217;s only fair to tap into this growth because Egypt&#8217;s inclusion ensures the firm has startups in the Big Four &#8212; the continent&#8217;s top startup ecosystems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Egyptian startup ecosystem and its economy is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding and we got to know that there are many talented founders and great investors in the country as well,&#8221; Yoneyama said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We already decided to make one investment into an Egyptian startup, and we know we&#8217;ll never regret it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Samurai first announced this fund back in January 2020, its ticket size was between $50,000 to $500,000. For pre-seed to seed rounds, startups got $200,000 or less. And for pre-Series A and Series A rounds, not more than $500,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upon completing the fund, Samurai Incubate is extending the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">maximum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amount of investment to $800,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We would like to support our portfolio companies&#8217; pre-series A and series A raises as an existing investor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, we thought it would be better to increase the ticket size considering the recent round size and valuation of companies,&#8221; Yoneyama said of the ticket size increase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although sector-agnostic, the firm is particular about companies in fintech, insurtech, logistics, healthtech, consumer and commerce, energy, agritech, mobility and entertainment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese VC plans to invest in 30 to 40 new companies at the pre-seed and seed stage as well as follow-up pre-Series A and Series A investments in 7 to 10 existing portfolio companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Samurai Incubate is part of the growing list of Japanese VC firms like Kepple Africa and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/japans-uncovered-fund-launches-15m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-africa/">Uncovered Fund</a> targeting African startups.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the eight person team behind the new startup <a href="https://hadrian.co/">Hadrian</a> has their way, they&#8217;ll have transformed the manufacturing industry within the next decade.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s the goal for the new San Francisco-based startup, founded only last year, which has set its sights on building out a new model for advanced manufacturing to enable the satellite, space ship, and advanced energy technology companies to build the future they envision better and faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We view our job as to provide the world’s most efficient space and defense component factory,&#8221; said Hadrian founder, Chris Power.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially, the company is building factories to make the parts that go on rocket ships, according to Power, but the business has implications for any company that needs bespoke components to make their equipment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me tell you how bad it is at the moment and what’s going to happen over the next 20 years. Right now everyone in space and defense, [including] SpaceX and Lockheed Martin, outsources their parts and manufacturing to small factories across the country. They’re super expensive, they’re unreliable and they’re completely invisible to the customers,&#8221; said Power. &#8220;This causes big problems with space and defense manufacturers in the design phase, because the lead time is so long and the iteration time is super long. Imagine running software and being able to iterate on your product once every 20 days? If you can imagine a Gantt chart of how to build a rocket, about 60% of that is buffer time… A lot of the delays in launches and stuff like that happen because parts got delivered three months ago. It’d be like running a McDonalds and realizing that your fries and burger providers could not tell you when the food would arrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the strategic importance of the parts suppliers to the operations of aerospace, defense, and advanced machining companies. As no less an authority on manufacturing than Elon Musk noted in a tweet, &#8220;The factory is the product.&#8221; It&#8217;s also hard to overstate the geopolitical importance of re-establishing the U.S. as a center of manufacturing excellence, according to Hadrian&#8217;s investors Lux Capital, Founders Fund, and Construct Capital. Which is one reason why they&#8217;re investing $9.5 million into the very early stage business.</p>
<p>&#8220;America made massive strategic mistakes in the early 90s which have left our national manufacturing ecosystem completely dilapidated,&#8221; said Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov. &#8220;The only way to get out of this disaster is to re-invent the most basic input into our aerospace and defense supply chains, machining metal parts quickly and with high tolerance. Right now, America&#8217;s most innovative company, SpaceX, relies on a network of near-retired machinists to produce space-worthy metal parts, and no one in technology is. focused on solving this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Power got to understand the problem at his previous company, Ento, which sold workforce management software to blue collar customers. It was there he realized the issue of. the aging workforce and the need for manufacturers to upgrade almost every aspect of their own technology stack. &#8220;I realized that the right way to bring technology to the industrial space is not to sell software to these companies, it&#8217;s to build an industrial business from scratch with software.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Hadrian is focusing all of its efforts on the space industry, where the component manufacturing problem is especially acute, but the manufacturing capabilities the company is building out have broad relevance across any industry that requires highly engineered components.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The demand for manufacturing from both the large SpaceX and Blue Origin all the way to this growing long tail of companies from Anduril to Relativity to Varda,&#8221; said Lux Capital co-founder Josh Wolfe. &#8220;Most of these guys are using mom and pop machine shops… [and] those shops are horribly inefficient. They’re not consistent, and they’re not reliable. Between the software automation, the hardware, you can cut down on inefficiency every step of the process… I like to think of value creation as waste reduction… so mundane things like quoting, scheduling, bidding, and planning all the way to the programming of the manufacturing… every one of those things takes hours to tens of hours to days and weeks, so if you can do that in minutes, it’s just a no-brainer. [Hadrian] will be the cutting edge choice for all of the new and explicitly dedicated and focused aerospace and defense companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Power envisions a network of manufacturing facilities that can initially cover roughly 65% of all space and defense components, and will eventually take that number up to 95% of components. Already several of the biggest launch vehicle and satellite manufacturers are in talks with the company to produce hundreds of units for them, Power said. Some of those companies just happen to be in the Construct, Lux, and Founders Fund portfolio.</p>
<p>And the company&#8217;s founder sees this as a new way to revitalize American manufacturing jobs as well. &#8220;Manufacturing jobs in space and defense can easily be as high paying as a software engineering job at Google,&#8221; he said. In an ideal world, Hadrian would like to offer an onramp to high paying manufacturing careers in the 21st century in the same way that automakers provided good union jobs in the twentieth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t built any of this. If you look at the sheer number of people that we need to train and hire on our new technology and new systems, that people problem and that training problem is part of growing our business.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race among mobility startups to become profitable by controlling market share has produced a string of bad results for cities and the people living in the them.</p>
<p>City officials and agencies learned from those early deployments of ride-hailing and shared scooter services and have since pushed back with new rules and tighter control over which companies can operate. This correction has prompted established companies to change how they do business and fueled a new crop of startups, all promising a different approach.</p>
<p>But can mobility be accessible, equitable and profitable? And how?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tamika&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tamika&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, a virtual event scheduled for June 9, aims to dig into those questions. Luckily, we have three guests who are at the center of cities, equity and shared mobility: community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p>Butler, a lawyer and founder and principal of her own consulting company, is well known for work in diversity and inclusion, equity, the built environment, community organizing and leading nonprofits. She was most recently the director of planning in California and the director of equity and inclusion at Toole Design. She previously served as the executive director of the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust and was the executive director of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition. Butler also sits on the board of Lacuna Technologies.</p>
<p>Chu is the CEO and co-founder of Remix, a startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design. Remix was recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">acquired by Via for $100 million</a> and will continue to operate as a subsidiary of the company. Remix, which was backed by Sequoia Capital, Energy Impact Partners, Y Combinator, and Elemental Excelerator has been recognized as both a 2020 World Economic Forum Tech Pioneer and BloombergNEF Pioneer for its work in empowering cities to make transportation decisions with sustainability and equity at the forefront. Chu currently serves as Commissioner of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, and sits on the city’s Congestion Pricing Policy Advisory Committee. Previously, Tiffany was a Fellow at Code for America, the first UX hire at Zipcar and is an alum of Y Combinator. Tiffany has a background in architecture and urban planning from MIT.</p>

<p>Reig is the co-founder and CEO of Revel, a transportation company that got its start launching a shared electric moped service in Brooklyn. The company, which launched in 2018, has since expanded its moped service to Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, Washington, D.C., Miami, Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. The company has since expanded its focus beyond moped and has started to build fast-charging EV Superhubs across New York City and launched an eBike subscription service in four NYC boroughs. Prior to Revel, Reig held senior roles in the energy and corporate sustainability sectors.</p>
<p>The trio will join other speakers TechCrunch has announced, a list that so far includes Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JonBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and Linked founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital and Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla.

<p>Xwing has scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company said Thursday it has raised $40 million at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>
<p>The company is setting its sights on expansion – not only tripling its engineering team, but eventually running regular fully unmanned commercial cargo flights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xwing has been developing a technology stack to convert aircraft, including a widely used Cessna Grand Caravan 208B, to function autonomously. But it’s had to solve a few problems first: “the perception problem, the planning problem and the control problem,” Xwing founder Marc Piette explained to TechCrunch. The company has come up with a whole suite of solutions to solve for these problems, including integrating lidar, radar and cameras on the plane; retrofitting the servomotors that control the rudder, braking and other functions; and ensuring all of these are communicating properly so the plane understands where it is in space and can execute its flight.</p>
<p>The company has already performed close to 200 missions with its AutoFlight system. For all these flights, there’s been a safety pilot on board. In addition, a ground control operator sits in a control center and acts as a go-between from the autonomous aircraft to the human air traffic control operator.</p>
<p>“We don’t anticipate automating [communication with air traffic control], trying to do natural language processing and having a computer make the response to the air traffic controller,” Piette said. “For safety critical applications, we don’t view that as a useful path. . .but what we do, though, is we have a ground operator in our control room that just talks to air traffic control on behalf of the aircraft. So for the air traffic controller, it’s seamless. As far as they&#8217;re concerned, they are just talking to a pilot onboard the aircraft.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139161" style="width: 1790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139161" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2139161 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png" alt="" width="1780" height="880" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png 1780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=768,380 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=1536,759 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-09.42.18.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1780px) 100vw, 1780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139161" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Xwing</p></div></p>
<p>For its autonomous flight activities, the company has authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly under an experimental airworthiness certificate for research and development that was expanded in August of last year to include a special flight permit for optionally piloted aircraft (OPA).</p>
<p>The company is looking to eventually remove the safety pilot, but only once full safety redundancies are in place, Piette added. That includes redundancies across all sensors and computer systems. Fortunately for all of us that fly, commercial aviation safety levels are extremely high. It means a high airworthiness standard for aviation startups. Smaller Class III aircraft like the ones Xwing is targeting must demonstrate a risk of one catastrophic failure per hundred million flight hours.</p>
<p>Xwing’s activities have garnered attention from investors. This most recent funding round was led by Blackhorn Ventures, with participation from ACME Capital, Loup Ventures, R7 Partners, Eniac Ventures, Alven Capital and Array Ventures. Including this round, the company has raised $55 million in total capital.</p>
<p>The autonomous flights are only one part of Xwing’s business activities. It’s also been flying manned commercial cargo operations under a contract with a large logistics company signed December 1.</p>
<p>“We set up what’s effectively an airline,” Piette said. By modifying these aircraft with sensors to collect data, Xwing is able to feed this valuable flight time into a training algorithm, and collect other useful data, such as how often the pilots communicate with air traffic controllers and the types of directions the craft receives.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company will be significantly scaling its workforce over the next 12 months, in addition to increasing its commercial operations in parallel. On the technology side, Xwing is looking to fly autonomous commercial cargo flights, with a safety pilot onboard, under an experimental ticket and exemption from the FAA. The company will likely reach this milestone also within the next twelve months, Piette said. After that, it would look to remove the safety pilot from the aircraft. Even then, the company would still need to get its systems certified to completely remove any constraints on its movements in airspace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tecton.ai/">Tecton</a>, the company that pioneered the notion of <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/what-is-a-feature-store/">the machine learning feature store</a>, has teamed up with the founder of the open source feature store project called <a href="https://feast.dev/">Feast</a>. Today the company announced the release of version 0.10 of the open source tool.</p>
<p>The feature store is a concept that the Tecton founders came up with when they were engineers at Uber. Shortly thereafter an engineer named Willem Pienaar read the founder&#8217;s Uber blog posts on building a feature store and went to work building Feast as an open source version of the concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of Tecton [involved bringing] feature stores to the industry, so we build basically the best in class, enterprise feature store. [&#8230;] Feast is something that Willem created, which I think was inspired by some of the early designs that we published at Uber. And he built Feast and it evolved as kind of like the standard for open source feature stores, and it&#8217;s now part of the Linux Foundation,&#8221; Tecton co-founder and CEO Mike Del Balso explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tecton later hired Pienaar, who is today an engineer at the company where he leads their open source team. While the company did not originally start off with a plan to build an open source product, the two products are closely aligned, and it made sense to bring Pienaar on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The products are very similar in a lot of ways. So I think there&#8217;s a similarity there that makes this somewhat symbiotic, and there is no explicit convergence necessary. The Tecton product is a superset of what Feast has. So it&#8217;s an enterprise version with a lot more advanced functionality, but at Feast we have a battle-tested feature store that&#8217;s open source,&#8221; Pienaar said.</p>
<p>As we wrote in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/tecton-ai-nabs-35m-series-b-as-it-releases-machine-learning-feature-store/">a December 2020 story</a> on the company&#8217;s $35 million Series B, it describes a feature store as &#8220;an end-to-end machine learning management system that includes the pipelines to transform the data into what are called feature values, then it stores and manages all of that feature data and finally it serves a consistent set of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Del Balso says that from a business perspective, contributing to the open source feature store exposes his company to a different group of users, and the commercial and open source products can feed off one another as they build the two products.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we really like, and what we feel is very powerful here, is that we&#8217;re deeply in the Feast community and get to learn from all of the interesting use cases [&#8230;] to improve the Tecton product. And similarly, we can use the feedback that we&#8217;re hearing from our enterprise customers to improve the open source project. That&#8217;s the kind of cross learning, and ideally that feedback loop involved there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The plan is for Tecton to continue being a primary contributor with a team inside Tecton dedicated to working on Feast. Today, the company is releasing version 0.10 of the project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the money flowing into Silicon Valley is reaching historic heights, the competition for getting customer attention and growing businesses is still a major challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.casa-blanca.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to develop a “Bumble-like app” for finding a home, has raised $2.6 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Hannah Bomze got her real estate license at the age of 18 and worked at Compass and  Douglas Elliman Real Estate before launching Casa Blanca last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She launched the app last October with the goal of matching home buyers and renters with homes using an in-app matchmaking algorithm combined with “expert agents.” Buyers get up to 1% of home purchases back at closing. Similar to dating apps, Casa Blanca’s app is powered by a simple swipe left or right.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samuel Ben-Avraham, a partner and early investor of Kith and an early investor in WeWork, led the round for Casa Blanca, bringing its total raise to date to $4.1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York-based startup recently launched in the Colorado market and has seen some impressive traction in a short amount of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the app in October, Casa Blance has “made more than $100M in sales” and is projected to reach $280 million this year between New York and its Denver launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bomze said the app experience will be customized for each city with the goal of creating a personalized experience for each user. Casa Blanca claims to streamline and sort listings based on user preferences and lifestyle priorities.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139196" style="width: 178px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139196" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2139196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?w=168" alt="" width="168" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png 1116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=168,300 168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=768,1374 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=380,680 380w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=859,1536 859w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/17.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Casa Blanca</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People love that there is one place to book, manage feedback, schedule and communicate with a branded agent for one cohesive experience,” Bomze said. “We have a breadth of users from first time buyers to people using our platform for $15 million listings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike competitors, Casa Blanca applies to a direct-to-consumer model, she pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While our agents are an integral part of the company, they are not responsible for bringing in business and have more organizational support, which allows them to focus on the individual more and creates a better end-to-end experience for the consumer,” Bomze said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casa Blanca currently has over 38 agents in NYC and Colorado, compared to about 15 at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a growth phase and finding a unique opportunity in this climate, in particular, because there are many women exploring new, more flexible job opportunities,” Bomze noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to continue expanding into new markets, nationally and globally; enhancingits technology and scaling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow in new markets, the app experience will be curated to each city &#8211; for example, in Colorado you can edit your preferences based on access to ski areas &#8211; to make sure we’re offering a personalized experience for each user,” Bomze said.</span></p>

<p>Launched in 2016, Chili Piper’s software for B2B revenue teams is designed to convert leads into attended meetings. Sales teams can also use it to book demos, increase inbound conversion rates, eliminate manual lead routing, and streamline critical processes around meetings. It&#8217;s used by Intuit, Twilio, Forrester, Spotify, and Gong.</p>
<p>Chili Piper has a number of different tools for businesses to schedule and calendar accountments, but its key USP is in its use by ‘inbound SDR Sales Development Representatives (SDR)’, who are responsible for qualifying inbound sales leads. It’s particularly useful in scheduling calls when customers hit websites ask for a salesperson to call them back.</p>
<p>Nicolas Vandenberghe, CEO, and co-founder of Chili Piper said: “When we started we sold the house and decided to grow the company ourselves. So all the way until 2019 we bootstrapped. Tiger gave us a valuation that we expected to get at the end of this year, which will help us accelerate things much faster, so we couldn&#8217;t refuse it.”</p>
<p>Alina Vandenberghe, CPO, and Co-founder said: “We’re proud to have so many customers scheduling meetings and optimizing their calendars with Chili Piper’s Instant Booker.&#8221;</p>
<p>The husband-and-wife founded company has was fully remote from day one, with 93 employees in 81 cities and 21 countries, long before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global said: “When we met Nicolas and Alina, we were fired up by their product vision and focus on customer happiness.”</p>
<p>TJ Nahigian, Managing Partner at Base10 Partners, added: “We originally invested in Chili Piper because we knew customers needed ways to add fire to how they connected with inbound leads. We’ve been absolutely blown away with the progress over the past year, 2020 has been a step-change for this company as business went remote.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce is booming, but among the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs of online businesses are finding a place to store the items they are selling and dealing with the logistics of operating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Scriven, Maxwell Bonnie and Paul D’Arrigo co-founded </span><a href="https://www.saltbox.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to solve that problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio came up with a unique “co-warehousing” model that provides space for small businesses and e-commerce merchants to operate as well as store and ship goods, all under one roof. Beyond the physical offering, Saltbox offers integrated logistics services as well as amenities such as the rental of equipment and packing stations and access to items such as forklifts. There are no leases and tenants have the flexibility to scale up or down based on their needs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in that sweet spot between co-working and raw warehouse space,” said CEO Scriven, a former Palantir executive and Techstars managing director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltbox opened its first facility &#8212; a 27,000-square-foot location &#8212; in its home base of Atlanta in late 2019, filling it within two months. It recently opened its second facility, a 66,000-square-foot location, in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that is currently about 40% occupied. The company plans to end 2021 with eight locations, in particular eyeing the Denver, Seattle and Los Angeles markets. Saltbox has locations slated to come online as large as 110,000 square feet, according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded on the premise that the need for “co-warehousing and SMB-centric logistics enablement solutions” has become a major problem for many new businesses that rely on online retail platforms to sell their goods, noted Scriven. Many of those companies are limited to self-storage and mini-warehouse facilities for storing their inventory, which can be expensive and inconvenient. </span></p>
<p>Scriven personally met with challenges when starting his own e-commerce business, True Glory Brands, a retailer of multicultural hair and beauty products.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We became aware of the lack of physical workspace for SMBs engaged in commerce,” Scriven told TechCrunch. “If you are in the market looking for 10,000 square feet of industrial warehouse space, you are effectively pushed to the fringes of the real estate ecosystem and then the entrepreneurial ecosystem at large. This is costing companies in significant but untold ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Saltbox has completed a $10.6 million Series A round of financing led by Palo Alto-based Playground Global that included participation from XYZ Venture Capital and proptech-focused Wilshire Lane Partners in addition to existing backers Village Global and MetaProp. The company plans to use its new capital primarily to expand into new markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s customers are typically SMB e-commerce merchants “generating anywhere from $50,000 to $10 million a year in revenue,” according to Scriven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasizes that the company’s value prop is “quite different” from a traditional flex office/co-working space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our members are reliant upon us to support critical workflows,” Scriven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides e-commerce occupants, many service-based businesses are users of Saltbox’s offering, he said, such as those providing janitorial services or that need space for physical equipment. The company offers all-inclusive pricing models that include access to loading docks and a photography studio, for example, in addition to utilities and Wi-Fi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company secures its properties with a mix of buying and leasing by partnering with institutional real estate investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These partners are acquiring assets and in most cases, are funding the entirety of capital improvements by entering into management or revenue share agreements to operate those properties,” Scriven said. He said the model is intentionally different from that of “notable flex space operators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have obviously followed those stories very closely and done our best to learn from their experiences,” he added. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Everyone warns you not to build on top of someone else’s platform.</p>
<p>When I first started in VC more than 10 years ago, I was told never to invest in a company building on top of another company’s platform. Dependence on a platform makes you susceptible to failure and caps the return on your investment because you have no control over API access, pricing changes and end-customer data, among other legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>I am sure many of you recall Facebook shutting down its API access back in 2015, or the uproar Apple caused when it decided to change the commission it was charging app developers in 2020.</p>
<p>Put simply, founders can no longer avoid the decision around platform dependency.</p>
<p>Salesforce in many ways paved the way for large enterprise platform companies, being the first dedicated SaaS company to surpass $10 billion in annual revenue supported by its open application development marketplace. Salesforce’s success has given rise to dominant platforms in other verticals, and for founders starting companies, there is no avoiding that platform decision these days.</p>
<p>Some points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 4,000 fintech companies, including several unicorns, have <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/">built</a> their platforms on top of Plaid.</li>
<li>Recruiters may complain about the cost, but <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/2017-05-05/how-headhunters-use-linkedin-to-find-talented-candidates">95%</a> still utilize LinkedIn.</li>
<li>More than 20,000 companies trust <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a> to be their system of record for customer data.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> powers over 1 million businesses across the globe.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.epic.com/">Epic</a> has the medical records of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/epic/why_epic/">nearly 50%</a> of the U.S. population.</li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean for founders who decide to build on top of another platform?</p>
<h2>Increase speed to market</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.postscript.io/">PostScript</a>, an SMS/MMS marketing platform for commerce brands, built its platform on Shopify, giving it immediate access to over 1 million brands and a direct customer acquisition funnel. That has allowed PostScript to capture 3,500 of its own customers and successfully close a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">$35 million Series B</a> in March 2021.</p>
<h2>Ability to focus on core functionality</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/">Varo</a>, one of the fastest-growing neobanks, started in 2015 with the principle that a bank could put customers’ interests first and be profitable. But in order to deliver on its mission, it needed to understand where its customers were spending their money. By partnering with Plaid, Varo <a href="https://plaid.com/documents/varo-case-study.pdf">enabled</a> more than 176,000 of its users to connect their Varo account to outside apps and services, allowing Varo to focus on its core mission to provide more relevant financial products and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the seemingly unending debate around <a href="https://substack.com">Substack</a> has focused on well-known writers with a national profile, the newsletter platform just announced that it will be supporting local (presumably non-famous) journalists through a new program.</p>
<p>The startup described <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">Substack Local</a> as a $1 million initiative that will fund independent writers creating local news publications. Similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">the Substack Pro program</a>, the company will offer cash advances of up to $100,000, as well as mentorship and &#8220;subsidized access&#8221; to health insurance and design services. In exchange, Substack will take 85% of subscription revenue for a year (its cut goes back to the standard 10% after that).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0KKTcoM5meemtYYmcPnnXXHk__cDB-2PTDc9VRid_MblpdA/viewform">Applications</a> are due by April 29, with participants selected by a panel of judges with their own Substack publications — Zeynep Tufekci of Insight, Anne Helen Petersen of Culture Study, Dick Tofel of Second Rough Draft and Rachel Larimore, managing editor of The Dispatch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Substack said that through this initiative, it&#8217;s also partnering with New Zealand-based <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz">Stuff</a> to launch two new publications covering under-served regions in the country.</p>

<p>A Substack skeptic might suggest that programs like this are an easy way to drum up positive publicity. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/facebook-local-news-2/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/google-announces-a-journalism-emergency-relief-fund-for-local-newsrooms/">Google</a> have also announced programs to support local news.) In Substack&#8217;s case, this comes after the platform has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">criticized for bankrolling transphobic writers</a> with big advances — just a few days ago, the company revealed that it has recently signed lucrative contracts with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">transgender writers including Daniel Lavery</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless of motivation, the need for more local journalism is real, with news deserts created by <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2018/about-1300-u-s-communities-have-totally-lost-news-coverage-unc-news-desert-study-finds/">the shutdowns and struggles of many local newspapers</a>. If there&#8217;s going to be any hope, it seems more likely to come from new, digitally-focused publications and independent journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a grants program, nor is it inspired by philanthropic intent,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/introducing-substack-local-for-a">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Our goal is to foster an effective business model for independent local news that provides ample room for growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced this morning it will begin testing a new experience for discovering businesses in its News Feed in the U.S. When live, users to tap on topics they&#8217;re interested in underneath posts and ads in their News Feed in order to explore related content from businesses. The change comes at a time when Facebook has been arguing how Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">App Tracking Transparency</a> update will impact its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">small business customers</a> &#8212; a claim many <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/facebooks-misleading-campaign-against-apples-privacy-policy">have</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sorry-facebook-ios-changes-not-bad-for-small-businesses/">dismissed</a> as misleading, but nevertheless led some <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">mom and pop shops to express concern</a> about the impacts to their ad targeting capabilities, as a result. This new test is an example of how easily Facebook can tweak its News Feed to build out more data on its users, if needed.</p>
<p>The company suggests users may see the change under posts and ads from businesses selling beauty products, fitness or clothing, among other things.</p>
<p>The idea here is that Facebook would direct users to related businesses through a News Feed feature, when they take a specific action to discover related content. This, in turn, could help Facebook create a new set of data on its users, in terms of which users clicked to see more, and what sort of businesses they engaged with, among other things. Over time, it could turn this feature into an ad unit, if desired, where businesses could pay for higher placement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;People already discover businesses while scrolling through News Feed, and this will make it easier to discover and consider new businesses they might not have found on their own,&#8221; the company noted in a brief <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-tools-for-online-marketing">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t detail its further plans with the test, but said as it learned from how users interacted with the feature, it will expand the experience to more people and businesses.</p>

<p>Along with news of the test, Facebook said it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-business-suite-features-including-stories">will roll out more tools</a> for business owners this month, including the ability to create, publish and schedule Stories to both Facebook and Instagram; make changes and edits to Scheduled Posts; and soon, create and manage Facebook Photos and Albums from Facebook&#8217;s Business Suite. It will also soon add the ability to create and save Facebook and Instagram posts as drafts from the Business Suite mobile app.</p>
<p>Related to the businesses updates, Facebook updated features across ad products focused on connecting businesses with customer leads, including Lead Ads, Call Ads, and Click to Messenger Lead Generations.</p>
<p>Facebook earlier this year announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-redesigns-pages-with-a-more-simplified-layout-and-no-like-button/">a new Facebook Page experience</a> that gave businesses the ability to engage on the social network with their business profile for things like posting, commenting and liking, and access to their own, dedicated News Feed. And it had removed the Like button in favor of focusing on Followers.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that Facebook is touting its tools for small businesses at a time when there&#8217;s concern &#8212; much of it loudly shouted by Facebook itself &#8212; that its platform could be less useful to small business owners in the near future, when ad targeting capabilities becomes less precise as users vote &#8216;no&#8217; when Facebook&#8217;s iOS app asks if it can track them.</p>
