										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> says it has blocked a distributed denial-of-service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">DDoS</a>) attack that peaked at just under 2 Tbps, making it one of the largest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The internet company <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack/">said in a blog post</a> that the attack was launched from approximately 15,000 bots running a variant of the original <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mirai/">Mirai code</a> on exploited Internet of Things (IoT) devices and unpatched GitLab instances.</p>
<p>The DDoS attack comes just two weeks after <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/11/01/gitlab-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2021-22205-exploited-in-the-wild/">Rapid7 warned of a GitLab vulnerability</a> — rated a full 10.0 on the CVSS severity scale — that could be exploited to allow an attacker to remotely run code, like botnet malware, on an affected server. Rapid7 found that at least half of the 60,000 internet-facing GitLab instances remain unpatched, and warned that it expected &#8220;exploitation to increase&#8221; as details of the bug became public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company wasn&#8217;t wrong; Cloudflare said it blocked the massive DDoS attack just one week later. From its analysis of the attack, Cloudflare believes that it was a multi-vector attack that combined both DNS amplification attacks along with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/">UDP floods</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare says the attack, which lasted less than a minute, was the largest it had witnessed to date. It comes just a month after Microsoft said it mitigated <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/business-as-usual-for-azure-customers-despite-24-tbps-ddos-attack/">a “record-breaking” 2.4 Tbps DDoS attack</a> targeting one of its Azure customers in Europe.</p>
<p>While Cloudflare mitigated the attack in seconds, it warns that it has witnessed multiple terabit-strong DDoS attacks last month, adding that this is unlikely a trend that’s going to slow down any time soon.</p>
<p>“Another key finding from our Q3 DDoS Trends report was that network-layer DDoS attacks actually increased by 44% quarter-over-quarter,” said Omer Yoachimik, product manager at Cloudflare. “While the fourth quarter is not over yet, we have, again, seen multiple terabit-strong attacks that targeted Cloudflare customers.”</p>
<p>Rapid7 has urged GitLab users to the latest version of GitLab as soon as possible. “In addition, ideally, GitLab should not be an internet-facing service,” the company added. “If you need to access your GitLab from the internet, consider placing it behind a VPN.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We noticed the kind of amazing content shared by people on Twitter who worked around the 280 character limit to express longer thoughts, but they were hard to find and even more difficult to read. We felt a desire to highlight these great stories and knowledge shared on the platform,&#8221; Threader wrote in <a href="https://threader.app/threader-has-joined-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Just last week, Twitter&#8217;s paid subscription product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a> launched in the U.S. and New Zealand, offering features that enhance the platform&#8217;s user experience. One of these features is a Reader mode, which functions similarly to the Threader app, showing a thread in a more unencumbered format. Twitter said that Threader co-founder Marie Denis helped build the Reader feature, though Twitter did not integrate any of the actual Threader product into its own tech stack.</p>
<p>The terms of the acquisition are not disclosed, but Denis will join Twitter&#8217;s Longform team, working on features like Reader and other similar products. Threader will shut down in 30 days as part of the acquisition, so if fans of the app want to retain the Threader reading experience, they&#8217;ll have to join Twitter Blue for $2.99 per month.</p>
<p>This is just one of several acquisitions that Twitter has made recently &#8212; its most major ones were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, a newsletter platform, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>, which laid the foundation for Twitter Spaces. Just last month, Twitter acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/twitter-acquires-group-chat-app-sphere/">Sphere</a>, a group chat app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do we care about one public company's planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper's demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former venture-backed startup Casper is going private in an all-cash transaction, it <a href="https://ir.casper.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management/default.aspx">announced</a> this morning. Since its early-2020 IPO, Casper has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/">struggled as a public concern</a>, seeing the majority of its value evaporate after its operating results failed to excite investors.</p>
<p>Casper will sell for $6.90 per share, or around a 94% &#8220;premium to the closing share price on November 12, 2021,&#8221; per its own mathematics. When it listed, Casper sold its stock for $10 per share, rising above $15 per share in its early life before falling as low as $3.18 per share more recently</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why do we care about one public company&#8217;s planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper&#8217;s demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms. And given that we&#8217;re seeing cash-hungry operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">like Sweetgreen</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway list</a>, it&#8217;s worth digging into what happened at Casper.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This is not to say that every direct-to-consumer (DTC) company is the same. Or even that Casper is entirely DTC; it isn&#8217;t. But we can learn from Casper all the same because it provides a living example of how a company can struggle post-IPO.</p>
<p>When we examine its results, it&#8217;s clear that cash was the issue and that the company&#8217;s share price likely prevented it from saving itself, while also providing an avenue for external rescue.</p>
<p>What the Casper saga means for DTC companies more broadly is nuanced, but we&#8217;ll take that on at the end. To the numbers!</p>
<h2>Why Casper had to sell</h2>
<p>Casper&#8217;s exit might feel like an inevitability in retrospect, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that the company enjoyed a brief return to pricing form earlier this year:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HPE has confirmed that a &#8220;limited subset&#8221; of customer data was taken in a data breach involving its subsidiary Aruba Networks, a maker of networking equipment.</p>
<p>The enterprise technology giant said in <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> that an unauthorized person used a private key to gain access to customer data stored in its Aruba Central cloud. HPE did not say how the hacker obtained the private key, but said the key allowed access to cloud servers in multiple regions where customer data was stored.</p>
<p>HPE bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for $3 billion in cash. Aruba provides networking gear, like wireless access points, and network security for companies. Through its dashboard, Aruba Central, companies can centrally monitor and manage their Wi-Fi networks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the Wi-Fi data collected in Aruba Central that HPE said was compromised. HPE said two data sets were exposed: one for network analytics containing information about devices accessing a customer&#8217;s Wi-Fi network, and a second data set containing location data about devices on the network. HPE did not give more details about the granularity of the exposed location data, but noted that the data &#8220;could allow the general vicinity of a user&#8217;s location to be determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the data included details about a device, such as a device&#8217;s MAC and IP address, device hostname and operating system and, in some cases, the username of the user accessing a Wi-Fi network. HPE said usernames are chosen by customers but could include a user&#8217;s name or an email address.</p>
<p>Worse, although the data was both scrambled and encrypted, the company said the private key had permission to use the decryption key; it wasn&#8217;t clear if the data was ultimately decrypted. HPE said it was likely only a &#8220;very small amount, if any&#8221; data was exfiltrated. The company added that it wasn&#8217;t clear which specific customers or what files were taken because the company does not keep logs of individual file access.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>, the hacker first used the key on October 9, but HPE did not detect the intrusion until November 2. HPE automatically purges data from its cloud servers every 30 days, so the amount of compromised data was limited to records dating back to September 10.</p>
<p>HPE said it was notifying customers of the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat has <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inked a deal</a> with Sony Music Entertainment to include its artists’ music in the app&#8217;s Sounds library. The company also revealed that it&#8217;s creating new AR music lenses. Soon, Snapchat will feature &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; with a pre-selected song embedded into the lens, a lens that transforms pictures of anyone to appear as if they are singing a song, and &#8220;Cameo Sound Lenses&#8221; that apply visual effects.</p>
<p>The company says that with more than 200 million users engaging with augmented reality on the platform every day, these new &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; will create a more immersive music experience for its users. Snapchat has been leveraging AR capabilities in several different ways over the past few years. Most recently, the app announced several updates to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>.</p>
<p>As for Snapchat’s partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, it comes at a time when access to unique sounds is becoming a competitive advantage for social apps. With this latest launch, Snapchat users will be able to include fully licensed Sony Music artists&#8217; music in their snaps and send them to other users or post them to Snapchat Spotlight.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new partnership comes two weeks after Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/snapchat-partners-with-nbcuniversal-to-give-users-access-to-more-audio-clips/">inked a deal with NBCUniversal</a> to give users access to licensed audio clips from various NBCU TV shows and movies. It’s worth noting that Snapchat also has partnerships with numerous studios and companies within the music industry, including Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, NMPA, Warner Chappell, Kobalt, BMG and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been looking to compete with TikTok, which has popularized short-form video sharing with posts set to music from a large catalog. For Snapchat, giving users access to different sounds is an important part of its efforts to compete with TikTok. Last year, the company launched Sounds, a music-powered feature that allows users to set their Snaps to music.</p>
<p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, says that since launching Sounds, videos created with music from Sounds have resulted in 521 million videos created and 31 billion views. But Sounds aren’t just used to help fuel Snap’s TikTok competitor. Since Sounds’ launch, nearly 45% of all Snapchat videos created with Sounds (across sends, posts and saves) were sent via direct message.</p>
<p>The new catalog of Sony Music Sounds will be made available to Snapchat users globally, across iOS and Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based software testing startup <a href="https://www.virtuoso.qa/">Virtuoso</a> has raised a $13.3 million Series A round led by <a href="http://paladincapgroup.com">Paladin Capital</a>. The round was joined by Mubadala Capital as well as existing UK investors Crane Venture Partners, Forward Partners, and Downing Ventures. </p>
<p>Virtuoso says its SaaS software testing platform, which launched in 2019, uses machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to “make testing simpler and faster” and claims that QA teams can identify software bugs and errors much faster than manual processes.</p>
<p>The software testing automation market is projected to grow from $12.6b in 2019 to $28.8b in 2024, according to Global Market Insights. Virtuoso says it aims to create fully autonomous testing with little to no human interaction, enabling non-coders and coders to write automated tests in plain English.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Adil Mohammed Founder and CEO of Virtuoso said: “The way software testing is currently being done is not fit for purpose. When done inefficiently, the QA and testing process can be a big barrier to growth. We want to change that.” Virtuoso plans to use the funding to expand its sales team, increase market share in the USA, and develop its product.</p>
<p>Ken Pentimonti, Principal and European Manager, Paladin Capital Group commented: “In the fragmented Software Testing Automation market, Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack, and its ease of use.”</p>
<p>Virtuoso competes with companies such as Mabel, Leapwork, Testim, ACCELQ, and Functionize.</p>
<p>Mohammed told TechCrunch over email: “ A lot of the companies offer human-driven solutions characterised by a high degree of manual testing and non-system-driven automation with little to no ML or RPA. Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack (execution and deployment speed), and ease of use.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tobii is bringing its eye-tracking tech to the iPad with TD Pilot, a case meant to turn Apple&#8217;s tablet into a powerful all-in-one tool for people with physical impairments. Equipped with TD Pilot, users can launch and use apps, type quickly, and speak with a synthetic voice using nothing but their gaze.</p>
<p>iPadOS 15 brought native integration of eye-tracking hardware to these popular devices, and Tobii is probably the most familiar name in that space. I&#8217;ve checked out plenty of their devices, both all-in-one slates and standalone peripherals for PCs, and they&#8217;ve always worked very well. But because of limitations on Apple&#8217;s side, eye-tracking has primarily been on Windows machines. I wouldn&#8217;t mind, myself, but some people prefer iOS and will now have the same access opportunity on that platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232532" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232532" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg" alt="Front and back view of the TD Pilot ipad case" width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg 4832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=1536,686 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=2048,915 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tobii</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TD Pilot is a large case that includes the eye-tracking gear up front (which is actually remarkably small — a little strip with cameras built in), and behind is not only a set of stereo speakers but a small screen for displaying text. So the device&#8217;s user can communicate via text or audio, sending either though Tobii&#8217;s own TD Talk text-to-speech app or another of their choice. (Not just speech — they can be the DJ too if they want.)</p>
<p>The device comes with access to the rest of Tobii&#8217;s little suite of apps as well for configuration, symbol-based communication and all the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is medically certified, and has been certified to meet Apple performance standards,&#8221; said Tobii Dynavox CEO Fredrik Reuben. &#8220;With that, users know that they can rely on market-leading technology that will continue to be updated and supported, and they can avoid insecure &#8216;one-time hacks&#8217; that may be developed for popular technologies.&#8221; This is no doubt a thinly veiled reference to other eye-tracking solutions for earlier versions of the OS that didn&#8217;t support the feature natively.</p>
<p>Tobii&#8217;s eye-tracking devices can be purchased by anyone, but they&#8217;re often, as the company explained, prescribed by a person&#8217;s doctor or therapist as part of a larger set of solutions catering to their individual needs. As such it is frequently covered by insurance, but of course your mileage may vary. I asked for a specific cost but Tobii did not provide one.</p>
<p>Hopefully for those who would be most empowered by an eye tracking solution, however, insurance or other methods will suffice to equip them with this useful gadget. It&#8217;s shipping today, so no need to wait.</p>

<p>The collaborative kicked off with 50 participating startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/voiceitt-lets-people-with-speech-impairments-use-voice-controlled-technology/">Voiceitt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/">Rendever</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/san-diegos-trust-will-raises-6-million-for-online-estate-planning/">Trust &amp; Will</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mighty-health-created-a-wellness-app-with-older-adults-top-of-mind/">Mighty Health</a>. Companies have the benefit of six testbeds to trial their products and will be able to bounce ideas off more than 10 investors and venture capitalists, top companies with a stake in the 50-plus community and service providers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Miller, AARP senior vice president of innovation and product development, told TechCrunch that while the spending power of those over 50 is already $8.3 trillion, that is <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2019/longevity-economy-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to triple in 30 years</a>.</p>
<p>Miller said the idea stemmed from AARP Innovation Labs, an accelerator he leads, which was attracting some 30 companies, but was not able to provide access to AARP’s membership. Instead, the organization began thinking of ways to give startups a path to scale, which included finding pilot opportunities and partnering with companies willing to test out products.</p>

<p>AARP was also getting calls from venture capital firms eager to get the organization&#8217;s take on a startup targeting the 50-plus market, as well as other accelerator programs.</p>
<p>“We felt there was this enormous need to bring together this ecosystem,” Miller said. “Within this demographic, 10,000 people turn 65 every day, and the oldest millennials are 10 years from turning 50. There is a financial incentive, but ours is socially good by allowing people to age better. We can leverage the power of AARP, the ultimate connector where we have a unique vantage point, with VC, corporate and startups. If anyone should win the age stack, it should be AARP. We want everyone to be successful.”</p>
<p>Other organizations are also playing into the age tech space, looking for the next best innovations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/28/aging-30tour/">Aging 2.0</a>, while startups continue to bring in funding for various products and services. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/health-tech-startup-bold-raises-7-million-in-seed-funding-for-senior-focused-fitness-programs/">Bold raised $7 million</a> earlier this year for its senior-focused fitness programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prior to the global pandemic, technology for older folks was a nice to have, but now is “an absolute necessity to live your best life,” he added. From having to scan QR codes to access a restaurant menu to telemedicine appointments with doctors, it required older people to be more comfortable with technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to those two areas, Miller sees innovations in categories like voice, which is what Voiceitt is working on with technology to decipher grunts and sounds that translate into turning on lights, and fintech with products like intergenerational financial planning.</p>
<p>Fintech is also one of the areas that Nigel Morris, managing partner of QED Investors, has been keeping his eye on.</p>
<p>There is a need to understand retirement options and figure out whether they will pass money to their children and that people are no longer retiring at 60 and going off to the beach, but would rather take advantage of the gig economy, he said.</p>
<p>QED invests in four age tech companies, including Freewill, software for managed giving, and True Link, which helps caregivers manage finances.</p>
<p>“Companies are thinking of this problem, and this is the time,” Morris added. “This population is not classically cool and is overlooked because many investors don’t understand the population. There is so much opportunity and AARP putting this together is great. Being a founding member is a feather in our cap.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monograph, a startup providing a cloud-based platform for architecture and design professionals to manage their projects, announced today that it has raised $20 million in its Series B funding round. New investor Tiger Global led the round, with participation from Tishman Speyer and existing investors Index Ventures and Homebrew Ventures.</p>
<p>The round brings Monograph’s total funding raised to $29.3 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/monograph-developer-of-project-and-cost-management-software-for-architects-raises-1-9-million/">since it was founded in 2019</a>. Monograph last raised in May 2021, bringing in $7.4 million for its Series A.</p>
<p>Three design technologists started the company &#8212; Robert Yuen, Moe Amaya and Alex Dixon &#8212; all of whom have a background in architecture. Its software helps architectural practices manage many different aspects of their operational systems, including timesheets, budgets, human resources and invoicing. $500 million worth of projects have been executed on the platform to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based company has grown to 33 employees after beginning 2021 with just eight, CEO and co-founder Robert Yuen told TechCrunch in an email. The new funding will be used to further grow the product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated growth among smaller design firms as the demand for new residential renovations and construction grows, Yuen wrote. As hiring in the industry picks up pace, Monograph is building a virtual community of professionals in the field through sharing content and job openings, on top of investing in its core software product.</p>
<p>Yuen highlighted Monograph’s budgeting solution, which allows project managers to view project-level finances in real time, as particularly unique given the industry’s reliance on spreadsheets. According to Yuen, the typical project manager who does not use Monograph would have to wait an average of one month to understand whether they were under or over budget on a project.</p>
<p>John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, was closely involved in the firm’s investment in Monograph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Monograph is built for architects by architects, which is why it excels at providing a solution to minimize the time spent managing a project,” Curtius said in an email to TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mprint, a one-year-old startup that offers branded payments and rewards products, today announced a $38 million Series A funding round co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Stripe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not every day that a leading fintech player and top-tier venture capital firm co-lead an investment. Notably, </span><a href="http://imprint.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imprint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also co-founded by a VC &#8212; Thrive Capital partner </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaurav Ahuja (chairman) along with Daragh Murphy (CEO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive Capital, Affirm, Allen &amp; Co., Late Show host James Corden, Lloyd Blankfein and unnamed CEOs of consumer brand companies also participated in the financing, which brings New York-based Imprint’s total raised since its 2020 inception to $53 million. The startup had previously raised about $15 million in seed money from Affirm and Thrive Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232832" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, all sorts of cards abound &#8212; from virtual cards to co-branded credit cards. Imprint aims to stand out in the increasingly crowded space by partnering with businesses to provide branded rewards cards for customers. Those cards work like debit cards in that a user doesn’t have to undergo a credit check or pay interest and fees, and as they spend, their balance draws down over time. At the same time, a customer has access to a “rich” reward program while a brand “can take ownership of how their customers pay and significantly reduce their cost to process payments,” the company claims. A brand also can benefit from increased retention, notes Murphy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really focused on the fact that all brands today have to pay an incredible amount of money for their top line revenue process of payment, and yet none of them get anything in return,” Murphy told TechCrunch. “But if you look back over the last 15 or 20 years one of the most valuable ways for you to get a customer to pay was with a branded card. It used to be credit cards, but we&#8217;ve kind of reinvented the model a little so it&#8217;s taken away the nastiness of the credit but giving brands the ability to really deepen the relationship with their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imprint, instead, saves a brand somewhere between 60% and 90% of the cost of the process of payment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An advantage for merchants, according to Imprint, is that they can use the money they save in payment processing costs toward funding rewards, which in turn theoretically will foster greater loyalty from their customers. For example, each time a customer uses the card with that particular brand, he or she will get a minimum of 5% back. And each time they use it toward a purchase at another brand, he or she will get 1% back. Imprint says it works with each brand to tailor their rewards program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ask the brand to give some of that value back to their customers and so in effect, brands get stickier customers for free, and customers get a much better, much more rewarding way to pay,” Murphy said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s commerce platform apps and APIs also will eventually give merchants a way to integrate their payment method at checkout or anywhere else on their site or in their app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Sperandio, corporate development lead at Stripe, believes that as consumers’ purchasing behavior continues to evolve, that it makes sense to offer them merchant-specific cards. Not only is Stripe investing in Imprint’s business, but its Issuing infrastructure is also powering its product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kleiner Perkins Partner Mamoon Hamid believes that Imprint is offering an “Apple Pay-like experience” for merchants and consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imprint is the first company that extends the incredible innovation in fintech to co-branded credit cards,” he wrote via email. “There is an enormous opportunity for modern brands to deliver customer value with new co-branded payments and rewards products, and Imprint is offering a rewarding way to pay without the traditional strings attached.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thrive Capital Partner and Imprint Chairman Ahuja said the startup can empower brands by cutting out the middlemen, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointing economic value</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally captured by legacy banks back to brands and their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This results in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">customers who are more loyal and higher spenders,” he said in a statement.</span></p>

It&#8217;s not yet clear how many there are or if they&#8217;re accessible to drivers, but the deployment at least includes Florida.</p>
<p>Tesla hasn&#8217;t commented on the rollout and is believe to have disbanded its PR team.</p>
<p>There are multiple possible uses for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-rectangular-terminal-satellite-internet-112330512.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1">Starlink broadband</a> at Superchargers. At the least, it could replace or supplement the existing connections that handle basics like payments and charger status. That could help the company deploy Superchargers faster and in more remote areas. That&#8217;s important when the brand hopes to allow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">charging for non-Tesla EVs</a> and triple the size of its station network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233969" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

You&#8217;re typically parked at a charger for long enough to watch some TV episodes — you could stream shows without a Premium Connectivity subscription or using your phone as a hotspot. Network congestion could be a problem if the chargers are busy, but it would be convenient and potentially sell customers on Starlink service at home.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since its seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four months after securing a $5.25 million seed round, Mexican buy now, pay later startup <a href="https://aplazo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aplazo</a> is back with an even bigger round to expand adoption of the payment plan approach across that country.</p>
<p>Angel Peña and Alex Wieland co-founded the company in 2020. Prior to Aplazo, Peña lived in New York and worked at Morgan Stanley investing in credit in Mexico, while Wieland had been launching businesses across Latin America after spending time at companies like Uber and Lime.</p>
<p>Aplazo plugs into a merchant’s payment process, online or offline, and enables users to purchase items and pay in five equal installments without needing a credit card.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That offline component, in particular, is what Peña says differentiates the company from competitors, as 95% of purchases are still made offline in Mexico. Typically, you need to have a credit card in order to take advantage of installments. However, credit penetration in Mexico is low, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/865822/credit-card-ownership-rate-age-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 10%</a>, due to lack of trust in the banking system, he added. The more popular payment methods are still cash or a <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/merchant-services/insights/reports/mexico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debit card</a>.</p>
<p>“That means 90% of people are unaddressed,” Peña told TechCrunch. “There is huge adoption for it, but the roadblocks are the banks who have been super profitable, but have not democratized installment credit.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/">Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Balancing risk: Modern architecture&#8217;s role in the BNPL playbook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/balancing-risk-modern-architectures-role-in-the-bnpl-playbook/embed/#?secret=qeJAjklt0t" data-secret="qeJAjklt0t" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The merchant is charged a fee to use the tool, but customers are not, and Alplazo takes on the risk of installment payments and chargebacks. The merchant then benefits from increased conversion rates and higher average order values, while also maintaining a consumer relationship.</p>
<p>Due to about 40% of the population not having a credit history, Aplazo uses alternative data, such as open banking and telecom data, to gauge consumers’ creditworthiness and level of affordability, optimizing approval rates and providing fair credit products to underserved consumers, Peña said.</p>
<p>Today, they announced $27 million in Series A investment led by Oak HC/FT, with participation from existing investors Kaszek and Picus Capital. This gives the company total funds of over $35 million.</p>
<p>Peña says the new funding was unexpected since the company had enough capital from its seed round. However, the opportunity provided the company a chance to accelerate its mission, which includes technology and product development and investing in merchant success. In addition, the company intends to double its 50-person team by February and launch in two additional countries in 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the seed round, Aplazo grew its total processing volume more than eight times and in less than a year has partnered with over 1,000 merchants that operate in lifestyle products like fashion, footwear and beauty. Peña estimates these categories represent some $70 billion in spending in both online and offline purchases.</p>
<p>Aplazo is the latest startup going after the BNPL space that has been dominated by companies like Afterpay, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/extra-crunch-roundup-square-buys-afterpay-paid-search-basics-career-advice-for-devs/">bought by Square</a> earlier this summer, Klarna and Affirm. There has been a lot of activity in the past year, between M&amp;A with Afterpay and companies like ShopBack, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/singapore-based-cashback-platform-shopback-acquires-bnpl-service-hoolah/">agreed to acquire Hoolah</a>, and funding rounds for BNPL companies. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/billie-a-buy-now-pay-later-specialist-for-the-b2b-market-raises-100m-on-a-640m-valuation/">Billie</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/nelo-joins-the-bnpl-rush-with-20m-in-new-funding-and-the-mexican-market-in-its-sights/">Nelo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/scalapay-raises-155m-at-a-700m-valuation-as-buy-now-pay-later-services-continue-to-boom/">Scalapay</a> raised recently.</p>
<p>“We have been fascinated by the global phenomenon that is buy now, pay later,” Allen Miller, principal at Oak HC/FT, said. “We wanted to make an investment in Latin America and thought that buy now, pay later would be an interesting entry point. The industry has the same appetite as the U.S., but is on steroids, and with the limited access to credit opportunity for buy now, pay later to be successful, Angel and Alex fit the mold.”</p>
<p>Miller expects the future of buy now, pay later in Latin America to be a bright one for a couple of reasons: one, fewer millennials are getting credit cards and are instead relying on debit cards. Two, merchants want to access a whole swath of people, but can’t due to the large amount of people who don’t have access to credit. Aplazo is building an infrastructure around both of those elements and “has been able to attract talent from best brands, and when we saw that momentum, that was exciting,” he added.</p>

<p>Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before we jump, I wanted to note that the <strong>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</strong> posted what appears to be the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y%252520%2525205-SEAT/SUV/RWD">first crash involving a Tesla</a> that had the FSD beta software engaged. As always, Tesla vehicles equipped with full self-driving (FSD) software are not self driving. What does this mean? Well, my expectation is that there will be more incidents like this and as a result NHTSA will be forced to act.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oh and I&#8217;ll be out in Los Angeles this coming week for a number of events, including CoMotion and the Los Angeles Auto Show. Stay tuned for our coverage throughout the week.</p>

<p><strong>Wheels</strong>, the shared micromobility operator with distinctive sit-down scooters, has partnered with <strong>UMass Boston</strong>, and soon, with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Free Now</strong>, the mobility app backed by BMW and Daimler, has officially integrated with <strong>Dott</strong>, allowing customers to <a href="https://www.realwire.com/releases/FREE-NOW-integrates-Dott-micro-mobility-services-into-its-app">book Dott&#8217;s e-scooters on the app</a>, and eventually, its e-bikes, too. The partnership will be available in the U.K., France, Italy, Poland and Germany, with more countries expected to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong> riders surveyed in Atlanta show that nearly half of all riders <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/nearly-half-bird-riders-atlanta-are-women-bike-lanes-have-helped/">identify as female</a>, which is a promising stat if we&#8217;re trying to close the gender gap in the micromobility world. In the same survey, 65% of respondents said protected bike lanes would encourage them to use more scooters.</p>
<p>In other Bird news, the company is launching its <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/mogo-bikeshare-integrates-with-bird-detroit/">public bikeshare integration</a> with MoGo in Detroit, a docked bikeshare service. Bird will now feature MoGo bikes in its app.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong> is <a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/tier-mobility-europes-largest-micro-mobility-operator-gets-all-charged-up-with-the-arrival-of-10-new-all-electric-man-etge-vans/">bringing 500 e-bikes</a> to the London Borough of Islington, boosting green transport options following the Ultra Low Emissions Zone expansion. The company has also just added 10 new all-electric MAN eTGE vans in London. The vans will be used to service Tier&#8217;s e-scooter fleet.</p>
<p><strong>Cabify</strong> has added a new business line to its multimodal repertoire. The <a href="https://twitter.com/cabify_espana/status/1458462709930987530?s=20">company is partnering</a> with <strong>Velca</strong>, a Spanish e-motorcycle brand, to provide users in Barcelona, Malaga, Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia with monthly rentals of electric motorcycles.</p>
<p>Back in July, <strong>BMW</strong> announced it would finally start producing its retro-futuristic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/bmw-is-finally-producing-its-retro-futuristic-ce-04-electric-scooter-but-at-12k-will-anyone-buy-it/">CE 04 electric motorbike</a>, a vehicle it has released multiple concepts around. Now, the automaker has entered into <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/09/bmw-begins-full-production-of-its-75-mph-ce-04-futuristic-electric-motorbike/">full series production</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Propella</strong>, the e-bike manufacturer, introduced its <a href="https://www.propella.bike/shop/ebikes/mini">Propella Mini bike</a>, its smallest and lightest model yet. Coming in at just 33 pounds and 59 inches long, the Mini has 20-inch wheels, a small frame and low-power electronics. It&#8217;s equipped with a 400W Bafang motor, which is good for mainly flat land riding. It can handle a slope of about 10% grade.</p>
<p>Anyone buying an e-bike or e-scooter, should be taking precautions, say fire departments and safety officials, after an increase in battery fires linked to micromobility devices. The <strong>New York Fire Department</strong> reported <a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/cities-report-ebike-fires-micromobility-safety/609516/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-11-10%20Smart%20Cities%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:37926%5D&amp;utm_term=Smart%20Cities%20Dive">78 fires linked to e-bikes</a> this year and their lithium-ion batteries that can get overheated and catch fire if they&#8217;re not charged or disposed of properly.</p>

<p>The <strong>Rivian</strong> IPO wasn&#8217;t just the deal of the week. I&#8217;m dubbing it deal of the year.</p>
<p>We all knew it was going to be big. Rivian&#8217;s IPO has been highly anticipated. Still, the reaction and willingness of investors to buy shares 37% higher than the listed price is simply bananas. Rivian shares were listed at $78 and its opening trade was $106.75.</p>
<p>The  company has a trickle of revenue and mounting losses due to the expense of ramping up production of its R1T and R1S vehicles and RCV, the electric commercial vans it is supplying to Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/rivian-expands-into-fleet-business-beyond-amazon-deal/">and maybe others</a>. That didn&#8217;t stop people from piling in and helping push Rivian&#8217;s value past $110 billion. (Closing share price on Friday was $129.95). Rivian now has a market cap beyond GM and Ford, two legacy automakers that actually produce and sell millions of vehicles each year.</p>
<p>Those niggling details like revenue didn&#8217;t dampen the mood. Even Amazon, which already held a 20% stake in the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/amazon-adds-to-its-rivian-stake/">bought even more shares</a>, per a Friday afternoon regulatory filing. Amazon now owns a total of 158,363,834 shares of Rivian, or about 22%.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been speculation about whether Ford, which owns about 12% of Rivian, will cash out. The automaker has made a hefty return on it investment already. Ford has made about $820 million in equity and bond investments in Rivian. Those shares, about 102 million according to filings, are now worth $13.15 billion.</p>
<p>What comes next? You better believe the attention on Rivian will be intense as it tries to meet production and delivery targets on the commercial delivery van for Amazon and its consumer products.</p>
<p>Rivian is supposed to deliver the first 10 vans (out of an order of 100,000) to Amazon in December. When there is a customer like Amazon to please, that deadline might be difficult to keep. I&#8217;ll be watching.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ample</strong>, a startup developing battery swapping technology for electric vehicles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ample-is-the-ev-battery-industrys-newest-unicorn/">raised $30 million</a> from The Blackstone Group and Spanish multinational financial services company Banco Santander.</p>
<p><strong>Applied Intuition</strong>, a company that sells software development tools to automotive engineers, has raised $175 million in a round led by Addition Capital, Coatue Management and serial entrepreneur Elad Gil, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/google-vets-raise-175-million-for-automotive-software-tools?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The Mountain View, California-based company has a post-funding valuation of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Blackshark.ai</strong>, the Austrian mapping startup, raised a $20 million round A to develop and scale its replica-Earth tech. The potential applications for a planetary &#8220;digital twin&#8221; are many and various, and the company has a head start even on mapping giants like Google, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blackshark-ai-digital-twin-of-earth-microsoft-funding/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Devin Coldewey wrote</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong>, the on-demand delivery giant acquired food delivery company <strong>Wolt</strong> in an all-stock deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/">valued at €7 billion</a>, or $8.1 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Embark Trucks</strong>, an autonomous vehicle company completed its SPAC merger and began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker EMBK. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/11/embark-ceo-sees-supply-chain-crisis-as-the-inflection-point-for-autonomous-trucking.html">CNBC profiled</a> its 26-year-old founder and CEO Alex Rodrigues.</p>
<p><strong>Gett</strong>, the ride-hailing company, reached a deal to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company with Rosecliff Acquisition Corp. I, a SPAC backed by the investment firm Rosecliff Venture Management LLC, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gett-nears-1-1-billion-spac-merger-to-go-public-11636498833">the WSJ reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>GoTo Group</strong>, the Indonesia-based startup borne out of a merger in May between ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, secured more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/">$1.3 billion</a> in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. The round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>, a startup that finances commercial electric vehicle operations and has plans to build, own and operate the corresponding charging infrastructure, came out of stealth with an initial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/ev-fleet-and-charging-infrastructure-startup-inspiration-comes-out-of-stealth-with-200m-and-revel-as-first-customer/">$200 million in investment</a>. The funding comes from ArcLight Capital Partners, a venture fund that invests in energy infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, one of the last privately held autonomous truck outfits in Silicon Valley, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">raised $125 million</a> in new capital. Notably, the lead investor is not listed and not being disclosed. I was told that a freight and logistics company set up a special interest financial vehicle as the strategic lead investor spot in the round.</p>
<p>Other investors include newcomers SIP Global Partners, Muirwoods Ventures, Harpoon Ventures, StepStone Group, Gopher Asset Management, Walleye Capital, Aliya Capital Partners and others. Existing investors Battery Ventures, CRV and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated. Bridgestone Americas and BMW i Ventures, which had announced strategic investments in Kodiak earlier this year, converted its funds to this round.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> sold its 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown, Ohio factory to Foxconn, the Taiwanese hardware manufacturing company best known for making Apple&#8217;s iPhone. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/foxconn-buys-lordstown-motors-ohio-factory-for-230m-plans-to-help-produce-endurance-electric-pickup/"> $230 million deal</a> is expected to close by the end of April next year, according to a statement from Lordstown.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong> and Hennessy Capital Investment Corp, a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, agreed to terminate their previously announced merger. The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108006149/en/Hennessy-Capital-Investment-Corp.-V-and-Plus-Mutually-Agree-to-Terminate-Business-Combination-Agreement">companies said</a> this was &#8220;in light of recent developments in the regulatory environment outside of the United States.&#8221; Plus, an autonomous vehicle company, said it is pursuing a potential restructuring of certain aspects of its business. Importantly, Plus&#8217; deal to supply Amazon with driver-assistant technology remains intact, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/plus-spac-merger-canceled-amazon-deal-rolls-along">Automotive News reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Point One Navigation</strong>, a startup that combines augmented Global Navigation Satellite System, computer vision and sensor fusion into an API to provide precise location for robotics, OEMs and AV developers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/point-one-navigation-raises-10m-to-bring-its-precise-location-tech-to-all-vehicles/">raised $10 million</a>. The Series A round was led by UP.Partners, with participation from existing investors including BOLT, IA Ventures and Ludlow Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMart</strong>, or Rabbit for short, came out of stealth with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/rabbit-a-20-minute-convenience-delivery-startup-in-egypt-comes-out-of-stealth-with-11m-pre-seed/">$11 million in pre-seed funding</a> amid a booming fast-delivery market in Africa. San Francisco-based Global Founders Capital, Raed Ventures, Foundation Venture, MSA Capital and Goodwater Capital participated in this pre-seed round.</p>
<p><strong>TriEye</strong>, the Israeli sensing startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/intel-samsung-and-porsche-among-investors-in-trieyes-74m-funding-round/">raised $74 million</a> in a round led by M&amp;G Investments and Varana Capital, with the participation of Samsung Ventures, Tawazun SDF, Deep Insight, Allied Group, and Discount Capital as well as existing investors Intel Capital, Porsche Ventures, Marius Nacht and Grove Ventures. The round brings TriEye&#8217;s total funding to $96 million.</p>
<p><strong>Upstream Security</strong>, the automotive cybersecurity technology company, received an undisclosed investment from BMW i Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>United States Postal Service</strong> narrowed its net losses by about half. The company reported a <a href="https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2021/1110-usps-reports-fiscal-year-2021-results.htm">net loss of $4.9 billion</a> for the 2021 budget year an improvement over last year&#8217;s losses of $9.17 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Zoomcar</strong>, the Bangalore-based car-sharing startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/zoomcar-raises-92-million-to-expand-its-car-rental-marketplace-to-new-markets/">raised $92 million</a> in a new financing round led by SternAegis Ventures. Zoomcar has raised $207 million to date.</p>

<p>I hear things, but I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share. Three quick items this week that are all about executive shuffling in the autonomous vehicle industry.</p>
<p>You might remember that <strong>Anthony Foxx</strong>, the Secretary of Transportation under President Barack Obama, joined <strong>Lyft</strong> as chief policy officer and senior adviser back in 2018.</p>
<p>Foxx is stepping down from the CPO gig, I learned recently. The new CPO will be Jeremy Bird, who is taking over in January. Bird joined Lyft in 2019 and was promoted to deputy CPO nearly a year ago.</p>
<p>Lyft did confirm this tidbit to me and said Foxx will stay on as a senior adviser. Here&#8217;s a statement from Foxx that was sent me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the right time for me. I worked hard to build the absolute best policy team in business. There&#8217;s really no other team like us. That&#8217;s really what I came to do, and I could not be more proud of our people or have more confidence in Lyft going forward. I can now feel good about transitioning the team while continuing to advise Lyft. Jeremy has been an instrumental part of this team and is a great leader in his own right. I&#8217;m thrilled to pass the torch to him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another departure that actually occurred months ago, but no one has reported on, is over at <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2018, Kodiak came out of stealth with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-40-million/">$40 million in funding</a> and an intriguing founder lineup. One co-founder was Don Burnette, who is CEO and a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry. Burnette, left the Google self-driving project engineer to co-found self-driving truck startup Otto in early 2016, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/anthony-levandowski-is-back-with-a-new-self-driving-startup-called-kache-ai/">Anthony Levandowski</a>, Lior Ron and Claire Delaunay. He left in March 2018, about a year after Uber bought Otto.</p>
<p>The other co-founder was <strong>Paz Eshel</strong>, former venture capitalist. Specifically, he had been a vice president at Battery Ventures, where he led the firm’s autonomous-vehicle investment project. Battery Ventures led Kodiak&#8217;s first round and Itzik Parnafes, a general partner at Battery Ventures, joined the Kodiak board.</p>
<p>I learned, and Burnette confirmed, that Eshel is no longer at the company. Burnette wouldn&#8217;t provide further details except to say that he departed earlier this summer. I reached out, but have not heard from Eshel.</p>
<p>And finally, it seems that <strong>Gretchen Effgen</strong>, a long time executive at <strong>Motional</strong>, is now at Google.</p>
<p>Effgen led partnerships and marketing at nuTonomy, the autonomous vehicle startup that was acquired by Aptiv in November 2018. This venture was spun out in 2020 as Motional, a $4 billion joint venture with Hyundai. Effgen joined Google as it director of global automotive partnerships, platforms and ecosystems this month, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>I want to touch briefly on the news regarding the <strong>$1.2 trillion infrastructure bill</strong> passed by Congress last Friday &#8212; briefly because, well, there&#8217;s tons already out there detailing in full what it includes and doesn&#8217;t include, what it means for roads, ports and the railway system.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation electrification, the big wins include:<br />
• $5 billion for zero-emission transit<br />
• $5 billion to expand EV chargers along highways, plus an additional $2.5 billion that could go toward EV charging or other types of alternative fuel, like hydrogen stations<br />
• $2.5 billion to electrify school buses</p>
<p>There are a few other interesting tidbits included in the bill that caught my eye as well, especially an &#8220;Advanced Impaired Driving Technology&#8221; provision. Essentially, this provision gives the <strong>National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration</strong> three years to evaluate anti-drunk driving auto tech and issue a new safety standard, which automakers will be required to incorporate into new vehicles two years after that.</p>
<p>NHTSA will no doubt be evaluating driver monitoring tech, including sensors outside the vehicle and even in-vehicle sensors that actually monitor the driver&#8217;s eyes and attention. It looks like many technologies that are already rolling out in vehicles today, like lane departure warnings, could be used for this purpose, and other companies are already starting to look into how their systems could be used to prevent drunk driving.</p>
<p>Also of note: NHTSA will receive around $110 million per year to conduct &#8220;behavioral research on Automated Systems and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and improving consumer responses to safety recalls.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Another bill was passed this week that could mean big things for everything from drones to eVTOL. That is the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1339">Advanced Air Mobility Coordination and Leadership Act</a>, which will establish an interagency working group within the Department of Transportation to &#8220;plan and coordinate efforts related to the safety, operations, infrastructure, physical security, cybersecurity, and Federal investment necessary for maturation of the AAM ecosystem&#8221; in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is a big deal! This goes far beyond the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s authority to certify aircraft, which is really one one piece of the puzzle to launching AAM technologies. This working group will make recommendations for all the other pieces in which the federal government plays a role, like safety requirements of future air traffic management systems; infrastructure, including utility infrastructure, to support the growth of AAM; and community acceptance of the tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress spending intentional time looking at infrastructure, looking at operations, looking at how all of these things can come to fruition and really benefit states in the communities that each of these Senators and Representatives serve is pretty big,&#8221; Ian Villa, COO of Whisper Aero, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The working group&#8217;s recommendations will also likely push conformity &#8212; which is good for end users and industry, Villa added. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way we can stand up a real system if the way that air taxis operate in Miami is different than the way [they] operate in California.&#8221;</p>
<p>The working group will be required to submit a report to Congress on their findings.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Gatik</strong>, autonomous delivery startup focused on the middle mile, pulled the safety operator from behind the wheel of two self-driving box trucks that operate in Walmart&#8217;s home turf of Bentonville, Arkansas. This means the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/gatik-driverless-deliveries-walmart/">startup&#8217;s box trucks are driverless</a> on a commercial route. TechCrunch actually reported about this in August, when the company first went fully driverless. Gatik revealed more details on this milestone, including that it has a chase vehicle for now.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> and <strong>Motional</strong> will launch their first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">fully driverless ride-hail service</a> in Las Vegas in 2023. The companies aim to be transporting public passengers — via Motional&#8217;s electric Hyundai IONIQ 5-based robotaxis and booked through the Lyft app — by the second half of next year. They will eventually scale up to a full commercial launch when Lyft is allowed to charge for rides in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Nvidia</strong> said that Hyperion 8 &#8212; a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development &#8212; is now available to buy for 2024 vehicle models. Hyperion 8 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/nvidias-next-generation-self-driving-toolkit-is-available-for-2024-vehicle-models/">is the latest iteration</a> of the end-to-end Nvidia Drive platform that automakers can use to customize to their likening and needs. This was revealed back in April. However, some details, including which companies are supplying the 12 cameras, nine radars and one lidar that are part of the platform, weren&#8217;t shared until this past week. Notably, <strong>Luminar</strong> is supplying the lidar, a potential boon for the newly public company. Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8.</p>
<p><strong>Plus</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company I cited up in the &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; section, announced a partnership with Aeva lidar. Aeva&#8217;s tech will be used in Plus&#8217;s first 100,000 trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Ouster</strong>, a lidar company, held its <a href="https://investors.ouster.com/news/news-details/2021/Ouster-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">Q3 earnings call last week</a>. Ouster said it is spending more on R&amp;D and scaling up a division focused just on automotive, another signal that lidar companies have to diversify their offerings to stay afloat.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GreenPower</strong> and <strong>Perrone Robotics</strong> are teaming up to produce the <a href="https://greenpowermotor.com/gp-products/av-star/">AV Star</a>. It&#8217;s a combination of GreenPower&#8217;s EV star, a mini electric bus, that will be fitted with Perrone&#8217;s TONY autonomous vehicle retrofit kit.</p>
<p><strong>Workhorse Group</strong>, the troubled electric vehicle startup, is struggling — and beyond its Q3 $81 million loss. Revenue is also in the negative to the tune of $576,600 because it had to issue refunds to customers who had their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/workhorse-reports-81m-loss-plans-to-redesign-c-1000-electric-cargo-van/">C-1000 cargo delivery vans</a> recalled due to safety issues. Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch also admitted that, aside from federal safety issues, the C-1000 just might not be up to the task of heavy duty deliveries. Yikes.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p>The <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> filed a lawsuit against ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/the-doj-is-suing-uber-over-claims-its-wait-time-fee-policy-discriminates-against-people-with-disabilities/">discriminates against passengers with disabilities</a>, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lawrence Burns</strong>, an author and former corporate vp of research &amp; development and planning at General Motors, is now an executive adviser of autonomous sensing platforms company Neural Propulsion Systems. Burns was a former adviser to Waymo.</p>
<p><strong>MotoRefi</strong>, the auto refinance platform, changed its name to Caribou. Along with the new branding and logo, Caribou recently combined its auto financing product with insurance. The company said it plans to announce specific details on insurance carrier plans in early 2022.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year, California&#8217;s supreme court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ruled</a> that Apple broke the law by failing to pay employees while they waited for mandatory bag and iPhone searches. Now, Apple has offered to pay $30 million to settle the suit and lawyers for the employees have urged them to accept it, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/11/13/apple-to-pay-30m-to-retail-employees-for-off-the-clock-bag-device-searches" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported. &#8220;This is a significant, non-reversionary settlement reached after nearly eight years of hard-fought litigation,&#8221; wrote plaintiff attorney Lee Shalov in the proposed settlement seen by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/apple-to-pay-30-million-to-employees-subjected-to-off-the-clock-searches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Courthouse News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Employees launched the suit way back in 2013, saying they weren&#8217;t paid while being searched for stolen merchandise or trade secrets. The workers felt they were still under Apple&#8217;s &#8220;control&#8221; during that five to 20 minute process and should therefore be compensated. Apple in turn argued that the employees could choose not to bring their bags or iPhones, thus avoiding a search in the first place.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Apple </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/FrlekinetalvAppleInc?1581671141" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">won</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an earlier battle in district court, but the case went to the California Supreme Court on appeal. There, the judges ruled that Apple workers were &#8220;clearly under Apple&#8217;s control while awaiting, and during, the exit searches.&#8221; The court dismissed Apple&#8217;s argument that bringing a bag to work was an employee convenience, particularly that Apple felt employees didn&#8217;t necessarily need to bring their iPhones to work.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Its characterization of the iPhone as unnecessary for its own employees is directly at odds with its description of the iPhone as an &#8216;integrated and integral&#8217; part of the lives of everyone else,&#8221; the judges wrote. In that statement, the court referenced a 2017 Tim Cook interview where he stated that the iPhone was &#8220;so so integrated and integral to our lives, you wouldn&#8217;t think about leaving home without it.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233961" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The settlement is still subject to approval by the plaintiffs. Nearly 12,000 current and former Apple Store employees in California involved in the lawsuit stand to receive a maximum payment of around $1,200.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For any company, organization, or even individual writer, maintaining a consistent voice is a constant challenge. <a href="https://writer.com">Writer</a> is a startup aiming to provide a solution with an intelligent integrated style guide that goes beyond mere error checking. Following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">$5M seed</a> last year, the company has now raised a $20M A round to continue growing and improving its service.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO May Habib says that writing is &#8220;the last unstructured business process,&#8221; which is perhaps a bit optimistic (sometimes I think every business process is unstructured) but nevertheless a cogent thesis on which to build a company. Writing is, after all, fundamentally a creative process, and it is only by systematically taming that process that writing is able to be used as a business tool. (Even now I am taming it: must&#8230; resist&#8230; using em dashes in every sentence&#8230;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to make sure that copy is clean and accurate, quite another to make sure that a dozen writers do not have clashing styles, use inaccurate or inappropriate phrases, and generally stick to a tone and style chosen by leadership. Of course there are style guides — even TechCrunch has one — but anyone who writes for a living knows how difficult it can be to stop and consult one when they&#8217;re in the zone.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232934" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Writer is meant to be a sort of style guide angel that sits on your shoulder and keeps your writing in line while you&#8217;re writing. It plugs into Chrome and Word, among other platforms, and instantly catches you out on everything from typos to company tone. Basically, Habib explained, you &#8220;take these 80, 90-page guidelines and turn it into a web app that becomes the single source of truth.&#8221; Notably this is all done without using a client company&#8217;s content as training data, so there&#8217;s no risk of HIPAA or security violations that way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233092" style="width: 944px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233092" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/writer-list1.gif" alt="A cursor selects a word from a style guide for more details." width="934" height="809" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2233092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Writer</p></div></p>
<p>That helps not just keep copy clean, but also make sure companies are taking action on things like, for example, inclusive language. A company may not have considered it worth formalizing in its style guide how to use gender-neutral language, or how to refer to various groups in the preferred manner, but it&#8217;s built into Writer if you want it — just check a few boxes and now all your company&#8217;s copy will be written more inclusively in line with recommendations from experts. There are other basic rules users can configure around common items like hyphenation, spacing, date and location formatting, serial commas, and so on.</p>
<p>But you knew all this, because you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/writer-pens-a-5m-seed-round-for-its-ai-style-guide-that-flags-bias-and-tone/">read all about Writer back in 2020</a>. So what&#8217;s new? Well, apart from the money, the company is growing fast. They&#8217;ve nearly doubled their staff, from 14 to 25 (still small, obviously, but growing fast) and have signed up a laundry list of high-profile customers: Twitter, Intuit, Pinterest, Accenture, Deloitte, and UnitedHealthcare among 150 or so more. The growing client list contributed to a tripled ARR over the last year. DAUs and MAUs and all those lovely metrics have risen steadily as well.</p>
<p>Confidence from happy customers has led the company to begin diversifying its service, branching out from correction and guidance into automation. Now, &#8220;automated&#8217; writing sounds pretty bad, but only if you are still clinging to that creative instinct. Writing is about effective communication, and in a professional context that means consistency. So things like text snippets, already widely used in the industry, can be included in a smarter, more easily deployed way.</p>
<p>The app now also supports multiple teams within an organization, so sales and editorial, for example, don&#8217;t have clashing definitions or recommendations. There&#8217;s also Figma integration now, a commonly requested feature now that style is being included as part of broader design systems at many companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The most intriguing feature is still a little ways down the roadmap: a more sophisticated language-aware AI system that understands context and content, akin to OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 but independently developed. How and why this was attempted will be worth investigating when more information is available.</p>
<p>But the applications are obvious: An app that&#8217;s aware of what you&#8217;re writing and the broader context can make suggestions that are based on hazier concepts like overall tone or intention. For example it might be able to tell that you&#8217;re attempting to state the company&#8217;s policy on refunds, and automatically suggest the approved standard copy for that. No need to go hunting around for the right snippet or consult the style guide. Or it could see that overall the piece uses more technical or jargon than is generally liked, and recommend reworkings of entire paragraphs in plainer language.</p>
<p>At any rate, the company is looking to continue expanding and staffing up, something $21M ought to help with. The round was led by Insight Partners, with a very long list of other participants: Gradient Ventures, the Todd &amp; Rahul Angel Fund, Scott Belsky, Oliver Jay, Jack Altman, Allison Pickens, Packy McCormick, Lenny Rachitsky, Austin Rief, Ankur Nagpal, Alex MacCaw, Camille Ricketts, Vivek Sodera, Julia Lipton, and James Beshara.</p>
<p>Keep an eye open for more news soon about Writer&#8217;s language AI ambitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola, a startup that aims to help global entrepreneurs form a U.S. business, has raised $3 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.doola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doola</a> actually started its life in 2020 as StartPack as a pivot from another startup called Standups. During that pivot process, the team realized that it didn’t want to go through the “complex and time-consuming” process of setting up the full-stack of software and accounts needed to get a business off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to focus on building product, talking to users and growing our new business, and we thought, ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what if we could click a button and initialize a company?’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Mahadevan. In September, the New York-based company built an MVP and got its first paying customer. It recently rebranded from StartPack to doola.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola’s mission is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support its customers through the incorporation process so they can “confidently collect payments, build credibility, stay legal and make more money,” said Mahadevan, a former growth product manager at Dropbox. Specifically, doola provides company formation, an EIN (employee identification number), a U.S. address and bank account, access to U.S. payments, a free tax consultation, U.S. tax support, a phone number and $50,000 in startup “perks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, hundreds of companies have formed LLCs with doola &#8212; even without a U.S. Social Security number. And the company is &#8220;growing profitably from a unit economics perspective,&#8221; according to Mahadevan.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233151" style="width: 2706px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233151" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2233151 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2696" height="1434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg 2696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,408 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,817 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2696px) 100vw, 2696px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233151" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> doola</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes doola stand out in the space, according to Mahadevan, is that it doesn’t just help a founder incorporate and leave them to fend for themselves.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not just a formation service, we’re a full-service fintech company,” he told TechCrunch. “Formation is our wedge to build the operating system for creators globally: from formation to financial to legal stack, by providing technical, educational and personal support every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if there are things that doola can’t provide in-house, it works with partners such as Amazon and Twilio to help, Mahadevan said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-venture-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexus Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led doola’s financing, which brings the company’s total raised to $3.6 million. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s summer 2020 batch and also counts as backers Hustle Fund, XX, Psion Capital and Translink Investment, as well as a high-profile group of angels, including </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-reses-938b7850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacqueline Reses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former head of Square Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dharmesh Shah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder and CTO at HubSpot; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankurnagpal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ankur Nagpal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder at Teachable and of Vibe Capital; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohinipandhi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rohini Pandhi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, product manager at Square and partner at Transparent Collective; </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asethi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arjun Sethi</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founder and investor at Tribe Capital; and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/myprasanna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prasanna Sankar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Rippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doola plans to use its new capital to scale its team. Besides Mahadevan and co-founder and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">JP Pincheira</span><b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doola has 14 employees. The capital will also go toward product and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nagpal noted that the creator economy is booming, with more than 50 million people becoming creators in the last decade &#8212; and those creators becoming businesses in the coming decade. He believes doola is poised to help such global businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“doola makes it incredibly easy for anyone, from anywhere in the world to set up a US-based LLC, get a US bank account, with access to all the payment products and financial services typically reserved for US-based businesses,” he wrote via email. “What intrigues me about this business however is not this initial beachhead of business formation, but the longer-term opportunity they have to handle all the unsexy business management pieces for creators and independent entrepreneurs around the world &#8212; including incorporation, banking, taxes and other critical pieces of infrastructure.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jishnu Bhattacharjee, managing director of Nexus Venture Partners, agrees. He joined doola&#8217;s board as part of the financing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Creators and independent entrepreneurs want to focus on their crafts that they love. However, to build businesses around their crafts, they would also need to take care of unexciting but necessary backend business management functions, for which they usually do not have expertise, nor interest, nor the time those activities demand,&#8221; he wrote via email. &#8220;doola is set to address just that: so solo-preneurs can do what they love and are best at, while doola takes care of the rest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoomo, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">Australian startup that builds e-bikes and offers micromobility subscriptions</a> to gig workers and couriers, wants to be the next disruptive electric vehicle company. The startup has just announced a $60 million Series B fundraise, money it aims to use to transform the way companies look at last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really see ourselves disrupting Rivian,&#8221; Mina Nada, CEO and co-founder of Zoomo, told TechCrunch. Rivian is an electric vehicle startup that&#8217;s building an electric SUV and an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">electric pickup truck</a> – it went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/">public last week at an implied valuation of $90 billion</a>. &#8220;We think that it doesn&#8217;t make sense for 90% of deliveries in the United States of two kilogram burgers to be done in 2-ton vehicles. And we really think that that&#8217;s going to change fundamentally to being Zoomo vehicles in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half of Zoomo&#8217;s $60 million funding comes from equity led by Grok Ventures, Skip Capital and ArcTern Ventures, and supported by AirTree Ventures, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Contrarian Ventures and Maniv Mobility. The equity, Nada says, will be invested directly into the platform, including software and a servicing network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The other half comes from asset-backed debt from Viola Group, which the startup will use to scale up its hardware into existing and new markets. The company already operates in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and has recently expanded into new cities in those markets, like Manchester, U.K. and Chicago, Illinois, as well as into Valencia in Spain, Paris in France and Stuttgart in Germany. The debt will allow Zoomo to pay a monthly subscription on its bikes rather than paying a large lump-sum upfront.</p>
<p>Many of Zoomo&#8217;s existing customers have asked the company to expand after being unable to find others to meet their needs in those markets, says Nada, so more cities are on the horizon for the startup.</p>
<p>Zoomo&#8217;s business is broken down into B2B and B2C elements. The startup offers fleets of electric bikes (and in some markets, mopeds), as well as fleet management software, to enterprise customers like Domino&#8217;s. It also deals directly with couriers, often through partnerships with gig worker platforms like DoorDash, that want a flexible, durable work vehicle at an affordable price. Zoomo offers gig workers a weekly subscription, which includes servicing, for anywhere from $20 per week to $49 per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are realizing we can&#8217;t hit zero emissions by continuing to just electrify vehicles, and right-sizing the form factor is a win for everybody,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;It&#8217;s more efficient, there are faster food deliveries with less congestion. Couriers can make more money because they can do more deliveries per hour, and customers are happier because the deliveries come more quickly. We really see micromobility disrupting the traditional four-wheeled space, and we are heavily focused right now on the fact that no micromobility company is doing a really good job for the logistics space, even though there&#8217;s some cool companies doing a good job in the consumer space.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoomo says its vehicles are built for couriers who have to ride eight hours per day, complete with big batteries that can carry a worker on late night slogs through the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safety is a really big feature for them, so is durability,&#8221; said Nada, whose pedigree includes Deliveroo, Bolt Bikes, Bain and Mobike. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got customers doing 50,000 kilometers per annum on a bike, so the requirements for delivery are really quite different to the consumer space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/axlehire-to-scale-tortoise-and-urb-e-zero-emissions-delivery-solutions-nationally/">URB-E</a> in the U.S. and <a href="http://velove.se/electric-cargo-bike">Velove</a> in Sweden are also trying to address the last-mile delivery space, but they&#8217;re more focused on container deliveries that can even accommodate middle-mile than food deliveries, which is where Zoomo specializes for now. That said, with this funding round, Zoomo wants to start developing light vehicles to address parcel delivery and other urban last-mile form factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, what this money allows us to do is to build the product muscle in our team to better research the needs of our customers,&#8221; said Nada. &#8220;We&#8217;re building the product team to now be able to do the customer research to make sure we&#8217;re replicating our success into new areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Direct-to-consumer deliveries are happening increasingly from microfulfilment centers as more shopping is done online. The best way to have faster delivery is to have those fulfilment centers closer to the customer and do deliveries on smaller form factors, like e-bikes, says Nada. But different customers will have different requirements that might require different form factors down the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is a company that&#8217;s going to be able to offer those different form factors to different customer types on top of our platform of software, servicing and financing,&#8221; said Nada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro and small businesses in emerging markets still struggle to access digital payments for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, most of them </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from various payment ecosystems globally due to their size, and two, getting hardware from providers can be expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-based fintech <a href="https://nomod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomod</a> allows these businesses to bypass the card terminal by providing a platform to accept card payments on their phone with no extra hardware. The company has raised $3.4 million in seed funding at a valuation of $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments will act as the company&#8217;s flywheel to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a merchant base and build out a financial operating system, founder and CEO <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/okassim">Omar Kassim</a> told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233595" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for the company is to provide merchants with access to accounts, cards, local payment networks and lending. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suite of services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is essential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the primary markets in which Nomod is aiming to build a significant merchant base, like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bangladesh</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Saudi Arabia, for instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 3% of more than 1 million registered businesses have access to bank credit. In the UAE, it can take </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six months to set up a business bank account. For Bangladesh, card POS hardware is pretty expensive for small and medium merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Nomod, merchants can start dealing with payments issues first as t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey can download Nomod on their phones and process in-person payments and payment links from their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can use different cards, from Visa and Mastercard to American Express and Union Pay, or go contactless via NFC and QR codes. The company also allows merchants to charge in over 135 currencies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A merchant today can install Nomod, sign up in three or four minutes and start processing in-person and online payments using payment links,&#8221; Kassim said in a call with TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233882" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233882" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2233882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?w=680" alt="Nomod" width="680" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg 1524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=768,730 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=680,646 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PhotoPictureResizer_211115_005952448_crop_1524x1448.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233882" class="wp-caption-text">Omar Kassim (Nomod CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nomod has focused its early acquisition on merchants in the MENA and GCC region, Kassim says the platform has a global reach and allows merchants to sign up from more than 40 countries across Europe, the U.S., Australia and Asia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim said the company is conducting tests with merchants in Nigeria and South Africa and expects to launch both markets in the near future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our thesis is that card acceptance is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> homogenous action. Whether you&#8217;re doing it in Australia or India, or wherever, it doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> matter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like we can do a lot of markets in parallel, and today, we allow merchants to sign up from 44 different countries to use our platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nomod can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and settle merchants in the U.S., the U.K and the UAE in their local currencies &#8212; dollars, pounds and dirhams, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in other markets where there is some currency fluctuation, say, in South Africa, Nomod applies some FX cost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassim says that once there is significant adoption in such markets, Nomod will optimize its platform for the merchants and begin acquiring and offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settlements in their local currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/nomod">YC bio</a>, Nomod describes itself as &#8220;Square minus the hardware&#8221; and Kassim believes the name is telling, particularly as to how payments have evolved since Stripe launched in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the founder, if the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$95 billion company were to launch newly, it would not need hardware</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his bias results from how payments work in emerging markets like the UAE, where most businesses carry out their fintech transactions using wallets or tokens</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The platform is one of Stripe&#8217;s <a href="https://stripe.com/partners/nomod">listed partners</a> to accept in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some platforms are seeing about 60-70% of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their online transactions coming from Apple Pay. And so what you&#8217;re finding is that consumers these days actively </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tokenizing [payments] onto their device.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Nomod, Kassim ran an e-commerce marketplace platform JadoPado and sold it to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Noon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Amazon competitor in the MENA region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then worked on some consulting gigs, and after noticing the wave of fintech and neobank activity that stormed the U.K., he started Nomod as a side project in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple app that allowed anyone with a Stripe account to make in-person payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running the product gave him two broad ideas on how he thought payments might look in the future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First was that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plastic cards get</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replaced by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital tokens or native wallets in consumer fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for fintechs targeting merchants, legacy hardware would give way to software-led solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a dominant mobile software solution for payments globally at the moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I almost feel like there&#8217;s an opportunity for us to build like a WhatsApp or Telegram </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">equivalent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for payment acceptance or face to face as well with things like payment links and subscription</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launching in March 2021, Nomod has acquired </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 4,500 merchants. According to the company, its total processed volume has grown 11.5x and is on an annualized run rate of $7 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which graduated from the recent Y Combinator summer batch, received investments led by Global Founders Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other VCs such as Kingsway Capital, Goodwater Capital, and angels from the Valley and globally, including a partner from DST Global, participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
