										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Northrop Grumman hit a new milestone in extending the life of active spacecraft as a purpose-built spacecraft, MEV-2, <a href="https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-and-intelsat-make-history-with-docking-of-second-mission-extension-vehicle-to-extend-life-of-satellite">docking with Intelsat&#8217;s IS-1002 satellite</a> to give it another 5 years of life. It&#8217;s a strong demonstration of the possibilities in a growing field of orbital servicing operations.</p>
<p>MEV-2 launched in August and matched the orbit of Intelsat&#8217;s 18-year-old satellite, which would have soon be due for decommissioning, having exceeded its original mission by some 5 years. But it&#8217;s precisely this type of situation that the new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/orbital-refueling-and-manufacturing-go-from-theory-to-reality-in-2021/"> &#8220;on-orbit service, assembly and manufacturing,&#8221; or OSAM,</a> industry intends to target, allowing such satellites to live longer — likely saving their operators millions.</p>
<p>In last night&#8217;s operation, the MEV-2 spacecraft slowly approached IS-1002 and docked with it, essentially adding itself as a spare engine with a full tank. It will stay attached this way for five years, after which it will move on to its next mission — another end-of-life satellite, probably. (I&#8217;ve asked for a few more details along these lines.)</p>
<p>Last year the MEV-1 mission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/in-space-satellite-servicing-proves-successful-in-record-breaking-orbital-spacecraft-operation/">performed a similar operation</a>, docking with Intelsat&#8217;s IS-901 and changing its orbit.</p>

<p>But in that case, the satellite was inactive and not in the correct orbit to return to service. MEV-1 therefore had a bit more latitude in how it approached the first part of the mission.</p>
<p>In the case of MEV-2, the IS-1002 satellite was in active use in its accustomed orbit, meaning the servicing spacecraft had to coordinate an approach that ran no risk of disrupting the target craft&#8217;s operations. Being able to service working satellites, of course, is a major step up from only working with dead ones.</p>
<p>And naturally the goal is to have spacecraft that could dock and refuel another satellite without hanging onto it for a few years, or service a malfunctioning part so that a craft that&#8217;s 99% functional can stay in orbit rather than be allowed to burn up. Startups like Orbit Fab aim to build and standardize the parts and ports needed to make this a reality, and Northrop Grumman is planning a robotic servicing mission for its next trick, expected to launch in 2024.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A month ago, Coupang arrived on Wall Street with a bang. The South Korean e-commerce giant — buoyed by $12 billion in 2020 revenue — raised $4.55 billion in its IPO and hit a valuation as high as $109 billion. It is <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/coupang-surges-to-over-100-billion-valuation-after-4-6-billion-ipo/articleshow/81455061.cms?from=mdr">the biggest</a> U.S. IPO of the year so far, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/15/rose-park-softbank-big-winners-in-coupang-ipo/?sh=3670106c4e24">the largest</a> from an Asian company since Alibaba’s.</p>
<p>But long before founder Bom Kim rang the bell, I knew him as a fellow founder on the hunt for a good idea. We stayed in touch as he formed his vision for what would become Coupang, and I built it alongside him as an investor and board member.</p>
<p>As a board member, I’ve observed a brief quiet period following the IPO. But now I want to share how exactly our paths intersected, largely because Bom exemplifies what founders should aspire to and should seek: big risks, dogged determination, and obsessive responsiveness to the market.</p>
<p>Bom fearlessly turned down an acquisition offer from then-market-leader Groupon, ferociously learned what he didn’t know, made a daring pivot even after becoming a billion-dollar company, and iteratively built a vision for end-to-end market dominance.</p>
<h2>Why I like talking to founders early</h2>
<p>In 2008, I met Bom while playing a weekend game of pickup basketball at Stuyvesant High School. We realized we had a mutual acquaintance through my recently-sold startup, Community Connect Inc. He told me about the magazine he had sold and his search for a next move. So we agreed to meet up for lunch and go over some of his ideas.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t remember any of those early ideas, probably because they weren’t very good. But I really liked Bom. Even as I was crapping on his ideas, I could tell he was sharp from how he processed my feedback. It was obvious he was super smart and definitely worth keeping in touch with, which we continued to do even after he relocated to go to HBS.</p>
<p>I soon began investing in and incubating businesses, starting mostly with my own capital. When I got a call from an executive recruiter working for a company in Chicago called Groupon — who told me they were at a $50 million run rate in only a few months — I became fascinated with their model and started talking to some of the investors, former employees, and merchants.</p>
<p>Inspired, and as a new parent, I decided to launch a similar daily-deal business for families: Instead of skydiving and go-kart racing, we offered deals on kids’ music classes and birthday party venues. While I was working on this idea, John Ason, an angel investor in Diapers.com, said I should meet with the founder and CEO Marc Lore. By the end of the meeting, Marc and I etched a partnership to launch DoodleDeals.com co-branded with Diapers.com. The first deal did over $70,000 — great start.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>All that time, I kept in touch with Bom. In February 2010, we were catching up over lunch at the Union Square Ippudo, and he asked if I had heard of Buywithme, a Boston-based Groupon clone. He hadn’t yet heard about Groupon, so I explained the business model and shared the numbers. He thought something similar might transfer well to South Korea, where he was born and his parents still lived.</p>
<p>This kind of conversation is exactly why I love working with founders early, even before the idea forms: You learn a lot about them as they explore, wrestle with uncertainty, and eventually build conviction on a business they plan to spend the next decade-plus building. Ultimately, success comes down to founders’ belief in themselves; when you develop the same belief in them as an investor, it is pretty magical. I was starting to really believe in Bom.</p>
<h2>The idea gets real — and moves fast</h2>

In short: a very dense population that’s incredibly online. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ben Sun</p></div></p>
<p>I told Bom he should drop out of business school and do this. He said, “You don’t think I can wait until I graduate?” I responded, “No way! It will be over by then!”</p>
<p>First-mover advantage is real in a business like this, and it didn’t take Bom long to see that. He raised a small $1.3 million seed round. I invested, joined the board. Because of my knowledge of the deals market and my entrepreneurial experience, Bom asked me to get hands-on in Korea — not at all typical for an investor or even a board member, but I think of myself as a builder and not just a backer, and this is how I wanted to operate as an investor.</p>
<p>Once he realized time was of the essence, Bom was heads down. For context, he was engaged to his longtime girlfriend, Nancy, who also went to Harvard undergrad and was a successful lawyer. Imagine telling your fiancée, “Honey, I am dropping out of business school, moving to Korea to start a company. I will be back for the wedding. Not sure if I will ever be coming back to the U.S.”</p>
<p>I emailed Bom, saying: “Bom — honestly as a friend. Enjoy your wedding. It is a real blessing that your fiancée is being so supportive of you doing this. Launching a site a few weeks before the wedding is going to be way too distracting and she won&#8217;t feel like your heart is in it. Launching a few weeks later is not going to make or break this business. Trust me.”</p>
<p>Bom didn’t listen. He launched Coupang in August 2010, two weeks before the wedding. He flew back to Boston, got married, and — running on basically no sleep — sneaked out for a 20-minute nap in the middle of his reception. Right after the wedding, he flew back to Seoul. Nancy has to be one of the most supportive and understanding partners I have ever seen. They are now married and have two kids.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin is making progress toward its goal of flying human astronauts aboard its spacecraft, with a plan to run an &#8220;astronaut rehearsal&#8221; during a launch it has planned for Wednesday, April 14. The launch of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard suborbital, reusable rocket will be a key step in verifying the vehicle for paying human passengers.</p>
<p>What does the rehearsal entail? Basically everything except for the actual spaceflight, including boarding and going through preflight operations, the returning to the capsule once it has landed and going through a staged version of an actual capsule exit post-mission. It&#8217;s what would happen during a Blue Origin launch with private astronauts on board, with the exception that the Blue Origin personnel standing in for those customers will get out of the capsule before actual engine ignition and launch, and then be transported to the capsule landing site where they&#8217;ll get back in and behave as though they&#8217;ve been there all along.</p>
<p>There will be one passenger on board the spacecraft during its actual flight: Mannequin Skywalker, a test dummy used by Blue Origin to measure data about what the launch would be like for people. Mannequin has flown previously, but this is the first time it&#8217;s playing a sort of human spaceflight relay with the simulation crew doing the ground operations rehearsal portions of the mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blue Origin launched its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/blue-origin-successfully-launches-and-lands-key-crew-capsule-test-in-first-mission-of-2021/">New Shepard rocket of 2021 back in January</a>, and that mission included a test of improved capsule cabin crew features, like better acoustics and temperature management system, and new display and communications equipment for the eventual crew. The company expects to begin flying people on board the rocket at some point this year, as of the most recently disclosed timelines.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s launch is set for a take-off time of 8 a.m. CDT (9 a.m. EDT/6 a.m. PDT), and will take place from the company&#8217;s launch site in West Texas. A live feed will kick off an hour ahead of the opening of the launch window, and Blue Origin also plans to include footage of the astronaut rehearsal activities, which will be the best look we&#8217;ve gotten yet at what its tourist flights might look like.</p>

<p>The New York-headquartered firm has led the $100 million Series D round in three-year-old social commerce startup DealShare, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Tiger Global declined to comment, and a founder of the Indian startup didn&#8217;t return an email sent on Sunday.</p>
<p>Indian news outlet <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/04/exclusive-tiger-global-set-to-lead-100-mn-round-in-dealshare/">Entrackr reported</a> Monday evening that DealShare was in talks to raise $70 million to $100 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.dealshare.in">DealShare</a> kickstarted its journey the day <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/walmart-confirms-16b-flipkart-investment-giving-it-77-in-indias-e-commerce-leader/">Walmart acquired Flipkart</a>, the startup’s founder and chief executive Vineet Rao said at a virtual conference late last year. Rao said that even as Amazon and Flipkart had been able to create a market for themselves in the urban Indian cities, much of the nation was still underserved. There was an opportunity for someone to jump in, he said.</p>
<p>The startup began as an e-commerce platform on WhatsApp, where it offered hundreds of products to consumers. It didn’t take long before a major consumer spending pattern was visible, Rao said. People were only interested in buying items that were selling at discounted rates, said Rao.</p>
<p>Over time, that idea has become part of DealShare’s core offering. Today it incentivizes consumers — by offering them discounts and cashbacks — to share deals on products with their friends. The startup, which has since launched its own app and website, now operates in over two dozen cities in India.</p>
<p>Consumers wanted products that were relevant to them and they wanted to buy these items at a price that instilled the most value for their bucks, said Rao. “We focused on locally produced items instead of national brands. Even today, 80% to 90% of items we sell are locally produced,” he said.</p>

<p>Amazon and Flipkart have captured less than 3% of the retail market in India, leaving room for firms to explore other models. Social commerce is one of the bets we&#8217;re seeing being played out in India. The other bet gaining traction is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/google-dotpe-india-27-5-million-investment/">digitizing neighborhood stores in the country</a> — without so much of the social element — that dot tens of thousands of towns, cities and villages in India.</p>
<p>The investment comes as Tiger Global looks to close <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">over two dozen deals in India this year</a>, TechCrunch reported on Monday. Tiger Global, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">closed a $6.7 billion fund</a>, last week led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">investments in social network ShareChat</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/messaging-platform-gupshup-raises-100-million-at-1-4-billion-valuation/">business messaging platform Gupshup</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">investment app Groww</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">participated in fintech app CRED’s round</a>, helping all of these startups attain the much sought-after unicorn status.</p>
<p>Meesho, the market leading social commerce in India, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/">turned a unicorn last week</a> after SoftBank led a $300 million round in the Indian firm, valuing it at $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>DealShare counts WestBridge, Falcon Edge Capital&#8217;s Alpha Wave, Z3Partners, and Omidyar Network among its investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WeRide, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup that recently raised $310 million, has received a permit to test driverless vehicles on public roads in San Jose, California. WeRide is the seventh company, following AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro Waymo and Zoox, to receive a driverless testing permit.</p>
<p>In the early days of autonomous vehicle development, testing permits required human safety drivers behind the wheel. Some 56 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver. Driverless testing permits, in which a human operator is not behind the wheel, have become the new milestone and a required step for companies that want to launch a commercial robotaxi or delivery service in the state.</p>
<p>The California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing in the state, said the permit allows WeRide to test two autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within San Jose. WeRide has had a permit to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel since 2017. WeRide is also restricted to how and when it tests these vehicles. The driverless vehicles are designed to operate on roads with posted speed limits not exceeding 45 miles per hour. Testing will be conducted during the day Monday through Friday, but will not occur in heavy fog or rain, according to the DMV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To reach driverless testing status in California, companies have to meet a number of safety, registration and insurance requirements. Any company applying for a driverless permit must provide evidence of insurance or a bond equal to $5 million, verify vehicles are capable of operating without a driver, meet federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or have an exemption from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and be an SAE Level 4 or 5 vehicle. The test vehicles must be continuously monitored and train remote operators on the technology.</p>
<p>Driverless testing permit holders must also report to the DMV any collisions involving a driverless test vehicle within 10 days and submit an annual report of disengagements.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of WeRide&#8217;s operations are in China, the permit does signal its continued interest in the United States. WeRide, which is headquartered in Guangzhou, China, maintains R&amp;D and operation centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Zhengzhou and Anqing, as well as in Silicon Valley. The startup, which was founded in 2017, received a permit in February to operate a <span class="il">ride</span>-hailing operation in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The company is one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/weride-200-million-funding/">China’s most-funded autonomous vehicle technology startups</a> with backers that include bus maker Yutong, Chinese facial recognition company SenseTime and Alliance Ventures, the strategic venture capital arm of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Other WeRide investors include CMC Capital Partners, CDB Equipment Manufacturing Fund, Hengjian Emerging Industries Fund, Zhuhai Huajin Capital, Flower City Ventures and Tryin Capital. Qiming Venture Partners, Sinovation Ventures and Kinzon Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A collection of tech and auto industry executives met with the White House to discuss solutions for the worldwide chip shortage Monday.</p>
<p>CEOs from Google, Intel, HP, Dell, Ford and General Motors attended the virtual summit on semiconductors and resilience in supply chains. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese hosted the meeting, which President Biden also attended briefly.</p>
<p>Ahead of the summit, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he hoped the U.S. could increase its semiconductor production to encompass a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/intel-ceo-hopes-us-can-reclaim-one-third-of-chip-manufacturing.html">third of all chips sold in the U.S</a>. Intel is in discussions to make chips designed specifically for automakers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors/intel-in-talks-to-produce-chips-for-automakers-within-six-to-nine-months-ceo-idUSKBN2BZ2C4?il=0">within its own facilities</a>, a project that could take some pressure off of supply lines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An ongoing dearth of the tiny, high-tech components used in everything from car entertainment systems to smartphones has stretched supply thin. Consumers have been feeling it for months. Soaring demand has made new gaming consoles and graphics cards scarce, even months after some of those devices are released. But with semiconductors omnipresent in devices these days, the supply shortages are disrupting industries well beyond gaming.</p>
<p>President Biden signed an executive order taking aim at the supply issues in February. That order initiated a 100-day review of supply chains for semiconductors as well as advanced batteries like those found in electric vehicles, key minerals required for tech products, and pharmaceuticals and their ingredients.</p>
<p>Biden noted that the chip shortages have &#8220;caused delays in productions of automobiles and has resulted in reduced hours for American workers.&#8221; He also cited supply shortages for PPE during the early months of the pandemic, when many health workers were forced to work without proper protection.</p>
<p>The order also kicks off a longer review in cooperation with industry leaders that will look for solutions that can be implemented right away to alleviate ongoing supply chain issues.</p>
<p>Supply chain issues for tech components also highlight tensions with China, a fact that Sullivan&#8217;s presence at the White House summit makes clear. Biden cited concerns around &#8220;long-term competitiveness&#8221; as one motivation for undergoing a major audit of supply chains for critical tech components.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has called the shortage &#8220;a national security issue as well as an economic one,&#8221; citing the need for semiconductors in defense tech.</p>
<p>Warner has emphasized the need for legislative solutions that would move the U.S. toward self-reliance and push back on China&#8217;s influence, pointing to a <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/6/bipartisan-bicameral-bill-will-help-bring-production-of-semiconductors-critical-to-national-security-back-to-u-s">semiconductor production bill</a> he introduced with Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) last summer.</p>
<p>Biden previously said that the administration will work toward solutions to the current shortfall of the critical chips and will be leaning on political allies &#8220;to ramp up production to help us resolve the bottlenecks we face now.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After it looked like Apple might no-show, the company has committed to sending a representative to a Senate antitrust hearing on app store competition later this month.</p>
<p>Last week, Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) put public pressure on the company to attend the hearing, which will be held by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights. Klobuchar chairs that subcommittee and has turned her focus toward antitrust worries about the tech industry&#8217;s most dominant players.</p>
<p>The hearing, which Google will also attend, will delve into Apple and Google&#8217;s control over &#8220;the cost, distribution, and availability of mobile applications on consumers, app developers, and competition.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>App stores are one corner of tech that looks the most like a duopoly, a perception that Apple&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/judge-rules-that-apple-can-ban-fortnite-but-cant-terminate-epics-unreal-developer-accounts/"> high-profile battle with Fortnite-maker Epic</a> is only elevating. Meanwhile, with a number of state-level tech regulation efforts brewing, Arizona is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-next-big-tech-fights-are-in-state-capitals-11615714201?mod=djemalertNEWS">looking to relieve developers</a> from Apple and Google&#8217;s hefty cut of app store profits.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VjmjFfdCiC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">Apple&#8217;s App Store commission structure called into question in antitrust hearing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Store commission structure called into question in antitrust hearing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/embed/#?secret=VjmjFfdCiC" data-secret="VjmjFfdCiC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a letter last week, Klobuchar and Lee, the subcommittee&#8217;s ranking member, accused Apple of &#8220;abruptly&#8221; deciding that it wouldn&#8217;t send a witness to the hearing, which is set for April 21.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>By Monday, that pressure had apparently done its work, with Apple agreeing to attend the hearing. Apple didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>While the lawmakers are counting Apple&#8217;s acquiescence as a win, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll be sending their chief executive. Major tech CEOs have been called before Congress more often over the last few years, but those appearances might have diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Tech CEOs, Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook included, are thoroughly trained in the art of saying little when pressed by lawmakers. Dragging in a CEO might work as a show of force, but tech execs generally reveal little over the course of their lengthy testimonies, particularly when a hearing isn&#8217;t <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf?utm_campaign=4493-519">accompanied by a deeper investigation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the earliest stages of building a startup, it can be hard to justify focusing on anything other than creating a great product or service and meeting the needs of customers or users. However, there are still a number of surefire measures that any early-stage company can and <em>should</em> put in place to achieve &#8220;people ops&#8221; success as they begin scaling, according to venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/atomico-v/">Atomico</a>&#8216;s talent partners, Caro Chayot and Dan Hynes.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You need to recruit for what you need, but you also need to think about what is coming down the line.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As members of the VC&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/05/more-atomico-promotions-sees-three-new-partners-at-the-european-vc-firm/">operational support team</a>, both work closely with companies in the Atomico portfolio to &#8220;find, develop and retain&#8221; the best employees in their respective fields, at various stages of the business. They&#8217;re operators at heart, and they bring a wealth of experience from time spent prior to entering VC.</p>
<p>Before joining Atomico, Chayot led the EMEA HR team at Twitter, where she helped scale the business from two to six markets and grew the team from 80 based in London to 500 across the region. Prior to that, she worked at Google in people ops for nine years.</p>
<p>Hynes was responsible for talent and staffing at well-known technology companies including Google, Cisco and Skype. At Google, he grew the EMEA team from 60 based in London to 8,500 across Europe by 2010, and at Skype, he led a talent team that scaled from 600 to 2,300 in three years.</p>
<h2>Caro Chayot&#8217;s top 3 tips</h2>
<h3>1. Think about your long-term org design (18 months down the line) and hire back from there</h3>
<p>When most founders think about hiring, they think about what they need <em>now</em> and the gaps that exist in their team at that moment. Dan and I help founders see things a little differently. You need to recruit for what you need, but you also need to think about what is coming down the line. What will your company look like in a year or 18 months? Functions and team sizes will depend on the sector &#8212; whether you are building a marketplace, a SaaS business or a consumer company. Founders also need to think about how the employees they hire now can develop over the next 18 months. If you hire people who are at the top of their game now, they won’t be able to grow into the employees you need in the future.</p>
<h3>2. Spend time defining what your culture is. Use that for hiring and everything else people-related</h3>
<p>If org design is the “what,” then culture is the “how.” It’s about laying down values and principles. It may sound fluffy, but capturing what it means to work at your company is key to hiring and retaining the best talent. You can use clearly articulated values at every stage of talent-building to shape your employer brand. What do you want potential employees to feel when they see your website? What do you want to look for in the interview process to make sure you are hiring people who are additive to the culture? How do you develop people and compensate them? These are all expressions of culture.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You hear so much about <em>data</em> these days that you might forget that a huge amount of the world runs on <em>documents</em>: a veritable menagerie of heterogeneous files and formats holding enormous value yet incompatible with the new era of clean, structured databases. <a href="https://www.docugami.com/">Docugami</a> plans to change that with a system that intuitively understands any set of documents and intelligently indexes their contents — and NASA is already on board.</p>

<p>If Docugami&#8217;s product works as planned, anyone will be able to take piles of documents accumulated over the years and near-instantly convert them to the kind of data that&#8217;s actually useful to people.</p>
<p>Because it turns out that running just about any business ends up producing a ton of documents. Contracts and briefs in legal work, leases and agreements in real estate, proposals and releases in marketing, medical charts, etc, etc. Not to mention the various formats: Word docs, PDFs, scans of paper printouts of PDFs exported from Word docs, and so on.</p>
<p>Over the last decade there&#8217;s been an effort to corral this problem, but movement has largely been on the organizational side: put all your documents in one place, share and edit them collaboratively. Understanding the document itself has pretty much been left to the people who handle them, and for good reason — understanding documents is hard!</p>

<p>Think of a rental contract. We humans understand when the renter is named as Jill Jackson, that later on, &#8220;the renter&#8221; also refers to that person. Furthermore, in any of a hundred other contracts, we understand that the renters in those documents are the same <em>type</em> of person or concept in the context of the document, but not the same <em>actual</em> person. These are surprisingly difficult concepts for machine learning and natural language understanding systems to grasp and apply. Yet if they could be mastered, an enormous amount of useful information could be extracted from the millions of documents squirreled away around the world.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s up, .docx?</h2>
<p>Docugami founder Jean Paoli says they&#8217;ve cracked the problem wide open, and while it&#8217;s a major claim, he&#8217;s one of few people who could credibly make it. Paoli was a major figure at Microsoft for decades, and among other things helped create the XML format — you know all those files that end in x, like .docx and .xlsx? Paoli is at least partly to thank for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data and documents aren&#8217;t the same thing,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a thing <em>you</em> understand, called documents, and there&#8217;s something that <em>computers</em> understand, called data. Why are they not the same thing? So my first job [at Microsoft] was to create a format that can represent documents as data. I created XML with friends in the industry, and Bill accepted it.&#8221; (Yes, that Bill.)</p>
<p>The formats became ubiquitous, yet 20 years later the same problem persists, having grown in scale with the digitization of industry after industry. But for Paoli the solution is the same. At the core of XML was the idea that a document should be structured almost like a webpage: boxes within boxes, each clearly defined by metadata — a <em>hierarchical</em> model more easily understood by computers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few years ago I drank the AI kool-aid, got the idea to transform documents into data. I needed an algorithm that navigates the hierarchical model, and they told me that the algorithm you want does not exist,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The XML model, where every piece is inside another, and each has a different name to represent the data it contains — that has not been married to the AI model we have today. That&#8217;s just a fact. I hoped the AI people would go and jump on it, but it didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221; (&#8220;I was busy doing something else,&#8221; he added, to excuse himself.)</p>
<p>The lack of compatibility with this new model of computing shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise — every emerging technology carries with it certain assumptions and limitations, and AI has focused on a few other, equally crucial areas like speech understanding and computer vision. The approach taken there doesn&#8217;t match the needs of systematically understanding a document.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people think that documents are like cats. You train the AI to look for their eyes, for their tails … documents are not like cats,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It sounds obvious, but it&#8217;s a real limitation. Advanced AI methods like segmentation, scene understanding, multimodal context, and such are all a sort of hyperadvanced cat detection that has moved beyond cats to detect dogs, car types, facial expressions, locations, etc. Documents are too different from one another, or in other ways too similar, for these approaches to do much more than roughly categorize them.</p>
<p>As for language understanding, it&#8217;s good in some ways but not in the ways Paoli needed. &#8220;They&#8217;re working sort of at the English language level,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They look at the text but they disconnect it from the document where they found it. I love NLP people, half my team is NLP people — but NLP people don&#8217;t think about business processes. You need to mix them with XML people, people who understand computer vision, then you start looking at the document at a different level.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Docugami in action</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2137221" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137221" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2137221" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png" alt="Illustration showing a person interacting with a digital document." width="1024" height="697" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png 1254w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png?resize=768,522 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/docugami-3.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137221" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Docugami</p></div></p>
<p>Paoli&#8217;s goal couldn&#8217;t be reached by adapting existing tools (beyond mature primitives like optical character recognition), so he assembled his own private AI lab, where a multidisciplinary team has been tinkering away for about two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did core science, self-funded, in stealth mode, and we sent a bunch of patents to the patent office,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we went to see the VCs, and Signalfire basically volunteered to lead the seed round at $10 million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coverage of the round didn&#8217;t really get into the actual experience of using Docugami, but Paoli walked me through the platform with some live documents. I wasn&#8217;t given access myself and the company wouldn&#8217;t provide screenshots or video, saying it is still working on the integrations and UI, so you&#8217;ll have to use your imagination … but if you picture pretty much any enterprise SaaS service, you&#8217;re 90% of the way there.</p>
<p>As the user, you upload any number of documents to Docugami, from a couple dozen to hundreds or thousands. These enter a machine understanding workflow that parses the documents, whether they&#8217;re scanned PDFs, Word files, or something else, into an XML-esque hierarchical organization unique to the contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say you&#8217;ve got 500 documents, we try to categorize it in document sets, these 30 look the same, those 20 look the same, those five together. We group them with a mix of hints coming from how the document looked, what it&#8217;s talking about, what we think people are using it for, etc.,&#8221; said Paoli. Other services might be able to tell the difference between a lease and an NDA, but documents are too diverse to slot into pre-trained ideas of categories and expect it to work out. Every set of documents is potentially unique, and so Docugami trains itself anew every time, even for a set of one. &#8220;Once we group them, we understand the overall structure and hierarchy of that particular set of documents, because that&#8217;s how documents become useful: together.&#8221;</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t just mean it picks up on header text and creates an index, or lets you search for words. The data that is in the document, for example who is paying whom, how much and when, and under what conditions, all that becomes structured and editable within the context of similar documents. (It asks for a little input to double check what it has deduced.)</p>
<p>It can be a little hard to picture, but now just imagine that you want to put together a report on your company&#8217;s active loans. All you need to do is highlight the information that&#8217;s important to you in an example document — literally, you just click &#8220;Jane Roe&#8221; and &#8220;$20,000&#8221; and &#8220;five years&#8221; anywhere they occur — and then select the other documents you want to pull corresponding information from. A few seconds later you have an ordered spreadsheet with names, amounts, dates, anything you wanted out of that set of documents.</p>
<p>All this data is meant to be portable too, of course — there are integrations planned with various other common pipes and services in business, allowing for automatic reports, alerts if certain conditions are reached, automated creation of templates and standard documents (no more keeping an old one around with underscores where the principals go).</p>

<p>Remember, this is all half an hour after you uploaded them in the first place, no labeling or pre-processing or cleaning required. And the AI isn&#8217;t working from some preconceived notion or format of what a lease document looks like. It&#8217;s learned all it needs to know from the actual docs you uploaded — how they&#8217;re structured, where things like names and dates figure relative to one another, and so on. And it works across verticals and uses an interface anyone can figure out a few minutes. Whether you&#8217;re in healthcare data entry or construction contract management, the tool should make sense.</p>
<p>The web interface where you ingest and create new documents is one of the main tools, while the other lives inside Word. There Docugami acts as a sort of assistant that&#8217;s fully aware of every other document of whatever type you&#8217;re in, so you can create new ones, fill in standard information, comply with regulations and so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so processing legal documents isn&#8217;t exactly the most exciting application of machine learning in the world. But I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this (at all, let alone at this length) if I didn&#8217;t think this was a big deal. This sort of deep understanding of document types can be found here and there among established industries with standard document types (such as police or medical reports), but have fun waiting until someone trains a bespoke model for your kayak rental service. But small businesses have just as much value locked up in documents as large enterprises — and they can&#8217;t afford to hire a team of data scientists. And even the big organizations can&#8217;t do it all manually.</p>
<h2>NASA&#8217;s treasure trove</h2>

<p>The problem is extremely difficult, yet to humans seems almost trivial. You or I could glance through 20 similar documents and a list of names and amounts easily, perhaps even in less time than it takes for Docugami to crawl them and train itself.</p>
<p>But AI, after all, is meant to imitate and transcend human capacity, and it&#8217;s one thing for an account manager to do monthly reports on 20 contracts — quite another to do a daily report on a thousand. Yet Docugami accomplishes the latter and former equally easily — which is where it fits into both the enterprise system, where scaling this kind of operation is crucial, and to NASA, which is buried under a backlog of documentation from which it hopes to glean clean data and insights.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing NASA&#8217;s got a lot of, it&#8217;s documents. Its reasonably well-maintained archives go back to its founding, and many important ones are available by various means — I&#8217;ve spent many a pleasant hour <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/tindex.html">perusing its cache of historical documents</a>.</p>
<p>But NASA isn&#8217;t looking for new insights into <a href="https://www.history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/a11-documents.html">Apollo 11</a>. Through its many past and present programs, solicitations, grant programs, budgets, and of course engineering projects, it generates a huge amount of documents — being, after all, very much a part of the federal bureaucracy. And as with any large organization with its paperwork spread over decades, NASA&#8217;s document stash represents untapped potential.</p>
<p>Expert opinions, research precursors, engineering solutions, and a dozen more categories of important information are sitting in files searchable perhaps by basic word matching but otherwise unstructured. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice for someone at JPL to get it in their head to look at the evolution of nozzle design, and within a few minutes have a complete and current list of documents on that topic, organized by type, date, author and status? What about the patent advisor who needs to provide a NIAC grant recipient information on prior art — shouldn&#8217;t they be able to pull those old patents and applications up with more specificity than any with a given keyword?</p>

<p>The NASA SBIR grant, awarded last summer, isn&#8217;t for any specific work, like collecting all the documents of such and such a type from Johnson Space Center or something. It&#8217;s an exploratory or investigative agreement, as many of these grants are, and Docugami is working with NASA scientists on the best ways to apply the technology to their archives. (One of the best applications may be to the SBIR and other small business funding programs themselves.)</p>
<p>Another SBIR grant with the NSF differs in that, while at NASA the team is looking into better organizing tons of disparate types of documents with some overlapping information, at NSF they&#8217;re aiming to better identify &#8220;small data.&#8221; &#8220;We are looking at the tiny things, the tiny details,&#8221; said Paoli. &#8220;For instance, if you have a name, is it the lender or the borrower? The doctor or the patient name? When you read a patient record, penicillin is mentioned, is it prescribed or prohibited? If there&#8217;s a section called allergies and another called prescriptions, we can make that connection.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m French&#8221;</h2>
<p>When I pointed out the rather small budgets involved with SBIR grants and how his company couldn&#8217;t possibly survive on these, he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not running on grants! This isn&#8217;t our business. For me, this is a way to work with scientists, with the best labs in the world,&#8221; he said, while noting many more grant projects were in the offing. &#8220;Science for me is a fuel. The business model is very simple — a service that you subscribe to, like Docusign or Dropbox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is only just now beginning its real business operations, having made a few connections with integration partners and testers. But over the next year it will expand its private beta and eventually open it up — though there&#8217;s no timeline on that just yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very young. A year ago we were like five, six people, now we went and got this $10 million seed round and boom,&#8221; said Paoli. But he&#8217;s certain that this is a business that will be not just lucrative but will represent an important change in how companies work.</p>
<p>&#8220;People love documents. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m French,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I think text and books and writing are critical — that&#8217;s just how humans work. We really think people can help machines think better, and machines can help people think better.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As artificial intelligence becomes more advanced, previously cutting-edge — but generic — AI models are becoming commonplace, such as Google Cloud’s<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/"> Vision AI</a> or<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;blog-cards.sort-order=desc"> Amazon Rekognition</a>.</p>
<p>While effective in some use cases, these solutions do not suit industry-specific needs right out of the box. Organizations that seek the most accurate results from their AI projects will simply have to turn to industry-specific models.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Any team looking to expand its AI capabilities should first apply its data and use cases to a generic model and assess the results.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are a few ways that companies can generate industry-specific results. One would be to adopt a hybrid approach — taking an open-source generic AI model and training it further to align with the business’ specific needs. Companies could also look to third-party vendors, such as IBM or C3, and access a complete solution right off the shelf. Or — if they really needed to — data science teams could build their own models in-house, from scratch.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into each of these approaches and how businesses can decide which one works for their distinct circumstances.</p>
<h2>Generic models alone often don’t cut it</h2>
<p>Generic AI models like Vision AI or Rekognition and open-source ones from TensorFlow or Scikit-learn often fail to produce sufficient results when it comes to niche use cases in industries like finance or the energy sector. Many businesses have unique needs, and models that don’t have the contextual data of a certain industry will not be able to provide relevant results.</p>
<h2>Building on top of open-source models</h2>
<p>At ThirdEye Data, we recently worked with a utility company to tag and detect defects in electric poles by using AI to analyze thousands of images. We started off using Google Vision API and found that it was unable to produce our desired results — with the precision and recall values of the AI models completely unusable. The models were unable to read the characters within the tags on the electric poles 90% of the time because it didn’t identify the nonstandard font and varying background colors used in the tags.</p>
<p>So, we took base computer vision models from TensorFlow and optimized them to the utility company’s precise needs. After two months of developing AI models to detect and decipher tags on the electric poles, and another two months of training these models, the results are displaying accuracy levels of over 90%. These will continue to improve over time with retraining iterations.</p>
<p>Any team looking to expand its AI capabilities should first apply its data and use cases to a generic model and assess the results. Open-source algorithms that companies can start off with can be found on AI and ML frameworks like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn or Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. At ThirdEye Data, we used convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms on TensorFlow.</p>
<p>Then, if the results are insufficient, the team can extend the algorithm by training it further on their own industry-specific data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the best parts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=terriburnspost">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> is the Startup Battlefield competition, and one of the most important pieces of the Startup Battlefield is our lineup of expert judges — they&#8217;re the ones the founders are trying to impress. Once the demos and presentations are done, the judges need to think quickly and ask probing questions about each startup. And then, of course, they choose the winner who gets to take home $100k and the Disrupt Cup.</p>
<p>This year, at our second <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">virtual Startup Battlefield</a>, GV partner Terri Burns will be joining us as one of our judges. Burns joined the firm (formerly known as Google Ventures) in 2017 as a principal, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/new-gv-partner-terri-burns-has-a-simple-investment-thesis-gen-z/">was promoted to partner last year</a> — making her the first Black female partner at GV, and its youngest partner as well.</p>
<p>Burns previously worked as a developer evangelist and front-end engineer at Venmo and an associate product manager at Twitter. At GV, she&#8217;s invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/gv-bets-on-young-team-behind-high-school-social-app-hags/">high school social app HAGS</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/locker-room-app-sports-discussion-betty-labs-6e8a50c5-112d-41e5-9970-4b70ecb62aca.html">social audio app Locker Room</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/new-gv-partner-terri-burns-has-a-simple-investment-thesis-gen-z/">an interview about her role last fall</a>, Burns told us she&#8217;s interested in backing Gen Z founders, and she pointed to HAGS as a good example of a product that was &#8220;built by and for Gen Z.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few months back, robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn UiPath <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">raised a huge $750 million round</a> at a valuation of around $35 billion. The capital came ahead of the company&#8217;s expected IPO, so its then-new valuation helped provide a measuring stick for where its eventual flotation could price.</p>
<p>UiPath then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">filed to go public</a>. But today the company&#8217;s first IPO price range <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521112457/d98556ds1a.htm">was released</a>, failing to value the company where its final private backers expected it to.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="58RC2jZsqI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/embed/#?secret=58RC2jZsqI" data-secret="58RC2jZsqI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an S-1/A filing, UiPath disclosed that it expects its IPO to price between $43 and $50 per share. Using a simple share count of 516,545,035, the company would be worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion at the lower and upper extremes of its expected price interval. Neither of those numbers is close to what it was worth, in theory, just a few months ago.</p>
<p>According to IPO watching group Renaissance Capital, UiPath <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/80660/Software-maker-UiPath-sets-terms-for-$990-million-IPO">is worth</a> up to $26 billion on a fully diluted basis. That&#8217;s not much more than its simple valuation.</p>
<p>For UiPath, its initial IPO price interval is a disappointment, though the company could see an upward revision in its valuation before it does sell shares and begin to trade. But more to the point, the company&#8217;s private-market valuation bump followed by a quick public-market correction stands out as a counter-example to something that we&#8217;ve seen so frequently in recent months.</p>
<p>Is UiPath&#8217;s first IPO price interval <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/compass-ceo-hails-ipo-as-a-fundraising-event-amid-challenging-market/">another indicator</a> that the IPO market is cooling?</p>
<h2>Remember Roblox?</h2>
<p>If you think back to the end of 2020, Roblox decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/">cancel its IPO</a> and pursue a direct listing instead. Why? Because a few companies like Airbnb had gone public at what appeared to be strong valuation marks only to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">see their values rocket</a> once they began to trade. So, Roblox decided to raise a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">huge amount of private capital</a>, and then direct list.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Biden has named two former National Security Agency veterans to senior government cybersecurity positions, including the first national cyber director.</p>
<p>The appointments, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/12/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-key-members-for-the-u-s-department-of-homeland-security/">announced Monday</a>, land after the discovery of two cyberattacks linked to foreign governments earlier this year — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">the Russian espionage campaign</a> that planted backdoors in U.S. technology giant SolarWinds&#8217; technology to hack into at least nine federal agencies, and the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange servers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">linked to hackers backed by China</a>.</p>
<p>Jen Easterly, a former NSA official under the Obama administration who helped to launch U.S. Cyber Command, has been nominated as the new head of CISA, the cybersecurity advisory unit housed under Homeland Security. CISA has been without a head for six months after then-President Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/">fired former director Chris Krebs</a>, who Trump appointed to lead the agency in 2018, for disputing Trump&#8217;s false claims of election hacking.</p>
<p>Biden has also named former NSA deputy director John &#8220;Chris&#8221; Inglis as national cyber director, a new position created by Congress late last year to be housed in the White House, charged with overseeing the defense and cybersecurity budgets of civilian agencies.</p>
<p>Inglis is expected to work closely with Anne Neuberger, who in January was appointed as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/decrypted-with-more-solarwinds-fallout-biden-picks-his-cybersecurity-team/">the deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity</a> on the National Security Council. Neuberger, a former NSA executive and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/nsas-anne-neuberger-to-talk-cybersecurity-at-disrupt-2020/">first director of cybersecurity</a>, was tasked with leading the government&#8217;s response to the SolarWinds attack and Exchange hacks.</p>
<p>Biden has also nominated Rob Silvers, a former Obama-era assistant secretary for cybersecurity policy, to serve as undersecretary for strategy, policy, and plans at Homeland Security. Silvers was <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/rob-silvers-biden-cisa-cyber-homeland-security/">recently floated</a> for the top job at CISA.</p>
<p>Both Easterly and Silvers&#8217; positions are subject to Senate confirmation. The appointments were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-senior-nsa-officials-named-to-white-house-cyber-position-and-head-of-dhs-cyber-agency/2021/04/11/b9d408cc-9b2d-11eb-8005-bffc3a39f6d3_story.html">first reported</a> by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Former CISA director Krebs <a href="https://twitter.com/c_c_krebs/status/1381437135153168389">praised</a> the appointments as &#8220;brilliant picks.&#8221; Dmitri Alperovitch, a former CrowdStrike executive and chair of Silverado Policy Accelerator, called the appointments the &#8220;cyber equivalent of the dream team.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/DAlperovitch/status/1381430265378185218">In a tweet</a>, Alperovitch said: &#8220;The administration could not have picked three more capable and experienced people to run cyber operations, policy and strategy alongside Anne Neuberger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuberger is replaced by Rob Joyce, a former White House cybersecurity czar, who returned from a stint at the U.S. Embassy in London earlier this year to serve as NSA&#8217;s new cybersecurity director.</p>
<p>Last week, the White House asked Congress for <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-cisa-funding-dhs-request/">$110 million in new funding</a> for next year to help Homeland Security improve its defenses and hire more cybersecurity talent. CISA hemorrhaged senior staff last year after several executives were fired by the Trump administration or left for the private sector.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa.html">statement</a>, Twitter says it is now actively building a team in Ghana &#8220;to be more immersed in the rich and vibrant communities that drive the conversations taking place every day across the continent<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Twitter indicated several roles, from product and engineering to design, marketing, and communications, for job openings in the company. However, individuals will fill these roles remotely as Twitter makes plans to establish an office in the country later.</p>

<p>&#8220;The choice of Ghana as HQ for Twitter’s Africa operations is excellent news. Government and Ghanaians welcome very much this announcement and the confidence reposed in our country,” said Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo.</p>
<p>He also revealed that he held a virtual meeting with Dorsey on the 7th of April, where the two parties might have finalized the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I indicated to Jack in our virtual meeting on 7th April 2021, this is the start of a beautiful partnership between Twitter and Ghana, which is critical for the development of Ghana&#8217;s hugely important tech sector. These are exciting times to be in and to do business in Ghana,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>According to Twitter, the decision to kick off its African expansion with Ghana stems from the country&#8217;s dealings with AfCFTA and its openness toward the internet.</p>

<p class="hyphenate ">“As a champion for democracy, Ghana is a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate. Furthermore, Ghana’s recent appointment to host The Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area aligns with our overarching goal to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The news comes almost 18 months after Dorsey&#8217;s visit with his Twitter team to Africa for the first time in November 2019. During <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1180191189590392832">his tour on the continent</a>, he visited Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa, where he met with different industry leaders and tech stakeholders on matters concerning Twitter and bitcoin.</p>
<p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1199774792917929984">stated</a> that he would return to the continent to live for six months in mid-2020, but the pandemic made sure that plan was soiled. Since then, not much was communicated by Dorsey or the Twitter team about the visit, although in September, the company subsequently made some mental health and cultural partnerships with local communities across the countries &#8212; Afrochella and The HackLab Foundation in Ghana, Amref Health Africa in Kenya and Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the Twitter CEO showed solidarity in the protests against police brutality that rocked Nigeria and supported bitcoin usage throughout the demonstrations. For months, it seemed Dorsey was solely concerned about bitcoin activities on the continent. However, today&#8217;s news puts things into perspective and shows connecting Twitter and the continent was at the back of his mind after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity training startup <a href="http://hackthebox.eu">Hack The Box</a>, which emerged originally from Greece, has raised a Series A investment round of $10.6 million, led by Paladin Capital Group and joined by Osage University Partners, Brighteye Ventures and existing investors Marathon Venture Capital. It will use the funding to expand. Most recently it launched Hack The Box Academy.</p>
<p>Started in 2017, Hack The Box specializes in using &#8220;ethical hacking&#8221; to train cybersecurity techniques. Users are given challenges to “attack” virtual vulnerable labs in a simulated, gamified and test environment. This approach has garnered more than 500,000 platform members, from beginners to experts, and brought in around 800 organizations (such as governments, Fortune 500 companies, and academic institutions) to improve their cyber-adversarial knowledge.</p>
<p>Haris Pylarinos, Hack The Box co-founder and CEO said: “Everything we do is geared around creating a safer internet by empowering corporate teams and individuals to create unbreakable systems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gibb Witham, senior vice president, Paladin Capital Group, commented: “We’re excited to be backing Hack The Box at this inflection point in their growth as organizations recognize the increasing importance of an adversarial security practice to combat constantly evolving cyber attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hack The Box competes with <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security</a>, <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">Immersive Labs</a>, <a href="https://ine.com/">INE</a> and <a href="https://elearnsecurity.com/">eLearnSecurity</a> (acquired by INE).</p>
<p>Hack The Box is using a SaaS business model. In the B2C market it provides monthly and annual subscriptions that provide unrestricted access to the training content and in the B2B market, it provides bi-annual and annual licenses which provide access to dedicated adversarial training environments with value-added admin capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Out the window, a fire is raging — and it’s moving ever closer. Confusion. Fear. A run for the car. Roads open and then suddenly closed by authorities. Traffic jams. A fire break that stalls the flames and then suddenly the flames jump, changing direction. Everyone has a plan for what to do — a plan that gets ripped up the second someone leaves their home to evacuate.</p>
<p>In the heat of the moment, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and where to go. Unfortunately, that information is rarely available in the format they need.</p>
<p>Bailey Farren’s family has experienced this four times living in California north of San Francisco. The wildfires are more common than ever with the aridness of climate change, yet the evacuations remain a pandemonium. While a student at Berkeley, she started investigating what was happening, and why her family constantly lacked the information they needed to get out safely and swiftly. “I thought that first responders had everything they need,” she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They don’t. Firefighters on the frontlines often lack the technology needed to relay accurate information to operations centers, which can then guide citizens on how to evacuate. With the pressing need to keep citizens up-to-date, most authorities rely on simple text messages to just tell everyone in, say, an entire county to evacuate, with nary more detail.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire in California in 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/25/camp-fire-deadliest-wildfire-californias-history-has-been-contained/">the worst fire in California’s history</a>, triggered her to go beyond interviewing public safety officers to building a solution. She graduated in spring 2019, and at the same time, founded Perimeter with fellow Berkeley grad Noah Wu.</p>
<p><a href="https://perimeterplatform.com">Perimeter</a> is an emergency response platform designed to “bridge the gap between agencies and citizens,” in Farren’s words, by offering better two-way communication centered on geospatial data.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Shawn Merani of Parade Ventures and Dustin Dolginow, social-impact organization One World and Alchemist Accelerator participating. Alchemist was the first money into the startup.</p>

<p>Using Perimeter, citizens can upload geospatial-tagged information such as a new fire outbreak or a tree that has fallen and is now blocking a road. “Sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with … government officials,” Farren said. That information is not immediately disseminated to the public though. Instead, first responders can vet the information, ensuring that citizens are always using accurate information in planning their actions. “We do not want it to be a social-media platform,” she explained.</p>
<p>In the other direction, operations centers can use Perimeter to send citizens accurate and detailed evacuation maps with routes on where to go. Unlike with just a text message, Perimeter will send both the message and a URL, which can then display maps and real-time information on how a disaster is progressing.</p>

<p>Right now, the platform is distributed as a web app, so that citizens don’t need to have it pre-installed when a disaster strikes. Farren noted that the company is working on native apps as well, particularly for first responders who need robust offline capabilities due to intermittent cell signals that are typical in disaster zones.</p>
<p>Farren and her team have interviewed emergency management agencies extensively, and she says that her first customer is Palo Alto’s Office of Emergency Services. Over the past two fire seasons, “we had an R&amp;D focus in that we were building hand-in-hand with agencies … and we took two fire seasons to beta test our technology,” she said.</p>
<p>The company has four full-time employees working remotely, but all based in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye is ratcheting up its autonomous vehicle ambitions and getting into delivery.</p>
<p>The company said Monday it struck a deal with Udelv to supply its self-driving system to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles, dubbed Transporters, on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>Donlen, a U.S. commercial fleet leasing and management company, has made the first preorder for 1,000 of these Udelv Transporters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement is notable for both companies. Udelv, which initially launched as an autonomous vehicle delivery startup, has opted to adopt Mobileye&#8217;s self-driving system and focus on &#8220;creating the hardware and software that allows for autonomous deliveries,&#8221; its CEO Daniel Laury said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a hardcore engineering problem to solve when one understands the multiplicity of goods to deliver, the variety of ways to do it, and some other intricately complex issues linked to the automation of last and middle mile deliveries,&#8221; Laury said. &#8220;By partnering with Mobileye, Udelv can focus 100% of its resources and efforts to perfecting the business application while Mobileye provides the tool to scale fast. It is a win-win situation.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye is bringing its autonomous vehicle test fleets to at least four more cities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/embed/#?secret=z2QI4vSW2I" data-secret="z2QI4vSW2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Mobileye it marks yet another expansion for a company that got its start as a developer of camera-based sensors, which are now used by most automakers to support advanced driver assistance systems. Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great combination of the two partners together and we expect some great scale,&#8221; Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the vice president of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye, said in a recent interview. &#8220;And this does kind of mark, officially, the first proof point of Mobileye&#8217;s technology getting into goods delivery in addition to all the other spaces that we&#8217;ve already announced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has widened its scope in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. More than two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018/">REM mapping system</a> and software algorithms. And in 2018, the company made an unlikely turn and announced plans to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier. Mobileye also plans to deploy autonomous shuttles with Transdev ATS and Lohr Group beginning in Europe. Mobileye also plans to begin operating an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel in early 2022.</p>

<p>This latest deal shows Mobileye&#8217;s ambition to see its self-driving systems used in other applications beyond robotaxis.</p>
<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobileye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute, redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>Udelv will work with Mobileye to integrate the self-driving technology with its own delivery management system. Mobileye will also provide over-the-air software support throughout the lifetime of the vehicles.</p>
<p>These purpose-built vehicles won&#8217;t have the typical mechanical features one might find in a human-driven truck or delivery van. It will be designed to be capable of so-called Level 4 self-driving, a designation by SAE that means the vehicle can handle all operations without a human under certain conditions. It will also come with four-directional four-way steering, LED screens to greet the people picking up the delivery and special compartments for goods.</p>
<p>There will be a teleoperations system that will allow for the maneuvering of the vehicles in parking lots, loading zones, apartment complexes and private roads, according to Udelv.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last month was Uber's best in history in terms of gross sales on its platform. That's good, but not as good as you might think.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a short hiatus, The Exchange is back. We&#8217;ll spend part of this week digging into the global venture capital scene&#8217;s Q1 performance, but today, we&#8217;re kicking off with a quick dive into Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo and DoorDash &#8212; and the ability of on-demand companies of various stripes to generate profit.</p>
<p>Uber is our lodestone today because it dropped a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/84bcb1ae-108c-493b-a622-c8fcd2bb29b7.pdf">new SEC filing</a> that includes some notes on its recent performance. And, most critically, a piece of guidance for investors concerning its ability to make money this year.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>By &#8220;make money,&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean traditional net income on a GAAP &#8212; generally accepted accounting principles &#8212; basis. We mean Uber is providing its public investors with notes on its future <em>adjusted</em> profitability. Real profits are still somewhere out in the uncharted future.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s parse Uber&#8217;s latest, vet its profit promise, consider its rivals and their performance, and then ask ourselves if the great ride-hailing and food-delivery booms will ever make back the money they cost to scale.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s planned profits</h2>
<p>In 2019, Lyft told investors to expect positive adjusted EBITDA by the final quarter of 2021; at the time, Uber said it would generate full-year positive adjusted EBITDA. Those are slightly different (if related) promises. Later, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/unpacking-ubers-new-profitability-promise/">moved up its profitability promise to Q4 2020</a>, but that was not to be.</p>
<p>After Uber changed up its profitability timeline, COVID-19 came. The pandemic forced the American ride-hailing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/uber-pushes-adjusted-quarterly-profit-target-to-2021/">to revert</a> to its previous adjusted profitability promises.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft took huge revenue hits as their core ride-hailing businesses dried up faster than water on a Texas sidewalk after COVID-19 lockdowns took effect. In response, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/huge-delivery-demand-fails-to-stop-ubers-revenue-from-shrinking-in-q3/">fell back on its Uber Eats business</a>, while Lyft had to get by without a second business line.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">bring an electric pickup to market later this year</a>, has partnered with Samsung SDI as its battery cell supplier, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement released Monday Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI “throughout the vehicle development process.”</p>
<p>Rivian pointed out that its anticipated R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which Rivian calls “adventure vehicles,” require a battery module and pack that can handle extreme temperatures and durability use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korea-based Samsung SDI already supplies battery cells to other automakers. In 2019, the company signed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/bmw-locks-up-10-2-billion-euro-battery-order-ahead-of-ev-onslaught/">$3.2 billion deal with BMW Group for a 10-year supply agreement</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the performance and reliability of Samsung SDI battery cells combined with our energy-dense module and pack design,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “Samsung SDI’s focus on innovation and responsible sourcing of battery materials aligns well with our vision.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">it was acquiring Nuance Communications</a> this morning for $19.7 billion, you could be excused for doing a Monday morning double take at the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s surely a lot of money for a company on a $1.4 billion run rate, but Microsoft, which has already partnered with the speech-to-text market leader on several products over the last couple of years, saw a company firmly embedded in healthcare and it decided to go all in.</p>
<p>And $20 billion is certainly all in, even for a company the size of Microsoft. But 2020 forced us to change the way we do business from restaurants to retailers to doctors. In fact, the pandemic in particular changed the way we interact with our medical providers. We learned very quickly that you don&#8217;t have to drive to an office, wait in waiting room, then in an exam room, all to see the doctor for a few minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, we can get on the line, have a quick chat and be on our way. It won&#8217;t work for every condition of course &#8212; there will always be times the physician needs to see you &#8212; but for many meetings such as reviewing test results or for talk therapy, telehealth could suffice.</p>

<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Nuance is at the center of this shift, especially with its use of cloud and artificial intelligence, and that&#8217;s why the company was willing to pay the amount it did to get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance,&#8221; Nadella said <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">in a post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says says that may be so, but he believes that Microsoft missed the boat with Cortana and this is about helping the company catch up on a crucial technology. &#8220;Nuance will be not only give Microsoft technology help in regards to neural network based speech recognition, but also a massive improvement from vertical capabilities, call center functionality and the MSFT IP position in speech,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft sees this deal doubling what was already a considerable total addressable market to nearly $500 billion. While TAMs always tend to run high, that is still a substantial number.</p>

<p>It also fits with Gartner data, which found that by 2022, 75% of healthcare organizations will have a formal cloud strategy in place. The AI component only adds to that number and Nuance brings 10,000 existing customers to Microsoft including some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the world.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says the deal could provide Microsoft with a ton of health data to help feed the underlying machine learning models and make them more accurate over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is going be a ton of health data being captured by the interactions coming through telemedicine interactions, and this could create a whole new level of health intelligence,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>That of course could drive a lot of privacy concerns where health data is involved, and it will be up to Microsoft, which just experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">a major breach on its Exchange</a> email server products last month, to assure the public that their sensitive health data is being protected.</p>
<p>Leary says that ensuring data privacy is going to be absolutely key to the success of the deal. &#8220;The potential this move has is pretty powerful, but it will only be realized if the data and insights that could come from it are protected and secure &#8212; not only protected from hackers but also from unethical use. Either could derail what could be a game changing move,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft also seemed to recognize that when it wrote, &#8220;Nuance and Microsoft will deepen their existing commitments to the extended partner ecosystem, as well as the highest standards of data privacy, security and compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate Leggett, an analyst at Forrester Research thinks healthcare could be just the first step and once Nuance is in the fold, it could go much deeper than that.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the benefit of this acquisition does not stop [with healthcare]. Nuance also offers market-leading customer engagement technologies, with deep expertise and focus in verticals such as financial services. As MSFT evolves their industry editions into other verticals, this acquisition will pay off for other industries. MSFT may also choose to fill in the gaps within their Dynamics solution with Nuance’s customer engagement technologies,” Leggett said.</p>
<p>We are clearly on the edge of a sea change when it comes to how we interact with our medical providers in the future. COVID pushed medicine deeper into the digital realm in 2020 out of simple necessity. It wasn&#8217;t safe to go into the office unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Nuance acquisition, which is expected to close some time later this year, could help Microsoft shift deeper into the market. It could even bring Teams into it as a meeting tool, but it&#8217;s all going to depend on the trust level people have with this approach, and it will be up to the company to make sure that both healthcare providers and the people they serve have that.</p>
