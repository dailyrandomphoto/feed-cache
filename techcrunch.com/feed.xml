					<description><![CDATA[I've never used "stonkathon" in a headline before, but it's been that kind of week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Demo days at startup accelerators are a pretty big deal around here.</p>
<p>These events aren&#8217;t just a chance to review the latest cohort of hopeful entrepreneurs — they also showcase the technology, products and services that will compete for VC and consumer attention over the next few years.</p>
<p>You never know where a hit will come from, which is why these events capture our attention. Here&#8217;s just one example from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2013 Demo Day:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Positioning itself as the “FedEx of today,” it hopes to provide a logistics framework that goes beyond food and can be used for any type of on-demand order.</p></blockquote>
<p>That startup was DoorDash, by the way.</p>

<hr />
<p>Full disclosure: In 2016, I was 500 Startups&#8217; Journalist-in-residence. I covered one demo day in person, spending most of my time backstage where founder teams practiced their pitches.</p>
<p>It was quite a scene: Several people literally jumped up and down to shake off their nervous energy, but I also recall one who calmly recited their lines while gazing through a window.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jon Shieber and Alex Wilhelm covered 500 Startups&#8217; 27th virtual demo day and selected eight companies as their favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack</li>
<li>Adapty</li>
<li>MightyFly</li>
<li>Omnitron Sensors</li>
<li>AWSM</li>
<li>Memechat</li>
<li>Ryu Games</li>
<li>Apothecary</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much for reading Extra Crunch this week! I hope you have a safe, relaxing weekend.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never used &#8220;stonkathon&#8221; in a headline before, but it&#8217;s been that kind of week.</p>
<p>The war between hedge funds and day traders over GameStop vaulted discount trader Robinhood into the headlines for days.</p>
<p>But how did it affect the company&#8217;s financial health?</p>
<p>This morning, Alex Wilhelm examined why Robinhood&#8217;s investors were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">willing to inject $3.4 billion more into the company</a> in just one week.</p>
<p>&#8220;More trades means more PFOF (payment for order flow) revenue,&#8221; says Alex. &#8220;And Robinhood effectively doubled in size.&#8221;</p>

<p>A new arm of the company, Udemy for Business, just secured a 100,000-employee contract with Cisco Systems to offer software, business and technology courses.</p>
<p>“The opportunity that the company sees has really forced us to reallocate resources and strategy,” said Brown.</p>

<p>Deep tech founders face special challenges when pitching investors: they usually don&#8217;t have a product, customers or revenue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult enough to ask a stranger for a check when there&#8217;s a beta product, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/4-strategies-for-deep-tech-founders-who-are-fundraising/">how do you drum up interest in an unproven idea</a> that may exist largely in your imagination?</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage investors are in the business of funding dreams,&#8221; says angel investor Jessica Li.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors are less interested in the intricacies of your technology and more interested in what impact it can create.&#8221;</p>
<p>Step one: use storytelling to highlight your big vision.</p>

<p>The valuations of these companies aren&#8217;t rising at the same rate as SaaS or fintech startups, but &#8220;where edtech lacks in impressive valuations, investors see it gaining in exit opportunities,&#8221; writes Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>

<p>Some IT managers may still be debating the merits of usage-based pricing versus subscription-based models, but SaaS investors have made up their minds.</p>
<p>Compared to their rivals, companies that employ usage-based pricing trade at a 50% revenue multiple premium. You can argue with success, but seven out of the nine IPOs since 2018 with the best net dollar retention offer usage-based models.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder who hopes to break into the $100M ARR club, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">this guest post</a> can help you identify the right usage metrics for creating a sustainable customer journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, flexible workspace operator (and one-time unicorn) Knotel announced it had filed for bankruptcy and that its assets were </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by investor and commercial real estate brokerage Newmark for</span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/knotel-approved-to-borrow-initial-30-million-on-bankruptcy-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reported $70 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed, built and ran custom headquarters for companies. It then managed the spaces with “flexible” terms. In March 2020, it was reportedly </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/03/27/knotel-a-wework-rival-valued-at-16-billion-lets-go-half-of-its-staff/?sh=7d4d46f166c2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at $1.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, one might think that the WeWork rival, which had raised about $560 million since its 2016 inception, was another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But New York-based Knotel was reportedly in trouble – facing a number of lawsuits and evictions – before the pandemic had even hit, according to multiple reports, such as this one in </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/national/2021/02/01/knotel-files-for-bankruptcy-set-to-be-bought-by-newmark/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Real Deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Pasternak, a partner in the bankruptcy, restructuring and creditor rights group at New York-based Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron, believes the company’s Chapter 11 filing was inevitable despite it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching unicorn status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after raising $400 million in Series C funding in August 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition to being grossly overvalued on the market, the company overextended itself with long term leases and lavish build-outs, leaving the company in significant debt while failing to ever turn a profit,” Pasternak wrote via email. “The pandemic exacerbated their vacancy situation, resulting in more than 35% vacancies in their 2.4 million square-foot NYC portfolio. The company overextended and likely ran out of cash.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newmark’s purchase of Knotel’s assets is an effort to recoup some of its investment, according to Pasternak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anytime a company that has raised more than half a billion dollars basically implodes, it’s worth taking a look at the roller coaster ride it was on before it got to that point.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3>2016</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virgin Mobile co-founder Amol Sarva and former VC Edward Shenderovich founded Knotel, essentially </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reversing the WeWork model. There&#8217;s hype around the company in its early days.</span></p>
<h3>2017</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/knotel-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A round of $25 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in February from investors such as Peak State Ventures, Invest AG, Bloomberg Beta and 500 startups. It marketed its offering as “headquarters as a service” — or a flexible office space that could be customized for each tenant while also growing or shrinking as needed. </span></p>
<h3>2018</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, Knotel a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nnounced the close of a $70 million Series B financing led by Newmark Knight Frank and The Sapir Organization. In August, the company </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/flexible-workplace-startups-clamor-to-give-companies-an-alternative-to-wework/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was operating over 1 million square feet across 60 locations in New York, London, San Francisco and Berlin, and that it was on track to reach 2.5 million square feet and $100 million in revenue by year’s end. Revenue growth had increased by 300 percent year over year, according to the company. Customers and users and clients ranged from VC-backed startups Stash and HotelTonight to enterprise customers such as The Body Shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What they’re doing is different,” said Barry Gosin, CEO of Newmark Knight Frank, in a press release, at the time of the round. “It’s a new category the industry hasn’t seen and is rapidly adopting. We’ve watched their ascent from a distance and are now thrilled to join them on the journey. It marks a shift in how owners and tenants are coming together.”</span></p>
<h2>2019</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel announced the completion of a $400 million financing, led by Wafra, an investment arm of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Kuwait. With the round, the company had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/workspace-provider-knotel-secures-400m-putting-it-in-weworks-rear-view-mirror/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">achieved unicorn status </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and was being touted as a formidable WeWork competitor. At the time, Knotel said it operated more than 4 million square feet across more than 200 locations in New York, San Francisco, London, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Paris, Berlin, Toronto, Boston, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement at the time, CEO Sarva said: “Knotel is building the future of the workplace, and we are excited to welcome a group of investors who believe passionately in our product, vision and ability to execute. Wafra will help us continue our rapid global expansion and solidify our position as the leader in a fast-growing, trillion-dollar flexible office market.”</span></p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late March, Forbes </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/03/27/knotel-a-wework-rival-valued-at-16-billion-lets-go-half-of-its-staff/?sh=7d4d46f166c2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel had laid off 30% of its workforce and furloughed another 20%, due to the impact of the coronavirus. At the time, it was valued at about $1.6 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company had started the year with about 500 employees. By the third week of March, it had a headcount of 400. With the cuts, about 200 employees remained with the other 200 having either lost their jobs or on unpaid leave, according to Forbes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Business as usual is over,” Amol Sarva, Knotel’s CEO and co-founder, said in a statement to Forbes. “Knotel has decided to take sharp action to prepare for the worst case — a long health and economic crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second quarter, Knotel’s revenue slipped by about 20% to about $59 million compared to the first quarter, reported Forbes. Multiple landlords had filed </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/la/2020/05/13/knotel-no-pay-lawsuit-says-company-broke-profit-sharing-agreement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By July, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes had reported that Knotel was attempting to raise as much as $100 million, according to various sources “familiar with the matter.”</span></p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knotel </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed for bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, agrees to sell assets to investor Newmark for a reported $70 million after being valued at $1.6 billion less than one year prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Newmark&#8217;s commitment offers a path forward amidst this challenging climate,&#8221; CEO Sarva said in a statement. &#8220;We are optimistic that, through a successful restructuring, we can refocus on our mission of providing state-of-the-art, tailored flex space in key U.S. and international markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To facilitate the transaction under Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, an affiliate of Newmark agreed to provide Knotel with about $20 million in cash as DIP financing to support Knotel through the bankruptcy process.</span></p>
<p>Just as the startup and VC world watched as WeWork lost a significant amount of value over the past two years, we&#8217;re paying attention to the demise of Knotel and wondering what this means for the flexible workspace sector. As much of the world continues to work from home and office buildings remain mostly vacant as this pandemic rages, our guess is that things will only get worse before they get better.</p>

Section 230 [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first major Section 230 reform proposal of the Biden era is out. In a new bill, Senate Democrats Mark Warner (D-VA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) propose changes to <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a> that would fundamentally change the 1996 law widely credited with cultivating the modern internet.</p>
<p>Section 230 is a legal shield that protects internet companies from the user-generated content they host, from Facebook and TikTok to Amazon reviews and  comments sections. The new <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/4/f/4fa9c9ba-2b34-4854-8c19-59a0a9676a31/66DECFBC0D6E6958C2520C3A6A69EAF6.safe-tech-act---final.pdf">proposed legislation, known as the SAFE TECH Act</a>, would do a few different things to change how that works.</p>
<p>First, it would fundamentally alter the core language of Section 230 — and given how concise that snippet of language is to begin with, any change is a big change. Under the new language, Section 230 would no longer offer protections in situations where payments are involved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the current version:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information speech provided by another information content provider.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are the changes the SAFE TECH Act would make:</p>
<blockquote><p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any<strong> speech</strong> provided by another information content provider, <strong>except to the extent the provider or user has</strong> <strong>accepted payment to make the speech available or, in whole or in part, created </strong><strong>or funded the creation of the speech.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(B) (c)(1)(A) shall be an affirmative defense to a claim alleging that an interactive computer service provider is a publisher or speaker with respect to speech provided by another information content provider that an interactive computer service provider has a burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>That might not sound like much, but it could be a massive change. In <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1357742045176205314">a tweet</a> promoting the bill, Sen. Warner called online ads a &#8220;a key vector for all manner of frauds and scams&#8221; so homing in on platform abuses in advertising is the ostensible goal here. But under the current language, it&#8217;s possible that many other kinds of paid services could be affected, from Substack, Patreon and other kinds of premium online content to web hosting.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good lawyer could argue that this covers many different types of arrangements that go far beyond paid advertisements,&#8221; Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who authored a book about Section 230, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Platforms accept payments from a wide range of parties during the course of making speech &#8216;available&#8217; to the public. The bill does not limit the exception to cases in which platforms accept payments from the speaker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internet companies big and small rely on Section 230 protections to operate, but some of them might have to rethink their businesses if rules proposed in the new bill come to pass. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), one of Section 230&#8217;s original authors, noted that the new bill has some good intentions, but he issued a strong caution against the blowback its unintended consequences could cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, as written, it would devastate every part of the open internet, and cause massive collateral damage to online speech,&#8221; Wyden told TechCrunch, likening the bill to a full repeal of the law with added confusion from a cluster of new exceptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating liability for all commercial relationships would cause web hosts, cloud storage providers and even paid email services to purge their networks of any controversial speech,&#8221; Wyden said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a> Director Evan Greer echoed the sentiment that the bill is well intentioned but shared the same concerns. &#8220;&#8230;Unfortunately this bill, as written, would have enormous unintended consequences for human rights and freedom of expression,&#8221; Greer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It creates a huge carveout in Section 230 that impacts not only advertising but essentially all paid services, such as web hosting and [content delivery networks], as well as small services like Patreon, Bandcamp, and Etsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given its focus on advertising and instances in which a company has accepted payment, the bill might be both too broad and too narrow at once to offer effective reform. While online advertising, particularly political advertising, has become a hot topic in recent discussions about cracking down on platforms, the vast majority of violent conspiracies, misinformation, and organized hate is the result of organic content, not the stuff that&#8217;s paid or promoted. It also doesn&#8217;t address the role of algorithms, a particular focus of a <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-eshoo-and-malinowski-introduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-liable-algorithmic">narrow Section 230 reform proposal</a> in the House from Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ).</p>
<h2>New exceptions</h2>
<p>The other part of the SAFE TECH Act, which attracted buy-in from a number of civil rights organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Color Of Change, does address some of those ills. By appending Section 230, the new bill would open internet companies to more civil liability in some cases, allowing victims of cyber-stalking, targeted harassment, discrimination and wrongful death to the opportunity to file lawsuits against those companies rather than blocking those kinds of suits outright.</p>
<p>The SAFE TECH Act would also create a carve-out allowing individuals to seek court orders in cases when an internet company&#8217;s handling of material it hosts could cause &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; as well as allowing lawsuits in U.S. courts against American internet companies for human rights abuses abroad.</p>
<p>In a press release, Warner said the bill was about updating the 1996 law to bring it up to speed with modern needs:</p>
<p>&#8220;A law meant to encourage service providers to develop tools and policies to support effective moderation has instead conferred sweeping immunity on online providers even when they do nothing to address foreseeable, obvious and repeated misuse of their products and services to cause harm,&#8221; Warner said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no dearth of ideas about reforming Section 230. Among them: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/pact-act-takes-on-internet-platform-content-rules-with-a-scalpel-rather-than-a-jackhammer/">bipartisan PACT Act from Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Thune (R-SD)</a>, which focuses on moderation transparency and providing less cover for companies facing federal and state regulators, and the EARN IT Act, a broad bill from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) that 230 defenders and internet freedom advocates regard as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-act-violates-constitution">unconstitutional</a>, overly broad and disastrous.</p>
<p>With so many proposed Section 230 reforms already floating around, it&#8217;s far from guaranteed that a bill like the SAFE TECH Act will prevail. The only thing that&#8217;s certain is we&#8217;ll be hearing a lot more about the tiny snippet of law with huge consequences for the modern internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fi.co/">The Founder Institute</a> isn&#8217;t just trying to help entrepreneurs launch new startups — with its new <a href="https://fi.co/vc">VC Lab</a>, the accelerator says it&#8217;s also hoping to fuel the launch of 1,000 new venture capital funds.</p>
<p>FI co-founder Jonathan Greechan described this as an attempt to bring more &#8220;alignment&#8221; to the startup ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The thinking here is that if we can better align the startup and funding ecosystems towards impact, then we can create companies that are truly positive for humanity,&#8221; Greechan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, FI has already held two sessions of the VC Lab, one in the spring of last year (which Greechan compared to a minimum viable product) and one in the summer-fall (which he compared to a beta test). Now the deadline to <a href="https://fi.co/join?target=8930&amp;vc_lab_user=false">apply</a> for the next cohort is coming up on February 14.</p>
<p>Greechan said that 48 funds have emerged from its most recent cohort and they&#8217;re on track to raise a total of $100 million in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5xSRNlB3C7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/without-desks-and-a-demo-day-are-accelerators-worth-it/">Without desks and a demo day, are accelerators worth it?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Without desks and a demo day, are accelerators worth it?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/without-desks-and-a-demo-day-are-accelerators-worth-it/embed/#?secret=5xSRNlB3C7" data-secret="5xSRNlB3C7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While many of those funds are still in the fundraising process and cannot be disclosed publicly yet, he noted that one-third of those funds are being created by partners from underrepresented backgrounds and that more than half of them are focused on impact. And he pointed to <a href="https://pacer.vc">Pacer Ventures</a> — a $3 million fund targeting startups in sub-Saharan African — as an example of the kind of firm VC Lab is meant to support.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found was that a lot of the issues that these new fund managers have are pretty similar to the issues that new entrepreneurs have,&#8221; Greechan said. &#8220;They don’t understand the sequence of steps to actually get them off the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>VC Lab is meant to help them understand those steps, with a curriculum that includes webinars, virtual office hours and conversations on Slack. Participants are also required to take<a href="https://fi.co/insight/the-mensarius-oath"> The Mensarius Oath</a>, which commits them to a number of values, including endeavoring &#8220;to help create positive outcomes for all of humanity&#8221; and opposing &#8220;any abuse of power that leads to unfair advantage, seduction, corruption or mistreatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program is free, although participants can also pay $500 a month for access to &#8220;premium office hours.&#8221; Founders Institute/VC Lab isn&#8217;t participating in the funds financially.</p>
<p>When I asked about the business model, Greechan said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking at this necessarily as the next phase of our business. We&#8217;ve been fostering this community of people building interesting and impactful companies, and now we&#8217;re making sure that we build a correlated community of people funding impactful companies. It’s not for charity, but there’s long-term benefits that we see for all of our grads.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After &#8220;pausing&#8221; political giving to any politician who voted to overturn the 2020 election,<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/05/changes-to-political-giving/"> Microsoft has clarified changes to the lobbying policy of its employee-funded PAC</a>, doubling down on its original intention and changing gears with an eye toward funding impactful organizations.</p>
<p>Microsoft, along with most other major companies in the tech sector and plenty others, announced a halt to political donations in the chaotic wake of the capitol riots and subsequent partisan clashes over the legitimacy of the election.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft said that it often pauses donations during the transition to a new Congress, but in this case it would only resume them &#8220;after it assesses the implications of last week&#8217;s events&#8221; and &#8220;consult[s] with employees.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Assessing and consulting can take a long time, especially in matters of allocating cash in politics, but Microsoft seems to have accomplished their goal in relatively short order. In a series of sessions over the last two weeks involving more than 300 employees who contribute to the PAC, the company arrived at a new strategy that reflects their priorities.</p>
<p>In a word, they&#8217;re blacklisting any senator, representative, government official or organization that voted for or supported the attempt to overturn the election. Fortunately there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a lot of grey area here, which simplifies the process somewhat. This restriction will remain in place until the 2022 election — which, frighteningly, happens next year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oGjbc3g3b1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-congress-committees/">House punishes Republican lawmaker who promoted violent conspiracy theories</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;House punishes Republican lawmaker who promoted violent conspiracy theories&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-congress-committees/embed/#?secret=oGjbc3g3b1" data-secret="oGjbc3g3b1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In fact, as an alternative to donating to individual candidates and politicians in the first place, the PAC will establish a new fund to &#8220;support organizations that promote public transparency, campaign finance reform, and voting rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>More details on this are forthcoming, but it&#8217;s a significant change from direct support of candidates to independent organizations. One hardly knows what a candidate&#8217;s fund goes to (Super Bowl ads this time of year), but giving half a million bucks to a group challenging voter suppression and gerrymandering in a hotly contested district can make a big difference. (Work like this on a large scale helped tip Georgia from red to blue, for instance, and it didn&#8217;t happen overnight, or for free.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a hint of a larger change in the offing, as Microsoft&#8217;s Corporate VP of U.S. Government Affairs Fred Humphries suggests in the blog post that &#8220;we believe there is an opportunity to learn and work together&#8221; with like-minded companies and PACs. If that isn&#8217;t a sly invitation to create a coalition of the like-minded I don&#8217;t know what is. (This paragraph previously attributed the post to Frank X. Shaw — my mistake, Shaw only promoted the new policy on Twitter.)</p>
<p>The company also will be changing the name of the PAC to the Microsoft Corporation Voluntary PAC to better communicate that it&#8217;s funded by voluntary contributions from employees and stakeholders and isn&#8217;t just a big corporate lobbying slush fund.</p>
<p>As we saw around the time of the original &#8220;pause,&#8221; and indeed with many other actions in the tech industry over the last year, it&#8217;s likely that one large company (in this case Microsoft) getting specific with its political moves will trigger more who just didn&#8217;t want to be the first to go. It&#8217;s difficult to predict exactly what the long-term ramifications of these changes will be (as they are still quite general and tentative) but it seems safe to say that the political funding landscape of the next election period will look quite a bit different from the last one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A legal challenge was heard today in Europe&#8217;s Court of Justice in relation to a controversial EU-funded research project using artificial intelligence for facial &#8220;lie detection&#8221; with the aim of speeding up immigration checks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62019TN0158&amp;from=EN">transparency lawsuit</a> against the EU&#8217;s Research Executive Agency (REA), which oversees the bloc&#8217;s funding programs, was filed in March 2019 by Patrick Breyer, MEP of the Pirate Party Germany and a civil liberties activist &#8212; who has successfully sued the Commission before over a refusal to disclose documents.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s seeking the release of documents on the ethical evaluation, legal admissibility, marketing and results of the project. And is hoping to set a principle that publicly funded research must comply with EU fundamental rights &#8212; and help avoid public money being wasted on AI &#8220;snake oil&#8221; in the process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The EU keeps having dangerous surveillance and control technology developed, and will even fund weapons research in the future, I hope for a landmark ruling that will allow public scrutiny and debate on unethical publicly funded research in the service of private profit interests&#8221;, said Breyer in a statement following today&#8217;s hearing. “With my transparency lawsuit, I want the court to rule once and for all that taxpayers, scientists, media and Members of Parliament have a right to information on publicly funded research &#8212; especially in the case of pseudoscientific and Orwellian technology such as the ‘iBorderCtrl video lie detector’.”</p>
<p>The court has yet to set a decision date on the case but Breyer said the judges questioned the agency &#8220;intensively and critically for over an hour&#8221; &#8212; and revealed that documents relating to the AI technology involved, which have not been publicly disclosed but had been reviewed by the judges, contain information such as &#8220;ethnic characteristics&#8221;, raising plenty of questions.</p>
<p>The presiding judge went on to query whether it wouldn&#8217;t be in the interests of the EU research agency to demonstrate that it has nothing to hide by publishing more information about the controversial <a href="https://www.iborderctrl.eu">iBorderCtrl </a>project, per Breyer.</p>

<h2>AI &#8216;lie detection&#8217;</h2>
<p>The research in question is controversial because the notion of an accurate lie detector machine remains science fiction, and with good reason: There&#8217;s no evidence of a &#8220;universal psychological signal&#8221; for deceit.</p>
<p>Yet this AI-fuelled commercial R&amp;D &#8220;experiment&#8221; to build a video lie detector &#8212; which entailed testers being asked to respond to questions put to them by a virtual border guard as a webcam scanned their facial expressions and the system sought to detect what an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/infocentre/article_en.cfm?artid=49726">official EC summary of the project</a> describes as &#8220;biomarkers of deceit&#8221; in an effort to score the truthfulness of their facial expressions (yes, really<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f926-200d-2640-fe0f.png" alt="🤦‍♀️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) &#8212; scored over €4.5 million/$5.4 million in EU research funding under the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700626">Horizon 2020 scheme</a>.</p>
<p>The iBorderCtrl project ran between September 2016 and August 2019, with the funding spread between 13 private or for-profit entities across a number of Member States (including the U.K., Poland, Greece and Hungary).</p>
<p>Public research reports the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-000152-ASW_EN.pdf">Commission said</a> would be published last year, per a written response to Breyer&#8217;s questions challenging the lack of transparency, do not appear to have seen the light of day yet.</p>
<p>Back in 2019 <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/07/26/europe-border-control-ai-lie-detector/">The Intercept</a> was able to test out the iBorderCtrl system for itself. The video lie detector falsely accused its reporter of lying &#8212; judging she had given four false answers out of 16, and giving her an overall score of 48, which it reported that a policeman who assessed the results said triggered a suggestion from the system she should be subject to further checks (though was not as the system was never run for real during border tests).</p>
<p>The Intercept said it had to file a data access request &#8212; a right that&#8217;s established in EU law &#8212; in order to obtain a copy of the reporter&#8217;s results. Its report quoted Ray Bull, a professor of criminal investigation at the University of Derby, who described the iBorderCtrl project as &#8220;not credible&#8221; &#8212; given the lack of evidence that monitoring microgestures on people’s faces is an accurate way to measure lying.</p>
<p>“They are deceiving themselves into thinking it will ever be substantially effective and they are wasting a lot of money. The technology is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what humans do when being truthful and deceptive”, Bull also told it.</p>
<p>The notion that AI can automagically predict human traits if you just pump in enough data is distressingly common &#8212; just look at <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-dark-past-of-algorithms-that-associate-appearance-and-criminality#:~:text=Perhaps%20the%20most%20notorious%20recent,an%20accuracy%20of%2089.5%20percent.">recent attempts</a> to revive phrenology by applying machine learning to glean &#8220;personality traits&#8221; from face shape. So a face-scanning AI &#8220;lie detector&#8221; sits in a long and ignoble anti-scientific &#8220;tradition&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the 21st century it&#8217;s frankly incredible that millions of euros of public money are being funnelled into rehashing terrible old ideas &#8212; before you even consider the ethical and legal blindspots inherent in the EU funding research that runs counter to fundamental rights set out in the EU&#8217;s charter. When you consider all the bad decisions involved in letting this fly it looks head-hangingly shameful.</p>
<p>The granting of funds to such a dubious application of AI also appears to ignore all the (good) research that has been done showing how data-driven technologies risk scaling bias and discrimination.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t know for sure, though, because only very limited information has been released about how the consortia behind iBorderCtrl assessed ethics considerations in their experimental application &#8212; which is a core part of the legal complaint.</p>
<p>The challenge in front of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg poses some very awkward questions for the Commission: Should the EU be pouring taxpayer cash into pseudoscientific &#8220;research&#8221;? Shouldn&#8217;t it be trying to fund actual science? And why does its flagship research program &#8212; the jewel in the EU crown &#8212; have so little public oversight?</p>
<p>The fact that a video lie detector made it through the EU&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/h2020/h2020-msca-if-2015/1645175-h2020_-_guidance_ethics_self_assess_en.pdf">ethics self-assessment</a>&#8221; process, meanwhile, suggests the claimed &#8220;ethics checks&#8221; aren&#8217;t worth a second glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision on whether to accept [an R&amp;D] application or not is taken by the REA after Member States representatives have taken a decision. So there is no public scrutiny, there is no involvement of parliament or NGOs. There is no [independent] ethics body that will screen all of those projects. The whole system is set up very badly&#8221;, says Breyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their argument is basically that the purpose of this R&amp;D is not to contribute to science or to do something for public good or to contribute to EU policies but the purpose of these programs really is to support the industry &#8212; to develop stuff to sell. So it&#8217;s really supposed to be an economical program, the way it has been devised. And I think we really actually need a discussion about whether this is right, whether this should be so&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU&#8217;s about to regulate AI and here it is actually funding unethical and unlawful technologies&#8221;, he adds.</p>

<h2>No external ethics oversight</h2>
<p>Not only does it look hypocritical for the EU to be funding rights-hostile research but &#8212; critics contend &#8212; it&#8217;s a waste of public money that could be spent on genuinely useful research (be it for a security purpose or, more broadly, for the public good; and for furthering those &#8220;European values&#8221; EU lawmakers love to refer to).</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need to know and understand is that research that will never be used because it doesn&#8217;t work or it&#8217;s unethical or it&#8217;s illegal, that actually wastes money for other programs that would be really important and useful&#8221;, argues Breyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example in the security program you could maybe do some good in terms of police protective gear. Or maybe in terms of informing the population in terms of crime prevention. So you could do a lot of good if these means were used properly &#8212; and not on this dubious technology that will hopefully never be used&#8221;.</p>
<p>The latest incarnation of the EU&#8217;s flagship research and innovation program, which takes over from Horizon 2020, has a budget of ~€95.5 billion for the 2021-2027 period. And driving digital transformation and developments in AI are among the EU&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/5g-ai-cybersecurity-and-renewable-energy-set-for-investment-boost-under-eu-coronavirus-recovery-plan/">stated research funding priorities</a>. So the pot of money available for &#8220;experimental&#8221; AI looks massive.</p>
<p>But who will be making sure that money isn&#8217;t wasted on algorithmic snake oil &#8212; and dangerous algorithmic snake oil in instances where the R&amp;D runs so clearly counter to the EU&#8217;s own charter of fundamental human rights?</p>
<p>The European Commission declined multiple requests for spokespeople to talk about these issues but it did send some on the record points (below), and some background information regarding access to documents which is a key part of the legal complaint.</p>
<p>Among the Commission&#8217;s on the record statements on &#8220;ethics in research&#8221;, it started with the claim that &#8220;ethics is given the highest priority in EU funded research&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;All research and innovation activities carried out under Horizon 2020 must comply with ethical principles and relevant national, EU and international law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights&#8221;, it also told us, adding: &#8220;<span lang="EN-IE">All proposals undergo a specific ethics evaluation which verifies and contractually obliges the compliance of the research project with ethical rules and standards&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>It did not elaborate on how a &#8220;video lie detector&#8221; could possibly comply with EU fundamental rights &#8212; such as the right to dignity, privacy, equality and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s worth noting that the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has raised concerns about misalignment between EU-funded scientific research and data protection law, writing in a <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/20-01-06_opinion_research_en.pdf">preliminary opinion</a> last year: &#8220;We recommend intensifying dialogue between data protection authorities and ethical review boards for a common understanding of which activities qualify as genuine research, EU codes of conduct for scientific research, closer alignment between EU research framework programmes and data protection standards, and the beginning of a debate on the circumstances in which access by researchers to data held by private companies can be based on public interest&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the iBorderCtrl project specifically the Commission told us that the <span lang="EN-IE">project appointed an ethics advisor to oversee the implementation of the ethical aspects of research &#8220;in compliance with the initial ethics requirement&#8221;. </span><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;The advisor works in ways to ensure autonomy and independence from the consortium&#8221;, it claimed, without disclosing who the project&#8217;s (self-appointed) ethics advisor is. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;Ethics aspects are constantly monitored by the Commission/REA during the execution of the project through the revision of relevant deliverables and carefully analysed in cooperation with external independent experts during the technical review meetings linked to the end of the reporting periods&#8221;, it went on, adding that: &#8220;A satisfactory ethics check was conducted in March 2019&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>It did not provide any further details about this self-regulatory &#8220;ethics check&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way how it works so far is basically some expert group that the Commission sets up with propose/call for tender&#8221;, says Breyer, discussing how the EU&#8217;s research program is structured. &#8220;It&#8217;s dominated by industry experts, it doesn&#8217;t have any members of parliament in there, it only has &#8212; I think &#8212; one civil society representative in it, so that&#8217;s falsely composed right from the start. Then it goes to the Research Executive Agency and the actual decision is taking by representatives of the Member States.</p>
<p>&#8220;The call [for research proposals] itself doesn&#8217;t sound so bad if you look it up &#8212; it&#8217;s very general &#8212; so the problem really was the specific proposal that they proposed in response to it. And these are not screened by independent experts, as far as I understand it. The issue of ethics is dealt with by self assessment. So basically the applicant is supposed to indicate whether there is a high ethical risk involved in the project or not. And only if they indicate so will experts &#8212; selected by the REA &#8212; do an ethics assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s been selected, we don&#8217;t know their opinions &#8212; it&#8217;s also being kept secret &#8212; and if it turns out later that a project is unethical it&#8217;s not possible to revoke the grant&#8221;.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy charge comes in sharply here because the Commission is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">shaping risk-based rules for the application of AI</a>. And EU lawmakers have been saying for years that artificial intelligence technologies need &#8220;guardrails&#8221; to make sure they&#8217;re applied in line with regional values and rights.</p>

<p>Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/europes-recharged-antitrust-chief-makes-her-five-year-pitch-to-be-digital-evp/">has talked about</a> the need for rules to ensure artificial intelligence is &#8220;used ethically&#8221; and can &#8220;support human decisions and not undermine them&#8221;, for example.</p>
<p>Yet EU institutions are simultaneously splashing public funds on AI research that would clearly be unlawful if implemented in the region, and which civil society critics decry as obviously unethical given the lack of scientific basis underpinning &#8220;lie detection&#8221;.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.iborderctrl.eu/Frequently-Asked-Questions">FAQ section</a> of the iBorderCtrl website, the commercial consortia behind the project concedes that real-world deployment of some of the technologies involved would not be covered by the existing EU legal framework &#8212; adding that this means &#8220;they could not be implemented without a democratic political decision establishing a legal basis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Or, put another way, such a system would be illegal to actually use for border checks in Europe without a change in the law. Yet European taxpayer funding was nonetheless ploughed in.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the EDPS declined to comment on Breyer&#8217;s case specifically but he confirmed that its preliminary opinion on scientific research and data protection is still relevant.</p>
<p>He also pointed to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/ohjeet/guidelines-032020-processing-data-concerning-health-purpose_en">further related work </a>which addresses a recent Commission push to encourage pan-EU health data sharing for research purposes &#8212; where the EDPS advises that data protection safeguards should be defined &#8220;at the outset&#8221; and also that a &#8220;thought through&#8221; legal basis should be established <em>ahead</em> of research taking place.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The EDPS recommends paying special attention to the ethical use of data within the [health data sharing] framework, for which he suggests taking into account existing ethics committees and their role in the context of national legislation&#8221;, the EU&#8217;s chief data supervisor writes, adding that he&#8217;s</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;convinced that the success of the [health data sharing plan] will depend on the establishment of a strong data governance mechanism that provides for sufficient assurances of a lawful, responsible, ethical management anchored in EU values, including respect for fundamental rights&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>tl;dr: Legal and ethical use of data must be the DNA of research efforts &#8212; not a check-box afterthought.</p>

<h2>Unverifiable tech</h2>
<p>In addition to a lack of independent ethics oversight of research projects that gain EU funding, there is &#8212; currently and worryingly for supposedly commercially minded research &#8212; no way for outsiders to independently verify (or, well, falsify) the technology involved.</p>
<p>In the case of the iBorderCtrl tech no meaningful data on the outcomes of the project has been made public and requests for data sought under freedom of information law have been blocked on commercial interest grounds.</p>
<p>Breyer has been trying without success to obtain information about the results of the project since it finished in 2019. The Guardian reported in detail on his fight back in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/10/sci-fi-surveillance-europes-secretive-push-into-biometric-technology">December</a>.</p>
<p>Under the legal framework wrapping EU research he says there&#8217;s only a very limited requirement to publish information on project outcomes &#8212; and only long after the fact. His hope is thus that the Court of Justice will agree &#8220;commercial interests&#8221; can&#8217;t be used to over-broadly deny disclosure of information in the public interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;They basically argue there is no obligation to examine whether a project actually works so they have the right to fund research that doesn&#8217;t work&#8221;, he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;They also argue that basically it&#8217;s sufficient to exclude access if any publication of the information would damage the ability to sell the technology &#8212; and that&#8217;s an extremely wide interpretation of commercially sensitive information.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I would accept is excluding information that really contains business secrets like source code of software programs or internal calculations or the like. But that certainly shouldn&#8217;t cover, for example, if a project is labelled as unethical. It&#8217;s not a business secret but obviously it will harm their ability to sell it &#8212; but obviously that interpretation is just outrageously wide&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that this [legal action] will be a precedent to clarify that information on such unethical &#8212; and also unlawful if it were actually used or deployed &#8212; technologies, that the public right to know takes precedence over the commercial interests to sell the technology&#8221;, he adds. &#8220;They are saying we won&#8217;t release the information because doing so will diminish the chances of selling the technology. And so when I saw this then I said well it&#8217;s definitely worth going to court over because they will be treating all requests the same&#8221;.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations have also been thwarted in attempts to get detailed information about the iBorderCtrl project. The Intercept reported in 2019 that researchers at the Milan-based <a href="https://www.hermescenter.org/">Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights</a> used freedom of information laws to obtain <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/projectid:41912-iBorderCtrl">internal documents</a> about the iBorderCtrl system, for example, but the hundreds of pages they got back were heavily redacted &#8212; with many completely blacked out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard from [journalists] who have tried in vain to find out about other dubious research projects that they are massively withholding information. Even stuff like the ethics report or the legal assessment &#8212; that&#8217;s all stuff that doesn&#8217;t contain any commercial secrets, as such&#8221;, Breyer continues. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t contain any source code, nor any sensitive information &#8212; they haven&#8217;t even released these partially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it outrageous that an EU authority [the REA] will actually say we don&#8217;t care what the interest is in this because as soon as it could diminish sales then we will withhold the information. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s acceptable, both in terms of taxpayers&#8217; interests in knowing about what their money is being used for but also in terms of the scientific interest in being able to test/to verify these experiments on the so called &#8216;deception detection&#8217; &#8212; which is very contested if it really works. And in order to verify or falsify it scientists of course need to have access to the specifics about these trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also democratically speaking if ever the legislator wants to decide on the introduction of such a system or even on the framing of these research programs we basically need to know the details &#8212; for example what was the number of false positives? How well does it really work? Does it have a discriminatory effect because it works less well on certain groups of people such as facial recognition technology. That&#8217;s all stuff that we really urgently need to know&#8221;.</p>
<p>Regarding access to documents related to EU-funded research the Commission referred us to Regulation no. 1049/2001 &#8212; which it said &#8220;lays down the general principles and limits&#8221; &#8212; though it added that &#8220;each case is analysed carefully and individually&#8221;.</p>
<p>However the Commission&#8217;s interpretation of the regulations of the Horizon program appears to entirely exclude the application of the freedom of information &#8212; at least in the iBorderCtrl project case.</p>
<p>Per Breyer, they limit public disclosure to a summary of the research findings &#8212; that can be published some three or four years after the completion of the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see an essay of five or six pages in some scientific magazine about this project and of course you can&#8217;t use it to verify or falsify the technology&#8221;, he says. &#8220;You can&#8217;t see what exactly they&#8217;ve been doing &#8212; who they&#8217;ve been talking to. So this summary is pretty useless scientifically and to the public and democratically and it takes ages. So I hope that in the future we will get more insight and hopefully a public debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>The EU research program&#8217;s legal framework is secondary legislation. So Breyer&#8217;s argument is that a blanket clause about protecting &#8220;commercial interests&#8221; should not be able to trump fundamental EU rights to transparency. But of course it will be up to the court to decide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I stand some good chance especially since transparency and access to information is actually a fundamental right in the EU &#8212; it&#8217;s in the EU charter of fundamental rights. And this Horizon legislation is only secondary legislation &#8212; they can&#8217;t deviate from the primary law. And they need to be interpreted in line with it&#8221;, he adds. &#8220;So I think the court will hopefully say that this is applicable and they will do some balancing in the context of the freedom of information which also protects commercial information but subject to prevailing public interests. So I think they will find a good compromise and hopefully better insight and more transparency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll blacken out some parts of the document, redact some of it but certainly I hope that in principle we will get access to that. And thereby also make sure that in the future the Commission and the REA will have to hand over most of the stuff that&#8217;s been requested on this research. Because there&#8217;s a lot of dubious projects out there&#8221;.</p>
<p>A better system of research project oversight could start by having the committee that decides on funding applications not being comprised of mostly industry and EU Member State representatives (who of course will always want EU cash to come to their region) &#8212; but also parliamentary representatives, more civil society representatives and scientists, per Breyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should have independent participants and those should be the majority&#8221;, he says. &#8220;That would make sense to steer the research activities in the direction of public good, of compliance with our values, of useful research &#8212; because what we need to know and understand is research that will never be used because it doesn&#8217;t work or it&#8217;s unethical or it&#8217;s illegal, that wastes money for other programs that would be really important and useful&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also points to a new EU research program being set up that&#8217;s focused on defence &#8212; under the same structure, lacking proper public scrutiny of funding decisions or information disclosure, noting: &#8220;They want to do this for defence as well. So that will be even about lethal technologies&#8221;.</p>
<p>To date the only disclosures around iBorderCtrl have been a few parts of the technical specifications of its system and some of a communications report, per Breyer, who notes that both were &#8220;heavily redacted&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t say for example which border agencies they have introduced this system to, they don&#8217;t say which politicians they&#8217;ve been talking to&#8221;, he says. &#8220;The interesting thing actually is that part of this funding is also presenting the technology to border authorities in the EU and politicians. Which is very interesting because the Commission keeps saying look this is only research; it doesn&#8217;t matter really. But in actual fact they are already using the project to promote the technology and the sales of it. And even if this is never used at EU borders funding the development will mean that it could be used by other governments &#8212; it could be sold to China and Saudi Arabia and the like.</p>
<p>&#8220;And also the deception detection technology &#8212; the company that is marketing it [a Manchester-based company called Silent Talker Ltd] &#8212; is also offering it to insurance companies, or to be used on job interviews, or maybe if you apply for a loan at a bank. So this idea that an AI system would be able to detect lies risks being used in the private sector very broadly and since I&#8217;m saying that it doesn&#8217;t work at all and it&#8217;s basically a lottery lots of people risk having disadvantages from this dubious technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite outrageous that nobody prevents the EU from funding such &#8216;voodoo&#8217; technology&#8221;, he adds.</p>
<p>The Commission told us that &#8220;The <u></u>Intelligent Portable Border Control System&#8221; (aka <span class="il">iBorderCtrl</span>) &#8220;explored new ideas on increasing efficiency, convenience and security of land border crossing&#8221;, and like all security research projects it was &#8220;aimed at testing new ideas and technologies to address security challenges&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;iBorderCtrl</span> was not expected to deliver ready-made technologies or products. Not all research projects lead to the development of technologies with real-world applications. Once research projects are over, it is up to Member States to decide whether they want to further research and/or develop solutions studied by the project&#8221;, it also said. <u></u><u></u></p>
<p>It also pointed out that specific application of any future technology &#8220;will always have to respect EU and national law and safeguards, including on fundamental rights and the EU rules on the protection of personal data&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, Breyer also calls foul on the Commission seeking to deflect public attention by claiming &#8216;it&#8217;s only R&amp;D&#8217; or that it&#8217;s not deciding on the use of any particular technology. &#8220;Of course factually it creates pressure on the legislator to agree to something that has been developed if it turns out to be useful or to work&#8221;, he argues. &#8220;And also even if it&#8217;s not used by the EU itself it will be sold somewhere else &#8212; and so I think the lack of scrutiny and ethical assessment of this research is really scandalous. Especially as they have repeatedly developed and researched surveillance technologies &#8212; including mass surveillance of public spaces&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have projects on Internet on bulk data collection and processing of Internet data. The security program is very problematic because they do research into interferences with fundamental rights &#8212; with the right to privacy&#8221;, he goes on. &#8220;There are no limitations really in the program to rule out unethical methods of mass surveillance or the like. And not only are there no material limitations but also there is no institutional set-up to be able to exclude such projects right from the beginning. And then even once the programs have been devised and started they will even refuse to disclose access to them. And that&#8217;s really outrageous and as I said I hope the court will do some proper balancing and provide for more insight and then we can basically trigger a public debate on the design of these research schemes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pointing again to the Commission&#8217;s plan to set up a defence R&amp;D fund under the same industry-centric decision-making structure &#8212; with a &#8220;similarly deficient ethics appraisal mechanism&#8221; &#8212; he notes that while there are some limits on EU research being able to fund autonomous weapons, other areas could make bids for taxpayer cash &#8212; such as weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this will be hugely problematic and will have the same issue of transparency, all the more of course&#8221;, he adds.</p>
<p>On transparency generally, the Commission told us it &#8220;always encourages projects to publicise as much as possible their results&#8221;. While, for iBorderCtrl specifically, it said more information about the project is available on the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/700626&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612601598439000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdBIuIOwTxqUsMxmai8hWQ-GA0eA">CORDIS website</a> and the dedicated <a href="https://www.iborderctrl.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.iborderctrl.eu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612601598439000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYZJIrojNtfrHdVWV4gln1NEqyjA">project website</a>. <u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Laura Wittig and Liza Moiseeva met as guests on a podcast about sustainable fashion, they jibed so well together that they began one of their own: <a href="https://brightly.eco/podcast/5/">Good Together.</a> Their show’s goal was to provide listeners with a place to learn how to be eco-conscious consumers, but with baby steps.</p>
<p>Wittig thinks the non-judgmental environment (one that doesn’t knock on a consumer for not being zero-waste overnight) is the show’s biggest differentiator. “Then, people were emailing us and asking how they can be on our journey beyond being a listener,” Wittig said. Now, over a year after launching the show, the co-hosts are turning validation from listeners into the blueprint for a standalone business: Brightly.</p>
<p><a href="https://brightly.eco/">Brightly</a> is a curated platform that sells vetted eco-friendly goods and shares tips about conscious consumerism. While the startup is launching with more than 200 products from eco-friendly brands, such as<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-sheets-giggles-made-600000-8-months-selling-bed-colin-mcintosh"> Sheets &amp; Giggles </a> and <a href="https://juicebeauty.com/">Juice Beauty</a>, the long-term vision is to start their own commerce brand of Brightly-branded products. The starting lineup will include two to four products in the home space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To get those products out by the holiday season, Brightly tells TechCrunch that it has raised $1 million in venture funding from investors, including Tacoma Venture Fund, Keeler Investments, Odile Roujol (a FAB Ventures backer and former L’Oréal CEO) and Female Founder’s Alliance.</p>
<p>The funding caps off a busy 12 months for Brightly. The startup has gone through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/snaps-yellow-accelerator-debuts-its-third-batch-of-investments/">Snap’s Yellow accelerator</a>, an in-house effort from the social media company that began in 2018. As part of the program Snap invests $150,000 in each Yellow startup for an equity stake. The company also did Ready Set Raise, an equity-free accelerator put on by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/ready-set-raise-an-accelerator-for-women-third-class/"> Female Founders Alliance</a>, in the fall.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vjsq1tj6lT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/ready-set-raise-an-accelerator-for-women-third-class/">Ready Set Raise, an accelerator for women built by women, announces third class</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ready Set Raise, an accelerator for women built by women, announces third class&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/ready-set-raise-an-accelerator-for-women-third-class/embed/#?secret=Vjsq1tj6lT" data-secret="Vjsq1tj6lT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With new funding, Brightly is seeking to take a Glossier-style approach to become the next big brand in commerce: gather a community by recommending great products, then turn the strategy on its head and make your superfans buy in-house products under the same brand.</p>
<p>“We have access to a community of women who are beating our door down to shop directly with us and have exclusive products made for them,” Wittig said.</p>
<p>Brightly wants to be more than a “boring storefront” one could quickly whip up on Shopify or Amazon, Wittig says.</p>
<p>The company’s curation process, which every product goes through before being listed on the platform, is extensive. The startup makes sure that every product is created with sustainable and ethical supply chain processes and sustainable material. The team also interviews every brand’s founders to understand the genesis of any product that lives on the Brightly platform. The co-founders also weigh the durability and longevity of products, adopting what Wittig sees as a “Wirecutter approach.”</p>
<p>“It’s more like, ‘why would we pick an ethically produced leather handbag over something that might be made not from leather but wouldn’t last too long necessarily,’ ” she said. “These are the conversations we have with our audience, because the term eco-friendly is very much our grayscale.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109052" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109052" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2109052" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png" alt="" width="455" height="810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen3_iPhone.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 455px) 100vw, 455px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109052" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brightly</p></div></p>
<p>More than 250,000 people come to Brightly, either through their app or website, every day, according to Wittig. The startup monetizes largely through brand partnerships and getting those users in front of paid products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109050" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109050" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2109050" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png" alt="" width="570" height="1014" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen2_iPhone.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109050" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brightly</p></div></p>
<p>The monetization strategy is similar to what you might find a podcast use: affiliate links or product placement mid-episode. But while the co-founders are relying on this strategy right now, they see the opportunity to create their own e-commerce company as larger and more lucrative.</p>
<p>“The billion-dollar opportunity is not with that,” Wittig said. “The value will be going direct commerce and selling our picks of ethical sustainable goods.”</p>
<p>Marking the transition from podcasting about eco-friendly goods to creating them in-house is a strong pivot. The co-founders consider creating a distribution commerce channel to be a larger opportunity and likely more lucrative than the podcasting business.</p>
<p>Beyond creating a line of their own products, Brightly is thinking about how to partner with white-label sustainable products. Another option, Wittig said, is to partner with big corporations to get products on their shelves with colors and customization for Brightly. An example of an ideal partnership would be <a href="https://www.blueland.com/products/the-routine-clean-kit?gclid=CjwKCAiAjeSABhAPEiwAqfxURQf59swA2LnkAAPR8zTUSTwe-k-wdP9vVhs9KU4ZFJ1NgaAunlJ99xoC5eoQAvD_BwE">Reformation’s recent partnership with Blueland.</a></p>
<p>Wittig declined to share more details on how they plan to win, but likened the strategy to that of Goop or Glossier, two companies that started with content arms and drew their community into a commerce platform.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be a Thrive Market where there are hundreds and thousands of sustainable goods on there. It’s going to be much more curated,” she said.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has helped the startup further validate the need for a platform that unites a conscious consumer community.</p>
<p>“We are all so aware of the purchasing power we have,” she said. “As consumers we go out and support small businesses by getting coffee on the go. But before, we did not think twice about getting everything from Amazon.”</p>
<p>The conversation with investors hasn’t been as simple, the co-founder said. Investors continue to be “hands off” about community-based platforms because they are unsure it will work. Wittig says that many bearish investors have placed bets on singular direct-to-consumer brands, such as Away or Blueland.</p>
<p>“Those investors know the rising costs of customer acquisition, and see what happens when you don’t have a community that surrounds our business,” she said.</p>
<p>Brightly is betting that the future of commerce brands has to start with a go-to-market, and then bring in the end-product, instead of the other way. The end goal here for Brightly is attracting, and generating excitement from, Gen Z and millennial shoppers. To do so, Wittig says that Brightly is experimenting with ways to implement socialization aspects into the shopping experience.</p>
<p>Leslie Feinzaig, the founder of Female Founders Alliance, said that what’s special about Brightly is that it “demonstrated demand before building for it.”</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people today could build software to connect people and sell things, but very few people could get thousands of fanatical followers to actually engage with each other and make that software useful,” Feinzaig said. “Brightly built that community with matchsticks and tape.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://be-great.tv/">BeGreatTV</a>, an online education platform featuring Black and brown instructors, recently closed a $450K pre-seed round from Stand Together Ventures Lab, Arlan Hamilton, Tiffany Haddish and others.</p>
<p>The goal with BeGreatTV is to enable anyone to learn from talented Black and brown innovators and leaders, founder and CEO Cortney Woodruff told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you think of being a Black or brown person or individual who wants to learn from a Black or brown person, there’s nothing that really exists that gives you a glossary of every business vertical and where you see representation at every level in a well put together way,&#8221; Woodruff said. &#8220;That alone makes our market a lot larger because there are just so many verticals where no one has really invested in or shown before.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The courses are designed to teach folks how to execute and succeed in a particular industry, and enable people to better understand the business aspect of industries while also teaching &#8220;you how to deal with the socioeconomic and racial injustices that come with being the only one in the room. Whether you are a Black man or woman who wants to get into the makeup industry, there will always be a lot of biases in the world.&#8221;</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490083961?portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<p>When BeGreatTV launches in a couple of months (the plan is to launch in April), the platform will feature at least 10 courses &#8212; each with around 15 episodes &#8212; focused on arts, entertainment, beauty and more. At launch, courses will be available from Sir John, a celebrity makeup artist for L&#8217;Oréal and Beyoncé&#8217;s personal makeup artist, BeGreatTV co-founder Cortez Bryant, who was also Lil Wayne and Drake&#8217;s manager, as well as Law Roach, Zendaya&#8217;s stylist.</p>
<p>Hamilton and Haddish will also teach their own respective courses on business and entertainment, Woodruff said. So far, BeGreatTV has produced more than 40 episodes that range anywhere from three to 15 minutes each.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108553" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108553" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108553" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png 856w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/begreattv-taught-by-sir-john.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108553" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BeGreatTV</p></div></p>
<p>Each course will cost $64.99, and the plan is to eventually offer an all-access subscription model once BeGreatTV beefs up its offerings a bit more. For instructors, BeGreatTV shares royalties with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, the platform can include a more diverse casting of instructors that aren&#8217;t just Black and brown,&#8221; Woodruff said. But for now, he said, the idea is to &#8220;reverse the course of &#8216;Now this is our first Black instructor&#8217; but &#8216;now this is the first white instructor&#8217; &#8221; on the platform.</p>
<p>BeGreatTV&#8217;s team consists of just 15 people, but includes heavy hitters like Cortez Bryant and actor Jesse Williams. Currently, BeGreatTV is working on closing its seed round and anticipates a six-figure user base by the end the year.</p>
<p>MasterClass is perhaps BeGreatTV&#8217;s biggest competitor. With classes taught by the likes of Gordon Ramsay, Shonda Rhimes and David Sedaris, it&#8217;s no wonder why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content/">MasterClass has become worth more than $800 million</a>. The company&#8217;s $180 annual subscription fee accounts for all of its revenue.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you benchmark [BeGreatTV] to MasterClass, we are finding individuals that are not only the best at what they do in the world, but often times these individuals have broken barriers because often times they were the first to do it,&#8221; Woodruff said. &#8220;And do it without having people who look like them.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Myanmar&#8217;s new military government has <a href="https://twitter.com/waiwainu/status/1357720557421268992">ordered</a> local telecom operators, internet gateways, and other internet service providers to block Twitter and Instagram in the South Asian country days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/myanmar-orders-telecom-networks-to-temporarily-block-facebook/">imposing a similar blackout on Facebook</a> to ensure &#8220;stability&#8221; in the Southeast Asian nation.</p>
<p>Norwegian telecom giant Telenor, which is one of the largest telecos in Myanmar, <a href="https://www.telenor.com/directive-to-block-social-media-services-twitter-and-instagram-in-myanmar/">said</a> the government has ordered ISPs to block Twitter and Instagram &#8220;until further notice.&#8221; The directive has &#8220;legal basis in Myanmar’s telecommunications law,&#8221; Telenor said, but it is challenging the &#8220;necessity and proportionality of the directive in its response to Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications, and highlighted the directive’s contradiction with international human rights law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds: &#8220;Telenor Group is gravely concerned with this development in Myanmar, and emphasises that freedom of expression through access to communication services should be maintained at all times, especially during times of conflict. Customers in Myanmar trying to access the affected services on web will be directed to a landing page, which states that the site cannot be reached due to the directive by MoTC. Telenor Group believes in open communication. Together with Telenor Myanmar we are actively looking to restore access to the services as soon as possible.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several users from Myanmar <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/myanmar/">confirmed</a> that they were unable to access Twitter. NetBlocks, which tracks global internet usage, further reported that multiple networks in the country had started to block the American social network.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch: &#8220;We’re deeply concerned about the order to block Internet services in Myanmar. It undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard. The Open Internet is increasingly under threat around the world. We will continue to advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns. We understand some people across the Asia-Pacific region may also be having trouble accessing Twitter, and we’re working to fix it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nation&#8217;s Transport and Communications alleged in its order, dated February 5, that Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram were being abused to spread propaganda and misinformation to the public and this posed threat to stability of the nation. The ministry had offered the same explanation when it ordered to temporarily block Facebook until February 7th midnight earlier this week. (State-owned MPT, the largest telecom operator in Myanmar, was already blocking Instagram, as well as WhatsApp on its network, according to NetBlocks.)</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s order comes as thousands of Myanmar citizens joined Twitter this week to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Myanmar-coup-latest-Protesters-jump-to-Twitter-after-Facebook-blocked">protest the new military government</a> that seized power by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2A00VK">detaining civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi</a> and other democratically elected leaders of her National League for Democracy, which won by landslide last year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week on Extra Crunch Live, the duo explained how they came together for Grafana's Series A — and eventually, its Series B. We've included highlights as well as the full video of our conversation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before he was a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, Gaurav Gupta had his eye on Grafana Labs, the company that supports open-source analytics platform <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/">Grafana</a>. But Raj Dutt, Grafana&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, played hard to get.</p>
<p>This week on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo explained how they came together for Grafana&#8217;s Series A — and eventually, its Series B. They also walked us through Grafana&#8217;s original Series A pitch deck before Gupta shared the aspects that stood out to him and how he communicated those points to the broader partnership at Lightspeed.</p>
<p>Gupta and Dutt also offered feedback on pitch decks submitted by audience members and shared their thoughts about what makes a great founder presentation, pulling back the curtain on how VCs actually consume pitch decks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve included highlights below as well as the full video of our conversation.</p>
<p>We record new episodes of Extra Crunch Live each Wednesday at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST/8 p.m. GMT. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Check out the February schedule here.</a></p>
<h2>Episode breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How they met — 2:20</li>
<li>Grafana&#8217;s early pitch deck — 12:25</li>
<li>The enterprise ecosystem — 26:00</li>
<li>The pitch deck teardown — 33:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>How they met</h2>
<p>As soon as Gupta joined Lightspeed in June 2019, he began pursuing Dutt and Grafana Labs. He texted, called and emailed, but he got little to no response. Eventually, he made plans to go meet the team in Stockholm but, even then, Dutt wasn&#8217;t super responsive.</p>
<p>The pair told the story with smiles on their faces. Dutt said that not only was he disorganized and not entirely sure of his own travel plans to see his co-founder in Stockholm, Grafana wasn&#8217;t even raising. Still, Gupta persisted and eventually sent a stern email.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one point, I was like &#8216;Raj, forget it. This isn&#8217;t working&#8217;,&#8221; recalled Gupta. &#8220;And suddenly he woke up.&#8221; Gupta added that he got mad, which &#8220;usually does not work for VCs, by the way, but in this case, it kind of worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they finally met, they got along. Dutt said they were able to talk shop due to Gupta&#8217;s experience inside organizations like Splunk and Elastic. Gupta described the trip as a whirlwind, where time just flew by.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the reasons that I liked Gaurav is that he was a new VC,&#8221; explained Dutt. &#8220;So to me, he seemed like one of the most non-VC VCs I&#8217;d ever met. And that was actually quite attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this day, Gupta and Dutt don&#8217;t have weekly standing meetings. Instead, they speak several times a week, conversing organically about industry news, Grafana&#8217;s products and the company&#8217;s overall trajectory.</p>
<h2>Grafana&#8217;s early pitch deck</h2>
<p>Dutt shared Grafana&#8217;s pre-Series A pitch deck — which he actually sent to Gupta and Lightspeed before they met — with the Extra Crunch Live audience. But as we know now, it was the conversations that Dutt and Gupta had (eventually) that provided the spark for that deal.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[In a single week, Robinhood raised more money than all startups in Spain, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia combined last year.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robinhood has shown an impressive ability to raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">enormous amounts of capital</a> in the past few weeks to ensure it has the funds needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">allow users to trade</a> and, presumably, provide it with enough cash until it goes public. Raising $3.4 billion so quickly is an extraordinary feat.</p>
<p>But how the company managed to get investors to wire money with such alacrity has been a curiosity; what about Robinhood was <em>so</em> compelling that giving it a multibillion dollar injection was such an obvious decision?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>We got a whiff of it when we parsed Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020 payment for order flow (PFOF) data, which showed the discount trading service growing nicely from its Q3 results. Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF revenue growth had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/">slowed in sequential terms in the third quarter of 2020</a>, but the final quarter iced near-term concerns that the unicorn&#8217;s growth days were behind it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But then the company gave us a little more, a few charts that I think better explain why Robinhood was able to raise so much money so quickly.</p>
<h2>Equities and options volumes go up</h2>
<p>The reason why Robinhood was able to raise lots more cash very quickly was because the company&#8217;s PFOF revenue driver likely went into overdrive during the mess that was the GameStop period, This is somewhat obvious, as many people were trading.</p>
<p>But thanks to a new chart from the company <a href="https://robinhood.engineering/reflections-on-robinhoods-growth-4f117e75adc5">posted on its own blog</a>, we now know that Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF incomes were likely spiking to all-time highs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the chart the company published, which I have loosely marked with quarterly intervals. Per Robinhood, the green line is &#8220;Robinhood equities and options trading volumes over a longer time horizon, through last week:&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tickr.co.uk/">Tickr</a>, an app that allows U.K. consumers to make financial investments based on their impact on society and the environment, has secured £2.5 million ($3.4 million) in funding lead by <a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a>, a VC which focuses on &#8220;impact&#8221; startups. The cash will be used for product development, expanding the user base, and eventually taking Tickr into other European countries from its current U.K. base.</p>
<p>As well as investing, the platform allows customers to spend their cash via partnerships with impact-oriented compares, and offset their carbon footprint through a subscription. The core business model is £1 p/m per customer, plus 0.30% on assets above £3,000. Additional products, like carbon offsets, for example, are charged as a separate additional subscription depending on the tier selected.</p>
<p>The startup says it is approaching 100,000 users in the U.K. and is reaching a millennial audience, 90% of which have &#8220;never invested before&#8221; (they say) and these users are investing £250 per month on average.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The app is not billed as a trading app, with quick &#8220;in and outs&#8221;, but is about building wealth whilst investing in a diversified portfolio of high-impact companies. Its competitors include <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/">MoneyBox</a>, but Tickr says it is “100% pure impact focus” by contrast. The vast majority of Europeans don&#8217;t invest in markets, so this could be a good opportunity for the product.</p>
<p>Founders Tom McGillycuddy and Matt Latham spent eight years working in investment management, but say they became disillusioned by the jargon, high fees and indifference to causes such as the environment.</p>
<p>Over text interview, McGillycuddy told me: “We also realized there was zero consideration for the underlying impact of the investments people were making; it was purely about the return. Coming from Wigan and Liverpool, we were the first people in our families to be exposed to this world, and it didn&#8217;t seem right.” The pair moved into impact investing and subsequently went on to launch Tickr in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India is restoring 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, a senior government official said Friday evening, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/india-gets-more-aggressive-with-internet-shutdowns-to-curb-protests/">18 months after imposing a sweeping communications blackout</a> in the Muslim-majority region in an attempt to curb the spread of potential backlash over New Delhi&#8217;s decision to revoke Kashmir&#8217;s semiautonomous status in August of 2019.</p>
<p>Rohit Kansal, principal secretary of the Jammu and Kashmir government, said 4G internet services were being restored in the entire region.</p>
<p>India partially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/india-restores-social-media-access-in-kashmir-for-2-weeks/">lifted the ban on internet</a> in two districts &#8212; out of 20 &#8212; of the state last year but maintained speed restrictions (2G internet), after a ruling from the Supreme Court that found an indefinite shutdown of the internet in the state <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/internet-shutdown-supreme-court-india-kashmir/">unwarranted, and demonstrated “abuse of power”</a> by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lifting of restrictions at the time had applied to 301 &#8220;whitelisted&#8221; services that included entertainment platforms such as Netflix and Amazon and some news outlets including The New York Times. Many Indian news outlets remained blocked, along with all social media. Many residents complained that the slow 2G speeds barely allowed them to check their emails and WhatsApp messages.</p>
<p>The internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir, home to more than 13 million people, has been by far the longest by any democracy.</p>
<p>In August, New Delhi told Supreme Court that it will start offering high-speed internet in one district of Jammu and one of Kashmir Valley on a &#8220;trial basis.&#8221; Late last year, the government resumed broadband service in the region. Critics have said that ban on internet has cost citizens of Jammu and Kashmir hundreds of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dublin-based <a href="https://www.frontline.vc/">Frontline Ventures</a> has released details of its new €70 million ($83.8 million) Frontline Seed Fund III, which will be aimed at European B2B startups. The new fund will bring Frontline&#8217;s total funds under management to €250 million, deployed out of its offices in London, Dublin and San Francisco. Backers of the fund include the European Investment Fund (EIF), Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Irish banking giant AIB, along with 10 tech angels, largely post-exit entrepreneurs, from Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>The new fund has already begun to invest in early-stage companies, and is aiming at investing in up to 45 companies over the next four years. Investments will range from €250,000 to €2.5 million. It follows Frontline’s recent new U.S.-based growth-stage fund, Frontline X, which is geared to U.S. startups wanting to expand to Europe and the EU region, given that Ireland is an EU member, and well placed to benefit from the ramifications of Brexit.</p>
<p>William McQuillan, partner, said the fund would invest about 50% of the fund into new early-stage companies. The remaining funds will be delayed for later investments in existing portfolio companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s McQuillan’s view that, with Europe having 26% of all the global B2B software market and the U.S. at 50 to 55%, Europe has plenty of growth opportunities.</p>
<p>The new seed fund launches at a time when U.S. VC firms are putting down roots in Europe, such as Sequoia, which opened an office in London last year, and more recently General Catalyst. In May of 2020, Frontline invested in Irish HQ’d company Evervault, alongside Kleiner Perkins, Index and Sequoia.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of Frontline’s seed portfolio companies have raised capital from U.S. VCs since 2012, and Frontline partners have experience with companies such as Google, Twitter, SurveyMonkey, Airtable and Yammer.</p>
<p>In a statement, McQuillan said, &#8220;When we looked at the data back in 2012 &#8211; at the very start of Frontline &#8211; it was painfully clear that European entrepreneurs lacked the infrastructure and support to build a global business out of Europe. Today, Europe rightfully finds itself on top-tier US investors’ target list, but global expansion remains an important challenge to solve. As a team, we&#8217;ve pooled all of our experience and resources into helping our founders cross the Atlantic. Seed Fund III will be an extension of our work &#8211; to help founders get off the ground &#8211; and go global.”</p>
<p>Frontline’s more notable investments include Linked Finance, Clearbanc and Currencyfair. The Frontline X growth fund has invested in the Series B of TripActions; People.ai’s $100 million Series C; and Clearbanc’s $50 million Series B.</p>
<p>Notable exits include Logentries, which was acquired by Rapid7; Orchestrate, acquired by CenturyLink; and Pointy acquired by Google in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.djamo.ci/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a financial super app for consumers in Francophone Africa, is the first startup from Ivory Coast to get backing from Y Combinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a huge profusion of financial services that have emerged in recent years in Africa, Djamo’s mission is to try to plug one specific and very underserved gap in Francophone Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the region, less than 25% of adults have bank accounts, as the focus for banks remains the top 10-20% wealthiest customers. The rest, which is a <a href="http://observatoire.francophonie.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Francophones-Statistiques-par-pays.pdf">huge segment of the market</a> of about 120 million people, is not perceived as profitable. But as banks slacked, mobile money from the region&#8217;s telcos filled in the gap. In the last 10 years, their wallets have reached more than 60% of the population &#8212; proof of how many millions of French-speaking natives were hungry for financial services. Today, this mobile money infrastructure and reach allows startups to build upon their existing payment infrastructure to democratize access through different applications.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo is one such company taking advantage of this opportunity to bring affordable and seamless banking to the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/hassan-bourgi-13165136/en-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan Bourgi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a second-time founder, returned to Ivory Coast after exiting his Latin American-based startup, Busportal, to Naspers-company redBus. There he met </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/regisbamba/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Régis Bamba</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was still working at MTN, one of Africa’s largest telcos, leading several mobile money projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated by the unpleasant banking experiences they and many millennials faced in the country, Bourgi and Bamba launched Djamo last year to challenge the banking industry status quo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Banking services are really difficult to access here, and we saw that as a huge opportunity,&#8221; Djamo CEO Bourgi told TechCrunch. “Since day one, we wanted to design a mobile-first platform that could break into the masses and our combined experience building mass-market consumer products was very critical to launching Djamo.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bourgi, the country&#8217;s millennials are trying to create relations with technology companies and be served differently from the norm. So, Djamo is providing this audience with a better front-end experience and faster customer service.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109257" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109257" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2109257 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png 1180w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=768,375 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/djamo-app-screens-presentation-.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109257" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Djamo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach, they focused on accommodating multiple layers tailored to different user needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it&#8217;s affording Ivorians the luxury to pay for online services like Amazon, Alibaba or Netflix, or providing Visa debit cards in a timely fashion, these tailored approaches have made Djamo grow organically via word of mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why not? Before Djamo came along, the CEO says people would need to go to their bank branches and stay in long queues to get their cards or even load them with credit. Djamo relieves that stress and even allows customers to use their cards with zero fees in a wide range of services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, it was important to offer a zero-fee card with no recurring fee to a certain limit. After that, you pay as you go in transaction fees. There is a premium plan around $4 a month where users can transact to higher limits,&#8221; said Bourgi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Djamo claims to have around 90,000 registered users and processes over 50,000 transactions monthly. However, to get to this point, the company has ridden on sheer resourcefulness around its operations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Nigeria, where there are established payment infrastructure players like Flutterwave and Paystack, Ivory Coast doesn&#8217;t have such household names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;We have a couple of providers, but most are unreliable. But this doesn&#8217;t matter to the end-user, you have to make it work somehow,&#8221; said Bamba, the company&#8217;s CPO and CTO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacking better options, Djamo switches from one provider to another to keep operations running. The year-old startup has also faced scepticism, common with most African fintech startups when they first launch. In Djamo&#8217;s case though, the founders had to go to lengths to prove to banks and customers that the platform was safe to use for onboarding, KYC and transactions.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2109259" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109259" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2109259 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo2-1280x853-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109259" class="wp-caption-text">Hassan Bourgi (CEO) and Régis Bamba (CTO &amp; CPO). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Djamo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onboarding customers also came with its own set of problems: the delivery of Djamo Visa cards. Bourgi says unlike more developed countries on the continent, it is a Herculean task to access efficient delivery and logistics services in Ivory Coast. So, the startup built a delivery app with in-house delivery agents for this particular purpose. &#8220;The objective for our customers is that after registering with us, they get their cards the next day in a timely fashion,&#8221; Bourgi added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even before pushing out its MVP, Djamo had already received monetary validation for its product. In June 2019, it raised a pre-seed investment of $350,000 from private investors &#8212; arguably the largest round at this stage in the Francophone region. The ingenuity of the solution, at least to French-speaking Africa, and the founders&#8217; track record, was crucial to Djamo closing the round, Hassan explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, Francophone Africa has been underrated by international investors, despite signs pointing to the emergence of a budding startup scene. Part of this has to do with language barriers and the region&#8217;s GDP and income per capita where English-speaking countries, excluding South Africa, contribute to 47% of sub-Saharan Africa’s average GDP, while French-speaking countries boast of only 19%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/worldbank/status/1126381505637384192"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that the region will have 62.5% of Africa’s fastest-growing economies by 2021, there&#8217;s bullishness around its growth in the coming years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many untapped opportunities, underrepresented regions like Francophone Africa are ripe for disruption. Investors know this and though their checks are still skewed toward Anglophone Africa, million-dollar raises from Senegalese energy startup, Oolu and Cameroonian healthtech startup, Healthlane in 2020 show their keenness on the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Djamo, both startups are YC-backed and are the other Francophone startups to have made it into the accelerator. But with this Winter 2021 batch, Djamo becomes the first fintech startup from the region. Following Healthlane&#8217;s acceptance in 2020, it is also the first time French-speaking Africa has had representatives for consecutive years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the founders, YC&#8217;s backing validates Djamo&#8217;s premise that financial service distribution across the Francophone Africa region is fundamentally changing toward applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Ivory Coast, people always say that the banking industry is too complex and we can’t do anything about it. But we saw it as a huge opportunity and a great industry to take on. Everywhere you see frustration, customers in pain, there is an opportunity for a business to come and do it better,” said Bamba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After participating in the three-month-long program, which culminates in a Demo Day on March 23rd, Djamo will also take part in Visa&#8217;s </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-program.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fintech Fast Track Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an avenue for the company to leverage the fintech giant&#8217;s network to introduce new payment experiences.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.twincocapital.com/">Twinco Capital</a>, a Madrid and Amsterdam-based startup making it easier to access supply chain finance, has raised €3 million in funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Spanish VC fund Mundi Ventures, with participation from previous backer Finch Capital and several unnamed angels. Twinco Capital also has a debt facility with the Spanish investment bank EBN Banco de Negocios, which is common for any type of lending company.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Sandra Nolasco and Carmen Marin Romano, Twinco Capital offers a supply chain finance solution that includes purchase order funding. To do this, it integrates with large corporates on the purchase side and then funds suppliers by paying up to 60% of the purchase order value upfront and the remainder immediately upon delivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entire process is digital, promising a quick decision and fast deployment of funds, and is powered by Twinco’s supply chain analytics and the data it is able to access by partnering with both sides of the supply chain.</p>
<p>“The financing of global supply chains is expensive and inefficient, the burden of the cost is mostly borne by the suppliers and in particular by those that are SMEs in emerging markets,” explains Twinco Capital co-founder and CEO Sandra Nolasco.</p>
<p>“Take any global supply chain, such as apparel, automotive, electronics etc. Exporters in countries like Bangladesh, China or Vietnam that have been supplying European companies for years, with stable commercial relationships. However, their creditworthiness is still measured only on the basis of annual financials, making access to competitive liquidity a major obstacle for growth”.</p>
<p>By having visibility on both sides, including upcoming orders, Twinco provides liquidity to the suppliers “from purchase order to final invoice payment”.</p>
<p>“We do that by analyzing supply chain data &#8212; the performance of the suppliers, the network effects between common suppliers and buyers (and many more data points I am not allowed to mention!),” says the Twinco CEO. “In short, using advanced data analytics we can better assess, price and significantly mitigate risk. The good news is that the more transactions we fund, the more suppliers and buyers we add, the more robust is our risk assessment. We believe there is a strong network effect”.</p>
<p>To that end, Twinco makes money by charging a “discount fee” for each purchase order it funds. “Since default rates are a fraction of that fee, we can unlock significant value,” says Nolasco.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fintech is also unlocking an asset class for investors and competes with local banks that are much more manual and don’t benefit from increased visibility via network effects. Nolasco says that to ensure interests are aligned, the company uses a portion of equity to also invest in the purchase orders it funds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market. “From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal is shutting down its domestic business in India, less than four years after the American giant kickstarted local operations in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>“From 1 April 2021, we will focus all our attention on enabling more international sales for Indian businesses, and shift focus away from our domestic products in India. This means we will no longer offer domestic payment services within India from 1 April,” said a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>In a long statement, PayPal said its priorities had shifted in India, but did not elaborate why it was winding down the business. A report recently said the company, which has amassed over 360,000 merchants in the country, was struggling to make inroads in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indian news outlet The Morning Context <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/paypal-india-hits-pause-on-domestic-payments-business">reported</a> in December that PayPal was abandoning its local payments business in India, a claim the company had refuted at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shift in priorities, some PayPal employees have been reassigned to new teams. Our focus is to always minimize the impact on our people whenever possible. Overall, our workforce is growing in India, not reducing. We are currently recruiting across our sites in India in large numbers,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the move comes as a surprise. The company said last year that it was building a payments service powered by India&#8217;s UPI railroad, suggesting an increase in the level of investments it was making in the country.</p>
<p>Over the years, PayPal also partnered with a range of popular Indian businesses such as ticketing services BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip and food delivery platform Swiggy to offer a faster checkout experience. At the time of writing, the PayPal website in India appears to have removed all such references.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest battlegrounds for mobile payments firms in recent years. Scores of heavily-backed firms, including Paytm, PhonePe, Google, Amazon and Facebook, are competing to increase their share in India, where the market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion by 2023. Several of these firms also offer a range of payments services for merchants.</p>
<p>The company, which says it processed $1.4 billion worth of international sales for merchants in India last year, added that it will continue to invest in “product development that enables Indian businesses to reach nearly 350 million PayPal consumers worldwide, increase their sales internationally, and help the Indian economy return to growth.”</p>
<p>PayPal <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has been offering cross-border payments support in India for more than a decade. After entering the country, it allowed consumers in India to pay at online merchants with local currency.</span></p>
<p><em>The story was updated with additional details provided by PayPal.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kuaishou, a Chinese video app that&#8217;s largely underappreciated outside China, has just completed a massive initial public offering in Hong Kong. The app is by far the biggest rival for Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, and unlike many Western video platforms that make money from ads and subscriptions, Kuaishou&#8217;s cash cow is its tipping business.</p>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s shares opened in Hong Kong on Friday at HK$338 ($43.6) apiece, a 194% jump from its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2021/0126/2021012600014_c.pdf">IPO price of HK$115</a> ($14.8). That catapults its market cap to nearly HK$1.4 trillion ($180 billion). The company pocketed approximately $5.4 billion from the listing with a total of 365,218,600 shares, excluding the overallotment option.</p>
<p>Kuaishou, which is backed by Tencent, now has a replenished coffer to invest in growth and hopefully work toward profitability. In the first nine months of 2020, the app posted an adjusted net loss of 7.2 billion yuan ($1.1 billion), compared to an adjusted profit of 1.8 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kuaishou&#8217;s stock is a huge hit with both institutional financiers and retail investors from China, many of whom are familiar with the app that boasted 481 million monthly users in the 11 months ended November. The app set a record as the most oversubscribed deal in Hong Kong, attracting retail investor demand totaling $164.8 billion, the South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3119805/tencent-backed-kuaishous-ipo-overbought-1200-times-retail">reported</a>. Its share reached HK$322.8 on the gray market platform operated by Phillip Securities Group and HK$421 on online broker Futu Securities.</p>
<p>Like Douyin, Kuaishou began as a platform for people to create and share 15-second short videos (following a brief period as a GIF app) and later expanded into livestreaming. The transition is natural, as creators who have built a name may seek further interaction with followers, and followers may want to express their loyalty and affection to creators. Livestreaming and virtual gifting fill that need.</p>
<p>Kuaishou has three main monetization methods, with livestreaming making up the majority of its revenue. Fifty-eight million users on Kuaishou spent on live videos monthly in the 11 months ended November, and on average every paying user brought 47.6 yuan ($7.36) in revenue.</p>
<p>The app also sells ads, with each user driving 71.4 yuan ($11) in marketing revenue for the period. Lastly, Kuaishou allows creators to hawk products. The gross merchandise value &#8212; an industry metric used loosely to measure e-commerce transactions &#8212; generated directly on Kuaishou reached 332.7 billion yuan ($51.4 billion) in the period.</p>
<p>For comparison, the livestreaming feature on Alibaba&#8217;s Taobao bazaar generated over <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">400 billion yuan in GMV</a> for the 12 months ended December.</p>
<p>While Kuaishou enjoys growing revenue from livestreaming, regulatory risks loom in the background. The Chinese government has banned users under the age of 18 from purchasing virtual gifts. It has also urged platforms to <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2020/1124/c1004-31941781.html">put a cap</a> on users&#8217; monthly spending on virtual gifts, though regulators haven&#8217;t specified or suggested a limit.</p>
<p>Kuaishou is aware of the risk, noting in its <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/app/sehk/2020/102806/documents/sehk21012400052.pdf">prospectus</a> that &#8220;any limits on user spending on virtual gifting ultimately imposed may negatively impact our revenues derived from virtual gifting and our results of operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until regulators take further action to rein in virtual gifting, Kuaishou will likely continue to thrive while it works on diversifying its business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Democrats in the House voted to strip <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/qanon-congress-house-race-marjorie-taylor-greene/">freshman Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> of some of her responsibilities Thursday, citing her penchant for <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-threats-pelosi-mccarthy-qanon-parkland-163725291.html">violent</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/532534-rep-elect-marjorie-taylor-greene-wears-trump-won-mask-on-house-floor">anti-democratic</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22256258/marjorie-taylor-greene-jewish-space-laser-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theories">at times anti-Semitic</a> conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Greene has expressed support for a range of alarming conspiracies, including the belief that the 2018 Parkland school shooting that killed 17 people was a &#8220;false flag.&#8221; That belief prompted<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/536976-two-major-teachers-unions-call-on-gop-leadership-to-remove-greene-from"> two teachers unions to call for her removal</a> from the House Education Committee — one of her new committee assignments.</p>
<p>The vote on a resolution to remove Greene from her committee assignments broke along party lines, with nearly all Republicans opposing the resolution. Some of her colleagues even voted in Greene&#8217;s defense in spite of condemning her behavior in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the House moved to vote on the highly unusual resolution, the new Georgia lawmaker claimed that her embrace of QAnon was in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never once said during my entire campaign &#8216;QAnon,&#8217; &#8221; Greene said Thursday. &#8220;I never once said any of the things that I am being accused of today during my campaign. I never said any of these things since I have been elected for Congress. These were words of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-claims-she-never-promoted-qanon-after-her-georgia-election-win-thats-not-true?via=twitter_page">Daily Beast&#8217;s Will Sommer reported</a>, a deleted tweet from December shows Greene explicitly defending QAnon and directing blame toward the media and &#8220;big tech.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed today that she hasn&#39;t promoted QAnon since being elected. But on Dec. 4, she praised an article promoting Q in a now-deleted tweet. The story Greene praised as &quot;accurate&quot; calls QAnon an &quot;objective flow of information” that&#39;s &quot;uniting Christians.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/nN3bnTCyPa">pic.twitter.com/nN3bnTCyPa</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In another recently-uncovered post from January 2019, Greene showed support for online comments calling for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-violence/index.html">&#8220;a bullet to the head&#8221; for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and executing FBI agents</a>.</p>
<p>Greene has also shared openly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-marjorie-taylor-greene.html">racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic views in Facebook videos</a>, a track record that prompted Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to condemn her statements as &#8220;appalling&#8221; last June. More recently, McCarthy defended Greene against efforts to remove her from committees.</p>
<p>Greene was elected in November to represent a conservative district in northwest Georgia after her opponent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/17/kevin-van-ausdal-qanon-marjorie-greene-georgia/?arc404=true">Kevin Van Ausdal dropped out, citing personal reasons</a>. Greene beat her opponent in the Republican primary in August, winning 57% of the vote.</p>
<p>QAnon, a dangerous once-fringe collection of conspiracy theories, was well-represented in January&#8217;s deadly Capitol riot and many photos from the day show the prevalence of QAnon symbols and sayings. In 2019, an FBI bulletin warned of QAnon&#8217;s connection to &#8220;conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists.&#8221; A year later, at least one person who had espoused the same views would win a seat in Congress.</p>
<p>The overlap between Greene&#8217;s beliefs and those of the violent pro-Trump mob at the Capitol escalated tensions among lawmakers, many of whom feared for their lives as the assault unfolded.</p>
<p>A freshman representative with little apparent appetite for policy or coalition-building, Greene wasn&#8217;t likely to wield much legislative power in the House. But as QAnon and adjacent conspiracies move from the fringe to the mainstream and possibly back again — a trajectory largely dictated by the at times arbitrary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/twitter-qanon-ban/">decisions of social media companies</a> — Greene&#8217;s treatment in Congress may signal what&#8217;s to come for a dangerous online movement that&#8217;s more than demonstrated its ability to spill over into real-world violence.</p>
