										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger bank <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> is adding a third subscription product called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/n26" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="n26">N26 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Smart. N26 Smart is designed to be a mid-tier subscription plan with advanced banking features but without a travel insurance package.</p>
<p>In Europe, in addition to the free plan, N26 already provides two subscription tiers called N26 You and N26 Metal. N26 You costs €9.90 per month and comes with higher limits, such as five free ATM withdrawals instead of three and free withdrawals in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>With an N26 You account, you can create sub-accounts (N26 Spaces), share them with other N26 users or use them to save money. As an N26 You subscriber, you also get a travel insurance package with medical travel insurance, trip and flight insurance and more. You can also access some partner offers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>N26 Metal is the most expensive plan and costs €16.90 per month. In addition to everything in N26 You, you get car rental insurance when you’re abroad and phone insurance. As the name suggests, you also get a metal card.</p>
<p>The new N26 Smart subscription costs €4.90 and works well for people who don’t need travel insurance. With an N26 Smart subscription, you can create up to ten sub-accounts. You get five free ATM withdrawals per month. You can also call N26 support directly in addition to in-app support chat.</p>
<p>N26 is launching a new round-up feature for N26 Smart users. It lets you round each purchase up to the nearest Europe and save it in a separate sub-account. N26 Smart account also access colorful debit cards —&nbsp;the same colors as N26 You.</p>
<p>This is just a first step as N26 plans to revamp its subscription products altogether. In the near future, N26 You will become N26 International. There will be more features focused on borderless banking. N26 Metal will become N26 Unlimited.</p>
<p>As for the free N26 Standard account, the company wants to focus on digital cards. Some users are going to switch to the N26 Smart plan to keep some of the features that they’ve been using with a free account. That move should help the company’s bottom line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Finally. It only took almost three weeks, but the Biden-Harris transition has officially begun.</p>
<p>On Monday, the General Services Administration gave the green light for the Biden-Harris team to transition from political campaign to government administration, allowing the team to receive government resources like office space, but also classified briefings and secure computers. And, with it, comes a shiny new <code>.gov</code> domain.</p>
<p>Transitioning is an obscure part of the law that&#8217;s rarely discussed, in large part because outgoing governments and incoming administrations largely get on and try to maintain continuity of government through a peaceful transition of power. The process is formally triggered by the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Services Administration, the lesser-known federal agency tasked with the basic functioning of government, and allows the incoming administration to receive funds, tools, and resources to prepare for entering government.</span></p>
<p>But this time around, the agency&#8217;s head Emily Murphy had <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">been reluctant to trigger the formal transition period after the Trump campaign filed a number of lawsuits challenging the election.</span></p>
<p>Murphy finally approved the transition on Monday after Michigan certified its election results.</p>
<p>Up until now, the Biden-Harris team <code>buildbackbetter.com </code>to host its transition website. Now it&#8217;s hosted at <code>buildbackbetter.gov</code>, a departure from the <code>ptt.gov</code> domain used by the incoming Obama-Biden administration in 2008.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-team-lacks-full-u-s-cybersecurity-support-in-transition-fracas-11605891470">Wall Street Journal reported last week</a> that until now the Biden-Harris team was using a Google Workspace for email and collaboration, secured with hardware security keys that staff need to log into their accounts. That setup might suffice for an enterprise, but had security experts worried that the lack of government cybersecurity support could make the camp more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>As for the domain, which you might not think much about, the shift to a <code>.gov</code> domain marks a significant step forwards in the camp&#8217;s cybersecurity efforts. Government domains, hosted on the <code>.gov</code> domain, are <a href="https://digital.gov/2018/10/29/gsa-steps-up-security-for-dotgov/">toughened</a> to prevent against domain hijacking or spoofing. In simple terms, they&#8217;re far more resilient than your regular web hosting services.</p>
<p>Biden tweeted out the domain marking the change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.amprobotics.com/">AMP Robotics</a>, the recycling robotics technology developer backed by investors including <a href="https://www.amprobotics.com/newsroom/2019/11/21/amp-robotics-raises-16-million-series-a-led-by-sequoia-capital-joining-alphabet-backed-sidewalk-infrastructure-partners-and-leaders-in-sustainable-investing">Sequoia Capital and Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, is close to closing on as much as $70 million in new financing, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The new financing speaks to AMP Robotics&#8217; continued success in pilot projects and with new partnerships that are exponentially expanding the company&#8217;s deployments.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the company announced a new deal that represented<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/"> its largest purchase order</a> for its trash sorting and recycling robots.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DYLZz5VhRG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/">Sequoia-backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sequoia-backed recycling robot maker AMP Robotics gets its largest purchase order&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/sequoia-backed-recycling-robot-maker-amp-robotics-gets-its-largest-purchase-order/embed/#?secret=DYLZz5VhRG" data-secret="DYLZz5VhRG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That order, for 24 machine learning-enabled robotic recycling systems with the waste handling company Waste Connections, was a showcase for the efficacy of the company&#8217;s recycling technology.</p>
<p>That comes on the back of a pilot program earlier in the year with one Toronto apartment complex, where the complex&#8217;s tenants were able to opt into a program that would share recycling habits monitored by AMP Robotics with the building&#8217;s renters in an effort to improve their recycling behavior.</p>
<p>The potential benefits of AMP <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robot-a0fd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robot-a0fd">Robotic&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> machine learning enabled robots are undeniable. The company&#8217;s technology can sort waste streams in ways that traditional systems never could and at a cost that&#8217;s far lower than most waste handling facilities.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch reported earlier the tech can tell the difference between high-density polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The robots can also sort for color, clarity, opacity and shapes like lids, tubs, clamshells and cups — the robots can even identify the brands on packaging.</p>
<p>AMP’s robots already have been deployed in North America, Asia and Europe, with recent installations in Spain and across the U.S. in California, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/colorado" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="colorado">Colorado, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amp-robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="amp-robotics">AMP Robotics </a> worked with its investor, <a href="https://www.sidewalklabs.com/">Sidewalk Labs</a> on a pilot program that provided residents of a single apartment building representing 250 units in Toronto with detailed information about their recycling habits. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sidewalk-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="sidewalk-labs">Sidewalk Labs</a> is transporting the waste to a Canada Fibers material recovery facility where trash is sorted by both Canada Fibers employees and AMP Robotics.</p>
<p>Once the waste is categorized, sorted and recorded, Sidewalk communicates with residents of the building about how they’re doing in their recycling efforts.</p>
<p>It was only last November that the Denver-based AMP Robotics raised a $16 million round from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and others to finance the early commercialization of its technology.</p>

<div class="embed breakout">
<p>As TechCrunch reported at the time, recycling businesses used to be able to rely on China to buy up any waste stream (no matter the quality of the material). However, about two years ago, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/piling-up-how-chinas-ban-on-importing-waste-has-stalled-global-recycling">China decided it would no longer serve as the world’s garbage dump</a> and put strict standards in place for the kinds of raw materials it would be willing to receive from other countries.</p>
<p>The result has been higher costs at recycling facilities, which actually are now required to sort their garbage more effectively. At the time, unemployment rates put the squeeze on labor availability at facilities where trash was sorted. Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has put even more pressure on those recycling and waste handling facilities, despite their identification as &#8220;essential workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given the economic reality, recyclers are turning to AMP’s technology — a combination of computer vision, machine learning and robotic automation to improve efficiencies at their facilities.</p>
<p>And, the power of AMP&#8217;s technology to identify waste products in a stream has other benefits, according to chief executive Matanya Horowitz.</p>
<p>“We can identify… whether it’s a Coke or Pepsi can or a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/starbucks" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="starbucks">Starbucks <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> cup,” Horowitz told TechCrunch last year. “So that people can help design their product for circularity… we’re building out our reporting capabilities and that, to them, is something that is of high interest.”</p>
<p>AMP Robotics declined to comment for this article.</p>

<p>The Bangalore-based startup’s Series B was led by London-headquartered private equity firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apis-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apis-partners">Apis Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (which invested through its Growth Fund II), with participation from existing investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Smilegate Investments. The new round brings the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/cashfree-raises-5-5m/">startup’s to-date raise to $42 million</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cashfree.com/">Cashfree</a> kickstarted its journey in 2015 as a solution for restaurants in Bangalore that needed an efficient way for their delivery personnel to collect cash from customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Akash Sinha and Reeju Datta, the founders of Cashfree, did not have any prior experience with payments. When their merchants asked if they could build a service to accept payments online, the founders quickly realized that Cashfree could serve a wider purpose.</p>
<p>In the early days, Cashfree also struggled to court investors, many of whom did not think a payments processing firm could grow big &#8212; and do so fast enough. But the startup’s fate changed after Y Combinator accepted its application, even though the founders had missed the deadline and couldn’t arrive to join the batch on time. Y Combinator later financed Cashfree’s seed round.</p>

<p>Fast-forward five years, Cashfree today offers more than a dozen products and services and helps over 55,000 businesses disburse salary to employees, accept payments online, set up recurring payments and settle marketplace commissions.</p>
<p>Some of its customers include financial services startup Cred, online grocer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bigbasket-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bigbasket-com">BigBasket, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> food delivery platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> insurers HDFC Ergo and Acko and travel ticketing service provider Ixigo. The startup works with several banks and also offers integrations with platforms such as Shopify, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon Pay.</p>
<p>Based on its offerings, Cashfree today competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/setu-raises-15m-to-help-developers-connect-with-banks-to-offer-indians-sachet-sized-financial-products/">scores</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/razorpay-100-million-billion-valuation-unicorn/">startups</a>, but it has an edge &#8212; if not many. Cashfree has been profitable for the past three years, Sinha, who serves as the startup’s chief executive, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Cashfree has maintained a leadership position in this space and is now going through a period of rapid growth fuelled by the development of unique and innovative products that serve the needs of its customers,” Udayan Goyal, co-founder and a managing partner at Apis, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup processed over $12 billion in payments volumes in the financial year that ended in March. Sinha said part of the fresh fund will be deployed in R&amp;D so that Cashfree can scale its technology stack and build more services, including those that can digitize more offline payments for its clients.</p>

<p>Cashfree is also working on building cross-border payments solutions to explore opportunities in emerging markets, he said.</p>
<p>“We still see payments as an evolving industry with its own challenges and we would be investing in next-gen payments as well as banking tech to make payments processing easier and more reliable. With the solid foundation of in-house technologies, tech-driven processes and in-depth industry knowledge, we are confident of growing Cashfree to be the leader in the payments space in India and internationally,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, <a href="https://www.alivecor.com/">AliveCor</a>, a nine-year-old, 92-person company whose small, personal electrocardiogram devices help users detect atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and tachycardia from heart rate readings taken from their own kitchen tables, raised $65 million from investors.</p>
<p>Today, it&#8217;s clearer why investors &#8212; who&#8217;ve now provided the Mountain View, Ca., company with $169 million altogether &#8212;  are excited about its prospects. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alivecor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alivecor">AliveCor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just received its newest FDA clearance under the agency&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/software-medical-device-samd">software as a medical device </a>designation for an upgrade that generates enough detail and fidelity that AliveCor says its cardiological services can now serve as stand-in for the vast majority of cases when cardiac patients are not in front of their doctor.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company says the FDA-cleared update can detect premature atrial contractions, premature ventricular contractions, sinus rhythm with wide QRS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a world where the pandemic continues to rage and people remain hesitant to visit a hospital, these little steps add up. In fact, CEO Priya Abani, along with AliveCor founder and chief medical officer David Albert, formerly the chief clinical scientist of cardiology at GE, say AliveCor&#8217;s &#8220;Kardia&#8221; devices have been used to record nearly 15 million EKG recordings since March of this year, which is up over 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>They also claim a 25% increase year-over-year in what they call physician-patient connections, meaning doctors specifically asking their patients to use the device, either at their medical office or at the patient&#8217;s home. Indeed, the pair says that while the company has focused historically on consumer sales, so much new business is coming through doctor referrals that roughly one out of every two of its devices is now sold through these recommendations.</p>
<p>Patients still need to pay out of pocket for AliveCor&#8217;s personal EKG devices, one of which currently sells for $89 while a more sophisticated model sells for $139.</p>
<p>The company also more recently rolled out a subscription product for $99 per year that &#8220;unlocks&#8221; additional features, including monthly summaries of a customer&#8217;s heart data, and hopefully soon, says Abani, access to cardiologists who will be able to answer questions in lieu of one&#8217;s own cardiologist.</p>
<p>Abani &#8212; who joined AliveCor last year from Amazon, where she was a general manager and director of Alexa &#8212; says other offerings are also in the works that should help customers measure their hypertension and blood pressure. She adds that the company more broadly sees itself as becoming a way for people to manage chronic conditions from home and that, if things go AliveCor&#8217;s way, employers will begin offering the service to employees as a way for them to take better care of their own heart health.</p>
<p>In the meantime, AliveCor&#8217;s bigger push into the enterprise appears tied not only to COVID and its ripple effects but also to competition on the consumer front from Apple Watch, which also now enables wearers to records the electrical pulses that make one&#8217;s heart beat and to determine whether the upper and lower chambers are their heart are in rhythm.</p>
<p>Though AliveCor has sung Apple&#8217;s praises for raising awareness around heart health, last year owing to shrinking sales, AliveCor stopped making an earlier product called the KardiaBand that was an FDA-cleared ECG wristband designed for use with Apple Watches.</p>
<p>AliveCor&#8217;s products are currently sold in 12 countries, including India, South Korea, and Germany, and it has clearance to sell in more than 37 altogether.</p>
<p>In addition to selling directly to customers through its site, its devices are available to buy through Best Buy, CVS, and Walgreens.</p>
<p>Very worth noting: Neither Apple nor AliveCor can detect actual heart attacks. While both can detect atrial fibrillation, acute heart attacks are not associated with atrial fibrillation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots, election results took a bit longer this year than usual. But if Americans were expecting an election week, November stretched on into a month of election drama, with President Trump mounting an unprecedented effort to undermine election results and stall the transition process, even as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/23/937802054/trump-is-running-out-of-time-as-key-states-set-to-certify-that-biden-won">states certified Biden&#8217;s win</a>.</p>
<p>President Trump at last appeared to accept the election results Monday, but not in so many words. It certainly wasn&#8217;t a concession speech, but it was probably the closest thing yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same,&#8221; Trump tweeted, seeming to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yamiche/status/1331013212377116673">contradict a fresh claim</a> made by GSA Administrator Emily Murphy that the White House did not influence her decision to block the transition. The General Services Administration (GSA) plays a role in making election results official and moving the transition forward on the federal level.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8230;fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1331013908971261953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>President-elect Biden&#8217;s transition work proceeded in spite of the roadblocks, with the incoming leader introducing aspects of his <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03207-2">plan to get COVID-19 under control</a> and working out the names of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/us/politics/biden-antony-blinken-secretary-of-state.html">officials he plans to appoint</a>. But with the head of the GSA refusing to release $6.3 million in federal funds for the transition, Biden&#8217;s hands were tied in some important ways. Murphy&#8217;s extremely unusual refusal to recognize the election results also blocked the president-elect&#8217;s ability to access secure government devices and receive briefings from federal agencies, including those involved in the pandemic response.</p>
<p>Apart from getting Biden&#8217;s transition on track, Trump&#8217;s words and GSA&#8217;s belated cooperation could help the nation move on in another important way. For weeks, election conspiracies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/trump-election-2020-premature-victory-facebook-twitter/">roiled the internet</a>, inspiring a number of Trump supporters to denounce mainstream social networks, which reminded users of the election results and cracked down on some forms of misinformation. Those conspiracy theories were often spread right from the top, with President Trump promoting <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/trump-s-election-attacks-put-voting-tech-firm-in-the-crosshairs">baseless claims</a> of fraud involving mail-in ballots and voting machines as he refused to concede.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s online supporters may not move on from the election quickly, but they&#8217;re likely to follow his lead — and for now at least, it looks like Trump will signal defeat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2020, parents and guardians are super spoilt for choice in the STEM toys gift department &#8212; which is great news in the midst of a pandemic that&#8217;s supercharging homeschooling needs. The category has matured to offer an interesting range of options for children across a wide span of ages, shedding some of its earlier reliance on Disney IP in favor of more original ideas. Below, we&#8217;ve rounded up 20+ gift ideas to get the (robotic) ball rolling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true the educational value of &#8220;learn to code&#8221; gizmos remains hard to quantify. And some price tags can seem tricky to justify. But there&#8217;s no doubt a lot of thought has gone on creating child-friendly product design and into chunking and structuring the learning. The short story is there&#8217;s plenty to intrigue and inspire developing minds, even if there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll have a future Googler on your hands. (But that&#8217;s okay; maybe your kid will invent the <em>next</em> paradigm-shifting platform?)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also good to see attention continuing to be paid to encouraging children to explore art &amp; design, not just get their heads around engineering &amp; science concepts. Maybe in the coming years we&#8217;ll get a little STEM ethics thrown into the mix &#8212; to further round-out the learning potential. While there&#8217;s clear value in kids understanding how digital tools work under the hood, helping the next generation appreciate that connectivity can change people&#8217;s behavior and reshape the world around them looks no less important a lesson to learn.</p>

<p>For parents looking for screen-free STEM toys <a href="https://www.learningresources.com/botleyr-the-coding-robot-2-activity-set">Botley 2.0</a> is worth a look. The battery-powered rolling-and-sensing programmable robot comes with a remote control for coding directional sequences (of up to 150 steps) via simple button pressing. There&#8217;s also a loops button to introduce the coding principle of recycling a previous sequence.</p>
<p>Botley&#8217;s maker, Learning Resources, has updated the robot for 2020 with new interactions, color-changing eyes and night vision so it can carry on line-sensing in the dark. There are also new programming sequences for kids to discover that transform the bot into fresh characters &#8212; such as a train, police car, ghost and frog &#8212; expressed via different sounds and movements. The kit also includes a 78-piece activity set so kids can devise obstacle courses for Botley to navigate.</p>

<p>Edtech company Life is Tech! has licensed Disney IP to inject the latter’s branding magic into a gamified and interactive learning environment that&#8217;s geared toward encouraging kids to acquire coding skills by building their own games, websites and movies featuring some of their favorite Disney characters. The online educational game — called <a href="https://codeillusion.io">Disney Codeillusion</a> — is billed as teaching four coding languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Processing), with a focus on visual arts thanks to the inclusion of Disney&#8217;s animated movie characters. The content features the usual cartoon suspects &#8212; from Queen Elsa and Aladdin to Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>The web-based course is definitely not a cheap option — and requires an internet connection via a desktop computer (not a mobile device) to work — costing $500 for a package that excludes any physical merch and also strips out some other digital elements (such as an RPG game). The package with all the bells &amp; whistles (aka the &#8220;Enchanted&#8221; edition) weighs in at $900. But with 125 lessons (averaging 30 minutes a pop), kids should at least be kept busy working on their code creations for some time &#8212; which might be magic enough for parents stuck homeschooling during a pandemic.</p>
<p>There is also a free seven-day trial to get a taster of lesson content before committing to shell out.</p>

The Windows-based plug-in-the-bits-and-play <a href="https://kano.me/eu/store/products/kano-pc">Kano PC</a> is aimed at parents who want to set their child on the path to STEM learning in a more mainstream computing environment. At $300 the laptop-slash-tablet is hardly a &#8220;toy&#8221; but the advantage of shelling out for a fully fledged computer is increased utility &#8212; and, hopefully, longevity. Kano touts the PC as capable of running “thousands” of applications.</p>
<p>Of most relevance to the STEM side, it comes preloaded with Kano’s <a href="https://kano.me/eu/downloadable">Software Studio package</a>: A set of learning tools geared toward teaching kids design, science, coding and creativity &#8220;in simple and fun ways&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>

<p>For very young kids point your peepers at <a href="https://kumiita.com/eng/">Kumiita</a>. The educational toy for kids who haven&#8217;t even reached their first birthday began as a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1599191780/kumiita-educational-programming-toy-for-0-year-old">Kickstarter</a> side-project. Now its Japanese maker is selling the gizmo globally, via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/KUMIITA/page/FCBE5355-B75C-4497-8B52-7F379AE9EA03?ref_=ast_bln">Amazon</a>. The idea is to teach foundational programming concepts via screen-free (and internet-free), tile-based floor play.</p>
<p>A battery-powered robot — Kumiita — responds to pictorial instructions on the tiles. Kids choose which tiles to place to &#8220;program&#8221; the robot — getting immediate feedback on their sequence as the bot twirls, changes colour, plays animal sounds or moves off in a new direction. If the bot falls off the pathway there’s obviously a problem and kids have to set about &#8220;debugging&#8221; by changing their choice of tiles. That in turn encourages problem solving and sequential thinking. Tiles in some of the packs also introduce conditional coding concepts.</p>

<p>Budding game designers can have fun coding their own retro games in Microsoft’s arcade game editor, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/explore/makecode-arcade">MakeCode Arcade</a> — based on its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode">open-source learn-to-code platform</a>. The free online project builder includes tutorials to create simple games using either a block-based coding interface, JavaScript or Python — building up to more complex types of gameplay. You can then turn this free STEM resource into a gift by adding a codable console that supports MakeCode Arcade projects. Such as KittenBot&#8217;s GameBoy-esque <a href="https://www.kittenbot.cc/collections/frontpage/products/meowbit-codable-console-for-microsoft-makecode-arcade">Meowbit</a> ($40); or the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200">Adafruit PyBadge</a> ($35) which can also run CircuitPython and Arduino &#8212; both of which are stocked by Adafruit. The maker-focused and electronics hobbyist brand stocks a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/explore/makecode-arcade">range of MakeCode compatible hardware</a> and plenty more besides.</p>

<p>This STEM toy lets kids learn about electronics circuits virtually. This means no fiddling with actual wires, batteries or components thanks to augmented reality. Instead, the <a href="https://shop.learnwithexplore.com/products/mindlabs-energy-and-circuits">MindLabs: Energy and Circuits</a> pack has kids play with a set of physical cards &#8212; viewing them through the screen of a tablet where they get to build out circuits that are brought to life digitally via the companion app. The kit offers 20+ interactive lessons with step-by-step instructions on basic circuit concepts. (NB: Children will need access to a tablet.)</p>
<p>The approach offers a relatively affordable way for kids to learn about electronics components and concepts through (virtual) trial and error &#8212; though clearly if it&#8217;s a screen-free toy you&#8217;re after, this isn&#8217;t it. An added advantage is children are able to collaborate remotely with friends for group learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Austrian STEM toy maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/robo-wunderkind-wants-to-build-the-lego-mindstorms-for-everyone/">Robo Wunderkind</a> has updated its programmable robotics kits for 2020 with new sensor modules, including an LED display block that can show designs or display scrolling text; a line-follower block so the bots can detect and follow lines; and an accelerometer block to give them spacial awareness.</p>
<p>For those not already familiar with the STEM toy, kids snap together the magnetic blocks to build sensor-laden robots and program them via a drag-and-drop coding interface in the companion app.</p>
<p>Blocks can be combined in multiple ways to build different sensing objects &#8212; from rolling robots to smart flashlights. The cheapest kit comes with six modules and 10 guided projects, while the top-of-the-range Explorer Pro kit ($400) has 15 modules and 30 projects. The blocks are also compatible with Lego pieces so children can augment the design of their constructions with additional elements if they have a few bricks lying around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, this one is going to be a different<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/gift-guide-gifts-for-the-promising-podcaster/"> from last year</a>. Because everything is different from last year. I know 2020 has been a pretty big change for my own personal podcast. I always prefer conducting interviews in person when I’m able — in fact, around 400 or so episodes were done exactly like that.</p>
<p>But face-to-face interviews are going to continue to be a non-starter for the foreseeable future, so I’ve had to switch the show to a virtual setup. It’s less than ideal for my own creative and aesthetic preferences, but when the world shifts radically, you do your best to adapt along with it.</p>
<p>For me, that’s meant a couple of things. First — and most obviously — shifting from in-person interviews to virtual ones. Another more surprising (for me) aspect has been the addition of a video element. I’ve started doing it less frequently, but I’ve incorporated YouTube live-streaming into my repertoire. After all, most of my interviews are done over Zoom, with the video stripped out. Sometimes it’s fun to do both.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So here’s a good place to start for the podcaster in your life — whether they’re just starting out or looking to make the transition to remote streaming.</p>

<h2>AKG Lyra</h2>

<p>This one is a repeat from last year, mostly because I’ve been using the heck out of it. AKG’s mic has become my go-to for podcasts and meetings alike. I’ve used it for television appearances, Disrupt panels and a recent guest hosting appearance on NPR. It sounds good, has simple-to-understand settings, plug-and-play functionality and it looks great.</p>

<p>The thing about webcams is that there are a lot of them. The other thing about them is they’re mostly pretty cheap. Logitech’s StreamCam is pretty pricey as far as the category goes. Many or most of these products can be had for around $100 or less. The StreamCam comes at a premium — but you get a lot of camera for that price.</p>
<p>It’s probably overkill for most scenarios (see also: our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gift-guide-7-great-gifts-for-anyone-working-from-home/">work from home gift guide</a>), but it delivers really solid streaming quality in a compact package. That includes 1080p video at 60fps, with face tracking and good low-light shooting.</p>

<p>Okay, this one is less exciting, but man oh man is it important. I suspect most amateur podcasters don’t even consider a wind screen, but after listening to a bit of level-spiking sibilance, you’ll understand exactly why this microphone add-on is so important.</p>
<p>I was using another model until its recent, untimely demise. I just picked this one up for $12 on Amazon and it’s been great. There’s a clamp at the bottom that attaches to most USB mics (including the Blue Yeti and the above AKG). The arm is also super flexible, which is the biggest issue I had with the older model.</p>

<p>This is the light ring that made most of our staff look great during our first-ever virtual Disrupt. It’s been sitting in the corner of my living room for several months now, and I utilize it for both video streams and meetings.</p>
<p>Like anything involving stills or video, lighting is incredibly important, and the GVM is a real powerhouse with a stated 70,000 hours of life. It’s intense and adjustable/dimmable, offering really solid realistic color settings.</p>

<p>Another returning item from last year. And honestly, this one is a bit hopeful that some day soon we’ll all be comfortable talking at each other in cramped spaces again. But the RODEcaster Pro is honestly just too good not to include here.</p>
<p>The RODEcaster Pro is a multi-channel mixing board that saves up to four mics&#8217; worth of input (along with effects and guest phone calls via Bluetooth) to an SD card, which will greatly assist in any post-podcast processing. I’m happy to retire it from my list when another podcasting board can offer similar functionality with such an accessible interface and reasonable price. Until then, the RODEcaster Pro continues to be the best way to quickly up your podcasting game.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1445257-REG/rode_rcp_rodecaster_pro_integrated_podcast.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">$599 from Sweetwater</a></p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/netflix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="netflix">Netflix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is committing $1 billion in production spend at its ABQ Studios in Albuquerque, New Mexico, along with plans to expand those studios, the company said.</p>
<p>In an announcement alongside New Mexico&#8217;s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller, Netflix&#8217;s chief executive <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ted-sarandos" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ted-sarandos">Ted Sarandos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said the company would add 300 acres to its existing space in ABQ Studios, creating one of the largest film production facilities in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That means roughly 1,000 new production jobs in New Mexico over the next 10 years, the company predicted, and an additional 1,467 construction jobs to complete the expansion.</p>
<p>“My administration has expanded our state’s competitive film incentives, facilitating higher-wage employment for New Mexicans all across the state, and increased opportunities for rural communities,” said Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>The proposed expansion and $150 million in capital expenditures will add 10 new stages, post-production services, mills, backlots and training facilities, wardrobe suites, a commissary and other flexible buildings.</p>
<p>New Mexico&#8217;s government is providing $17 million in funding and the city of Albuquerque is providing another $7 million in financing, including $6 million in infrastructure in-kind financing.</p>
<p>The city is also issuing bonds to abate property and other taxes over a 20-year term to cover the first $500 million investment by Netflix to build out the production facility.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Netflix has also agreed to lease 130 acres from the State Land Office in addition to the private purchase of another 170 acres.</p>
<p>New Mexico&#8217;s Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary, Alicia J. Keyes, said the deal could ultimately result in $2.5 billion worth of spending in the state.</p>
<p>Netflix also committed to supporting the state&#8217;s indigenous, Latino, Black and other underrepresented content creators and filmmakers.</p>
<p>Productions filming in New Mexico currently include &#8220;The Harder They Fall&#8221; and &#8220;Intrusion&#8221; &#8212; and the company expects to begin shooting the next season of &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; in the state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let’s just get this out of the way: For the past several years, I’ve contributed the “Best Gifts for Frequent Travelers” segment to TechCrunch’s annual gift guide. I love it. It was easily my favorite gift guide to write, and it was an audience favorite, as well. But I am no longer a frequent traveler. I’ve left New York City exactly once since March. Odds are that special person in your life isn’t traveling much, either.</p>
<p>So, in honor of this new sedentary life to which we’ve all grown accustomed over the past eight or nine months, I’m bringing you the polar opposite. This, friends, is the gift guide for those who have come to carve out office space in their homes. For everyone who’s come to blur the important lines between work and personal life.</p>
<p>The transition hasn’t been an easy one for everyone, but here are a handful of gifts that can help ease the transition and make someone’s home office a…well, a home, I guess. They’re not necessarily the most fun gifts, but odds are someone in your life can really use them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>I never truly appreciated the value of a good office chair until this pandemic. I’ve been lucky to work for a corporation that considers Herman Millers a necessary expense. I honestly can’t remember which manner of ratty Amazon bargain bin chair I had held onto for the last several years, but a month or two into this, I rolled it into the donation pile.</p>
<p>There’s truth in the conventional wisdom that you get what you pay for when it comes to office chairs. And, indeed, it’s an investment. But there are deals to be had. I didn’t spend an arm or leg, so I’m not going to encourage you to. After a good amount of research, I landed on this beast from Staples.

<p>Remember how I told you I wasn’t going to encourage you to spend an arm and a leg on the chair? Well, consider this a gift for the person in your life who was really good this year. If a good office chair is an investment, a computer is a lifeline. I wouldn’t recommend an iMac for, say, a 3D designer, but for many or most, you can’t really argue with ease of use for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> all-in-one.</p>

<p>Apple refreshed the system earlier this year, with some improved features, including, notably, an improved webcam — that’s obviously an important upgrade these days. There are no external monitors to deal with and minimal futzing required out of the box. There is, of course, a big Apple Silicon redesign coming in the next year or two, but that won’t do you a whole lot of good in the meantime.</p>

<p>Much like the office chair, Webcams were one of those those things I really didn’t pay much mind to before the pandemic. But the truth is this: Built-in webcams, as a category, suck. There are exceptions to this, of course, but unlike with smartphone makers, cameras have nearly universally been an afterthought with PC manufacturers. I do suspect there’s a good chance this will finally shift in the next year or so, but for now, you really want to avoid using your computer’s built-in camera for those important Zoom meetings, if you can.</p>
<p>There are a ton of options out there, and you can get a decent webcam at a decent price — Logitech is usually a pretty solid choice. This time out, however, I’m giving the prize to Razer. The gaming company has delivered a clever and versatile camera. It’s got an adjustable clip/stand, can capture video at 1080p @ 30FPS / 720p @ 60FPS and, best of all, there’s a built-in light ring. It’s not going to replace a pro-level camera set up, obviously, if they do a lot of conference appearances or frequently appear on CNN. But if they’re looking to liven up a Zoom call or two, this is a solid choice.</p>

<p>Okay, so, as a longtime podcaster this is something I’ve been thinking about well before the pandemic started. The truth is a decent set of headphones should double as an okay meeting mic. But if conference calls are central to work days, a good mic is a great way to up that game. And hey, everyone’s starting a podcast these days, right?</p>
<p>RØDE has some great USB mic options. The NT-USB Mini wouldn’t be my first (or probably even tenth) choice for podcasting. But its price and size make it a nice option for augmenting meetings and other calls. It also has the advantage of size and a removable stand that will make it a good travel companion if we’re able to travel again.</p>

<p>Bonus entry, this one from TechCrunch Editor Greg Kumparak:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been working from home for a few years now, and honestly the most important change I&#8217;ve made this year is vastly improving my home office&#8217;s lighting situation. Lighting — both natural and artificial — is hugely important to how we feel throughout the day, and being able to customize the lights to your exact likings is one of the huge plusses of working from home. No more awful flickering fluorescent lights! Want to make the lights purple and blue? You do you.</p>
<p>Smart lighting lets you do fancy things like shifting the colors to those that make you feel alert/productive, or dim them as evening approaches. During the California wildfires, when smoke and haze dyed the sky a terrifying orange, I shifted all of my lighting to be <em>way </em>more blue than it otherwise would be to help my brain realize it was the afternoon and not, as it seemed, an impossibly long sunrise.</p>
<p>Philips Hue bulbs are a solid pick, generally. They offer a ton of flexibility and options, the downside being that they&#8217;re generally on the more expensive end. I also don&#8217;t expect Philips to drop support for the Hue line or go out of business any time soon. New competition has been entering the market at lower price points, but my hesitation there is always how well they&#8217;ll be supported in the years to come.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;ve already got other smart lights around their house though, try to stick within the same brand. It makes things considerably easier to not have to deal with new hubs, apps, etc.</p></blockquote>

		Matheus is a hedge funds investment analyst for a major global investment manager and technology provider. In prior roles, he was an associate at a LatAm-focused venture capital firm and worked in corporate venture with regional banks and the Brazilian stock exchange. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Since 2007, the number of publicly listed companies in Brazil has decreased <a href="https://valorinveste.globo.com/mercados/renda-variavel/bolsas-e-indices/noticia/2019/11/14/numero-de-empresas-na-bolsa-e-o-menor-desde-1996.ghtml">from 400 to just a little over 300</a>.</p>
<p>In the past six years there were only 21 IPOs — an average of just 3.5 public exits per year; by 2019,<a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/listed_companies/"> even Iran had more listed companies than Brazil</a>. Global capital markets are heated given pandemic stimulus packages and low interest rates worldwide, but in Brazil the boom comes with a special feature: in Q3 2020, there were 25 primary and secondary equity offerings, and this year is on track to be the most active in history both in number of deals and dollar volume.</p>
<p>The most important event, however, is not necessarily the reversal of a shrinking public market but the fact that startups are issuing stocks for the first time, a dramatic change for a market previously dominated by industries like commodities and utilities.</p>
<h2>Growth versus value: Revert the shrinking market and internet companies</h2>
<p>Not only is Brazil&#8217;s IPO market roaring, the waitlist is even more impressive: <a href="http://sistemas.cvm.gov.br/asp/cvmwww/ciasabertas/registros/formRegCias.asp">More than 47 companies have filed at CVM</a> (equivalent to the the Securities and Exchange Commission) to issue equity and are waiting for approval. In other words, the IPO is equivalent to more than 15% of the number of publicly listed companies. In the first half of October, <a href="http://sistemas.cvm.gov.br/asp/cvmwww/ciasabertas/registros/RegistrosAno.asp">six companies were approved to issue equity</a>. Obviously construction and retail names are still predominant as they take advantage of the lower rates, but the main novelty are new entrants in internet and technology.</p>
<p>In the past decade, <a href="http://www.b3.com.br/data/files/70/11/B3/BC/A9FF47102C784E47AC094EA8/Ofertas_Publicas__Imprensa__-_Setembro.20__SITE_.xlsx">there were 56 IPOs in Brazil and only two were in the software space, both in 2013.</a> That is a reflection of the profile of the investors who dominate local markets, which are used to allocating assets to companies in sectors like oil, paper and cellulose, mining or utilities. Historically, publicly listed companies in the country were value plays, as few of them had significant exposure to the domestic market and derived a significant share of revenue from commodities and exports.</p>
<p>As a result, companies that focused on the domestic market or on growth were never quite embraced by local investors. Many investors deploying capital in Brazil were mostly foreign and very risk-averse to the dynamics of the domestic market; in 2007, when Brazil went through a similar IPO boom, <a href="https://www.euqueroinvestir.com/onda-ipo-2020-entenda/">70 percent of the demand for equity offerings came from foreign investors.</a></p>
<p>Along with an undervalued currency, growth companies struggled to find attractive valuations on the local exchange. As a result, growth companies such as Stone Payments, Netshoes, PagSeguro, Arco Educação and XP Investimentos <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2019/08/20/em-tres-anos-empresas-brasileiras-ja-levantaram-mais-de-us-5-bilhoes-nos-eua.ghtml">did their IPOs in New York</a> where they attained higher valuations. It&#8217;s ironic that there were three times more IPOs of Brazilian growth companies in the U.S. in the past five years than there were in the domestic market in the last decade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two large job search and recruiting platforms are coming together, with <a href="http://vettery.com">Vettery</a> acquiring <a href="https://hired.com">Hired</a>.</p>
<p>The news follows a report last week in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/job-site-hired-once-valued-at-500-million-discusses-winding-down">The Information</a> claiming that Hired had begun to sell off its assets and wind down the company. The report also stated that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hired" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hired">Hired <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Mehul Patel &#8220;abruptly resigned&#8221; via Zoom in early October.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement simply says that Patel is moving on &#8220;to pursue new opportunities,&#8221; with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vettery" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vettery">Vettery <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Josh Brenner becoming chief executive of the combined companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brenner told me that the two platforms are largely complementary, with only a 5% overlap in their respective customer bases. Hired, he said, has built AI job-matching tools (as well as talent assessment and bias reduction features) that are particularly well-suited for software and engineering positions, while Vettery offers &#8220;a little bit more breadth in the verticals that we support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key is bringing scale to these marketplaces,&#8221; Brenner said. &#8220;We see this as a formidable competitor to any of the legacy hiring solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077676" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077676" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077676" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?w=680" alt="Hired and Vettery logos" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HiredxVettery1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077676" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vettery</p></div></p>
<p>The plan, he added, is to create a single &#8220;unified solution&#8221; that brings together the best of both platforms. Vettery says this solution will offer job-matching AI that draws on combined data from 1.5 million interviews and more than 21,000 job placements.</p>
<p>Asked whether the combined site would operate under the Hired or Vettery brand name, Brenner said, &#8220;We believe there will be one brand in the future. Right now, we’re continuing to keep both brands while we do the research to figure out what the best approach is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hired was founded in 2012 and raised more than $130 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hired">according to Crunchbase</a>. Vettery, meanwhile, launched in 2014 and was itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/20/adecco-acquires-vettery/">acquired two years ago by HR services firm Adecco Group</a>.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Asked how many Hired employees would be joining Vettery, Brenner said it was too early in the transition to specify, but he added, &#8220;Not only does Hired have a great client base, they&#8217;ve also got an amazing team that we’ve admired as well and gotten to know over the last period of time &#8230; so we’re extremely hopeful that we can bring together as many of those talented people as possible.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is changing sides in a battle over whether states — and specifically California — can set tailpipe emissions regulations and other rules meant to mitigate climate change that are stricter than the federal government.</p>
<p>The automaker said Monday it will no longer back the Trump administration&#8217;s lawsuit to prevent California from setting its own rules, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-emissions-gm/gm-no-longer-backs-trump-effort-to-bar-california-emissions-rules-idUSKBN2832HF"> Reuters reported</a>. CEO Mary Barra reportedly sent a letter to several environmental groups stating that the automaker was &#8220;immediately withdrawing from the preemption litigation&#8221; and is inviting other automakers to join it.</p>
<p>The decision is a reversal for the automaker, which along with competitors Fiat Chrysler and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/toyota-2bf3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="toyota-2bf3">Toyota <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sided with the Trump administration last year over the issue. With President-elect Joe Biden just weeks away from taking office, this reversal falls into the strategic category. It also follows GM&#8217;s decision to spend $27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology in an effort to bring products to market faster.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DshRcEAFSE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">GM ups electric and autonomous vehicle spending to $27 billion through 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM ups electric and autonomous vehicle spending to $27 billion through 2025&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/embed/#?secret=DshRcEAFSE" data-secret="DshRcEAFSE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The issue of &#8220;states rights&#8221; are at the center of the legal standoff between Trump and California. Under the Clean Air Act, California does have the authority to set its own clean air regulations. The state&#8217;s Air Resources Board called for a 2.7% year-over-year fuel efficiency increase through 2026 even as the Trump administration set out to roll back Obama-era rules on fuel economy standards.</p>
<p>The automotive industry was split on the issue. BMW, Ford, Honda and Volkswagen of America <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html">reached a deal with California regulators</a> to adhere to stricter emissions rules, while GM, FCA and Toyota joined the industry group Association of Global Automakers.</p>
<p>Automakers that sided with Trump have been criticized, and not just by the usual climate and environmental advocates. Ford joined in as well, going as far as airing an ad campaign in September called <a href="https://youtu.be/thm_75HgBYw">&#8220;California Innovation&#8221;</a> that trolled GM brand Chevy, FCA&#8217;s Jeep and Toyota for not agreeing to the stricter emissions framework.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.lunewave.com">Lunewave</a>, the Arizona-based startup developing a novel technology for radars for autonomous vehicles, has raised $7 million in financing as it gets ready for the commercial rollout of its systems.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest financing came from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/proeza-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="proeza-ventures">Proeza Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Blue 9 Capital, Tsingyuan Ventures and Intact Ventures, the company said.</p>
<p>With the latest funding Lunewave will continue to work with Tier 1 suppliers to establish strategic partnerships and jointly manufacture the company&#8217;s radar sensor, according to chief executive and co-founder John Xin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iQYvI3SSpr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/better-vision-through-radar/">Lunewave is pitching a new sensor offering better vision for autonomous vehicles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lunewave is pitching a new sensor offering better vision for autonomous vehicles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/better-vision-through-radar/embed/#?secret=iQYvI3SSpr" data-secret="iQYvI3SSpr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The 3D-printed Luneburg lens pitches features like broad bandwidth, high gain and a capacity for forming multiple high-quality beams in all directions. The company said two of its sensors could replace 20 radar sensors used today.</p>
<p>The Lunewave radar has already gone through several pre-development projects with original equipment manufacturers and with ride-hailing companies. &#8220;We&#8217;re very close to establishing a formal contractual partnership to commercialize our product,&#8221; said Xin. &#8220;By the end of the first quarter we will be able to announce a strategic partnership with a global Tier 1 supplier.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">For Xin, the big pillars within sensors are cameras, lidar and radar, and he says that radar is the only one that works well in inclement weather conditions. &#8220;In the industry these days it’s becoming a philosophical discussion,&#8221; said Xin. &#8220;But we believe in sensor fusion. The more safety the better. Our job is to be the vendor choice for radar solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Xin said the new financing would go to staff up the company&#8217;s product development and sales teams as it looks to continue to refine its technology. The company&#8217;s product development currently operates on two tracks. One is a pure &#8220;a-dash&#8221; system and the other is geared toward level three, four and five autonomy in vehicles.</p>
<p>The company is also hoping to continue its penetration of the industrial vehicle market &#8212; another area where Xin says the Lunewave is beginning to see real traction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that ADAS and AV systems will continue to make their way into vehicles, leading to a strong growth in radars as they are a core component of both systems,” said Rodolfo Elias Dieck, managing director, Proeza Ventures. </span></p>
<p>The company boasts that its technology offers 180-degree field of view in the horizontal plane and can detect objects surrounding a car with six times the resolution available today &#8212; even at long range and in poor weather.</p>
<p>As part of the funding, former BMW director Peter Schwarzenbacher and former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/delphi-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="delphi-2">Delphi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> executive James Zizelman will be taking seats on the company&#8217;s board of directors. Zizelman, who currently serves as the president of Stoneridge Control Devices, was previously the vice president of engineering for Aptiv and an exec at Delphi Automotive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The technology that Lunewave is bringing to market provides the ultimate in value proposition,” said Zizelman. “Not only does this innovation bring truly superior technical capability in field of view, resolution and other attributes, it also offers the opportunity to replace multiple radar units with a single Lunewave device — better and more cost effective.”</span></p>

And while they’ve already been on the market for a while now, the company’s continuing to deliver some key updates, including today’s addition of new fitness features.</p>
<p>Say “Alexa, start my workout” with the buds in, and they’ll begin logging steps, calories, distance, pace and duration of runs. Like many new software additions, this one will take a few days to roll out for everyone. This one also requires users to enable the new tracking feature using the Alexa app.</p>
<p>Once enabled, you can state/ask follow-ups, like:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, start my run&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, pause my walk&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Alexa, end my workout&#8221;</li>
<li>“Alexa, how far have I run?”</li>
<li>“Alexa, what’s my pace?”</li>
<li>“Alexa, how was my workout?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking, “Alexa, how was my workout?” After the fact will pull up your historical running stats.</p>
<p>As I noted previously, the Echo Buds didn’t really do much to set themselves apart from myriad other earbuds, though there certainly was a lot to be said for the price — then $130. At the moment,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Buds/dp/B07F6VM1S3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=echo+buds&amp;qid=1606161150&amp;sr=8-1"> they’re discounted much further</a>, now running $80 — which makes them a solidly competitive deal.</p>

		Richard is CMO of <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/">Cheetah Digital</a>, a cross-channel customer engagement solution provider. As an expert in zero-party data, he is committed to helping brands provide a value exchange with consumers through the lifecycle in return for consumer attention, engagement and loyalty. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">2020 has brought about much-needed social movements. In June, activists launched the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">Stop Hate for Profit</a> campaign, a call to hold social media companies like Facebook accountable for the hate happening on their platforms.</p>
<p>The idea was to pull advertising spending to wake these social platforms up. More than 1,200 businesses and nonprofits joined the movement, including brands such as The North Face, Patagonia and Verizon. I led my company, Cheetah Digital, to join alongside some of our clients like Starbucks and VF Corp.</p>
<p>Stop Hate for Profit highlighted social media hitting its tipping point. Twitter and Snapchat chose to stand up against hate speech, banning political ads and taking action to flag misinformation. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> unfortunately, has not yet been as proactive, or at best it’s been sporadic in its response.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While many thought the movement would come and go, the reality is it has only just begun. With America conducting arguably its most divisive election in history, these problems won&#8217;t just go away. For marketers, Stop Hate for Profit is more than a social movement — it is pointing to an issue with ad tech as a whole.</p>
<p>I believe we are seeing the downfall of ad tech as we know it with social media boycotts and data privacy leading the charge.</p>
<h2>The social media quagmire</h2>
<p>In May, Forrester released a report titled <a href="https://go.forrester.com/press-newsroom/brands-its-ok-to-break-up-with-social-media/#:~:text=And%2068%25%20don't%20think,can%20prove%20the%20impact%20quantitatively.">&#8220;It’s OK to Break Up with Social Media&#8221;</a> that contained statistics indicating that consumers are fed up with social media: 70% of respondents said they don’t trust social media platforms with their data. Only 14% of consumers believe the information they read on social media is trustworthy. 37% of online adults in the U.S. believe social media does more harm than good.</p>
<p>Here is the reality we need to get back to: Social media isn’t built for marketers to reach consumers. In the beginning of the social media craze, brands rushed to get on board and join the conversations. What many brands discovered is these channels became a platform for customer complaints not for building positive brand perception. Furthermore, the social platforms marketers flocked to as an avenue to reach customers began charging marketers just to get to the customers.</p>

<p>The algorithms that define what content you see unfortunately make it harder for people to see opposing views, and this more than anything else polarizes society further. If you start looking at QAnon content, very soon that’s all the algorithms feed you. You might spend more time on social platforms fueling their ad dollars, but you have also lost a grip on reality. Marketers must admit things have gone too far on social media and it is okay to move on.</p>
<h2>Privacy matters</h2>
<p>Imagine you are in need of a minor surgery. Perhaps you take an Uber ride to the specialist for a consultation. Next, you go get the surgery and it is successful. Soon you find yourself at home recovering and all is well. That is, until you start scrolling Facebook. Suddenly advertisements pop up for medical malpractice lawyers, but you haven’t told anyone about the surgery and you certainly didn’t post about it on social media.</p>
<p>Here you are, just wanting to rest and recover at home, but instead you are being bombarded by advertisements. So how did those ads get there? You left a digital footprint, your data was sold and now you&#8217;re being hit with intrusive ads. To me, this story crystallizes the abuse ad tech has been fostering in the world around us. There’s an utter invasion of privacy and consumers aren’t blind to it.</p>
<p>Data privacy has been a focus of conversation for marketers for several years now. Just this year, America saw the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) go into effect and become enforceable. This legislation gives back control of data to the consumer. In June, <a href="https://www.exchangewire.com/blog/2020/06/26/apple-announces-changes-to-idfa-brazil-blocks-whatsapp-pay/#:~:text=In%20a%20blog%20post%20detailing,user%20data%20for%20advertising%20purposes.">Apple announced updates</a> to make it harder for apps and publishers to track location data and use it for ad targeting. At the beginning of August, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/meredith-kroger-first-party-data-cpg-advertisers/">Meredith and Kroger announced a partnership</a> to provide first-party sales data for advertising efforts in an attempt to move off of cookies. It is clear data privacy is not a fad going away anytime soon.</p>
<h2>Where do marketers go from here?</h2>
<p>I believe the future of marketing is the trust economy. The Stop Hate for Profit campaign, the invasion of privacy and shifting attitudes and behaviors of consumers point to the end of an era where marketers relied upon third-party data. Trust is now the most impactful economic power, not data. We conducted research earlier this year with eConsultancy, and our findings revealed that <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/press-release/cheetah-digital-research-reveals-2020-consumer-pov-towards-privacy-messaging-loyalty">39% of U.S. consumers don’t like personal ads driven from cookie data</a>. People don’t want to be tracked and targeted as they click around the web. Ad tech’s roof is caving in and marketers must adjust.</p>
<p>The old methods of marketing won’t carry you through into the era of the trust economy. It is time to look to new channels and revisit old channels. We have to shift back to the channels where we own what is being said. Advertising on social platforms should be focused on driving consumers to owned channels where you can capture their permissions and data to connect with them directly. Consider email as a channel to focus on.</p>
<p>Don’t worry — it works. That same eConsultancy report found nearly three out of four consumers made a purchase in the last 12 months from an email sent by a brand or retailer and massively outperformed social ads when it came to driving sales. Similarly <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/press-release/cheetah-digital-research-reveals-2020-consumer-pov-towards-privacy-messaging-loyalty">nine times as many U.S. consumers</a> want to increase their participation in loyalty programs in 2020 than those that want to reduce their involvement. You have to ensure you are owning your data and loyalty programs are a treasure trove of consumer data you own. Emily Collins from Forrester does a good job of explaining why you can achieve this with a true <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/signals/forrester-emily-collins-loyalty-strategy-rewards">loyalty strategy, not just a rewards program</a>.</p>
<p>Your goal should be to build direct connections to consumers. Building trust means offering a value exchange for data and engagement, not going and buying it from a third-party. Fatemah Khatibloo, a principal analyst for Forrester wrote, “<a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/blog/zero-party-data-explainer#:~:text=%E2%80%9CZero%2Dparty%20data%20is%20that,brand%20to%20recognize%20her.%E2%80%9D%20%2D">Zero-party data</a> is that which a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand. It can include purchase intentions, personal context, and how the individual wants the brand to recognize her.” This zero-party data is foundational for the trust economy and you should check out her advice on <a href="https://www.cheetahdigital.com/signals/forrester-fatemeh-khatibloo-zero-party-data-privacy-personalization">how it helps you navigate privacy and personalization</a>.</p>
<h2>Take responsibility</h2>
<p>The trust economy is really about asking yourself, as a marketer, what you stand for. How do you view your relationship with consumers? Do you care? What kind of relationship do you want? Privacy has to be part of this. Accountability is crucial. We must be accountable to where we are putting our money. It’s time to stop supporting hate, propping up the worst of society and fueling division. Start taking responsibility, caring about social issues and building meaningful relationships with consumers built on trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the renowned Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has backed companies like Apple, Google, Dropbox, Airbnb and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recently disclosed that it had opened its first office in Europe. To staff up, it hired partner Luciana Lixandru away from rival Accel Partners.</p>
<p>Even without an official European presence, Sequoia has quietly operated in the region for more than a decade, first investing in Klarna in 2010. Other Europe-founded companies in its portfolio include Baaima, CEGX, Charlotte Tilbury, Dashlane, Evervault, FON Wireless, Front, Graphcore, Mapillary, Metaswitch Networks, n8n, Remote, Skyscanner, Songkick, Tessian, Tourlane, UiPath, Unity and 6Winderkinder (Wunderlist).</p>
<p>Yet, it is only now that the VC firm is putting people on the ground here in Europe, starting with an office in London that has a remit to invest across the continent.</p>
<p>Working alongside Lixandru is a more junior investor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/sequoia-europe/">George Robson, who joined from Revolut</a>. Most recently, Sequoia recruited Zoe Jervier Hewitt from EQT as head of talent in Europe. And finally, Matt Miller, a Sequoia U.S. veteran, is also part of the European efforts and plans to relocate next year, while I also understand that Sequoia&#8217;s Doug Leone will be spending a lot of his time in Europe.</p>
<p>Last week at the virtual &#8220;Node by Slush&#8221; event, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnjPCtG87dU">I interviewed Lixandru and Miller</a> and teased out some important details about Sequoia&#8217;s plans.</p>
<h2>1. Sequoia now believes Europe is producing market leaders ahead of Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>&#8220;There has been this evolution and maturity of the tech ecosystem that has been really meaningful, that has attracted us to want to put down boots on the ground and be more invested in Europe than ever before,&#8221; said Sequoia partner Matt Miller.</p>
<p>&#8220;One change is in the attitudes of young people. Europe has always been this place where there&#8217;s been incredible talent coming out of the computer science programs, across the universities across the continent and the U.K., and these young people previously, were going into careers in investment banking and consulting are bigger conglomerates. And now that those young people are interested in startups and technology careers, that&#8217;s fueling a lot of great ideas and a lot of great talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long time this question of, when will there be a $10 billion plus startup, and now there&#8217;s multiple of them across the continent. And now the question has really changed: When will there be the next hundred billion dollar startup in Europe, and I think it&#8217;s just an evolution over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find ourselves getting pulled more and more. So when … we want to invest in the best AI semiconductor company in the world, we looked at them in China, Israel and Europe. And the one we wanted to invest in was Graphcore, in Bristol [in the U.K.]. And when we looked … [to] invest in the best process automation company in the world, we looked at automation anywhere in California … and we looked at companies all over the world, and the one we wanted to invest in was UiPath in Romania. And that is increasingly becoming the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>“To some extent, success breeds success, too,&#8221; said Lixandru. &#8220;I think role models are really powerful. And the fact that there have been these category-leading companies created out of Europe, but that are winning on a global scale, like Spotify, Adyen and UiPath … I think that&#8217;s really inspirational to the next generation of founders. And I think that has helped a lot.&#8221;</p>
<h2>2. The firm will make investments out of the same fund as the U.S. and Canada</h2>
<p>&#8220;We work as one partnership across two geographies, and we invest from the same pool of capital across both geographies,&#8221; explained Lixandru. &#8220;And the rationale behind that is exactly what Matt talked about. We want to be able to partner with category leading companies, and if they start in Paris, or in Stockholm, or in San Francisco, for us, it does not make a difference. We want to partner with them early. And we want to be able to help them on the ground early … whether they start here in Europe or in the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Related to this, Sequoia will share carry — the fund&#8217;s profits — with partners across the U.S. and Europe, regardless of where partners reside or where the deal was sourced.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that I love the most about Sequoia having been here close to nine years now is the way that we operate is very, very team centric, and that everybody is compensated the same amount in a fund, whether or not it is the investment that they lead or the investment that their partner led,&#8221; said Miller. &#8220;So when we make an investment, we lock arms together as a team, and we work collectively to help that company be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller said portfolio companies in Europe also get to work with Sequoia&#8217;s operational supporting partners in the U.S., too. &#8220;And the economic model is one that supports that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>3. Sequoia will continue building out a team on the ground in Europe<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This holiday season the next generation of gamers, bless their hearts, will be hoping to receive the next generation of gaming consoles. But confusing branding by the console makers — not to mention a major shortage of consoles — could lead to disappointment during the unwrapping process. Before making any big promises this year, you&#8217;ll want to be completely clear on two things: which console you&#8217;re actually trying to get, and how much of a challenge it might be to get one.</p>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s totally understandable if you&#8217;re a little lost — particularly on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> end, the branding is a little weird this time around. Even the lifelong gamers on our staff have mixed up the various Xbox names a few times.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not 100% sure which <em>brand</em> of console your kid (or partner or whoever) has, go take a look right now. An Xbox will have a big X somewhere on a side without cables coming out of it, and a PS4 will have a subtler &#8220;PS&#8221; symbol embossed on it. The &#8220;Pro&#8221; has three &#8220;layers&#8221; and the regular one has two.</p>
<p>Okay, now that you know what you&#8217;ve got, here are the new versions that they want:</p>
<h2>Sony PlayStation 5</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/">PlayStation 5</a>, or PS5 for short, is the newest gaming console from Sony. It&#8217;s the one your kids want if they already have a PlayStation 4 or even a PlayStation 4 <em>Pro</em>, which they might have gotten a year or two back.</p>
<p>The PS5 is more powerful than the PS4, but it also plays most PS4 games, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about a game you just bought for a birthday or whatever. It has some fancy new features for fancy new TVs, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about that — the improved performance is the main draw.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the PS5, and the only real difference between them is that one has a disc drive for playing disc-based games; they both come with a controller and are about the same size. The one with the drive costs $500 and is the one you should choose if you&#8217;re not completely certain the recipient would prefer the driveless &#8220;Digital Edition.&#8221; Saving $100 up front is enticing, but consider that some titles for this generation will cost $70, so the capability to buy used games at half-price might pay for itself pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The PS5 doesn&#8217;t come with any &#8220;real&#8221; next-generation games, and the selection this season is going to be pretty slim. But your best bet for pretty much any gamer is Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I&#8217;ve played it and its predecessor — which Miles Morales comes with — and it&#8217;s going to be the one everyone wants right off the bat. (Its violence is pretty PG, like the movies.)</p>
<p>The PS4&#8217;s controllers sadly won&#8217;t work on PS5 games. But don&#8217;t worry about getting any extra ones or charging stands or whatnot right now, unless your gamer plays a lot of games with other people on the couch already.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Xbox Series X</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2066498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="246" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg 1436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=150,36 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=300,72 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=768,185 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=680,163 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/xbox-series-x-not-one-x.jpg?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> is the latest gaming console from Microsoft, replacing the Xbox One X and One S. Yes, the practice of changing the middle word instead of the last initial is difficult to understand, and it will be the reason lots of kids unwrap last year&#8217;s new console instead of this year&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X is more powerful than the Xbox One X, but should also play almost all the old games, so if you bought something recently, don&#8217;t worry that it won&#8217;t be compatible. There are lots of fancy-sounding new features, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about those or buy them separately — stuff like HDR and 4K all depend on your TV, but any TV from the last few years will look great.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Review: Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Series X is ahead of its time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/review-the-xbox-series-x-is-ahead-of-its-time/embed/#?secret=z7XBJxBOeS" data-secret="z7XBJxBOeS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are two versions of the next Xbox, and they have significant differences. The $500 Xbox Series X is the &#8220;real&#8221; version, with a disc drive for old and used games, and all the power-ups Microsoft has advertised. This one is almost certainly the one any gamer will be expecting and hoping to get.</p>
<p>Like Sony, Microsoft has a version of the Xbox that has no disc drive: the $300 Xbox Series S. Confusingly, this is the same price, same color, and nearly the same name and type of console as last generation&#8217;s Xbox <em>One</em> S, so first of all be sure you&#8217;re not buying the One. The Xbox Series S is definitely &#8220;next-gen,&#8221; but has a bit less power than the Series X, and so will have a few compromises in addition to the lack of a drive. It&#8217;s not recommended you get this one unless you know what you&#8217;re doing or really need that $200 (understandable).</p>
<p>For a day-one game, there isn&#8217;t really a big must-have exclusive. Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Valhalla is probably a good bet, though, if bloody violence is okay. If not, honestly a gift certificate or subscription to the &#8220;Game Pass&#8221; service that provides free games is fine.</p>
<p>No need for extra controllers — the Xbox Series X supports the last-gen&#8217;s controllers. Genuine thanks to Microsoft for that one.</p>
<h2>Difficulty level: Holiday 2020</h2>

<p>Now that you know which console to get (again … a PlayStation <em>5</em> or an Xbox <em>Series</em> X), I&#8217;ve got some bad news and some good news.</p>
<p>The<strong> bad</strong> news is they&#8217;re probably (read: definitely) going to be sold out. Microsoft and Sony are pumping these things out as fast as they can, but the truth is they really rushed this launch to make it in time for the holidays and won&#8217;t have enough to go around.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to buy the &#8220;next best&#8221; in last year&#8217;s model — the new ones are a major change and are replacements, not just upgrades, for the old ones. It would literally be better for a kid to receive a pre-order receipt for a new console than a brand new old one. And don&#8217;t go wild trying to find one on eBay or whatever — this is going to be a very scammy season and it&#8217;s better to avoid that scene entirely.</p>
<p>The pandemic also means you probably can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t want to wait in line all night to grab a unit in person. Getting a console will almost certainly involve spending a good amount of time on the websites of the major retailers … and a good bit of luck. Follow electronics and gaming shops on Twitter and bookmark the consoles&#8217; pages to check for availability regularly, but expect each shipment to be sold out within a minute or two and for the retailer&#8217;s website to crash every single time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy them a Nintendo Switch, either, unless they&#8217;ve asked for one of course. The Switch is fantastic, but it&#8217;s completely different from the consoles above.</p>
<p>The <strong>good</strong> news is they won&#8217;t be missing out on much right now. Almost every game worth having for the next year will be available on the new and old consoles, and in some cases players may be able to start their game on one and continue it on the next. Good luck figuring out exactly which games will be enhanced, upgraded or otherwise carried between generations (it&#8217;s a patchwork mess), but any of the hot new games is a good bet.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Strong e-commerce sales are predicted to help lift overall holiday retail spending in the U.S., according to forecasts released today by the <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-expects-holiday-sales-will-grow-between-36-and-52-percent">National Retail Federation</a> (NRF) and <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a>. Both firms expect to see overall retail sales growth during November and December, though the market may be impacted by slowing brick-and-mortar sales.</p>
<p>Of the two, NRF had the more optimistic forecast. It estimates U.S. holiday sales during November and December will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% year-over-year, for a total between $755.3 billion and $766.7 billion. That&#8217;s compared with a 4% increase in 2019 to $729.1 billion, and an average of a 3.5% increase over the past five years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077640" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077640" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077640" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="793" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg 1870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=300,232 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=768,595 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=680,527 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=1536,1189 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-23-at-1.54.18-PM-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077640" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NRF</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Growth will come from online and other non-store sales, which are included in the total, which will increase between 20% and 30% to reach between $202.5 billion and $218.4 billion. That&#8217;s up from $168.7 billion last year.</p>
<p>NRF&#8217;s takeaway is that consumers are willing to spend &#8212; perhaps because of the challenging year that 2020 has been, rather than despite it.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all they’ve been through, we think there’s going to be a psychological factor that they owe it to themselves and their families to have a better-than-normal holiday,&#8221; noted NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz. &#8220;There are risks to the economy if the virus continues to spread, but as long as consumers remain confident and upbeat, they will spend for the holiday season,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The firm also noted Americans may have reduced their spending in other categories, like personal services, travel and entertainment due to the pandemic, which could increase the money they have for retail spending.</p>
<p>EMarketer, on the other hand, paints a less rosy picture when it comes to overall sales.</p>
<p>The firm predicts that total holiday season retail sales will see the lowest growth rate at just 0.9% year-over-year. This growth will come from the e-commerce sector, which will see its highest growth rate &#8212; 35.8% &#8212; since the firm began tracking retail sales in 2008. Brick-and-mortar sales, on the other hand, will decline 4.7%.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077604" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png" alt="" width="1000" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=768,691 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-4.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The discrepancy between these two firms&#8217; estimates have to do with how they calculate &#8220;retail sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>EMarketer&#8217;s estimates include auto and gasoline sales, but exclude restaurants, travel and event sales. NRF&#8217;s figures, on the other hand, exclude auto, gasoline and restaurants.</p>
<p>However, both agree on an e-commerce surge. NRF notes online sales were already up 36.7% year-over-year in the third quarter &#8212; in part, due to early holiday shopping. This year, some <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/earlier-start-holiday-shopping-season-embraced-consumers">42% of consumers had started shopping earlier</a> than usual, it recently found. Plus, retail sales were up 10.6% in October 2020 versus October 2019, in aggregate, its forecast noted.</p>
<p>But whether it&#8217;s 20% to 30% growth or 35.8%, depending on the firm, it&#8217;s clear e-commerce is saving the day here.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2077602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png" alt="" width="1000" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=300,270 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=768,691 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=680,612 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-6.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>NRF also expects seasonal hiring to be in line with recent years, as retailers hire between 475,000 and 575,000 seasonal workers compared with 562,000 in 2019. Some of that hiring may have already taken place in October, due to early shopping, it said.</p>
<p>Though Black Friday may not see the same levels of in-person shopping as in years past, brick-and-mortar retailers have made it easier to shop digitally, then either have items shipped home, picked up in-store, or even curbside. Outside of Amazon, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/walmart-wmt-q3-2021-earnings-.html">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/target-tgt-q3-2020-earnings.html">Target</a> have particularly benefited from investments in e-commerce, as both retailers easily beat Wall St. expectations in their latest earnings reports, released just ahead of the holiday quarter.</p>
<p>Online, however, Cyber Monday will continue to rule, however, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/emarketer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="emarketer">eMarketer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says.</p>

<p>Of the five big online shopping days in 2020, eMarketer says Cyber Monday will again beat out Black Friday in terms of overall e-commerce sales, at $12.89 billion compared with Black Friday&#8217;s $10.20 billion.
