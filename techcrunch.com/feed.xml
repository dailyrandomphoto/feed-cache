										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden has earmarked $174 billion from his ambitious infrastructure plan to build out domestic supply chains for electric vehicles, noting the imperative for United States automakers to “compete globally” to win a larger share of the EV market.</p>
<p>The funds are just one part of Biden’s plan, which calls for an ambitious $2 trillion infrastructure investment across multiple sectors. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">The Fact Sheet</a> for the plan includes six references to China – one of these in reference to the size of the Chinese EV market, which is two-thirds larger than the domestic U.S. market. Chinese manufacturer Foxconn, Apple’s main supplier, said in February it was considering producing EVs at its Wisconsin plants – just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/">tentatively agreeing</a> to manufacture an EV for startup-turned-SPAC Fisker.</p>
<p>To ensure Americans actually purchase these domestically manufactured EVs, Biden also plans to establish sales rebates and tax incentives for the purchase of American-made EVs, though the size of the credit has not been released. Customers can already cash in a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, but it is not available to automakers that have sold more than 200,000 electric cars – people looking to purchase a Tesla, for instance, would not qualify for the credit. It’s unclear whether the new tax credit would raise or abolish the sales limit for automakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The plan also proposes using some of the funds to build a national EV charging network of 500,000 stations by 2030. A <a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_Electric_Vehicles_Fuel_Economy_National_August_2020">recent survey from Consumer Reports</a> found that the availability of public charging stations was a major concern deterring people from looking into an EV for their next vehicle purchase.</p>
<p>On the transit side, Biden’s administration said the funds will also go towards replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrifying at least 20 percent of school busses, through a new program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The plan places a huge emphasis on providing good-paying jobs to American workers, but it still has a long way to go. It must be approved by Congress before becoming law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">sweeping infrastructure package</a> put forward today by President Joe Biden comes with a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/03/31/biden-infrastructure-climate-plan/">price tag of roughly $2 trillion (and hefty tax hikes)</a> but gives startups and the broader tech industry about $1 trillion worth of reasons to support it.</p>
<p>Tech companies have spent the past decade or more developing innovations that can be applied to old-world industries like agriculture, construction, energy, education, manufacturing and transportation and logistics. These are industries where structural impediments to technology adoption have only recently been broken down by the advent of incredibly powerful mobile devices.</p>
<p>Now, these industries are at the heart of the President&#8217;s plan to build back better, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that are earmarked to make America great again will, either directly or indirectly, be a huge boost to a number of startups and large tech companies whose hardware and software services will enable much of the work the Biden administration wants done.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The climate-oriented investment in Biden&#8217;s new plan would be roughly ten times what came through ARRA,&#8221; wrote Shayle Kann, a partner with the investment firm, Energy Impact Partners. &#8220;It would present a huge opportunity for a variety of climate tech sectors, ranging from clean electricity to carbon management to vehicle electrification.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of this will look and feel like a Green New Deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">but sold under a package of infrastructure modernization and service upgrades that the country desperately needs</a>.  Indeed, it&#8217;s hard to invest in infrastructure without supporting the kind of energy efficiency and renewable development plans that are at the core of the Green New Deal, since efficiency upgrades are just a part of the new way of building and making things.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A Biden presidency doesn&#8217;t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/embed/#?secret=d6HrPfmpO5" data-secret="d6HrPfmpO5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over $700 billion of the proposed budget will go to improving resiliency against natural disasters; upgrading critical water, power, and internet infrastructure; and rehabilitating and improving public housing, federal buildings, and aging commercial and residential real estate.</p>
<p>Additionally there&#8217;s another roughly $400 billion in spending earmarked for boosting domestic manufacturing of critical components like semiconductors; protecting against future pandemics; and creating regional innovation hubs to promote venture capital investment and startup development intended to &#8220;support the growth of entrepreneurship in communities of color and underserved communities.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Climate resiliency </strong></p>
<p>Given the steady drumbeat of climate disasters that hit the U.S. over the course of 2020 (and their combined estimated price tag of nearly $100 billion), it&#8217;s not surprising that the Biden plan begins with a focus on resiliency.</p>
<p>The first big outlay of cash outlined in the Biden plan would call for $50 billion in financing to improve, protect and invest in underserved communities most at risk from climate disasters through programs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and new initiatives from the Department of Transportation. Most relevant to startups is the push to fund initiatives and technologies that can help prevent or protect against extreme wildfires; rising sea levels and hurricanes; new agriculture resource management; and &#8220;climate-smart&#8221; technologies.</p>
<p>As with most of Biden&#8217;s big infrastructure initiatives, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/as-wildfires-burn-through-california-heres-what-startups-are-doing/">there are startups tackling these issues</a>. Companies like <a href="https://cornea.is/">Cornea</a>, <a href="https://emergencyreporting.com/">Emergency Reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.zonehaven.com/">Zonehaven</a> are trying to solve different facets of the fire problem; while<a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/4-tech-startups-are-fighting-coastal-climate-resilience-and-winning"> flood prediction and weather monitoring startups</a> are floating up their services too. Big data analytics, monitoring and sensing tools, and robotics are also becoming<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/agriculture/"> fixtures on the farm</a>. For the President&#8217;s water efficiency and recycling programs, companies like <a href="https://epiccleantec.com/">Epic CleanTec</a>, which has developed wastewater recycling technologies for residential and commercial buildings.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Fables of the reconstruction</strong></p>
<p>Energy efficiency and building upgrades represent by far the biggest chunk of the Biden infrastructure package &#8212; totaling a whopping $400 billion of the spending package and all devoted to upgrading homes, offices, schools, veteran&#8217;s hospitals and federal buildings.</p>
<p>It gives extra credence to the thesis behind new climate-focused funds from <a href="https://www.gspv.vc/">Greensoil Proptech Ventures</a> and <a href="https://fifthwall.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Traffic&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLUGcTMuGm8wLVjzpeTmlvRBjJMWoVi-6P591j__EFrBqeocmZwXJNBoCeL0QAvD_BwE">Fifth Wall Ventures</a>, which is raising<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/fifth-wall-adds-new-partner-as-it-seeks-at-least-200-million-for-a-new-climate-impact-fund/"> a $200 million investment vehicle</a> to focus on energy efficiency and climate tech solutions.</p>
<p>As Fifth Wall&#8217;s newest partner Greg Smithies noted last year, there&#8217;s a massive opportunity in building retrofits and startup technologies to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>“What excites me about this space is that there’s so much low-hanging fruit. And there’s $260 trillion worth of buildings,” Smithies said last year. “The vast majority of those are nowhere up to modern codes. We’re going to have a much bigger opportunity by focusing on some not-so-sexy stuff.”</p>
<p>Decarbonizing real estate can also make a huge difference in the fight against global climate change in addition to the its ability to improve quality of life and happiness for residents. “Real estate consumes 40% of all energy. The global economy happens indoors,” said Fifth Wall co-founder Brendan Wallace, in a statement. “Real estate will be the biggest spender on climate tech for no other reason than its contribution to the carbon problem.”</p>
<p>The Biden plan calls on Congress to enact new grant programs that award flexible funding to jurisdictions that take concrete steps to eliminate barriers to produce affordable housing. Part of that will include $40 billion to improve the infrastructure of the public housing in America.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project that startups like<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/"> BlocPower</a> are already deeply involved in supporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the superhero masks and capes out. The Biden Harris Climate announcement is literally a plan to save the American economy and save the planet. This is Avengers Endgame in real life. We can&#8217;t undo the last five years&#8230; but we can make smart, massive investments in the climate infrastructure of the future,&#8221; wrote Donnel Baird, the chief executive and founder of BlocPower. &#8220;Committing to electrify 2 million American buildings, moving them entirely off of fossil fuels is exactly that &#8212; an investment in America leading theway towards creating a new industry creating American jobs that cannot be outsourced, and beginning to reduce the 30% of greenhouse gas emissiosn that come from buildings.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the package that directly impacts startups, there&#8217;s a proposal for a $27 billion Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to mobilize private investment, according to the White House. The focus will be on distributed energy resources, retrofits of residential, commercial and municipal buildings; and clean transportation. A focus there will be on disadvantaged communities that haven&#8217;t had access to clean energy investments.</p>
<p><b>Financing the future startup nation </b></p>
<p>&#8220;From the invention of the semiconductor to the creation of the Internet, new engines of economic growth have emerged due to public investments that support research, commercialization, and strong supply chains,&#8221; the White House wrote. &#8220;President Biden is calling on Congress to make smart investments in research and development, manufacturing and regional economic development, and in workforce development to give our workers and companies the tools and training they need to compete on the global stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>To enable that, Biden is proposing another $480 billion in spending to boost research and development &#8212; including $50 billion for the National Science Foundation to focus on semiconductors and advanced communications technologies, energ technologies and biotechnology. Another $30 billion is designed to be targeted toward rural development; and finally the $40 billion in upgrading research infrastructure.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an initiative to create ARPA-C, a climate focused Advanced Research Projects Agency modeled on the DARPA program that gave birth to the Internet. There&#8217;s $20 billion heading toward funding climate-focused research and demonstration projects for energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and rare earth  element separations, floating off shore wind, biofuel/bioproducts, quantum computing and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The bulk of Biden&#8217;s efforts to pour money into manufacturing represents another $300 billion in potential government funding. That&#8217;s $30 billion tickets for biopreparedness and pandemic preparedness; another $50 billion in semiconductor manufacturing and research; $46 billion for federal buying power for new advanced nuclear reactors and fuel, cars, ports, pumps and clean materials.</p>
<p>Included in all of this is an emphasis on developing economies fairly and equally across the country &#8212; that means $20 billion in regional innovation hubs and a Community Revitalization Fund, which is designed to support innovative, community-led redevelopment efforts and $52 billion in investing in domestic manufacturers &#8212; promoting rural manufacturing and clean energy.</p>
<p>Finally for startups there&#8217;s a $31 billion available for programs that give small businesses access to credit, venture capital, and R&amp;D dollars. Specifically, the proposal calls for funding for community-based small business incubators and innovation hubs to support growth in communities of color and underserved communites.</p>
<p><strong>Water and power infrastructure </strong></p>
<p>America&#8217;s <a href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/">C- grade infrastructure</a> has problems extending across the length and breadth of the country. It encompasses everything from crumbling roads and bridges to a lack of clean drinking water, failing sewage systems, inadequate recycling facilities, and increasing demands on power generation, transmission and distribution assets that the nation&#8217;s electricity grid is unable to meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines,&#8221; the White House wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>To address this issue, Biden&#8217;s calling for an infusion of $45 billion into the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act grants. While that kind of rip and replace project may not directly impact startups, another $66 billion earmarked for upgrades to drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems and monitoring and managing the presence of contaminants in water will be a huge boon for the vast array of water sensing and filtration startups that have flooded the market in the past decade or more (<a href="https://www.imagineh2o.org/mission">there&#8217;s even an entire incubator dedicated to just water technologies</a>).</p>
<p>The sad fact is that water infrastructure in America has largely failed to keep up in large swaths of the country, necessitating this kind of massive capital infusion.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s true for water is also true increasingly true for power. Outages cost the U.S. economy upwards of $70 billion per year, according to the White House. So when analysts compare those economic losses to a potential $100 billion outlay, the math should be clear. For startups that math equals dollar signs.</p>
<p>Calls to build a more resilient transmission system should be music to the ears of companies like <a href="https://veir.com/team/">Veir,</a> which is developing a novel technology for improving capacity on transmission lines (a project that the Biden administration explicitly calls out in its plan).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden&#8217;s infrastructure plans could boost startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/startups-in-energy-storage-housing-transportation-and-agriculture-could-see-boost-under-biden-plans/embed/#?secret=O222Ze9J8O" data-secret="O222Ze9J8O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Biden plan also includes more than money, calling for the creation of a new Grid Deployment Authority within the Department of Energy to better leverage rights-of-way along roads and railways and will support financing tools to develop new high-voltage transmission lines, the White House said.</p>
<p>The administration doesn&#8217;t stop there. Energy storage and renewable technologies are going to get a boost through a clutch of tax credits designed to accelerate their deployment. That includes a ten-year extension and phase down of direct-pay investment tax credits and production tax credits. The plan aslo calls for clean energy block grants and calls for the government to purchase nothing but renewable energy all day for federal buildings.</p>
<p>Complimenting this push for clean power and storage will be a surge in funding for waste remediation and cleanup, which is getting a $21 billion boost under Biden.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://www.renewellenergy.com/">Renewell Energy</a>, or various non-profits<a href="https://grist.org/energy/plugging-abandoned-oil-wells-carbon-offsets/"> that are trying to plug abandoned oil wells</a>, can play a role here. There&#8217;s also the potential to recover other mineral deposits or reuse the wastewater that comes from these wells. And here, too, investors can find early stage businesses looking for an angle. Part of the money frm the Biden plan will aim to redevelop brownfields and turn them into more sustainable businesses.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where some of the indoor agriculture companies, like Plenty, Bowery Farms, AppHarvest could find additional pots of money to turn unused factory and warehouse space into working farms. Idled factories could also be transformed into hubs for energy storage and community based power generation and distribution facilities, given their position on the grid.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Biden’s plan also will spur targeted sustainable, economic development efforts through the Appalachian Regional Commission’s POWER grant program, Department of Energy retooling grants for idled factories (through the Section 132 program), and dedicated funding to support community-driven environmental justice efforts – such as capacity and project grants to address legacy pollution and the cumulative impacts experienced by frontline and fenceline communities,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>
<p>Key to these redevelopment efforts will be the establishment of pioneer facilities that demonstrate carbon capture retrofits for large steel, cement, and chemical production facilities. But if the Biden Administration wanted to, its departments could go a step further to support lower emission manufacturing technologies like the kind companies including Heliogen, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/business/heliogen-solar-bill-gates-rio-tinto/index.html">which is using solar power to generate energy for a massive mining operation</a>, or Boston Metal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/eying-sustainability-gains-for-its-supply-chain-bmw-backs-boston-metals-co2-free-iron-production-tech/">which is partnering with BMW</a> on developing a lower emission manufacturing process for steel production.</p>

<p>Critical to ensuring that this money gets spent is a $25 billion commitment to finance pre-development activities, that could help smaller project developers, as Rob Day writes in <em>Forbes</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I’ve written about elsewhere, <a class="color-link" title="https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" href="https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://impactalpha.com/local-project-developers-are-key-to-ensuring-a-just-energy-transition/" aria-label="local project developers are key">local project developers are key</a> to getting sustainability projects built where they will actually do the most good — in the communities hit hardest by both local pollution and climate change impacts. These smaller project developers have lots of expenses they must pay just to get to the point where private-sector infrastructure construction investments can come in,&#8221; Day wrote. &#8220;Everyone in sustainability policy talks about supporting entrepreneurs, but in reality much of the support is aimed at technology innovators and not these smaller project developers who would be the ones to actually roll out those technology innovations. Infrastructure investors are typically much more reticent to provide capital before projects are construction-ready.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Building a better Internet </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected,&#8221; the White House wrote. &#8220;Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. Americans in rural areas and on tribal lands particularly lack adequate access. And, in part because the United States has some of the highest broadband prices among OECD countries, millions of Americans can’t use broadband internet even if the infrastructure exists where they live.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $100 billion that the Biden Administration is earmarking for broadband infrastructure includes goals to meet 100 percent high-speed broadband coverage and prioritizes support for networks owned, operated, or faffiliated with local governments, non-profits and cooperatives.</p>
<p>Attendant with the new cash is a shift in regulatory policy that would open up opportunities for municipally-owned or affiliated providers and rural electric co-ops from competing with prive providers and requiring internet providers to be more transparent about their pricing. This increased competition is good for hardware vendors and ultimately could create new businesses for entrepreneurs who want to become ISPs of their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Americans pay too much for the internet – much more than people in many other countries – and the President is committed to working with Congress to find a solution to reduce internet prices for all Americans, increase adoption in both rural and urban areas, hold providers accountable, and save taxpayer money,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://getleeway.com/en">Leeway</a>, a French startup that is building an end-to-end software-as-a-service solution for your contracts. Leeway lets you centralize all your contracts in a single repository, go through multiple negotiation steps and trigger a DocuSign event for the signature.</p>
<p>The company raised a $4.2 million seed round from HenQ, Kima Ventures as well as several business angels, such as the founders of Algolia, Eventbrite, Spendesk, MeilleursAgents, Livestorm and Luko.</p>
<p>If you’re working for the legal department of your company, you’re probably working with multiple tools. Chances are you’re using Microsoft Word to write a contract, a cloud service to store and share the contract with your teammates and business partners, an e-signature and archival service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leeway is optimizing this worklfow at every step. First, you can store all your contracts on Leeway. In addition to making it easier to find a contract later down the road, you can get reminders when a contract is about to expire so that you can renew a contract.</p>
<p>Second, you can edit your contract from Leeway directly. For instance, a manager can review a contract and write changes in Leeway’s interface. The employee can then start a revision and save a new version of the contract.</p>
<p>After that, you can send the contract from the same interface. Administrators can set up approval workflows so that several people need to approve a contract before it is signed. As everything is centralized, you can get an overview of all your contracts that are currently in the pipeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132609" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132609" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png" alt="" width="1024" height="566" class="size-full wp-image-2132609" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=1536,849 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=2048,1132 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Leeway-Workspace.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132609" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Leeway</p></div></p>
<p>Up next, Leeway is thinking about integrating conditional clauses within the product. Usually, big companies have several versions of the same clause —&nbsp;very favorable, favorable, not so favorable, etc. When a client is negotiating, Leeway customers could switch the clause from very favorable to favorable for instance.</p>
<p>Right now, around 30 companies are using Leeway to manage their contracts. Clients include Voodoo, Evaneos, Ifop and Fitness Park. “We have a very specific customer base — the legal department of companies with 100 to 500 employees,” co-founder and CEO Antoine Fabre told me.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that smaller and bigger companies shouldn’t be using Leeway. But companies with less than 100 employees don’t necessarily have a full-fledged legal department. The sales team or the finance department could act as the legal-ish team. But Leeway still has a lot of room to grow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems safe to say that our honeymoon with big tech is officially over.</p>
<p>After years of questionable data-handling procedures, arbitrary content management policies and outright anti-competitive practices, it is only fair that we take a moment to rethink our relationship with the industry.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the ideas that have gathered mainstream attention — such as the calls to break up big tech — have been knee-jerk responses that smack more of retributionist fantasies than sound economic thinking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of chasing sensationalist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/dont-break-up-big-tech-regulate-data-access-says-eu-antitrust-chief/">non-starters</a> and zero-sum solutions, we should be focused on ensuring that big tech grows better as it grows bigger by establishing a level playing field for startups’ and competitors’ proprietary digital markets.</p>
<p>We can find inspiration on how to do just that by taking a look at how 20<sup>th</sup>-century lawmakers reined in the railroad monopolies, which similarly turned from darlings of industry to destructive forces of stagnation.</p>
<h2>We’ve been here before</h2>
<p>More than a century ago, a familiar story of a nation coming to terms with the unanticipated effects of technological disruption was unfolding across a rapidly industrializing United States.</p>
<p>While the first full-scale steam locomotive debuted in 1804, it took until 1868 for more powerful and cargo-friendly American-style locomotives to be introduced.</p>
<p>The more efficient and cargo-friendly locomotives caught on like wildfire, and soon steel and iron pierced through mountains and leaped over gushing rivers to connect Americans from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Soon, railroad mileage <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/rise-of-industrial-america-1876-1900/railroads-in-late-19th-century/">tripled</a> and a whopping<a href="https://www.lib.uiowa.edu/exhibits/previous/railroad/"> 77% of all intercity traffic and 98% of passenger business</a> would be running on rails, ushering in an era of cost-efficient transcontinental travel that would recast the economic fortunes of the entire country.</p>
<p>As is often the case with disruptive technologies, early success would come with a heavy human cost.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, abuse and exploitation ran rampant in the railroad industry, with up to 3% of the labor force suffering<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4q2wAAAAIAAJ"> injuries or dying during the course of an average year.</a></p>
<p>Railroad trust owners soon became key constituents of the widely maligned group of businessmen colloquially known as robber barons, whose corporations <a href="https://archive.org/details/railroadedtransc0000whit">devoured everything in their path</a> and made life difficult for competitors and new entrants in particular.</p>
<p>The railroad proprietors achieved this by maintaining carefully constructed walled gardens, allowing them to run competitors into the ground by means of extortion, exclusion and everything in between.</p>
<p>While these methods proved wildly successful for railroad owners, the rest of society languished under stifled competition and an utter lack of concern for consumers’ interests.</p>
<h2>Everything old is new again</h2>
<p>Learning from past experiences certainly doesn’t seem to be humankind’s strong suit.</p>
<p>In fact, most of our concerns with the tech industry are mirror images of the objections 20<sup>th</sup>-century Americans had against the railroad trusts.</p>
<p>Similar to the robber barons, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, et al., have come to dominate the major thoroughfares of trade in a fashion that leaves little space for competitors and startups.</p>
<p>By instating double-digit platform fees, establishing strict limitations on payment processing protocols, and jealously hoarding proprietary data and APIs, big tech has erected artificial barriers to entry that make replicating their success all but impossible.</p>
<p>Over the past years, tech giants have also taken to cannibalizing third-party solutions by providing private-label versions — à la AmazonBasics — to the point where big tech’s clients are finding themselves undercut and outplayed by the platform-holders themselves.</p>
<p>Given the above, it is not surprising that the pace at which tech startups are created in the US <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201505/leigh-buchanan/the-vanishing-startups-in-decline.html">has been declining for years</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, VC veterans such as Albert Wenger have called attention to the “<a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/06/02/american-tech-giants-are-making-life-tough-for-startups">kill zone</a>” around big tech for years, and if we are to reinvigorate the competitive fringe around our large tech conglomerates, something has to be done fast.</p>
<h2>Why we need to stop talking about breaking up big tech</h2>
<p>The 20<sup>th</sup>-century playbook for taming monopolistic railroad trusts offers several helpful lessons for dealing with big tech.</p>
<p>For first steps, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887 and tasked it with administering reasonable and just rates for access to proprietary railroad networks.</p>
<p>Due to partisan politicking, the ICC proved relatively toothless, however. It wasn’t until Congress passed the 1906 Hepburn Act, which separated the function of transportation from the ownership of the goods being shipped, that we started seeing true progress.</p>
<p>By disallowing self-dealing and double-dipping in proprietary platforms, Congress succeeded in opening up access on equal terms both to existing competitors and startups alike, making a once-unnavigable thicket of exploitative practices into the metallic backbone of American prosperity that we know today.</p>
<p>This could never have been achieved by simply breaking the railroad trusts into smaller pieces.</p>
<p>In fact, when it comes to platforms and networks, bigger often is better for everyone involved thanks to <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/why-some-platforms-thrive-and-others-dont">network effects</a> and several other factors that conspire against smaller platforms.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when access and interoperability rules are done right, bigger platforms can sustain wider and wider constellations of startups and third parties, helping us grow our economic pie instead of shrinking it.</p>
<h2>Making digital markets work for startups</h2>
<p>In our post-pandemic economy, our attention should be in helping tech platforms <em>grow better</em> as they grow bigger instead of cutting them down to size.</p>
<p>Ensuring that startups and competitors can access these platforms on equitable terms and at fair prices is a necessary first step.</p>
<p>There are numerous other tangible actions policymakers can take today. For example, rewriting the rules on data portability, pushing for wider standardization and interoperability across platforms, and reintroducing net neutrality would go a long way in addressing what ails the industry today.</p>
<p>With President Joe Biden’s recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/">nod</a> toward “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">Amazon’s Antitrust Antagonist</a>” Lina Khan as the next commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, these changes suddenly seem more likely than ever.</p>
<p>In the end, all of us would stand to benefit from a robust fringe of startups and competitors that thrive on the shoulders of giants and the platforms they have made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Deliver<em>oops</em>.</p>
<p>After a lackluster IPO pricing run, shares of Deliveroo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">are lower today</a>, marking a disappointing debut for the hot delivery company.</p>
<p>A good question to ask at this juncture is why Deliveroo struggled with its IPO during a historically strong moment for tech flotations. The European unicorn listed on the London Stock Exchange, however, possibly placing its public offering in a different climate than recent IPO successes listed in the United States.</p>

<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/equity-monday-deliveroo-servicetitan-and-robinhood-for-everywhere/">noted on Monday</a> that there were local concerns regarding Deliveroo&#8217;s governance and treatment of workers. At the time, however, those worries merely led to a decrease in the company&#8217;s IPO valuation.</p>

Is it suffering from cultural dissonance between its high-growth model and more conservative European investors? Let&#8217;s peek at the numbers and find out.</p>
<h2>Deliveroo versus DoorDash</h2>
<p>To ground us, let&#8217;s explore how differently the public markets value Deliveroo and DoorDash. If they are valued somewhat closely, we&#8217;ll be able to dismiss the question of whether the British delivery giant is really being treated with more skepticism than its American comp.</p>
<p>Not that we care, really, one way or the other about any single company&#8217;s value. But we do care if listing on a European exchange &#8212; I refuse to acknowledge Brexit this morning &#8212; means that companies valuing growth over profits are going to generate more stick than praise when they list.</p>
<p>So, briefly, here&#8217;s the data we need to make our comparison. We&#8217;ll start <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/280253921/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/2020_Q4_GAAP-and-Non-GAAP-tables_CLEAN.pdf">with DoorDash</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue: $2.886 billion</li>
<li>DoorDash 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 226%</li>
<li>DoorDash market cap: $41.98 billion</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 14.54x</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, <a href="https://corporate.deliveroo.co.uk/protected_file/175/">Deliveroo</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue: £1.191 billion</li>
<li>Deliveroo 2020 revenue growth (YoY): 54.3%</li>
<li>Deliveroo market cap: £5.55 billion</li>
<li>Implied 2020 revenue multiple: 4.66x<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies embrace the use of data, hiring more data scientists, a roadblock persists around sharing that data. It requires too much copying and pasting and manual work. <a href="http://hex.tech">Hex</a>, a new startup, wants to change that by providing a way to dispense data across the company in a streamlined and elegant way.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5.5 million seed investment, and also announced that it&#8217;s opening up the product from a limited beta to be more widely available. The round was led by Amplify Partners with help from Box Group, XYZ, Data Community Fund, Operator Collective and a variety of individual investors. The company closed the round last July, but is announcing it for the first time today.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Barry McCardel says that it&#8217;s clear that companies are becoming more data-driven and hiring data scientists and analysts at a rapid pace, but there is an issue around data sharing, one that he and his co-founders experienced first-hand when they were working at Palantir.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They decided to develop a purpose-built tool for sharing data with other parts of the organization that are less analytically technical than the data science team working with these data sets. &#8220;What we do is we make it very easy for data scientists to connect to their data, analyze and explore it in notebooks. [&#8230;] And then they can share their work as interactive data apps that anyone else can use,&#8221; McCardel explained.</p>
<p>Most data scientists work with their data in online notebooks like Jupyter where they can build SQL queries and enter Python code to organize it, chart it, and so forth. What Hex is doing is creating this super-charged notebook that lets you pull a data set from Snowflake or Amazon Redshift, work with and format the data in an easy way, then drag and drop components from the notebook page &#8212; maybe a chart or a data set &#8212; and very quickly build a kind of app that you can share with others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132551" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132551" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Hex app example with data elements at the top and live graph below it." width="680" height="566" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=768,639 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=680,566 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-9.58.28-AM.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132551" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hex</p></div></p>
<p>The startup has 9 employees including co-founders McCardel, CTO Caitlin Colgrove and VP of architecture Glen Takahashi. &#8220;We&#8217;ve really focused on the team front from an early stage, making sure that we&#8217;re building a diverse team. And actually today our engineering team is majority female, which is definitely the first time that that&#8217;s ever happened to me,&#8221; Colgrove said.</p>
<p>She is also part of a small percentage of female founders. A report last year <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-us-startups-lack-women-in-leadership-according-to-silicon-valley-banks-2020-women-in-us-technology-leadership-report-301016878.html#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20US%20startups,a%20least%20one%20female%20founder.">from Silicon Valley Bank</a>, found that while the number was heading in the right direction, only 28% of US startups have at least one female founder. That was up from 22% in 2017.</p>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 and the founders spent a good part of last year building the product and working with design partners. They have a small set of paying customers, and are looking to expand that starting today. While customers still need to work with the Hex team for now to get going, the plan is to make the product self-serve some time later this year.</p>
<p>Hex&#8217;s early customers include Glossier, imgur and Pave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera, an edtech unicorn, will begin its life today as a public company after <a href="https://investor.coursera.com/news/news-details/2021/Coursera-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx">pricing</a> its IPO at $33 per share yesterday evening. Using a simple share count, the company&#8217;s valuation comes to $4.30 billion, or $4.38 billion if its underwriters exercise their option to purchase shares at its offering price.</p>
<p>A more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/coursera-set-to-roughly-double-its-private-valuation-in-impending-ipo">diluted share count</a> pushes the valuation of Coursera over the $5 billion mark.</p>
<p>Coursera was last valued at $2.57 billion after <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2020/07/17/online-learning-platform-coursera-raises-130-million-at-reported-25-billion-valuation/?sh=397231d8688f">raising $130 million</a> in mid-2020, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>. The company&#8217;s simple valuation is around a 67% gain on that final private figure; that gain rises to just over 70% if its underwriters purchase their available shares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using a diluted valuation, Coursera has roughly doubled its final private price. In under a year. For edtech investors looking to Coursera to help determine public market sentiment regarding the exit-value of their investments, TechCrunch reckons it&#8217;s a pretty good day.</p>
<p>The amount of private capital at play in edtech startups is staggering; billions and billions of potential returns could get a further shot in the arm if Coursera trades well this morning. And the very same billions of invested capital could lose the smile that Coursera&#8217;s seemingly-strong IPO pricing brought them.</p>
<p>There are other edtech debuts in the wings. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">covered Nerdy&#8217;s plans to go public</a>, via a SPAC, for example.</p>
<p>Private investors, who put well north of $10 billion into edtech companies globally in 2020, are modestly bullish on edtech exit volume this year. In a prior <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">TechCrunch venture capitalist survey</a>, GSV managing partner Deborah Quazzo said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Exit volume is rising already with a wide range of strategic and financial buyers of edtech companies — something that didn’t exist before. You will see numerous high-value exits in the first half of 2021. It’s the public market “exits” that have really lagged and that I hope turns around in 2021 and 2022. There are numerous global companies that could go public and the addition of SPAC IPOs creates another positive dynamic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Coursera IPO <em>pricing</em> at least, meets the mark for a high-value exit. Which could lead where? Extending Quazzo&#8217;s thinking a single step, perhaps a strong Coursera first-day trading session will bolster SPAC interest in taking more edtech startups and unicorns public.</p>
<p>Such a move could lock-in valuations for a number of currently illiquid edtech startups, and perhaps begin to return chunks of invested capital in the historically out-of-fashion technology sector.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Edtech valuations aren&#8217;t skyrocketing, but investors see more exit opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/embed/#?secret=IcaCe9Vw26" data-secret="IcaCe9Vw26" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adding to that sentiment is Owl Ventures&#8217; managing director Ian Chiu, who told TechCrunch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/">the same survey</a> that &#8220;the pipeline for potential IPO candidates coming from the edtech sector continues to grow larger.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope &#8212; parsing the Coursera S-1 filing was good fun and we&#8217;d like another at-bat with an edtech IPO document.</p>
<p>More when Coursera trades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-31/introducing-new-spotify-mixes-personalized-playlists-featuring-your-favorite-artists-genres-and-decades/">announced</a> it&#8217;s significantly expanding its selection of personalized playlists with the addition of three new categories of playlists under the heading of &#8220;Spotify Mixes.&#8221; This collection will include artist mixes, genre mixes, and decade mixes &#8212; meaning you&#8217;ll gain access to a sizable number of new mixes with easy-to-understand titles, like 2010s Mix, R&amp;B Mix, Pop Mix, Drake Mix, Selena Gomez Mix, and so on &#8212; or whatever reflects your own tastes and interests.</p>
<p>The company says the idea for the Spotify Mixes was inspired by its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/spotify-daily-mix/">Daily Mixes, launched in fall 2016.</a></p>
<p>The Daily Mixes had been one of the company&#8217;s first big expansions in personalization beyond its flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, as they introduced a large set of playlists that reflected users&#8217; listening history. Today, Daily Mixes bring together your recent listens with other tracks to keep you engaged &#8212; and the new Spotify Mixes essentially do the same, as they&#8217;re populated with music you like plus &#8220;fresh tracks.&#8221; The difference is that the new mixes have clearer names and a more specific focus, in some cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spotify Mixes will be available to all users globally, including both Free users and Premium subscribers. At launch, you can find them within Search in the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll easily spot them, too, as Spotify has already populated its app with a selection of mixes in the top three rows of the &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub. Here, you&#8217;ll find &#8220;Your Genre Mixes,&#8221; &#8220;Your Artist Mixes,&#8221; and &#8220;Your Decade Mixes&#8221; &#8212;  each with a horizontally scrollable selection of mixes to get you started. Spotify says each mix category will be updated frequently and will always have several playlists available.</p>
<p>The new feature somewhat competes with a similar offering on Pandora, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">launched</a> three years ago. The SiriusXM-owned music app had used its Music Genome technology to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/28/pandora-takes-on-spotify-with-dozens-of-personalized-playlists-built-using-its-music-genome/">create personalized playlists across a number of attributes</a>, including also genre and mood. While not an apples-to-apples comparison, necessarily, Pandora&#8217;s launch had instantly expanded its users&#8217; access to personalized playlists by the dozens. It&#8217;s actually a bit surprising that it took Spotify as long as it did to offer a competitive response.</p>
<p>The launch comes shortly after the addition of <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-29/run-to-spotifys-workout-hub-for-all-new-celebrity-inspired-playlists/">new celebrity-inspired playlists</a> to Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;Workout Hub&#8221; earlier this week.</p>
<p>Spotify says the new playlists are rolling out today to global users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team behind <a href="https://cortado.ventures/">Cortado Ventures</a> thinks there&#8217;s plenty of untapped investment opportunity in the Midwest. To change that, it&#8217;s raised $20 million in what appears to be Oklahoma&#8217;s largest venture fund to date.</p>
<p>The firm is led by partners Nathaniel Harding, David Woods and Mike Moradi. In <a href="https://nathanielharding.medium.com/how-we-started-a-venture-capital-fund-in-oklahoma-ab192df2b809">a Medium post</a>, Harding (an angel investor and former oil and gas entrepreneur) recalled how he and Moradi had been discussing the need for an Oklahoma-based venture capital fund back in 2017.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d planned to launch the firm — which makes seed and Series A investments — just about a year ago, and the pandemic only gave them a greater sense of urgency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With the pandemic threatening Oklahoma’s economy, more attention than ever was placed on the need to diversify our economy and create future-ready tech jobs,&#8221; Harding said. &#8220;There was also a sense that innovation and startups would multiply, and that technology disruption and adoption would accelerate. In fact, we contend that there has never been a better time to start a new company. Our investors sensed this too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the firm&#8217;s first fund only recently hit its cap of $20 million, it has already invested in nine startups including text marketing company <a href="https://www.respondflow.com">RespondFlow</a> in Tulsa, Dallas-based <a href="https://www.socialwyze.com">Socialwyze</a> (which helps underemployed people find flexible work) and hybrid materials startup <a href="https://www.mitomaterials.com">Mito Material Solutions</a> in Stillwater.</p>
<p>Cortado was created with the thesis that the region was &#8220;underfunded,&#8221; but Harding told me it doesn&#8217;t have any geographic restrictions on investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look at companies from anywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We care more about what the company does and less about where they’re located.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harding suggested that Oklahoma is particularly rich in entrepreneurs with a background in traditional industries like energy, aerospace, agriculture and manufacturing. And being based in Oklahoma City hasn&#8217;t stopped Cortado from backing founders from diverse backgrounds — he said the majority of the portfolio is led by women, people of color and first-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>Asked whether the regional ecosystem will also need more later-stage firms to fund the growth of  successful startups, Harding said, &#8220;Funding at the early stage is often very local, but funding at later stages, once you get to nine figure valuations — you’re a known commodity. Once you’re getting to a Series C and D [&#8230;] you have a global market for investments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, the Equity team got ahold of three founders from the recent Y Combinator batch (more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/">here</a>) to chat through their experiences with a remote accelerator. TechCrunch was curious if the program lived up to founder expectations, how extreme timezone differentials were handled, and how easy it was to build camaraderie during a digital program. Oh, and how their demo day went.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s who is on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-croc-93669426/">Benjamin Croc</a>, a founder at <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a> (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/briohr-raises-1-3m-ahead-of-y-combinators-demo-day/">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/trisherrr">Trisha Bantigue</a>, a founder at Queenly (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/yc-backed-queenly-launches-a-marketplace-for-formalwear/">here</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/the_pangean?lang=en">Adam Alpert</a>, a founder at <a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/">Pangea</a> (TechCrunch coverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/yc-backed-pangea-discusses-growth-fundraising-ahead-of-demo-day/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The short version is that the founders were generally happy with Y Combinator being remote, and that the setup allowing them to stay in their normal location was plus. We also asked the founders for learnings regarding how to best handle remote accelerators in the future.</p>
<p>More from Equity on Friday, at which point we&#8217;ll put Y Combinator aside for a good while.</p>
<p><em>Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST, Wednesday, and Friday morning at 7:00 a.m. PST, so subscribe to us on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1215439780">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1215439780/equity">Overcast</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=rZDFHv2sQUul_g94iCRgpQ">Spotify</a> and all the casts.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following years of backlash over its algorithms and their ability to push people to more extreme content, which Facebook <a href="https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2">continues to deny,</a> the company today announced it would give its users new tools to more easily switch over to non-algorithmic views of their News Feed. This includes the recently launched &#8220;Favorites,&#8221; which shows you posts from up to 30 of your favorite friends and Pages, as well as the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view, which shows posts in chronological order. It also introduced new controls for adjusting who can comment on your posts, and other changes.</p>
<p>The features themselves aren&#8217;t entirely new, in some cases, but they&#8217;ve been made easier to get to with the addition of a Feed Filter Bar on mobile for changing the view of the News Feed, and an option menu on your posts to control who can comment.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view of the News Feed has long existed but has been buried in the extended &#8220;more&#8221; menu (the three-bar hamburger icon) on the Facebook mobile app. It&#8217;s not as useful as it sounds because it shows you all the posts from both friends and Pages in a single chronological view. If you&#8217;ve been on Facebook for many years, then you&#8217;ve probably &#8220;Liked&#8221; a number of Facebook Pages for brands, businesses and public figures. These Pages tend to post with more frequency than your friends, so the feed has become largely a long scroll through Page updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>However, if you still prefer the &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; view, the Feed Filter Bar will give you a tool to easier switch back and forth between this and other views. The feature will launch on Android first, then roll out to iOS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook has offered a way to prioritize who you see in your News Feed through a &#8220;See First&#8221; setting, but the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778">newer &#8220;Favorites&#8221; feature</a> rebrands this effort and gives you a single destination under <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778">Settings</a> to select and deselect your Favorites, including favorite Pages.</p>
<p>The updated commenting controls are a new take on a habit many Facebook users have already adopted &#8212; when they share a post only to a given audience, like family or friends, while excluding other groups like work colleagues or even specific people. Now, users will have the option to instead share their posts but control who can engage in conversations. Public figures, for example, may choose to adopt the feature to restrict their audience to only those brands and profiles they&#8217;ve tagged.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132520" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Facebook says it will also show more context around suggestions it displays in the News Feed with its &#8220;<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/03/why-am-i-seeing-this/">Why am I seeing this?&#8221; feature</a> that will explain how its algorithmic suggestions work. It says several factors may be at work here, in terms of what&#8217;s shown and why &#8212; including your location, whether you or people like you have engaged with related topics, groups or Pages, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2132518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NRP-Comment_Moderation_Launch_inline3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The changes arrive at a time when Facebook, along with other tech giants, has come under fire for its role in spreading misinformation leading to deadly events,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tech-hearing-capitol-attack-facebook-twitter-google/"> like the storming of the U.S. Capitol</a>, and serious public health crises, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/social-media-ceos-hedge-on-whether-theyd-boot-the-12-anti-vax-super-spreaders-cited-by-states-attorneys-general/">like vaccine hesitancy during a pandemic</a>. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week testified before the House’s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology about its failures to remove dangerous misinformation and its allowing of extremists to become more radicalized and to organize online.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s official position, however, is that it doesn&#8217;t play a role in directing people towards problematic content &#8212; they seek it out. And people&#8217;s News Feeds are only a reflection of their own choices, in that way.</p>
<p>These thoughts and more were <a href="https://nickclegg.medium.com/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2">detailed today by Nick Clegg</a>, VP of Global Affairs for Facebook, where he insists personalization algorithms are common across tech companies &#8212; Amazon and Netflix use them, too, for instance. And ranking simply makes what&#8217;s most relevant to the user appear first &#8212; effectively blaming users for the problems here. He also throws back the decisions to be made around Facebook&#8217;s role in misinformation peddling to the lawmakers, adding: &#8220;It would clearly be better if these [content] decisions were made according to frameworks agreed by democratically accountable lawmakers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the age of 14, Jacklyn Rome<span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw firsthand how divorce can impact families, and how arguing about finances both during and after the process can impact children.</span></p>
<p>The experience stuck with her. As an adult, after leading new product launches at Uber and Blue Apron,  Rome came up with the concept behind her startup, <a href="https://myensemble.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensemble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The expense tracking app quietly launched in the App Store in 2020 with the mission of reducing tension among co-parents and making sure kids&#8217; needs aren&#8217;t negatively impacted by a divorce.</span></p>
<p>Today, Ensemble is coming out of stealth with $3 million in seed funding from TTV Capital, Lerer Hippeau and Citi Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Put simply, Ensemble’s mission is to improve the lives of co-parents and their children by giving parents a streamlined way to track shared expenses.</p>
<p>“Most co-parents either figure out finances on their own ad hoc or rely on child support payments &#8212; however, child support only covers food, shelter and clothing, which is only half of the cost of raising a child,” Rome points out. The other half of expenses, including medical bills, extracurricular activities, transportation, etc., often end up being discussed by co-parents via text messages and spreadsheets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132081" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132081" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132081 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_1226-B-2-2.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132081" class="wp-caption-text">Ensemble founder and CEO Jacklyn Rome. Image courtesy of Ensemble</p></div></p>
<p>Ensemble kicked off a six-month pilot in January 2020, when the credit-first version of the app went live. In April 2020, the dual functionality version &#8212; where two parents could connect their accounts &#8212; went live.</p>
<p>Since its App store launch last spring, Ensemble has seen “strong organic growth and referrals” from its users, according to Rome. Ensemble’s users, on average, are tracking over $1,000 per month in shared expenses for their children.</p>
<p>Roughly 30% of Ensemble’s downloads were organic in people discovering the app in the App Store, she said.</p>
<p>“Even in the most amicable divorces, money is the number one thing that divorced parents end up arguing about. In more contentious divorces, it often gets used as a power lever among two emotionally charged individuals with no other tools at their disposal,” Rome said. “We set out to build a product that eases tense communication about shared finances and serves the nuanced needs of separated parents.”</p>
<p>For now, the app is free. Ensemble plans to begin monetizing with the use of funds from its seed round.</p>
<p>Eventually, the company is planning to build out a paid subscription model. Over the long term, it’s also planning to expand beyond being an expense tracking app to offering a suite of financial products and primarily banking products, for things like shared credit cards with tight spending controls, Rome told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we want to help make sure that the children of divorced parents are not at a financial disadvantage when it comes to building for their financial future,” she said.</p>

<p>Rome founded Ensemble while she was an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) at<a href="https://co-created.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-Created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a venture studio based in New York, with support and funding from </span><a href="https://www.citi.com/ventures/d10x.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citi Ventures’ D10X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span></p>
<p>“A key insight that Citi had given us was that for them as a bank, it&#8217;s incredibly hard to acquire new customers because people don&#8217;t often change banks,” Rome said. “One of the few times in life that people regularly change banks is when they get divorced. And that sparked the thought process around the pain points that people feel through their divorce, specifically as it relates to finances.”</p>
<p>Luis Valdich, managing director of venture investing at Citi Ventures, says the bank has been &#8220;tracking for some time&#8221; how the financial needs of individuals have been evolving given societal trends, while at the same time identifying potential investment opportunities in startups that address underserved needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;One growing gap is for divorced or separate parents to track and manage shared expenses,&#8221; Valdich said. &#8220;Ensemble solves this problem by striking the optimal balance of delivering ease of use, visibility and empathy for modern co-parents, minimizing the need for back-and-forth communications. While it is early, we found its user experience to be substantially superior to the alternatives in the market, and Jacklyn brings a unique perspective on the challenge Ensemble is trying to solve.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he could not<span style="color: #000000;"> speak to specific plans between Citi and Ensemble, Valdich said that Citi Ventures&#8217; approach has always been to invest in companies with an eye toward future collaborations.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud that the majority of our portfolio has been commercialized within Citi and/or with Citi clients and we will certainly explore opportunities for collaboration when mutually convenient for both parties, as we always do,&#8221; Valdich added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said his firm has been investing in fintech for over 20 years and that it’s clear “people are craving digital tools to simplify communication and finances.”</p>
<p>He called Ensemble’s app “a sleek and simple platform” that addresses those needs for co-parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://harlem.capital">Harlem Capital</a> is announcing that it has raised $134 million for its second fund — well above its target of $100 million and its initial cap of $125 million.</p>
<p>The firm was founded in 2015 by managing partners Henri Pierre-Jacques and Jarrid Tingle. It started out as an angel syndicate with the goal of investing in founders from diverse backgrounds, then announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/diversity-focused-vc-fund-harlem-capital-debuts-with-40m/">its first VC fund of $40 million</a> at the end of 2019. The firm&#8217;s investments include e-commerce companies <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pangaea, CashDrop, Malomo and Repeat, as well as wellness startups, Wellory, Expectful, Wagmo and Shine. </span></p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t invested all of that initial $40 million yet — the firm says it&#8217;s aiming to make five more investments from Fund I. Apparently 61% of Harlem Capital&#8217;s Fund I portfolio companies are led by Black or Latinx executives, while 43% are led exclusively by women. While the firm was founded in New York City&#8217;s Harlem neighborhood — where I live and am typing these words — it invests in startups across the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, with Fund II, it&#8217;s shifting its focus to seed stage investments in companies that are post-product, aiming to invest between $750,000 and $1.5 million and take a 10% stake or more. The firm says it&#8217;s industry agnostic, but will be focusing on both consumer and enterprise tech with the new fund. It will also introduce the idea of &#8220;culture carry,&#8221; where the founders backed by the fund will split 1% of the carry — basically, they&#8217;re getting a stake in the fund&#8217;s profits and in each other&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>The focus on diversity extends to the limited partners who invested in Fund II, with 42% of LPs being women or people of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are focused on building an institution and platform to support diverse founders for many generations,&#8221; said Managing Partner Henri Pierre-Jacques in a statement. &#8220;Fund II is one step closer to our mission, but we know the work and journey continues. We are excited to provide more capital and resources to even more diverse founders tackling unique problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week, Harlem Capital also announced that it had promoted Brandon Bryant to partner and Gabby Cazeau and Kelly Goldstein to principal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When investors gave Moveworks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/moveworks-snags-75m-series-b-to-resolve-help-desk-tickets-with-ai/">a hefty $75 million Series B</a> at the end of 2019, they were investing in a chatbot startup that to that point had been tuned to answer IT help question in an automated way. Today, the company announced it had used that money to expand the platform to encompass employee questions across all lines of business.</p>
<p>At the time of that funding, nobody could have anticipated a pandemic either, but throughout last year as companies moved to work from home, having an automated systems in place like Moveworks became even more crucial, says CEO and company co-founder Bhavin Shah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tragic year on a variety of fronts, but what it did was it coalesced a lot of energy around people&#8217;s need for support, people&#8217;s need for speed and help,&#8221; Shah said. It helps that employees typically access the Moveworks chatbot inside collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and people have been spending more time in these tools while working at home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We definitely saw a lot more interest in the market, and part of that was fueled by the large scale adoption of collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams by enterprises around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is working with 100 large enterprise customers today, and those customers were looking for a more automated way for employees to ask questions about a variety of tooling from HR to finance and facilities management. While Shah says expanding the platform to move beyond IT into other parts of an organization had been on the roadmap, the pandemic definitely underscored the need to expand even more.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chatbots spotlight machine learning&#8217;s trillion-dollar potential&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/chatbots-spotlight-machine-learnings-trillion-dollar-potential/embed/#?secret=9z8PVgF78B" data-secret="9z8PVgF78B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the company spent its first several years tuning the underlying artificial intelligence technology for IT language, they had built it with expansion in mind. &#8220;We learned how to build a conversational system so that it can be dynamic and not be predicated on some person&#8217;s forethought around [what the question and answer will be] &#8212; that approach doesn&#8217;t scale. So there were a lot of things around dealing with all these enterprise resources and so forth that really prepared us to be an enterprise-wide partner,&#8221; Shah said.</p>
<p>The company also announced a new communications tool that enables companies to use the Moveworks bot to communicate directly with employees to get them to take some action. Shah says companies usually send out an email that for example, employees have to update their password. The bot tells you it&#8217;s time to do that and provides a link to walk you through the process. He says that beta testers have seen a 70% increase in responses using the bot to communicate about an action instead of email.</p>
<p>Shah recognizes that a technology that understands language is going to have a lot of cultural variances and nuances and that requires a diverse team to build a tool like this. He says that his HR team has a set of mandates to make sure they are interviewing people in under-represented roles to build a team that reflects the needs of the customer base and the world at large.</p>
<p>The company has been working with about a dozen customers over the last 9 months on the platform expansion, iterating with these customers to improve the quality of the responses, regardless of the type of question or which department it involves. Today, these tools are generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, one of a number of startups currently battling it out in London and beyond by promising to let you order everyday items on-demand from its own delivery-only stores, has quietly raised a new round of funding from leading VCs, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Silicon Valley&#8217;s Lightspeed and Europe&#8217;s Atomico (the VC firm started by Skype founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/zennstroms-revolution/">Niklas Zennström</a>) have invested in Zapp&#8217;s unannounced Series A. Those same sources have also confirmed that Zapp has raised around $100 million in total, including via an earlier seed round.</p>
<p>In addition to Lightspeed and Atomico, other investors in Zapp include 468 Capital, and Burda, alongside notable angels such as Mato Peric, Christopher North (former Amazon UK CEO), and Stefan Smalla (Westwing CEO). One source tells me that the startup’s Series A is the first deal that consumer-focused partner, Sasha Astafyeva, has led on Atomico&#8217;s behalf <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/atomico-recruits-sasha-astafyeva-as-consumer-focused-partner-and-ex-googler-terese-hougaard-as-principal/">since joining</a> the London-headquartered VC firm.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We’re relentlessly focused on delighting our customers and generally do not comment on our capital structure. We are excited to bring Zapp to millions of customers in London and beyond this year,” said Zapp, in a statement issued to TechCrunch when asked about the Series A and list of investors.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In conversation with Sasha Astafyeva, Atomico&#8217;s new consumer-focused investment partner&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/in-conversation-with-sasha-astafyeva-atomicos-new-consumer-focused-investment-partner/embed/#?secret=A1E9VXXNI1" data-secret="A1E9VXXNI1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Started last summer, Zapp’s founders are Joe Falter, who was part of the founding team at Jumia where he led the on-demand services business through to the group’s IPO, and Navid Hadzaad, who most recently was a product leader at Amazon&#8217;s Seattle HQ after founding GoButler and scaling several ventures at Rocket Internet. The leadership team also spans ex-employees of Deliveroo, Just Eat, Dominoes and Tesco, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Zapp operates a vertical or “dark store” model, seeing it set up its own micro fulfillment centers. They include several locations in London already: Kensington, Chelsea, Fulham, Notting Hill, Hammersmith, Shepherd&#8217;s Bush, Shoreditch, Islington and Angel.</p>
<p>Shunning the gig economy model used by companies like Deliveroo, Zapp employs its riders directly. It also emphasises sustainability and utilises an all-electric fleet.</p>
<p>From what we can glean online and through conversations with sources, Zapp also looks to be focusing less on fresh food/groceries and more on convenience a la goPuff in the U.S., thus targeting impulse purchases rather than trying to usurp the traditional grocery shop. This is in contrast to many of the other dark store competitors, although there is clearly cross-over in all of the offerings from a multitude of players.</p>
<p>Alongside Zapp, dark store operators in London alone include <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/getir-10-minute-grocery-delivery-service-enters-london-20210202">Getir</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">Jiffy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/dija-launch/">Dija</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a> &#8212; with some also raising and deploying significant amounts of capital, including, in some instances, employing heavy discounting as <a href="https://twitter.com/amyrlewin/status/1376476794635833347">the land grab</a> accelerates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic unfolded last year, demand for at-home fitness equipment skyrocketed, and Tonal was no exception. The maker of a smart home fitness trainer experienced an explosive increase in sales, and now the six-year-old San Francisco-based startup is gearing up for its next stage of growth. Tonal is adding $250 million of new funding in a Series E round valuing the startup at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Participants in the round include Dragoneer, Cobalt Capital, L Catterton, Sapphire Ventures, and athlete investors Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Maria Sharapova, Mike Tyson and Sue Bird. According to Tonal, the new funds will allow it to spend more on marketing its strength-training product to shoppers to increase brand visibility, grow its catalog of streamed fitness classes, and invest further in operations and scaling its business to meet increased demand. To date, the at-home fitness tech startup has raised $450 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really getting ready to scale the business: we&#8217;re pouring a lot more capital into marketing and brand awareness, and we&#8217;re pouring a lot more capital into scaling our supply chain to get ready for the next phase, which I really think is the next two holiday seasons,” says Orady.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of its efforts to increase staffing across the organization, Tonal also added three new executives to its bench: COO Shannon Crespin, a former Johnson &amp; Johnson executive; Chief Strategy Officer Gregory de Gunzburg, who previously served as Head of Corporate Strategy and Development at NBCUniversal; and CTO Bryan James, whose previous employers include Google, Nest, and Apple. Ostensibly, Crespin, de Gunzburg, and James will be crucial to Tonal’s next chapter, as the startup continues to scale on all fronts, including hardware and content production.</p>
<p>This latest round of funding and set of new hires are all steps the startup is taking as part of a slow march towards an IPO, says Orady, although Tonal’s chief executive declined to give a timeline regarding when the startup may go public.</p>
<p>“We’re going to IPO at a time when it’s best for the business, because being a public company can be incredibly distracting,” adds Orady. “I get SPAC offers, or inquiries almost daily, and our answer is consistently ‘no.’ While an IPO Is a great milestone for the business and gives us access to a certain class of capital and liquidity, we also know that you’ve got to do it at the right time.”</p>
<p>Founded in March 2015 by Orady, who was motivated to start Tonal by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">his own personal quest to shed weight and strength train</a>, Tonal has since carved out a reputation among fitness enthusiasts for an all-in-one design and digital weights system that enables the device to replicate different gym weight stations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">Extra Crunch’s EC-1 on Tonal</a>, published earlier this week, offers a unique deep dive into this rapidly growing fitness startup, exploring Tonal’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-origin/">origin story</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-launch/">product launch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-community/">customer engagement strategy</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1-future/">future outlook</a>.</p>

<p>Tonal’s Series E follows an extremely eventful year-and-a-half for the startup, which saw sales increase 800% from December 2019 to December 2020, causing delivery delays of between 10 to 12 weeks — an issue the company previously told TechCrunch it’s working to address by ramping up production of devices, increasing employee headcount, and air-shipping equipment from Taiwan to the U.S. to meet demand. This March, Tonal also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/tonal-triples-its-physical-stores-with-nordstrom-partnership/">a new partnership with Nordstrom</a>, placing 50-square-foot stations in the women’s activewear departments of at least 40 Nordstrom locations across the U.S., bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech space and the Latin American venture scene are both booming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that an increasing number of global investors are investing in fintech startups based in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clocktower-technology-ventures/investor_financials">Clocktower Technology Ventures (CTV)</a>, the investing affiliate of Santa Monica, California-based macro investment firm </span><a href="https://www.clocktowergroup.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clocktower Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2015, Clocktower Technology Ventures has invested in a total of 96 fintech companies in North America, Europe and Latin America &#8212; eight of which are in LatAm specifically. Those investments include</span><a href="https://miflink.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a neobank, commission-free trading platform that recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/accel-backs-mexican-startup-flinks-effort-to-bring-investing-to-latin-america/">a $12 million Series A</a>;</span><a href="https://habi.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Habi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an iBuyer and listing service;</span><a href="https://kushkipagos.com/en/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kushki</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital payments processor; and</span><a href="https://www.ontop.ai/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ontop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an automated taxes, payroll and onboarding service for employers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now CTV is launching its first fund focused on investing exclusively in Latin American fintechs at the seed and Series A stages. The strategy has a target of $25 million. </span>Most of the capacity of the vehicle has already been taken by existing investors and a few strategics.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is targeting about 40 investments out of the new fund “in the coming years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV Partner Ben Savage said the affiliate’s strategy for Latin America is consistent with its approach to its flagship funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across our investments, we’ve led zero deals, and we’ve taken zero board seats,” Savage said. “We expect to replicate this approach for our strategy in Latin America. We recognize it’s an unusual approach, but we believe we can add more incremental value by doing other things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By other “things,&#8221; the firm believes its ability to connect founders and startups to other players in the financial services space such as CIOs of “globally significant investors, hedge fund managers thought leaders and academics” can be even more beneficial than if it led a round or took a board seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV will be looking at consumer and enterprise companies in Latin America, across the “entire spectrum” of financial services, including insurance, payments, personal finance, lending and credit, asset management, real estate finance and banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some fintech VCs narrow the scope, we go the opposite direction,” Savage said. “We attempt to see as much as possible in the early-stage fintech landscape.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV made its first investment in the region about one year ago (in Kushki). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had spent time before then getting to know the landscape and exploring it,” Savage told TechCrunch. “About six months ago, we realized just how good we believed the opportunity in Latin America to be, and we thought it made sense to pursue a purpose built financial innovation strategy in the region.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTV believes financial innovation in Latin America is “on the cusp of exponential growth” considering that a significant portion of the population is underbanked or unbanked. The COVID pandemic is expected to only accelerate the shift away from brick-and-mortar financial services there and everywhere, really.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is also operating under the premise that “the oligopoly of financial services institutions has not been able to provide quality and robust services to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe this is partially attributed to regulation and market forces,” Savage said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the same way the modern tech stack unlocked a wave of tech startups at a high velocity, new fintech entrants, we think, will change the competitive dynamics for the financial services industry, especially in a region like Latin America,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the quality of entrepreneurial talent in the region has continued to grow, largely a byproduct of a number of well-established tech companies in the region (such as Rappi, Nubank and Loft) “having seeded the next generation of talent,&#8221; according to Savage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some really exciting tech companies, all of which have a financial services angle to them, are spitting out teams of very talented engineers and operators &#8212; this trend we’ve seen occur in the same fashion in Silicon Valley, New York, Los Angeles, etc., has generated an ecosystem of fintech alumni that go on and do great things,” he said. “In fact, in some cases we see entrepreneurs who have been successful in the U.S. return home to Latin America to build a new company. We think over time a large cohort of the next wave of technology companies will be folks who spun out of great businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LPs in the new fund include institutions such as Hirtle Callaghan, an outsourced investment office for families and institutions that manages about $18 billion, along with hedge fund CIOs such as Alan Howard, Philippe Jabre, Glen Kacher and John Burbank’s Passport Foundation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huawei&#8217;s struggles amid U.S.-China trade tensions are driving it to seek opportunities in other smart devices, setting itself up against a raft of hardware makers at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The Chinese tech giant recorded sluggish <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report/2020">revenue growth in 2020</a>, climbing just <span class="s1">3.8% to 891.4 billion yuan ($136 billion), as its net profit grew 3.2% to 64.6 billion yuan. The results were in line with Huawei&#8217;s forecasts, the company said Wednesday at its annual report day in Shenzhen, a rare occasion to get a glimpse into the private entity&#8217;s financials.</span></p>
<p>To put the numbers in comparison, Huawei&#8217;s revenues were up <a href="https://www.huawei.com/uk/annual-report/2019">19%</a> and <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/annual-report/2018">19.5%</a> in 2019 and 2018, respectively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The slowdown in 2020 was primarily due to a slump in Huawei&#8217;s overseas smartphone sales after U.S. export controls cut the firm off core chipsets and Google services critical to consumers. But the challenge has also sped up the firm&#8217;s pace to diversify and offset losses from its phone business.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Huawei&#8217;s has been ratcheting up efforts in a multitude of smart devices, including AR/VR headsets, tablets, laptops, TVs, smartwatches, speakers, headphones and in-car systems.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s foray into the automotive industry has in particular attracted much limelight as the global smart vehicle industry booms. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-electric-exclusive-idUSKBN2AQ0KD">reported</a> recently that Huawei would be producing its own branded cars, which the company denied. At today&#8217;s event, the firm&#8217;s rotating chairman Ken Hu reiterated that Huawei would play to its own strengths and only be supplying certain car components and services, such as the in-car operating system and smart cockpit.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s matrix of connected products is reminiscent of Xiaomi&#8217;s IoT strategy built around its smartphones and operating system, with the difference being that Huawei is also a telecom infrastructure supplier.</p>
<p>Despite moves by a few countries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/uk-shrinks-timetable-for-telcos-to-stop-installing-5g-kit-from-huawei/">such as the United Kingdom</a>, to exclude Huawei from their 5G rollout plans, Huawei&#8217;s carrier segment in 2020 generated revenues on par with the year prior. The COVID-19 pandemic was a boon to the bsuiness, Hu said, which saw global demand in network solutions rise as people worked and learned from home.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s IoT push has shown some early traction but competition is fierce. Smartwatches, it said, was one of its major revenue drivers from last year.</p>
<p>Globally, Apple held onto its leading position in wearables with 34.1% of the market in 2020, according to<a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47534521"> research firm IDC</a>. Huawei ranked third at 9.8%, trailing its domestic rival Xiaomi which accounted for 11.4% of total shipments last year.</p>
<p>Overall, Huawei was leaning heavily on its home market to sustain growth in 2020. China accounted for 65.5% of its total revenues, growing by 15.4% year-over-year. Meanwhile, revenues fell 12.2% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was down 8.7% in the rest of Asia and down 24.5% in the Americas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independent music distribution platform and tool factory UnitedMasters has raised a $50M series B round led by Apple. A16z and Alphabet are participating again in this raise. United Masters is also entering a strategic partnership with Apple alongside this investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unfamiliar with UnitedMasters, it’s a distribution </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/15/united-masters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company launched in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Steve Stoute, a former Interscope and Sony Music executive. The focus of UnitedMasters is to provide artists with a direct pipeline to data around the way that fans are interacting with their content and community, allowing them to connect more directly to offer tickets, merchandise and other commercial efforts. UnitedMasters also generally allows artists to retain control of their own masters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of these conditions are at all typical in the music industry. In a typical artist deal, recording companies retain all audience and targeting data as well as masters. This limits an artist’s ability to be agile, taking advantage of new technologies to foster a community. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Apple does invest in various companies, it typically does so out of its Advanced Manufacturing Fund to promote US manufacturing or strategically in partners that make critical components of its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/apple-to-invest-1-2-billion-in-silicon-design-center-in-germany/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardware like silicon foundries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-awards-an-additional-250-million-from-advanced-manufacturing-fund-to-corning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">glass manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apple does a lot more purchasing than investing, typically, buying a company every few weeks or so to supplement one product effort or another. UnitedMasters, then, would be a relatively unique partnership, especially in the music space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to UnitedMasters CEO Steve Stoute about the deal and what it means for the businesses 1M current artists and new ones. Stoute credits Apple executive Eddy Cue having a philosophy aligned with the UnitedMasters vision with getting this deal done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all artists to have the same opportunity,” says Stoute. “Currently, independent artists have less opportunity for success and we’re trying to remove that stigma.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This infusion, Stoute says, will be used to hire talent that are mission oriented to take UnitedMasters global. They’re seeking local technical talent and artists talent to build out the platform worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every artist needs access to a CTO,” Stoute says. “Some of the value of what a manager is today for an artist needs to be transferred to that role.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UnitedMasters wants to provide that technical edge at scale, allowing artists to build out their fanbase at a community level.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-1744264 alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?w=200" alt="" width="235" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg 3470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=1025,1536 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=1367,2048 1367w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/96300695-992D-48FF-9AE3-E131E69967EB.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, UnitedMasters has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/new-unitedmasters-deal-will-enable-its-artists-get-play-across-nba-properties/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deals with the NBA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ESPN, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/tiktoks-big-unitedmasters-deal-is-the-way-forward-for-creators-looking-to-secure-their-bag/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Twitch and others that allow artists to tap big brand deals that would normally be brokered by a label and manager. It also has a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/04/unitedmasters-releases-iphone-app-for-diy-cross-service-music-distribution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct distribution app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allows publishing to all of the major streaming services. Most importantly, they can check stream, fan and earnings data at a glance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steve Stoute and UnitedMasters provide creators with more opportunities to advance their careers and bring their music to the world,” said Apple’s Eddy Cue in a release statement. “The contributions of independent artists play a significant role in driving the continued growth and success of the music industry, and UnitedMasters, like Apple, is committed to empowering creators.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“UnitedMasters has completely transformed the way artists create, retain ownership in their work, and connect with their fans,” said Ben Horowitz, Co-Founder and General Partner of Andreessen Horowitz in a release. “We are excited to work with Steve and team to build a better, bigger, and far more profitable world for musical artists.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently at an inflection point in the way that artists and fans connect with one another. Though there have been seemingly endless ways for artists to get their messages out or speak to fans using social media and other platforms, the actual business of distributing work to a community and making money from that work has been out of their hands completely since the beginning of the recording industry. Recent developments like NFTs, DAOs and social tokens, as well as an explosion of DTC frameworks have begun to re-write that deal. But the major players have yet to make the truly aggressive strides they need to in order to embrace this ‘artist centric’ new world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mechanics of distribution have been based on a framework defined by DRM and the DMCA for decades. This framework was always </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">marketed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to protect value for the artist but was in fact </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">architected</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect value for the distributor. We need a rethinking of the entire distribution layer.</span></p>
<p>As I mentioned when reporting the UnitedMasters + TikTok deal, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/tiktoks-big-unitedmasters-deal-is-the-way-forward-for-creators-looking-to-secure-their-bag/">going to be instrumental</a> in a more equitable future for artists:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s beyond time for the creators of The Culture to benefit from that culture. That’s why I find this UnitedMasters deal so interesting. Offering a direct pipeline to audiences without the attendant vulture-ism of the recording industry apparatus is really well-aligned with a platform like TikTok, which encourages and enables “viral sounds” with collaborative performances. Traditional deal structures are not well-suited to capturing viral hype, which can rise and fall within weeks without additional fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In music, Apple is at the center of this maelstrom along with a few other major players like Spotify. One of the big misses in recent years for Apple Music, in my opinion, was Apple’s failure to turn Apple Music Connect into an industry-standard portal that allowed artists to connect broadly with fans, distribute directly, sell tickets and merchandise but &#8212; most importantly &#8212; to foster and own their community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UnitedMasters tie up isn’t a straight line to that goal, but it’s definitely got the ingredients. I’m looking forward to seeing what this produces. </span></p>
