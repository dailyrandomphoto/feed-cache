										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to the EPA, the U.S. alone produces 292.4 million tons of municipal solid waste a year. That figure works out to around 4.9 pounds per person, per day. To say the world – and the United States in particular – has a waste problem is putting it mildly. No one solution is going to address this growing issue – but thankfully, we’ve seen a number of innovations surface in recent years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With less than a month to go before the Olympics kick off in Tokyo, cord-cutting services like YouTube TV are attempting to woo new subscribers who are looking for a way to watch summer sports. But whether or not you&#8217;re eager to watch Simone Biles defy gravity, YouTube TV&#8217;s latest upgrades enhance the product with audio and video improvements. Today, YouTube TV announced a 4K Plus add-on package with offline downloads, 5.1 Dolby audio, and features that make it easier to watch live sports. The company previously <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">teased these features</a> in February.</p>
<p>YouTube TV is already one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/youtube-tv-hikes-price-to-64-99-per-month-following-new-channel-additions/">the pricier streaming services</a> out there &#8212; at $64.99 per month, you might not save much money by choosing YouTube in lieu of your cable service. Hulu + Live TV is priced the same, but offers a Disney+ and ESPN+ add-on for a total of $72.99 per month. But if you want to kick your video quality (and your monthly bill) up a notch, you can now enable 4K streaming for an extra $19.99 per month, bringing your grand total to $84.98 monthly.</p>
<p>The 4K Plus add-on package will also allow subscribers to download shows from DVR to watch offline &#8212; currently, that&#8217;s not possible on the standard $64.99 per month package. Subscribers will be able to try out the package for free for a month, then pay $9.99 per month for a year before the price increases to $19.99. This is pretty consistent with YouTube TV&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/youtube-tv-gets-some-new-channels-and-a-hefty-price-hike/">continual price hikes</a> over the years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities will be a free addition for all YouTube TV members &#8212; in a blog post, the company says this has been one of users&#8217; &#8220;biggest requests.&#8221; Over the coming weeks, these surround-sound audio capabilities will begin rolling out to select devices. The sports upgrades also come at no additional cost &#8212; one new feature will let viewers jump to key plays and specific highlight moments when watching a DVR recording or trying to catch up live. So, if you&#8217;re tuning in an hour late, you can view key moments from the game, then jump right in live. YouTube TV will also let users search for specific sports to add to their DVR, which has no storage space limit. So, again, if you&#8217;re determined not to miss a single Simone Biles floor routine, it will be easier to make sure you&#8217;re in the loop. There will also be a Medal count view during the Olympics within the app.</p>
<p>As the Olympics draw nearer, we can expect other cord-cutting services to up the ante on their live sports offerings &#8212; the $9.99 monthly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">Paramount+ Premium plan</a> includes a wide range of international soccer matches, but no word on the Olympics yet. Still, the service is far less expensive than YouTube TV and already offers 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision. YouTube TV had<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-roku-face-off-youtube-tv-added-to-main-app-free-streaming-devices/"> 3 million subscribers</a> as of October 2020, but did not offer an update for Q1 of 2021. As of March, Hulu had <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/hulu-statistics/">4.1 million subscribers</a> to its Live TV service, which will also air the Olympics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare</a> co-founder Dennis Crowley has <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">announced</a> that he is stepping back of his full-time role at the company. During the first seven years of the company, he was the startup’s Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, Crowley moved to an executive chairman position. He’s also been running the <a href="https://foursquare.com/labs/">Foursquare Labs</a> R&amp;D group since then.</p>
<p>Going forward, Crowley won’t be working full-time at the company. He’ll remain on the Board of Directors as co-chair <a href="https://foursquare.com/article/foursquares-dennis-crowley-and-gil-elbaz-shifting-to-board-of-directors-full/">with Factual founder Gil Elbaz</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Vmq9xN72It"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/">Foursquare merges with Factual</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Foursquare merges with Factual&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/foursquare-merges-with-factual/embed/#?secret=Vmq9xN72It" data-secret="Vmq9xN72It" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2009, Foursquare was better-known for its location-based social network. People would check in to locations to share what they’ve been up to with their friends. Users would earn badges and mayorships.</p>
<p>Over the years, the most active users had amassed thousands of checkins. Foursquare became a great app to keep track of places you like. You could also use it to discover your friends’ favorite places.</p>
<p>That’s why the company decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/01/foursquare-splits-into-two-apps-but-will-either-be-strong-enough-to-survive/">split</a> its main app into two separate apps —&nbsp;the Foursquare City Guide and Swarm. At the same time, the company started workin on developer APIs and SDKs so that other companies could take advantage of Foursquare’s location data.</p>
<p>That business in particular has been quite lucrative. With the company’s <a href="https://foursquare.com/products/pilgrim-sdk/">Pilgrim SDK</a>, developers can build location-aware apps. For instance, an advertiser can send a personalized notification based on where you are. Foursquare tries to be as accurate as possible and can sometimes even figure out when you enter or exit a venue.</p>
<p>That SDK enables many different possibilities. It’s easy to track the impact of an advertising campaign on online sales — but what about offline interest?</p>
<p>Foursquare’s SDK can help advertisers and brand see whether an advertising campaign has an impact on foot traffic. Of course, you can also combine that data with other customer data.</p>
<p>The company has become an important advertising and marketing platform focused on location. Overall, the company has generated more than $100 million in revenue in 2020. And it plans to grow in 2021 and beat that number.</p>
<p>Dennis Crowley mentions two reasons why he’s leaving now. According to him, the company is doing well, and he’s been working on the same thing for twelve years already.</p>
<p>“Foursquare hasn’t just found its way… it leads the way. I used to say that my goal was to make the name ‘Foursquare’ synonymous with ‘innovation in contextual aware computing’… And, here in 2021, we’ve built the tools and frameworks that can make that so,” Crowley writes in a <a href="https://dens.medium.com/after-12-years-im-stepping-back-from-foursquare-10c75372123d">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>“Also, twelve years is a lot of time. I have lots of things I still want to build — many of which don’t fit neatly into the Foursquare of 2021 (and, hey fellow founder, it’s fine to feel this way!),” he adds. He&#8217;s also going to spend some well-deserved time with his family.</p>
<p>Crowley has been an iconic startup founder during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era. He managed to attract tens of millions of users. It’s clear that he’s been a great product CEO during the early years of the company. And now, the company is <em>also</em> generating revenue. So it’s going to be interesting to see what he builds next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brian Armstrong, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a>, is coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt this September 21-23</a>, and given how much there is to discuss, we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to host him.</p>
<p>As some industry observers will know, Armstrong, a native of San Jose, Calif., whose parents were both engineers, nabbed two degrees from Rice University in Texas before joining Airbnb as a software engineer in 2011 as a technical product manager focused on fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The role gave him the opportunity to learn about payment systems &#8212; and payment problems &#8212; across the world. It relatedly fueled a then-burgeoning interest in cryptocoins, which he began to buy and store and, more important, he began to believe would ultimately replace fiat money. In fact, after just 14 months with Airbnb, Armstrong left the company to join Y Combinator and found Coinbase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t focused on making money, by his telling. Instead, as he told Forbes last year, &#8220;I wanted the world to have a global, open financial system that drove innovation and freedom.” Either way, along the way, Armstrong became very wealthy, as have many Coinbase employees and investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, which built the biggest stake in Coinbase over the years and whose position was valued at a reported $11 billion at the time of Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing this past April.</p>
<p>Still, the success of Coinbase &#8212; which has established itself as <em>the</em> clean, well-lit place to invest in cryptocurrencies &#8212; has also invariably led to greater scrutiny. The company has been widely accused by its customers of focusing on security at the expense of adequate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/coinbase-commits-to-a-better-customer-experience-following-complaints/">customer service</a>. Several of Armstrong&#8217;s managerial decisions, including to clamp down on <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804">political speech</a> inside of Coinbase, has cost the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">valued employees</a>, while others have said they were treated unfairly because of their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/coinbase-pay-employees.html">race or gender</a>.</p>
<p>More, following a very long run, enthusiasm over cryptocurrencies has abruptly slowed over the last month or so. While Armstrong has seen enthusiasm for crypto grow and wane before, Coinbase is now a publicly traded company, and as questions bubble up about Bitcoin, Coinbase&#8217;s shares are down, too. (As of this writing, they are trading at around $217, almost half of where they were valued at their peak price in April of about $429.)</p>
<p>Little wonder Armstrong has been laser-focused on not only strengthening what Coinbase has already built but setting it up to become an even larger enterprise, including by <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-acquire-leading-blockchain-infrastructure-platform-bison-trails-f879654421d6">acquiring a company</a> early this year that sets up Coinbase to operate as a kind of AWS, enabling companies that, say, want to connect their wallet app to a blockchain to click a few buttons rather than hire a team of engineers to spin up the necessary nodes.</p>
<p>How else is Armstrong, 38, dealing with the markets ups and downs as he builds a completely new financial institution? Where does he want to take Coinbase over the next 12 months? How does he respond to criticisms about some of his very public decisions concerning Coinbase employees? These are among the many things we&#8217;ll talk with him about at this year&#8217;s Disrupt for an appearance that we know attendees won&#8217;t want to miss. We&#8217;re certainly excited to sit down with him.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The cybersecurity unicorn raised its IPO price range today. As a heat check on the larger IPO market, it's a thermometer about to explode. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the second quarter races to a close, we&#8217;re down to the wire for IPOs looking to get out before June ends. One such company is SentinelOne, a cybersecurity startup backed by Insight Venture Partners, Redpoint, Tiger Global Management, Data Collective and Anchorage Capital, among others.</p>
<p>SentinelOne raised an ocean of capital while private, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sentinel/company_financials">nearly $500 million across two rounds in 2020</a>. Its debut is therefore a huge liquidity event for a host of investing groups. And today, the cybersecurity unicorn had good news in the form of an upgrade to its IPO price range.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/investors-thirst-for-growth-could-bode-well-for-sentinelones-ipo/">The Exchange wrote that</a> the company&#8217;s IPO would be a &#8220;good heat check for the IPO market&#8221; given its rapid growth and pace of losses. How investors valued it would help explain the public market&#8217;s current appetite for loss-making startups. Today&#8217;s news implies healthy appetites.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995211 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>SentinelOne raised its IPO price range this morning from $26 to $29 per share to $31 to $32 per share, a sizable lift to its valuation and IPO raise.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re unpacking the company&#8217;s new valuation range, thinking about SentinelOne&#8217;s growth and revenue results compared to similar public companies, and working to understand if the company is inexpensive, neutrally priced or expensive compared to current comps. Sound fun? It will be!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s SentinelOne worth?</h2>
<p>Recall that when SentinelOne last raised capital it was valued at $2.7 billion on a pre-money basis. The company was therefore worth just under $3 billion after the $267 million round. The unicorn is going to yeet that figure into space in its IPO, barring something catastrophic.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210628005452/en/SentinelOne-Announces-Increase-in-IPO-Price-Range">new IPO price range</a> of $31 to $32 per share values the company on a much richer basis. With an anticipated simple share count of 253,530,006 after its IPO, inclusive of a private placement, the company would be worth $7.86 billion to $8.11 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify changed the e-commerce landscape by making it easier for merchants to set up their websites both quickly and affordably. A startup called <a href="https://tapcart.com/">Tapcart</a> is now doing the same for mobile commerce.</p>
<p>The company, which has referred to itself as the &#8220;Shopify for mobile apps,&#8221; today powers the shopping apps for top <a href="https://tapcart.com/resources/studies">brands</a>, including Fashion Nova, Pier One Imports, The Hundreds, Patta, Culture Kings, and thousands more. Following a year of 3x revenue growth, in part driven by the pandemic, Tapcart is today announcing the close of a $50 million round of Series B funding, led by Left Lane Capital. Having clearly taken notice of Tapcart&#8217;s traction with its own merchant base, Shopify is among the round&#8217;s participants.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include SignalFire, Greycroft, Act One Ventures and Amplify LA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mobass/">Sina Mobasser</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericnetsch/">Eric Netsch</a>, have worked in the mobile app industry for years. Mobasser&#8217;s previous company, TestMax, offered one of the first test prep courses on iOS, while Netsch had more recently worked on the agency side to create mobile and digital experiences for brands. Together, the two realized the potential in helping online merchants bring their businesses to mobile, as easily as they were able to go online with Shopify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170857" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170857" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170857" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg 5341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=1536,908 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=2048,1210 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC02403-Edit-2.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170857" class="wp-caption-text">Tapcart’s founders Sina Mobasser and Eric Netsch at their Santa Monica HQ</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you can launch an app on our platform in a matter of weeks, where historically it would take up to a year if you wanted to custom build an app,&#8221; explains Mobasser. &#8220;And you can do it for a low monthly fee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tapcart&#8217;s platform itself offers a simple drag-and-drop builder that allows anyone to create a mobile app for their existing Shopify store using tools to design their layout, customize the product detail pages, integrate checkout options, include product reviews, and even optionally add other branded content, like blogs, lookbooks, videos (including live video) and more. Everything is synced directly from Shopify to the app in real-time, so the merchant&#8217;s inventory, products and collections are all kept up-to-date. That&#8217;s a big differentiator from some rivals, which require duplicate sets of data and data transformation.</p>
<p>Tapcart, meanwhile, leverages all of Shopify&#8217;s APIs and SDKs to create a native application that works with Shopify&#8217;s existing data structures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170864" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170864" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=768,750 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=680,664 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-28-at-10.39.55-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This tight integration with Shopify helps Tapcart because it doesn&#8217;t have to focus on the e-commerce infrastructure, as the way things are structured around inventory and collections are roughly 90% the same across brands. Instead, Tapcart focuses on the 10% that makes brands stand out from one another, which includes things like branding, content and design. Its CMS allows merchants to create exclusive content, change the colors and fonts, add videos and more to make the app look and feel fully customized.</p>
<p>Beyond the mobile app creation aspect to its business, Tapcart also helps merchants automate their marketing. Through the Tapcart platform, merchants can communicate with their customers in real-time using push notifications that can alert them to new sales, to encourage them to return to abandoned carts, or any other promotions. The marketing campaigns can be automated, as well, which helps merchants schedule their upcoming launches and product drops ahead of time. The company claims these push notifications deliver click-through rates that are 72% higher than a traditional email or SMS text because of their interactivity and branding.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170859" style="width: 1180px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170859" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170859 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg" alt="" width="1170" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=1536,831 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=2048,1108 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Push_Phone.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170859" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>The platform has quickly found traction with SMB to mid-market enterprise customers who have reached the stage of their business where it makes sense for them to double down on customer retention and conversion and optimize their mobile workflow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our sweet spot is when you have maybe a couple hundred customers in your database,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;That&#8217;s a perfect time to now focus less on the paid acquisition portion of your business and more on how to retain and engage those existing customers, [so they&#8217;ll] shop more and have a better experience,&#8221; he says.</p>

<p>During the past 12 months, over $1.2 billion in merchant sales have flowed through Tapcart&#8217;s platform. And in 2020, Tapcart&#8217;s recurring revenue increased by 3x, as mobile apps grew even faster during the pandemic, which had increased consumer mobile screen time by 20% year-over-year from 2019. Mobile commerce spending also grew 55% year-over-year, topping $53 billion globally during the holiday shopping season, the company says. Tapcart&#8217;s own merchants saw mobile app orders at a rate of more than once-per-second during this time, and it believes these trends will continue even as the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
<p>Today, Tapcart generates revenue by charging a flat SaaS (software-as-a-service) fee, which differentiates it from a number of competitors who charge a percent of the merchant&#8217;s total sales.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170858" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170858" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2170858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2_AppClips_SMS.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170858" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tapcart</p></div></p>
<p>With the additional funding, Tapcart plans to focus on its goal of becoming a vertically integrated mobile commerce suite of tools, which more recently includes support for iOS App Clips. It will also soon release an upgraded version of its insights analytics platform and will offer scripts that merchants can install on their mobile websites to compare what works on the site versus what works in the app.</p>
<p>Later this year, Tapcart plans to launch a full marketing automation product that will allow brands to automate and personalize their notifications even further. And it plans to invest in market expansions to make its product better designed for mobile, global commerce.</p>
<p>The funding will allow Santa Monica-based Tapcart to hire another 200 people over the next 24 months, up from the 70 it has currently. These will include new additions across time zones and even in markets like Australia and Europe as it moves toward global expansion.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s investment will open up a number of new opportunities as well, including on product, engineering, business strategy and partnerships. It will also help to get Tapcart in front of Shopify&#8217;s 1.7 million global merchants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ErhjrkEgbJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/">5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still quite a lot of merchants that need better mobile experiences, but have yet to really double down on the mobile effort and get something like a native app,&#8221; notes Netsch. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of different ways and methods that merchants are experimenting with mobile growth, and we&#8217;re trying to offer all of the best parts of that in a single platform. So there&#8217;s tons of expansion for Tapcart to do just that with the existing target addressable market,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe brands must be where their customers are, and today that means being on their phones,&#8221; said Satish Kanwar, VP of product acceleration at Shopify, in a statement. &#8220;Tapcart helps merchants create mobile-first shopping experiences that customers love, reinforcing Shopify&#8217;s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We look forward to seeing Tapcart expand its success on Shopify with the more than 1.7 million merchants on our platform today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, TechCrunch is turning its spotlight on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with interviews, profiles, and an event featuring the outgoing mayor, CMU&#8217;s President, and local startups.</p>
<p>The Rust Belt city has spent much of the past decade working to shed the image that arrived in the wake of the deindustrialization of the 1970s and 80s. Courtesy of world class universities like Carnegie Melon and the University of Pittsburgh, the Steel City has transformed itself into a vibrant startup ecosystem and a world class environment for robotics, AI, autonomous driving and other high-tech companies.</p>
<p>Ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s event, TechCrunch spoke to Bill Peduto, who has served as Pittsburgh’s Mayor since 2014, a role that has involved overseeing much of that transformation. The Mayor spoke on his efforts over the past half-dozen years, which will culminate in January when he leaves office.</p>
<p>Peduto will also be speaking at our City Spotlight event Tuesday, June 29, 2021. He&#8217;ll be joining<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/karin-tsai-director-of-engineering-at-duolingo-will-be-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh-on-june-29/"> Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian</a>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">Register for the free event here.</a></p>

<hr />
<p><strong>TechCrunch: What are the biggest initiatives that the city government is doing in order to really help foster the startup community?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mayor Bill Peduto</strong>: We’ve been a partner throughout the past seven years, whether it was with the autonomous vehicle industry, the expansion of robotics or artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, we have engaged directly with the startup community, got them involved in city government and also opened up and provided access to public right of ways in order to see those industries expanding. Working with our universities, we’ve been able to recruit international companies to Pittsburgh: Bosch, Tata, Google, Facebook, Intel, Amazon. They have provided parallel advancements in the tech industry. Pittsburgh has become an innovation hub that people will come to not just for one job but because they know there is opportunity to advance in their careers here in specialized fields.</p>
<p><strong>Many of these companies are coming out of CMU, in industries like robotics, automation and self-driving cars. What is your sense of how varied and diverse the startup community is. What is the breakdown of robotics and automation on one side and all of the other tech categories on the other?</strong></p>
<p>I would say that the robotics and autonomous industries have positioned themselves much more visible on the global stage. But the other industries – especially within the startup industry – are competitive for a share of Pittsburgh’s economy. Obviously the partnership we created with Uber, Aurora and Argo AI – they all garnered attention as Pittsburgh became the first city in the world to have autonomous rideshare. But the fact is that CMU had already been testing their vehicles on our streets for a decade before. We became a city that was one of the first to be able to expand upon that. The competitive advantage that we have here is we don’t have to draw the talent here to build out the industries. We produce the talent.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like there has historically been a problem keeping the talent in Pittsburgh. People often move themselves or their companies to a New York or Silicon Valley. Has that shifted? What initiatives have to made to ensure that people not only come to Pittsburgh, but that they stay in Pittsburgh?</strong></p>
<p>It’s incumbent upon local government to create an environment where people want to live. Quality of life matters and is a key indicator in building out a 21st century urban economy. All the different amenities that we add into city government matter. People want to live in a place that provides them with opportunities that don’t involve being at home or being at work. They want to have a place that has free and plentiful open spaces and areas that they can enjoy. Young people want to be around other young people. For decades, Pittsburgh lacked all three. It was a direct result of deindustrialization and disinvestment. We’ve worked very hard as a city government to build up all three and support locally built companies, whether they’re restaurants, stages or theaters, as a critical part not only of the arts and culture of the city, but also as a critical part of our economic development strategy.</p>
<p><strong>I recently spoke to some startups around Detroit and it was kind of a mixed bag when it comes the legacy of having had the automotive industry based in the city. In 2021, what benefits are there to being a legacy industrial city as it pertains to building a startup ecosystem.</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the company itself, not simply the industry. There are companies that have been around for over 100 years that are some of the most cutting edge within our city. They’ve diversified their portfolios and recognized the direction the world is moving and they have decided to become a competitive part of it. Other companies are more reliant on their success in the past as a model of their future development. As you look at cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit, you understand that their industrial past is something they take great pride in and they build of off.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a sense when speaking to fossil fuel companies that they see the writing on the wall when it comes to pivoting to something more green?</strong></p>
<p>Again, it doesn’t get defined by industry. It’s defined by company and, in most cases, CEO. In many cases in Pittsburgh, absolutely, yes. Everything from the creation to the transfer of energy, long established companies are looking to find a way to put Pittsburgh on the map when it comes to transferring to green hydrogen. The leaders in this are not just the universities, but the companies that have been long established in gas and, in some cases, oil.</p>
<p><strong>What is your sense of how long term an impact Covid-19 will have when it comes to decentralizing some of these tech communities.</strong></p>
<p>You used the exact term. I believe that post-Covid will be a decentralization from the coasts to the cities that have been able to create an environment where they would want to locate. When we’re looking at competition, we’re looking at Charlotte, Austin, Nashville. We’re putting ourselves up against those cities and what they can offer to the startup industry. We’re not as much concerned with the New Yorks and the San Franciscos – or even the Bostons. What we see is that we can be highly competitive against any other area that has research and development that is fueled by the education and medical industries.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest hurdle when it comes to being an entrepreneur in Pittsburgh? And what are you doing to help address that?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest hurdle remains access to venture capital, especially in this stage. I think we’ve been able to convince investors from the coast that the companies don’t need to leave Pittsburgh in order to be highly successful and see their investment pay off. However, I believe if we had more venture capital arriving here to help to take early stage companies into that critical next stage of expansion, it would build off itself and it would excel growth in all of the industry cluster, significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically what is the city doing to attract the attention [and money] of venture capitalists?</strong></p>
<p>It’s more a partnership with the established intitutions like universities and hospital and our local VC community that have been at the forefront. The city provides the critical backing. I should also mention our corporate and philanthropic communities are also key partners, as well. Working together, we created the Pittsburgh Innovation District. It was a direct results of the Brookings report that came out a few years ago. It is a structural partnership between the city and county government, the philanthropic community, the universities and the UPMC. It is created not only to recruit startup companies, but also to recruit the funding and to be partners in the funding of our startup community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is hoping to attempt to fly its in-development spacecraft Starship to orbit for the first time in July, according to company president Gwynne Shotwell. Shotwell shared the timeline at the International Space Development conference during a virtual speaking engagement.</p>
<p>Starship has been in development for the past several years, and it has been making shorter test flights, but remaining within Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, since last year. Its most recent flight also included its first fully successful landing, which is a key ingredient in the development of the Starship launch system, which is designed to be SpaceX&#8217;s first that is fully reusable.</p>
<p>July (aka next month) is an ambitious timeline for making the first orbital flight attempt of Starship, but in May SpaceX filed its planned course for the flight, which would lift off from the company&#8217;s Starship development site in south Texas near Brownsville (known as &#8216;Starbase&#8217;) and then eventually return to Earth with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean somewhere off the cost of Hawaii.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This first flight won&#8217;t end with a controlled landing, and the focus will be on reaching orbit and testing the spacecraft component through that part of the flight. Later tests will include a controlled landing of the Starship spacecraft, with the goal of eventually making the entire system, including the Super Heavy booster that will help propel it to orbit, fully reusable.</p>
<p>While Shotwell seemed to indicate high confidence that SpaceX is pretty much technically ready to begin orbital test flights of Starship, the company still needs to secure a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in order to perform orbital launches, since its existing license only covers suborbital flights. The FAA is currently in process on reviewing the requirements for that license, including an environmental impact review of what it would mean for the surrounding area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saying goes that, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” That may or may not be true, but at least one “old dog” is working hard to disprove that saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Union has been operating in the cross-border payments space</span><a href="https://www.westernunion.com/blog/6-fascinating-things-about-western-unions-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nearly 150 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (yes, you read that right &#8211; 150 years) and today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">globally, it serves almost 150 million customers – representing senders and receivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a number of fintech startups have emerged to challenge Western Union in the massive space – from Wise (formerly TransferWise) to Remitly to WorldRemit. But the payments giant seems up for the challenge and has been investing heavily in its digital operations in an attempt </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/western-union-often-disrupted-by-startups-partners-a-startup-for-digital-push-in-the-philippines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to beat fintechs at their own game</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a massive acceleration of the trend of all things moving to digital in nearly all industries. Money transfer was no exception. In 2020, Western Union benefited from that acceleration. Its overall digital money transfer revenues &#8211; including </span><a href="http://wu.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WU.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its digital partnership business &#8211; climbed by 38% to more than $850 million, up from over $600 million in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of </span><a href="http://wu.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WU.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company’s online transactions site, it saw a nearly 30% gain in annual active customers to 8.6 million. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Western Union, often disrupted by startups, partners with a startup for digital push in the Philippines&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/western-union-often-disrupted-by-startups-partners-a-startup-for-digital-push-in-the-philippines/embed/#?secret=SGzvCx2YDI" data-secret="SGzvCx2YDI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e company recently projected that its digital money transfer revenues are on track to exceed $1 billion in 2021 after first-quarter revenue growth of 45% to a new quarterly high of $242 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Western Union claims to hold the largest cross-border, digital, peer-to-peer payments network in terms of scale, revenue and channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emphasis on beefing up its digital operations – an initiative that actually began in the second half of 2019, according to the company – and expanding those digital offerings to more countries led to Western Union’s overall business profile shifting over the past 15 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital channels in 2020 made up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">29% of transactions and 20% of revenue for the company’s consumer-to-consumer (C2C) business, up from 16% and 14%, respectively, in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Western Union also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“open sourced” its platform to third-party financial institutions in a move it says is a “step towards creating an end-to-end payments processing hub.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shellyswanback/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelly Swanback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Western Union’s president of product and platform, about the company’s digital strategy and what’s next beyond payments for the company (hint: it involves banking products). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: Let’s start out by hearing how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted your business, and what kinds of steps you took as a company to adapt?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: As COVID started playing out, just like any other company, I thought ‘What do we need to do to rally around our customers because our customers who rely on retail locations may not be able to get to their retail location as the COVID lockdowns started happening?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things we learned from that experience is this notion of everyday innovation. Innovation isn&#8217;t always blockchain or some emerging technology. Sometimes the best innovation is just about innovating every day with the products and services that you have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we had some places in the world where we actually needed to figure out how we could do home delivery of cash. Delivering cash is different than delivering pizza as you can imagine, as there are a whole lot of regulatory items and security items. We very quickly figured out how we can deliver cash in Sri Lanka and Nepal, Jordan and some other places across the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example lies in addressing how some folks were just a little intimidated by digital technology. I thought, ‘What if we set up a video digital location we called it where people could call in and do a video call with us and we could help them with their money transfer?’ It turned out that there actually wasn&#8217;t as much customer demand for that as we might have thought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the great news &#8212; and this is a good lesson, I think, for many organizations &#8212; is what we actually did there in terms of KYC (Know Your Customer), which is a big thing in the financial services industry. So, all the technology we set up for this digital location for customers to upload their documents electronically and not have to be in front of an agent, we’re using today, just in a different way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TC: I know Western Union has touted the fact that it has such a strong physical presence in so many locations actually benefits the growth of its digital operations as well as an expansion into other offerings beyond payments. Can you elaborate on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: The success and acceleration that we&#8217;re having in our digital business and of course the quarterly results are great, and we want to continue to do that. But for me, what&#8217;s most exciting is just the solid foundation and the basis gives us to build toward this idea of having a more meaningful account-based relationship with our customers and ability to offer them more than just money transfer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have the fortune of having a trusted brand that&#8217;s known globally and trusted for something that&#8217;s very near and dear to our customers. What we&#8217;re hearing from our customers is they would trust us to provide additional services. So one of the things that we&#8217;re beginning to put plans in place for, and beginning to do some market tests on, is building an ecosystem or building a marketplace if you will. It will all be catered around the 270 million migrants across the world and really connecting them to each other, connecting them to their families and connecting them to merchants who want to sell them goods or provide them services that are very culturally relevant to them,  either where they happen to be living and working or providing them services back home to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the fall, we&#8217;re going to be launching our first market test in Europe. We&#8217;re going to be offering a bank account, debit card, and multi-currency accounts tied of course into our money transfer services, as well as a few other things as we get closer to the market launch. But this really is our first test around providing a more comprehensive set of services.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: You recently announced a tie-up with Google Pay and some others. What is the significance of those partnerships?</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanback: We want to be able to offer our cross-border capabilities and platform in more of a co-branded or white-label fashion, so that we can reach those customers that might still prefer to just be a customer of a bank. As an example, we recently announced that Google Pay users can log in to their app and can do cross-border transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that&#8217;s an important part of our strategy– going after the direct relationship with customers and at the same time being able to offer our platform to others who already have a direct relationship with our customer. This is also part of our whole technology modernization right now of course. We&#8217;re very, very strong in the C2C segment, but the way we&#8217;re going about our technology modernization is one that provides us optionality to continue to expand in other segments  – whether it be consumer to business or business to consumer, or even business to business.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>TC: Tell me more about this “modernization.”</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Swanback</em></strong>: Like many financial organizations and many existing global organizations, part of our massive technology modernization program is moving to the cloud. So we were well on our way from migrating many of our applications to an AWS Cloud Platform. We’re pretty excited about the progress that we&#8217;re making there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, over the last 12 to 18 months, we’ve migrated a good portion of our customer agent transactions, like the core of our data, to Snowflake. We;&#8217;ve mined 33 data warehouses, and we&#8217;ve got 20 petabytes of data in the cloud. And so, that in itself is just this is just the starting point. We&#8217;re modernizing our apps on top of this data foundation and really starting to use artificial intelligence and machine learning. But we’re not using it in the back end processes like many other organizations who were using it for operational interactions with our customers. We&#8217;re using it in the front office. For example, we launched a telephone money transfer product where a customer talks to a virtual assistant and it’s 100% digitized. It’s actually one of the best customer experiences we&#8217;ve seen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Honda said Monday it will sell its first electric SUV in North America in early 2024, part of the automaker’s push to shift away from gas-powered vehicles before the middle of the decade. The new car&#8217;s name, Prologue, is meant to signify the beginning of what the company called its “new electrified era.”</p>
<p>Prologue is one of two forthcoming Honda vehicles that will use General Motors’ Ultium Cells EV platform and battery packs. The other, yet unnamed car, will be under the Acura brand and will also debut in 2024. GM will also manufacture the two vehicles at its North American facilities, as part of a long-running partnership between the two OEMs.</p>
<p>The automaker is keeping quiet about key details of the new SUVs, including the price and even what the car will look like. But it will enter a competitive electric SUV market, up against rivals such as Tesla’s Model Y, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Volkswagen’s ID.4.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Honda joined other automakers, including GM and Volvo, in setting ambitious electrification targets. GEO Toshihiro Mibe in April set an escalating target for its global battery and fuel cell electric sales of 40% by 2030, 80% by 2035 and completely phasing out internal combustion engine sales by 2040. As part of that target, Honda said it has plans to develop its own EV platform, dubbed e:Architecture, for EV models launched in the second half of the decade.</p>
<p>Honda separately announced on Monday that it had entered into an agreement with Battery Resourcers to recycle batteries from Honda and Acura EVs. These batteries will initially be processed at the recycling firm&#8217;s site in Worcester, Massachusetts, and then at a commercial scale plant that the company says will be operational in 2022. Battery Resourcers recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">$20 million Series B</a> to scale its operations, including opening the new plant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based robotics company CMR Surgical this morning <a href="https://cmrsurgical.com/news/cmr-closes-series-d-fundraise">announced a $600 million Series D</a>. This latest round, led by Softbank’s Vision Fund 2 and co-led by Ally Bridge Group, joins an <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cmr-surgical">existing $384.8 million</a> already raised by the Cambridge firm. It values the company at $3 billion.</p>
<p>CMR’s flagship product is Versius. The robotic system is designed to perform minimally invasive keyhole surgery, primarily focused on serious conditions like bowel disease or bowel cancer. The platform has been used globally and has thus far been involved in 1,000 surgeries, according to CMR’s numbers.</p>
<p>Four NHS (National Health Service) hospitals in the U.K. have enlisted the surgical platform, along with a slew of other locations in Europe, India, the Middle East and Australia. As CMR notes, the pandemic has resulted in a massive backlog in surgical procedures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/475942883" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Like many other robotic surgical platforms, one of Versius’s primary appeals is a sense of accessibility – essentially helping level the playing field for complex procedures. The system is modular and portable compared to a number of competitors, further increasing that accessibility. The company says funding will go toward accelerating the platform’s global roll out.</p>
<p>“This latest financing equips CMR with significant funds to accelerate our mission of bringing Versius to hospitals worldwide, whilst providing full flexibility to achieve our goals,” CEO Per Vegard Nerseth said in a release tied to the news. “This major injection of capital that now values us at $3billion not only reflects the level of interest we have seen in our product, but also the scale of the business, and will enable significant technology developments and global expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surgical robotics have been an increasingly popular category for VC funds of late. Recent rounds include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/memic-raises-96m-for-its-robot-assisted-surgery-platform/">$96 million for Memic,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">$10 million for ForSight</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/activ-surgical-raises-15-million-to-advance-autonomous-and-collaborative-robotic-surgery/">$15 million for Activ</a>. Even by those standards however, this is a massive round for the category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/department-of-transportation-to-provide-165m-to-make-u-s-cities-smarter/">U.S. Department of Transportation launched a Smart City Challenge in 2015</a>, which asked mid-sized cities across the country to come up with ideas for novel smart transportation systems that would use data and tech to improve mobility. Out of 78 applicants, Columbus, Ohio emerged as the winner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the city of just under a million residents was then awarded a $50 million grant to turn its proposal into a reality. $40 million came from the DOT, and $10 million from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-June, the program ended, but Columbus said the city would continue to work as a “collaborative innovation lab,” using city funds to integrate technology to address societal problems. But what does that mean in reality? </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Columbus’s ‘Smart City’ looks nothing like the rapidly developing prototype Toyota is developing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/">Woven City</a>, at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, but it’s not supposed to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really focus on not just demonstrating technology for technology&#8217;s sake, but to look at the challenges we are facing in our city around mobility and transportation and use our award to focus on some of those challenges,” Mandy Bishop, Smart Columbus program manager, told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those challenges involve lack of accessibility to mobility options, areas underserved by public transit, parking challenges, and terrible drivers with high collision rates. As you might expect, a lot of startups are involved in solving those challenges; Here&#8217;s who&#8217;s involved and what they bring to the table. </span></p>

<h3><b>The Pivot app, built by Etch</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etch is a Columbus-based geospatial solutions startup. Founded in 2018, the company cut its teeth with Smart Columbus, creating a multi-modal transport app that helps users plan trips throughout central Ohio using buses, ride hailing, carpool, micromobility or personal vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mobility problem in Columbus is access to mobility and people not understanding or knowing what options are available to them,” Darlene Magold, CEO and co-founder of Etch, told TechCrunch. “Part of our mission was to show the community what was available and give them options to sort those options based on cost or other information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app is based on open source tools like OpenStreetMap and OpenTripPlanner. Etch uses the former to get up-to-date crowdsourced information from the community about what’s happening in a given area, similar to Waze. The latter is used to find itineraries for different forms of mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because we are open source, the integration with Uber, Lyft and other mobility providers really gives users a lot of options so they can actually see what mobility options are available, other than their own vehicle if they have one. It takes away that anxiety of traveling and using that mixed mode of travel, knowing in real time where the bus is or where to find a scooter, and  like using Uber or renting a bike or scooter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.25 million of the total federal funds went to the Pivot app, which has 3,849 downloads to date, and the city will continue to fund the development and use of Pivot.</span></p>
<h3><b>Smart Columbus Operating System, made by Pillar Technology</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Columbus hired local smart embedded software company Pillar Technology, which was acquired by Accenture in 2018, to further develop the existing Smart Columbus operating system. The $15.9 million open source platform that hosts the city’s mobility data, including over 2,000 datasets and 209 visualizations, launched in April 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The program will continue through at least January 2022 as Columbus works to develop mobility and transportation use cases and further define the value and use of the operating system,” said Bishop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smart Columbus OS invites others to add their data to the set while also calling for crowdsourced solutions to problems like how to bring down crash rates or how to optimize city parking. </span></p>
<h3><b>Park Columbus, made with ParkMobile</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ParkMobile is an Atlanta-based provider of smart parking solutions. For Smart Columbus, the startup created Park Columbus, an event parking management app, to help free up traffic and pollution from cars circling around looking for parking. Users can find, reserve and pay for parking all on the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Columbus’s event parking management program built enhancements within ParkMobile’s existing offering, according to a spokesperson for the city. The $1.3 million project had over 30,000 downloads from October 2020 to March 2021. The city will continue to fund the app which will also display on-street parking via predictive analytic technology. </span></p>

<h3><b>Smart Mobility Hubs, built by Orange Barrel Media</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smart Mobility Hubs are interactive digital kiosks designed by Orange Barrel Media, a company that builds media displays to integrate into urban landscapes. The hubs bring the city’s transportation options together at a single location, like a physical manifestation of the Pivot app, which can actually also be accessed via the kiosks. The kiosks, which took another $1.3 million chunk out of the total federal grant pool, also have free WiFI and listings of restaurants, shops and activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange Barrel’s media displays can vary from something community oriented like its kiosks to advertising to art. According to Smart Columbus, the kiosks, placed at six key locations, had over 65,000 interactions from July 2020 to March 2021, but the city hopes that number will drastically increase in the post-pandemic era. The hubs also include the city’s bike share program, CoGo, which offers both pedal and e-bikes, bike racks, designated dockless scooter share and bike share parking, rideshare pickup and drop off zones, car sharing parking and EV charging stations.</span></p>
<h3><b>Connected vehicle environment, in partnership with Siemens</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohio has some of the worst drivers in the nation. This year, </span><a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Ohio-state-patrol-unveils-distracted-driving-16248689.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the state highway patrol released details about distracted driving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state, and found 70,000 crashes attributed to distracted driving since 2016, with more than 2,000 involving serious injuries or fatalities. In 2019, an insurance agency rated </span><a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/study-shows-columbus-drivers-are-among-worst-us-2019-oct/530-d8954829-81ba-4dae-a7e9-c521fe46f0d6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Columbus the fourth worst driving in the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might explain why the city wanted to experiment with connected vehicles. From October 2020 to March 2021, Columbus partnered with Siemens who provided both onboard and roadside units in creating a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) environment. Connected vehicles would “talk” to each other and to 85 intersections, seven of which have the highest crash rates in central Ohio. The project cost about $11.3 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were looking at 11 different applications including red light signal warning, school zone notifications, intersection collision warning, freight signal priority and transit signal priority, using the connected vehicle technology,” said Bishop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We deployed about 1,100 vehicles in a region that has about a million residents, so we did not anticipate seeing a decreased crash rate, but we did see drivers using the signals coming from the connected vehicle environment to not run traffic signals, so we’re really seeing improvements in driver behavior, which ultimately we would anticipate long term to effectively improve safety.”</span></p>

<h3><b>Linden LEAP, made by Easy Mile</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Columbus’s autonomous shuttle service, the Linden LEAP, cost about $2.3 million and ran from February 2020 until March 2021, with some breaks in between. Initially, two shuttles hitting four stops operated in the Linden neighborhood to provide transportation to underserved communities. That only lasted about two weeks before a passenger was somehow thrust from their seat when the vehicle, going no more than 25 miles per hour, stopped short. Then the pandemic happened, and it was a human shuttle service no longer. From July until the end of the program, the Linden LEAP pivoted to deliver 3,598 food pantry boxes or almost 130,000 meals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city will not continue to pay for the autonomous shuttle service now that federal funding has ended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The city is not historically a transit operator, so we’re really staying close to how CoTa looks to incorporate connected and autonomous and electric technology into their fleets moving forward,” said Bishop. “Our anticipation is that the next demonstrations would be private sector led or ultimately led by our transit authority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">French startup Easy Mile ran the Level 3 autonomous technology behind the shuttle, according to a spokesperson for the company. The Society of Automobile Engineers describes Level 3 as still requiring a human operator in the driver’s seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Columbus’s dalliance with autonomy initially began in late 2018 when Smart Columbus partnered with DriveOhio and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/may-mobility-puts-autonomous-shuttles-on-the-streets-of-columbus-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">May Mobility to launch the Smart Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the city’s OG self-driving shuttle. The shuttle ran a 1.5 mile route circling the Scioto Mile downtown, giving out over 16,000 free rides to certain cultural landmarks until September 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Circuit only cost about $500,000, but the city spent another $400,000 on general development for the entire autonomous shuttle program.</span></p>

<h3><b>Prenatal Trip Assistance, built by Kaizen Health</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaizen Health, a woman-owned technology firm, built its initial application after being dissatisfied with transportation options available to people undergoing health treatments. The Chicago-based company applied its model of streamlining the experience of ordering non-emergency, multimodal medical transportation for pregnant women and families.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program got $1.3 million in Smart Columbus funds from June 2019 to January 2021, but only had about 143 participants due to the pandemic, but that includes over 800 medical care trips and over 300 pharmacy, grocery or other service-related trips. In a state that averaged </span><a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200225/ohio-infant-deaths-decline-but-racial-disparity-persists"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.9 deaths for every 1,000 babies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the year this program began, it’s a good thing the participating Medicaid managed care organizations are now modernizing how they deliver non-emergency transportation services, including access to such a mobile application.</span></p>
<h3><b>Mobility assistance for people with cognitive disabilities, in partnership with Wayfinder</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech partner for the final project was Wayfinder, a navigation app that was acquired by Vodafone in 2019. The Mobility Assistance for People with Cognitive Disabilities (MAPCD) study worked with Wayfinder to create a highly detailed, turn-by-turn navigation app specifically built for those who have cognitive disabilities, making it safer for those people to be more independent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pilot cost nearly $500,000 and lasted from April 2019 to April 2020. Thirty-one participants used the app to get more comfortable using public transport. According to a spokesperson for the city, Columbus is working with potential partners to find a way to sustain the program. </span></p>
<h3><b>Looking towards the future</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the focuses of Smart Columbus was also electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure. The money from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and AEP Ohio, the state’s utility provider, helped incentivize and encourage multi-unit dwellings, workplaces and public sites to install charging stations. Smart Columbus exceeded its goal of 900 EV charging stations, as well as its goal for 1.8% of new car sales to be electric, reaching 2.34% in November, 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the future I think something that&#8217;s here to stay is really ensuring that we&#8217;re solving resident challenges in a way that makes sense for our community,” said Bishop.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On the heels of Etsy&#8217;s huge deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/etsy-is-acquiring-social-selling-site-depop-for-1-625b-in-a-mostly-cash-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Depop</a> to open the door to more social selling, targeting younger users, and deeply expand in Europe, the crafty marketplace has announced another significant deal to build out its reach, this time in Latin America. Etsy has <a href="https://investors.etsy.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Etsy-to-acquire-Elo7-Brazil-based-marketplace-for-unique-handmade-items/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will acquire Elo7 &#8212; commonly referred to as the &#8220;Etsy of Brazil&#8221; for its popular marketplace for crafty creators &#8212; for $217 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Etsy was already active in Brazil, but Elo7, one of the 10 biggest e-commerce sites in the region with 1.9 million active buyers, 56,000 active sellers and some 8 million items for sale, will give Etsy a significantly bigger presence in the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As with Depop (which was a $1.6 billion acquisition for Etsy) and Reverb (a musical instruments market Etsy acquired in 2019), Elo7 will remain a standalone brand and continue to be operated by its current management team out of its HQ in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The deal underscores an interesting playbook under Etsy CEO Josh Silverman, who has a long history in the world of e-commerce, including years with eBay during that company&#8217;s more acquisitive heydays.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Elo7 is the &#8216;Etsy of Brazil,&#8217; with a purpose and business model similar to our own,&#8221; Silverman said in a statement. &#8220;Following our recent agreement to purchase Depop, we&#8217;re excited to bring another unique marketplace into the Etsy family. This transaction will establish a foothold for us in Latin America, an underpenetrated ecommerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base. We look forward to welcoming Elo7&#8217;s talented leadership team and employees to the Etsy family.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting turn also for Etsy as it goes into a more aggressive growth mode. A lot of the earlier days in the world of e-commerce were marked by companies expanding inorganically &#8212; specifically, by picking up market share through acquisitions of similar players in their own or new geographies the acquirer wants to enter. This was the playbook followed at times by eBay, Amazon, Groupon and more.</p>
<p>These days, maybe because e-commerce has matured and, well, Amazon is such a behemoth that the barrier to entry becomes harder, you see a lot less of that, and there has even been something of a stigma attached to companies that you could call &#8220;clones&#8221; of models already started and scaled elsewhere, just not in your patch of the world.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting to see Etsy buying into that quite specifically in this case, with its announcement pointing out all the synergies of the two companies&#8217; business models making it an easy one to bring into the fold. It&#8217;s something also highlighted by Elo7 &#8212; which in its time had raised about $18 million in funding from investors that included Accel, Monashes, and Insight Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Etsy has always been an inspiration and a reference for us, and we&#8217;re excited to continue our growth journey as part of Etsy &#8211; a company whose mission and culture so closely match our own,&#8221; said Carlos Curioni, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/11/accel-and-monashees-capital-back-the-etsy-for-brazil-elo7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elo7&#8217;s longtime CEO</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to leveraging Etsy&#8217;s product and marketing expertise to help the Elo7 marketplace, community and team achieve our full potential in Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazil is really a prime market to follow the inorganic acquisition strategy. The country is one of the biggest e-commerce markets in the world in terms of both population, buying power and digital device penetration (particularly smartphones). At a time when many mature markets are seeing e-commerce growth slow &#8212; <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excepting the 44% bump in Covid-19 spending in 2020</a>, typically US consumers were seeing e-commerce growth of around 15% and slowing year-on-year pre-pandemic &#8212; Brazil has been booming, since penetration is still pretty low but all the right factors for growth are there. Etsy cites figures that project it will grow 26% by 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to announce this purchase of Elo7 following our recent announcement of the Depop transaction &#8211; two exciting businesses that meet Etsy&#8217;s very high bar for use of capital,&#8221; said Rachel Glaser, Etsy, Inc. CFO, in. statement. &#8220;In addition to job one, which is continuing to drive growth in our core <a href="http://etsy.com/">Etsy.com</a> marketplace, we will now focus on integrating Depop and Elo7 into the Etsy family. Reverb, Depop and Elo7 will each continue to be run by their talented and empowered management teams, and we&#8217;ll connect key functions across the brands in a way designed to accelerate value creation and make the whole worth more than the sum of its parts.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s digital businesses can breathe a sign of relief today as the European Commission has officially signed off on data adequacy for the (now) third country, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big deal for UK businesses as it means the country will be treated by Brussels as having essentially equivalent data protection rules as markets within the bloc, despite no longer being a member itself &#8212; enabling personal data to continue to flow freely from the EU to the UK, and avoiding any new legal barriers.</p>
<p>The granting of adequacy status has been all but assured in recent weeks, after European Union Member States signed off on a draft adequacy arrangement. But the Commission&#8217;s adoption of the decision marks the final step in the process &#8212; at least for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3183">PR</a> includes a clear warning that if the UK seeks to weaken protections afforded to people&#8217;s data under the current regime it &#8220;will intervene&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement, Věra Jourová, Commission VP for values and transparency, said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“</em>The UK has left the EU but today its legal regime of protecting personal data is as it was. Because of this, we are adopting these adequacy decisions today. At the same time, we have listened very carefully to the concerns expressed by the Parliament, the Members States and the European Data Protection Board, in particular on the possibility of future divergence from our standards in the UK&#8217;s privacy framework. We are talking here about a fundamental right of EU citizens that we have a duty to protect. This is why we have significant safeguards and if anything changes on the UK side, we will intervene.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The UK adequacy decision comes with a Sword of Damocles baked in: A sunset clause of four years. It&#8217;s a first &#8212; so, er, congratulations to the UK government for projecting a perception of itself as untrustworthy over the short run.</p>
<p>This clause means the UK&#8217;s regime will face full scrutiny again in 2025, with no automatic continuation if its standards are deemed to have slipped (as many fear they will).</p>
<p>The Commission also emphasizes that its decision does not mean the UK has four &#8216;guaranteed&#8217; years in the clear. On the contrary, it says it will &#8220;continue to monitor the legal situation in the UK and could intervene at any point, if the UK deviates from the level of protection currently in place&#8221;.</p>
<p>Third countries without an adequacy agreement &#8212; such as the US, which has adequacy twice struck down by Europe&#8217;s top court (after it found US surveillance law incompatible with EU fundamental rights) &#8212; do not enjoy &#8216;seamless&#8217; legal certainty around personal data flows; and must instead take steps to assess each of these transfers individually to determine whether (and how) they can move data legally.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-puts-out-final-guidance-on-data-transfers-to-third-countries/">Last week</a>, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) put out its final bit of guidance for third countries wanting to transfer personal data outside the bloc. And the advice makes it clear that some types of transfers are unlikely to be possible.</p>
<p>For other types of transfers, the advice discusses a number of of supplementary measures (including technical steps like robust encryption) that may be possible for a data controller to use in order to, through their own technical, contractual and organizational effort, ramp up the level of protection to achieve the required standard.</p>
<p>It is, in short, a lot of work. And without today&#8217;s adequacy decision UK businesses would have had to get intimately acquainted with the EDPB&#8217;s guidance. For now, though, they&#8217;ve dodged that bullet.</p>
<p>The qualifier is still very necessary, though, because the UK government has signalled that it intends to rethink data protection.</p>
<p>How exactly it goes about that &#8212; and to what extent it changes the current &#8216;essentially equivalent&#8217; regime &#8212; may make all the difference. For example, Digital minister <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac1cbaef-d8bf-49b4-b11d-1fcc96dde0e1">Oliver Dowden has talked about data being &#8220;a great opportunity&#8221; for the UK</a>, post-Brexit.</p>
<p>And writing in the FT back in February he suggested there will be room for the UK to rewrite its national data protection rules without diverging so much that it puts adequacy at risk. &#8220;We fully intend to maintain those world-class standards. But to do so, we do not need to copy and paste the EU’s rule book, the General Data Protection Regulation, word-for-word,&#8221; he suggested then, adding that: &#8220;Countries as diverse as Israel and Uruguay have successfully secured adequacy with Brussels despite having their own data regimes. Not all of those were identical to GDPR, but equal doesn’t have to mean the same. The EU doesn’t hold the monopoly on data protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devil will, as they say, be in the detail. But some <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994125/FINAL_TIGRR_REPORT__1_.pdf">early signals are concerning</a> &#8212; and the UK&#8217;s startup ecosystem would be well advised to take an active role in impressing upon government the importance to stay aligned with European data standards.</p>
<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s also the prospect of a legal challenge to the adequacy decision &#8212; even as is, i.e. based on current UK standards (which find <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/B-9-2021-0272_EN.html">plenty of critics</a>). Certainly it can&#8217;t be ruled out &#8212; and the CJEU hasn&#8217;t shied away from quashing other adequacy arrangements it judged to be invalid&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Note that reaching this stage was totally predictable; it was never the data-transfer-compliance supine Commission that was going to take CJEU case-law on this seriously. Only the Court might — the &#39;guardian of the Treaties&#39; has long left the building. The saga continues.</p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1409469967620268037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Today, though, the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) has seized the chance to celebrate a PR win, writing that the Commission&#8217;s decision &#8220;rightly recognises the country’s high data protection standards&#8221;.</p>
<p>The department also reiterated the UK government&#8217;s intention to &#8220;promote the free flow of personal data globally and across borders&#8221;, including through what it bills as &#8220;ambitious new trade deals and through new data adequacy agreements with some of the fastest growing economies&#8221; &#8212; simultaneously claiming it would do so &#8220;while ensuring people’s data continues to be protected to a high standard&#8221;. Pinky promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;All future decisions will be based on what maximises innovation and keeps up with evolving tech,&#8221; the DCMS added in a press release. &#8220;As such, the government’s approach will seek to minimise burdens on organisations seeking to use data to tackle some of the most pressing global issues, including climate change and the prevention of disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Dowden also made a point of combining both streams, saying: &#8220;We will now focus on unlocking the power of data to drive innovation and boost the economy while making sure we protect people’s safety and privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>UK business and tech associations were just as quick to welcome the Commission&#8217;s adequacy decision. The alternative would of course have been very costly disruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, John Foster, director of policy for the Confederation of British Industry, said: “This breakthrough in the EU-UK adequacy decision will be welcomed by businesses across the country. The free flow of data is the bedrock of the modern economy and essential for firms across all sectors– from automotive to logistics &#8212; playing an important role in everyday trade of goods and services. This positive step will help us move forward as we develop a new trading relationship with the EU.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement, Julian David, CEO of techUK, added: “Securing an EU-UK adequacy decision has been a top priority for techUK and the wider tech industry since the day after the 2016 referendum. The decision that the UK’s data protection regime offers an equivalent level of protection to the EU GDPR is a vote of confidence in the UK’s high data protection standards and is of vital importance to UK-EU trade as the free flow of data is essential to all business sectors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The data adequacy decision also provides a basis for the UK and EU to work together on global routes for the free flow of data with trust, building on the G7 Digital and Technology declaration and possibly unlocking €2TR of growth. The UK must also now move to complete the development of its own international data transfer regime in order to allow companies in the UK not just to exchange data with the EU but also to be able to access opportunities across the world.”</p>
<p>The Commission has actually adopted two UK adequacy decisions today &#8212; one under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and another for the Law Enforcement Directive.</p>
<p>Discussing key elements in its decision to grant the UK adequacy, EU lawmakers highlighted the fact the UK&#8217;s (current) system is based upon transposed European rules; that access to personal data by public authorities in the UK (such as for national security reasons) is done under a framework that has what it dubbed as &#8220;strong safeguards&#8221; (such as intercepts being subject to prior authorisation by an independent judicial body; measures needing to be necessary and proportionate; and redress mechanisms for those who believe they are subject to unlawful surveillance).</p>
<p>The Commission also noted that the UK is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights; must adhere <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to the </span>European Convention of Human Rights;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/108">Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; aka &#8220;the only binding international treaty in the area of data protection&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;These international commitments are an essential elements of the legal framework assessed in the two adequacy decisions,&#8221; the Commission notes. </span></p>
<p>Data transfers for the purposes of UK immigration control have been excluded from the scope of the adequacy decision adopted under the GDPR &#8212; with the Commission saying that&#8217;s &#8220;in order to reflect a recent judgment of the England and Wales Court of Appeal on the validity and interpretation of certain restrictions of data protection rights in this area&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission will reassess the need for this exclusion once the situation has been remedied under UK law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>So, again, there&#8217;s another caveat right there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ran Korber and his asthmatic and pregnant wife were looking to buy a house in Israel. As an environmental engineer, he knows that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of premature death, can cause premature birth, and can account for other respiratory diseases. Korber started looking for the city with the least amount of pollution in Israel only to realize that this information didn’t exist. His frustration led him to create what today is <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a>, a tool that forecasts 40 pollutants within the categories of pollen, air pollution, wildfires and weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the company announced a $30 million Series C </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">led by Fortissimo Capital, bringing its total raised to date to $45 million. The company is based in Israel and launched in June of 2014, about two years after Korber was house-hunting with his wife.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Science: Keeping AI honest in medicine, climate science and vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/deep-science-keeping-ai-honest-in-medicine-climate-science-and-vision/embed/#?secret=zcojVHVNvp" data-secret="zcojVHVNvp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In many countries, people don’t have a clue about the air around them,” Korber, now CEO and co-founder of BreezoMeter, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter uses AI and machine learning to gather and understand data from multiple sources, including more than 47,000 sensors worldwide. The result is street-level air quality resolution (within 16.5 ft) and pollen, pollutants, and fire data, in more than 100 countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably didn’t know this, but if you have an Apple Watch or an iPhone, they both have BreezoMeter built into the Apple weather app. Scroll down on the weather of any city, and the air quality measure is presented by BreezoMeter. In the U.S., the Air Quality Index (AQI) uses a scale from 0-500, 0 being the cleanest. Here in Miami, the air quality was 36 (good) yesterday, and 51 (moderate) today. In comparison, New York City’s air is 34 (good) today, better than Miami’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter is not only able to measure current air quality, but it can forecast it, too, allowing people to better prepare depending on their sensitivities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are able to forecast when the conditions for pollen season will start, and then [we] can forecast how pollen may move between two different locations,” said Korber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not sure of your sensitivities, knowing the air quality of where you are, you can at least keep a lookout for symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Depending on the type of pollutant in the air, BreezoMeter can also tell you the possible symptoms you may start feeling if exposed,” Korber said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge isn’t just the pollution itself, but also a large information gap regarding air quality. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), about 120 million people in the U.S. live in areas where there is no pollution monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before BreezoMeter, everyone used the data from the same sensors, and now we collect data from those sensors plus others including traffic data, wildfires, satellites, local sensors and we also take into account land use for pollen,” said Korber.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s behind this year&#8217;s boom in climate tech SPACs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/embed/#?secret=VDtTTE5tFX" data-secret="VDtTTE5tFX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A time when sensors can easily get destroyed is during a wildfire. “The sensors can burn, literally,” Korber said. To circumvent this problem, BreezoMeter relies on its other multitude of sensors for the data, including those from satellites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day, more than 300 million people use our platform to make informed decisions on how to avoid environmental hazards,” said Korber, and not everyone is using just the weather app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, they may be benefiting from BreezoMeter from within <a href="https://www.propellerhealth.com/">Propeller by Resmed</a>. Propeller is a device that, depending on the air quality, tells a patient what to do to improve their health, such as close a window or use an inhaler, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to BreezoMeter, since Propeller incorporated BreezoMeter into its product, Propeller’s patients have experienced about 50% fewer asthma attacks and reduced ER visits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BreezoMeter plans to use the money from the current raise to develop more product categories and triple its team to about 120 people.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>As you are reading this, I&#8217;ll be preparing to head out for an adventure, joining thousands of others who plan to jump in their cars, trucks, SUVs, and of course, vans and RVs for the great American road trip. While much of my time will be spent hiking in more remote wilderness, I will end up in Yellowstone National Park, which promises to be a busy affair. For those of you who are shaking your heads wondering why I would subject myself to the masses, I say consider this fun tidbit: According to one local guidebook, 98% of visitors to Yellowstone can be found within one mile of any trailhead. My previous anecdotal experiences supports this stat; I&#8217;ve found that most stick to their cars, paved paths, overlooks and boardwalks. I will not be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I will, however, make one exception while I&#8217;m in the park. I plan to check out the autonomous shuttle that will be piloted in the park. Beep, in partnership with Local Motors, will be operating the autonomous shuttle called T.E.D.D.Y., which stands for The Electric Driverless Demonstration in Yellowstone. T.E.D.D.Y. is meant to give homage to former President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The company plans to operate two routes, seven days a week. Information collected during the pilot will be used to inform future deployments in national parks across the country.</p>
<p><em>Happy trails.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a week of funding announcements and new vehicles in the micromobility world. Two of the e-scooter giants, <strong>Spin</strong> and <strong>Bird</strong>, have announced some fresh launches. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/ford-micromobility-subsidiary-spin-launches-first-in-house-built-e-scooter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin’s got its first in-house designed and built electric scooter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it’s calling the S-100T. The T is for “tough,” which is how Spin is positioning this scooter. It can get beat up on the streets, and in testing, and still last up to three years, maybe even more. Spin will start rolling out its scooter when it launches in Sacramento in July.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bird is launching some e-bikes to its fleet of e-scooters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will start in Cleveland, Ohio later this year. Bird’s choice to become multi-modal happens at a time when its biggest competitor, <strong>Lime</strong>, has already had bikes and is now working with e-mopeds. Bird is also launching a ‘Smart Bikeshare’ platform, wherein local shared e-bike and e-moped (but NOT e-scooter) operators can put their vehicles on the Bird app, thus making it seem like Bird has more of a multi-modal fleet than it does, and giving the local operators some more clout and attention. </span></p>
<p><b>Following the money</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of local operators, micromobility software provider <strong>Joyride</strong> believes more small shared e-scooter and e-bike businesses are cropping up, especially in areas where Bird and Lime pulled out during the pandemic. To help those companies get a fleet, launch it and manage it is Joyride. The company has been around since 2014, but </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/micromobility-software-provider-joyride-raises-3-7-million-seed-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just raised a $3.7 million seed round so that it can expand its services and help reach more local operators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while we’re on the subject of funding, New Zealand-based electric utility bike startup <strong>Ubco</strong> has just raised $10 million to fund its global expansion, with a focus on the U.S. market, and scale up its commercial subscription business. Full disclosure, I’m currently in Auckland testing one of these things out and it’s “smooth as,” as the Kiwis say, so keep your eyes out for a review of the bike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ubco 2X2 vehicle, which looks like a dirt bike and rides like a moped, started as a way to get farmers around the pasture, but the founders soon saw the utility vehicle’s utility beyond the farm. Now, the company supplies bikes to enterprise fleets, mail services, logistics and more.

<p><b>Safety first</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tier Mobility</strong>, the Berlin-based e-scooter company that recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won one of the London permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and signed on some </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/tier-banks-60-million-in-debt-from-goldman-sachs-to-expand-scooter-fleet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$60 million worth of debt from Goldman Sachs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has published an e-scooter safety </span><a href="https://www.tier.app/wp-content/uploads/TIER-UK-Safety-Board-Interim-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company formed a group called the Tier UK Safety Board in conjunction with charities and transport experts, Tier says. The group is calling for higher safety standards across the sector to protect pedestrians and improve rider safety, particularly for those who are blind or partially sighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Might this report just be a ploy for Tier to flex its safety records? Probably, but are the safety suggestions this group is likely trying to make into law also stuff that Tier already does? Also, yes, probably. Here are the things: </span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a SPAC-tacular week. Yes, I went there.</p>
<p>SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, have received a lot of attention in this newsletter. And that&#8217;s because the financial instrument, which allows a faster but more expensive path to an IPO, has inundated the transportation sector. Some 22 mobility SPACs occurred in 2020 with the majority of them involving electric vehicle manufacturers like the troubled Nikola Motors and Lordstown Motors, as well as Canoo, which has had its own drama, and Fisker.</p>
<p>In 2021, we&#8217;ve seen aviation-related companies take the SPAC plunge along with lidar companies and autonomous vehicle startups. This week, we had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/lidar-company-quanergy-to-go-public-via-1-4b-spac-deal/">solid state lidar company <strong>Quanergy</strong></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">self-driving trucks startup <strong>Embark</strong></a> make SPAC deals.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>BMW’s</strong> Silicon Valley-based venture capital arm is investing in <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, a company that develops autonomous trucking technology. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Kodiak told TechCrunch that BMW&#8217;s investment was financial, not strategic, meaning there&#8217;s no technical partnership between the two companies.</p>

<p><strong>Clean Mobility Options Voucher Pilot Program</strong> awarded vouchers for mobility projects worth $18 million to eligible under-resourced communities and $2 million set aside and awarded specifically to Native American tribal governments. The <a href="https://www.cleanmobilityoptions.org/mp-awardees/">funds will be used</a> to support projects that includes on-demand shuttles and microtransit, electric vehicle car sharing, bike and scooter-sharing, carpooling and vanpooling and ride-on-demand services.</p>
<p><strong>Electra Vehicles</strong>, which develops software to optimize EV battery system performance, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electra-vehicles-inc-closes-3-6-million-seed-funding-round-led-by-liftt-spa-and-blackberry-limited-301317931.html">raised $3.6 million</a> in seed funding. The round was led by BlackBerry Limited and the Italian investment group LIFTT S.p.A, with further participation from Club degli Investitori, Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, Hyperplane Venture Capital, Prithvi Ventures, Launchpad Venture Group and TiE Boston Angels.</p>
<p><strong>Holy Grail</strong>, a two-year-old startup based in Mountain View, California that is taking a micro approach to solving the outsized problem of capturing carbon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/holy-grail-raises-2-7m-seed-fund-to-create-modular-carbon-capture-devices/">raised $2.7 million in seed funding</a> from LowerCarbon Capital, Goat Capital, Stripe founder Patrick Collison, Charlie Songhurst, Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, Songkick co-founder Ian Hogarth, Starlight Ventures and 35 Ventures. Existing investors Deep Science Ventures, Y Combinator and Oliver Cameron, who co-founded Voyage, the autonomous vehicle acquired by Cruise, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>IoTecha</strong>, an electric vehicle charging company, has raised $13.2 million in a round led by BP Ventures. The venture firm invested $7 million into the fund. IoTecha connects EV chargers with the electricity grid through its software platform. Their product allows private and fleet vehicles from any manufacturer to communicate with charging stations to signal when they need recharging. It works by gathering information over time, identifying patterns and the energy requirements of each user across all forms of EV charging. IoTecha said that it will use the investment to scale its technology throughout BP&#8217;s electrification network.</p>
<p><strong>Lendbuzz</strong>, an auto finance platform, has raised $360 million in capital and debt. The $60 million in funding was led by Wellington Management joined by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and MUFG Innovation Partners. The $300 million in debt financing was led by Goldman Sachs Bank USA. The company, which sells its loan origination and servicing software to dealerships, said it will use the funds to continue its expansion in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola Corporation </strong>is <a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-invests-50-million-in-wabash-valley-resources-to-produce-clean-hydrogen-in-the-midwest-for-zero-emission-nikola-trucks-122">investing $50 million</a> in cash and stock in exchange for a 20% equity in a clean hydrogen project being developed by Wabash Valley Resources LLC. The project will use solid-waste and biomass to produce hydrogen for transportation fuel and electricity generation. Pablo Koziner, Nikola&#8217;s President of Energy and Commercial, said in a press release that the project should support future truck sales and the rollout of hydrogen stations throughout the Midwest.</p>
<p><strong>Sendle</strong>, a shipping carrier that uses carbon offsetting to run carbon neutral operations for small businesses, has raised a $35 million Series C. The round was led by AP Ventures, with participation from existing investors including Federation, Full Circle and NRMA. Sendle said it would use the funds to expand its operations in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> reached a deal to become the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/"> sole owner of Latin American delivery startup Cornershop</a>, one year after acquiring a majority stake in the company. Uber is acquiring the remaining 47% interest in Cornershop in exchange for 29 million shares. The transaction, which will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber, is expected to close in July.</p>

<p>Hi folks, welcome back to Policy Corner. We&#8217;ve got a short one this week but I promise the piece of news is a big one.</p>
<p><strong>President Joe Biden </strong>and a group of Senators have struck a deal on a massive infrastructure bill after months of debate. The $1.2 trillion agreement touches nearly all traditional forms of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and railways – but it also includes some funds for electric transportation.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this was one of the major sources of disagreement among lawmakers, so the funds for these initiatives is far, far less than what Biden originally proposed when he introduced the bill in March. He originally included new rebates for EV purchases, a proposal that’s been wiped from the new bill.</p>
<p>However, the bill does earmark $7.5 billion for electric buses and $7.5 billion to build out EV charging stations. While this is perhaps less than what advocates had been hoping for (and truthfully just a sliver of the original proposal), it’s still a big improvement from last year’s spending on such initiatives.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there is a lot of news. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Aurora</strong><strong>&#8216;s </strong>Board of Directors gained a new member: Sonos&#8217; chief financial officer Brittany Bagley. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/welcoming-sonos-cfo-brittany-bagley-to-auroras-board">in a blog post</a> that she brings &#8220;a keen understanding of how to ship industry-defining products and a strong sense of fiscal stewardship.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Plus </strong>has hired Lynn Miller as General Counsel. Miller was formerly the Deputy General Counsel at Tesla, where she led Tesla&#8217;s privacy program, handled government inquiries and investigations, and led its litigation strategy. Prior to working at Tesla, Miller was part of Apple&#8217;s litigation team. </span></p>
<p><strong>Pony.ai </strong>is considering going public, company CEO James Peng <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-toyota-backed-self-driving-startup-ponyai-considers-going-public-2021-06-25/">told Reuters</a> on Friday. The company also announced that Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase, would join as chief financial officer. The autonomous tech unicorn has operated robotaxis with human safety drivers in Irvine, California as well as China.</p>
<p><strong>Volvo&#8217;s </strong>flagship electric SUV, which will debut in 2022, will be outfitted with <strong>Luminar&#8217;s </strong>autonomous driving stack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/volvos-flagship-electric-suv-will-come-with-luminars-lidar-and-software-as-standard/">as standard</a>. When the two companies announced the partnership last year, the arrangement was that customers would have to pay extra for Luminar&#8217;s system. No longer! But customers will have to pay to access the Highway Pilot functionality, which takes drivers &#8216;out of the loop&#8217; on highway roads once conditions are verified as safe.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><strong>Electric Last Mile Solutions</strong>, a company that manufactures and sells electric vans and trucks to fleet customers, is heading to the Nasdaq on Monday. ELMS is merging with special purpose acquisition company Forum Merger III Corporation in a SPAC deal valued at $1.4 billion. The SPAC transaction, which was announced last December, will give ELMS $379 million in gross cash proceeds, including $155 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from private investors BNP Paribas Asset Management and Jennison Associates. The company will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ELMS.”</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic </strong>divested the entirety of its Tesla stock last fiscal year for around $3.61 billion, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-unloads-entire-Tesla-stake">Nikkei Asia reported</a>. Panasonic is Tesla&#8217;s electric-vehicle battery supplier for its Nevada Gigafactory, and the two companies have had a partnership going back over a decade. An executive for the Japanese company told Nikkei that that relationship &#8220;will not change going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span class="il">Toyota </span></strong>has entered into an intended partnership <strong><span class="il">VivoPower </span></strong><span class="il">to use</span> its electrical vehicle convertor kits in <span class="il">Toyota</span> LandCruisers. Through the deal, VivoPower will have exclusivity for the electrification of LandCruisers for five years. This is the first time Toyota has approved an external drive train supplier since Tesla in 2011. The conversion kits will be designed and manufactured by <span class="il">VivoPower</span> subsidiary <strong>Tembo e-LV B.V. </strong></p>
<h2>Ride-hailing</h2>
<p><strong>Revel&#8217;s </strong>plans to deploy a fleet of ride-hailing Teslas may have hit a major block after New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted against issuing new for-hire vehicle licenses to EVs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546955/nyc-tlc-electric-vehicle-license-taxi-vote-revel-tesla">The Verge&#8217;s Andrew Hawkins said</a> the vote was seen as a snub toward the startup. Revel was planning on launching a ride-hailing service using a fleet of Tesla Model Ys.</p>
<h2>Other bits</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Ryder System</strong>, a company that offers heavy-duty truck rentals to commercial fleet customers, was hacked last December. In <a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/blog/2021/06/08/ryder-system-inc-notice-of-data-breach-to-consumers/">a letter</a> posted to Vermont’s Attorney General website, the Miami-based company said it was notifying 3,563 individuals of the “unauthorized intrusion.” Customers’ driver’s license numbers, social security numbers (which I&#8217;m told by TechCrunch writer Zack Whittaker is highly unusual), and other identifying information was potentially involved in the data breach. </span></p>
<p><strong>Porsche </strong>is going into the battery business. The automaker announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/">a new joint venture</a> with <strong>Customcells</strong> to open a 100 megawatt-hours battery manufacturing plant in Germany. For reference, that&#8217;s enough batteries for around 1,000 vehicles. The batteries will be manufactured for Porsche&#8217;s line of racing and high-performance vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Drink making probably isn’t at the top of your list of jobs most likely to be fully automated. The past year-and-a-half have, however, brought into stark relief how large a role robotics could play in the food service industry. I’ve said it time and again on these pages, but the appeal is clear: Robots don’t get sick and they don’t spread diseases the way we human Petri dishes tend to.</p>
<p>There’s been no shortage of investments in the category, and today <a href="https://www.botrista.co/">Botrista</a> (robotic barista, get it?) joins the list with a $10 million Series A. The round was co-led by Purestone Capital and La Kaffa and featured the Sony Innovation Fund, Middleby Corporation and PIDC. It follows a $4 million seed round, bringing the startup’s funding to date to around $16 million.</p>
<p>The company’s premier product is the simply named Drinkbot (Botrista, it seems, is enough pun name to go around). The latest version of the robotic drink mixing system features a refrigerated base with up to eight ingredients, a touchscreen control panel and 14 separate nozzles for dispensing the mixed beverages. The entire process runs around 20 seconds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by former Tesla engineer Sean Hsu, the company will be using the funding to expand the robot’s footprint across the U.S. on the heels of some pandemic-related transformations to the food service industry.</p>
<p>“In 2020, fountain drink sales were down considerably as consumers rapidly switched their drink preferences and were less likely to order fountain drinks during take-out or delivery,” Hsu said in a press release tied to the round.</p>
<p>Miso Robotics, notably, announced their own plans to release a fountain drink-based robotic system last week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getthursday.com">Thursday</a>, a dating app that wants to solve problems created by, well, too much time spent using dating apps, had raised a £2.5 million (~$3.5M) seed investment &#8212; a few months after launching (in May) its single-matching service in London and New York (and racking up over 52k downloads).</p>
<p>Last Thursday (June 17) it says that 110,000 likes were sent, resulting in 7,500 matches in a single day. How many actual dates occurred isn&#8217;t something it&#8217;s able to report, though.</p>
<p>The seed is double their initial target, with financing coming from Ascension Ventures, Best Nights VC (previously M-Venture) the investment arm of Jägermeister, Connect Ventures, plus early backers of CityMapper, TypeForm and FIIT (processed via SeedLegals).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notable angels backing the dating platform include Tom Blomfield, founder of Monzo; Matt Robinson, founder of GoCardless and Nested; Ian Hogarth, founder of Songkick; Eldar Tuvey, founder of Wandera and Henry de Zoute, founder of LookAfterMyBills.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meme-based dating is here: Meet Schmooze&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/a-new-dating-app-schmooze-matches-people-based-on-their-affinity-for-memes/embed/#?secret=8RW5PHSV0k" data-secret="8RW5PHSV0k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So what&#8217;s Thursday&#8217;s twist in a highly competitive space? The clue is in the name: This dating app is only live for one day per week.</p>
<p>Specifically the app opens for usage at 00.01 each Thursday morning so swiping is compressed into a few hours. All matches and conversations vanish at midnight. Hence users are pushed to act quickly &#8212; and &#8220;be a bit spontaneous&#8221;, as it puts it &#8212; if they want to get a date that night.</p>
<p>Profiles are thus fairly basic. Users can upload five photos (either from social media apps like Facebook or their phone&#8217;s camera roll) &#8212; and share some &#8220;topline information&#8221; about themselves.</p>
<p>The app also prompts them to answer a few questions &#8212; to give a flavor of their personality. And there&#8217;s a &#8216;Stories&#8217; style feature to further show off who they are (again that content deletes after 24 hours).</p>
<p>Matches are based on what Thursday says is a &#8220;rough location&#8221; &#8212; so users being matched are able to figure out a convenient place to meet up. (The app specifies that users&#8217; exact location is never shared.)</p>
<p>Thursday users are encouraged to only log on in the morning if they are free that evening to go out on a date.</p>
<p>Matches are also limited to x10 people a day &#8212; to avoid users just trying to maximize their chances by swiping to match with every user they see.</p>
<p>By putting some hard (time) limits on usage, Thursday&#8217;s pitch is that service scarcity can fix some of the problematic issues of overuse which can plague dating apps &#8212; leading to dating indecision and swipe fatigue. And, well, just waste a lot of people&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>It also reckons that by giving users a limited &#8212; one day per week &#8212; chance to book a date it can put some of the excitement back into digital dating. Which can otherwise, at times, feel pretty transactional.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, co-founder George Rawlings said: “Just four weeks into launching and we&#8217;re delighted to have a number of notable investors on board who really believe in our vision and back this app. We&#8217;ve got big plans with a clear mission, to change a culture of how people date. This is just the start and we will deliver. Dating apps just got exciting again.”</p>
<p>Flush with 2x the amount of seed funding they had initially planned to raise, Thursday&#8217;s team intends to step on the gas &#8212; and, well, there&#8217;s no way to patent this kind of idea so they will need to move quickly to stay ahead of any fast-follows.</p>
<p>No surprise then that the plan for the seed funding includes hiring a head of growth and a head of marketing, in addition to other senior roles and a number of tech hires &#8212; and coming up with what they dub as a &#8220;six figure marketing strategy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Expanding the app to other cosmopolitan cities elsewhere is also on the roadmap. But for now Thursday is only available for singles in London and New York.</p>
<p>Dating apps are already a diverse bunch &#8212; catering to all sorts of priorities, communities and kinks, including by applying various creative twists in the name of helping users find a match (such as by limiting who can send the first message; or hiding selfies until a few messages have been exchanged to push beyond superficial swiping).</p>
<p>Time limits on usage is another interesting idea. Albeit, how this type of &#8216;demand manipulation&#8217; might affect the resulting dating power dynamics remains to be seen. And it seems noteworthy that the founders are both male.</p>
<p>“This is the first version of Thursday and it&#8217;s definitely not perfect so in the short term we are going to use this time to tighten up the app, introduce some new features and continue to develop our matching algorithm to make it the most efficient and intuitive matching system on the market,&#8221; added co-founder Matt McNeill Love in another statement. &#8220;We’re also going to be introducing a not been done before, revolutionary feature, which will really assist with matches resulting in dates.”</p>
<p>Given the accelerated usage timeframe and the vanishing messages Thursday clearly needs to pay careful attention to user security.</p>
<p>On this front it says all users are verified before they join &#8212; either by uploading their passport or driving license. It also says it takes abusive messages &#8220;extremely seriously&#8221; and does not tolerate hate speech, such as racism, body shaming or misogyny.</p>
<p>The pledge is that any such abusive users will be blocked and unable to return.</p>
<p>While the USP of the app is a &#8216;one day a week&#8217; limit there is, of course, an option to pay to get a little more access.</p>
<p>Thursday says there are &#8220;a limited number&#8221; of VIP memberships available.</p>
<p>Users who choose to shell out a monthly fee will get their profiles boosted all day (&#8220;x60 increased visibility&#8221;); be able to send unlimited likes; and be able to unlock Saturday usage&#8230; albeit on the bonus day they are presumably limited to the pool of other VIP users as non-paying users are locked out til Thursday.</p>
