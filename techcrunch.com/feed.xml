										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Own a Tesla Model S or Model X? It might have a recall, and it&#8217;s serious.</p>
<p>Tesla today issued one of its largest recalls to date, covering roughly 135,000 Model S and Model X. The touchscreen is the concern.</p>
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the touchscreen in these vehicles can fail when a memory chips runs out of storage capacity, which can cause a host of failures, including affecting turn signals and defrosters, and the rearview camera. This failure can also affect Tesla&#8217;s self-driving Autopilot functionality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INRM-EA20003-11321.pdf">NHTSA explained the department&#8217;s findings</a> to Tesla in a mid-January letter. According to NHTSA&#8217;s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI), the affected vehicle&#8217;s memory chips are to blame. The 8GB chip eventually wears out, and the only remedy is a replacement, the letter says.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-recalls-roughly-135-000-vehicles-over-touch-screen-failures-11612270332">According to the WSJ</a>, Tesla disagrees that the issue is a failure, though the automaker is recalling a select amount of vehicles to investigate the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is economically, if not technologically, infeasible to expect that such components can or should be designed to last the vehicle&#8217;s entire useful life,&#8221; Tesla said in the letter.</p>
<p>The vehicles covered by the recall include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 and Model X vehicles made between 2016 and 2018. The affected vehicles are equipped with NVIDIA Tegra 3 computing platforms and an 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005693/en/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly">today announced plans</a> to acquire alcohol delivery service Drizly. The approximately $1.1 billion deal includes stock and cash and is expected to close in the first half of the year. The plan will build Drizly’s marketplace directly into the Uber Eats app, though the company notes that it will maintain Drizly as a standalone app offering as well, for the time being.</p>
<p>Certainly there&#8217;s a marketplace fit here. Uber provides the underlying ride hailing and delivery technologies, while Drizly can help the company expand Uber Eats into an even more potentially lucrative service.</p>
<p>&#8220;[CEO Cory Rellas] and his amazing team have built Drizly into an incredible success story, profitably growing gross bookings more than 300 percent year-over-year,&#8221; Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a release. &#8220;By bringing Drizly into the Uber family, we can accelerate that trajectory by exposing Drizly to the Uber audience and expanding its geographic presence into our global footprint in the years ahead.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service has experienced a steady roll out in markets across the U.S. Though local liquor laws have offered something of a hurdle for expansion. Last month,<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/drizly-brings-on-demand-adult-beverage-delivery-to-atlanta-following-recent-statewide-legalization-of-alcohol-e-commerce-301200960.html#:~:text=All%20Products-,Drizly%20Brings%20On%2DDemand%20Adult%20Beverage%20Delivery%20To%20Atlanta%20Following,Legalization%20Of%20Alcohol%20E%2DCommerce&amp;text=BOSTON%2C%20Jan.%205%2C%202021,is%20now%20available%20in%20Atlanta."> it added Atlanta</a> to the list, teaming up with a dozen or so local markets and liquor stores to expand delivery. Like Uber Eats, Drizly teams with local merchants in the markets it services. The company says its services reach more than 1,400 cities in North America at last count. No doubt pandemic-related shutdowns have also gone a ways toward expanding the appeal of alcohol delivery.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Boston-based Drizly has raised just under $120 million to date, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/drizly">per Crunchbase</a>. That includes<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/11/online-liquor-store-drizly-just-landed-34-5-million-in-fresh-funding/"> a $34.5 million Series C</a> back in late-2018. More recently, the service was hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/drizly-data-breach/">with a data breach</a>. The breach, which was disclosed last July, was believed to have impacted up to 2.5 million accounts.</p>
<p>Uber says it expects around 90% of the payment to Drizly stockholders to be made in Uber stock, with the remainder coming via cash. The deal will be is pending standard regulatory approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite all the headaches that come with it, homeownership is still the American dream for many.</p>
<p>Divvy Homes &#8211; a startup that is out to help more people realize that dream by buying a house and renting it back to them while they build equity &#8211; has just closed on $110 million in Series C funding. Tiger Global Management led the round, which also saw participation from a slew of other investors including GGV Capital, Moore Specialty Credit, JAWS Ventures, and existing backers such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/divvy-an-interesting-new-fractional-home-ownership-startup-just-raised-a-series-a-round-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">a16z</a>. The latest financing brings Divvy’s total debt and equity raised since its 2017 inception to over $500 million with about one-third of that raised in equity and two-thirds in debt.</p>
<p>The startup last raised $43 million<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/fractional-home-ownership-startup-divvy-raises-43m-series-b-to-build-a-path-from-rent-to-purchase/"> in Series B funding</a> from the likes of Affirm CEO Max Levchin and homebuilder Lennar (via its venture arm), among others. In fact, Divvy – which was co-founded by Adena Hefets, Nick Clark and Alex Klarfeld.  – was incubated in Levchin&#8217;s startup studio HVF.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mortgage rates dropped to historic laws in 2020, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of making it easier to buy a home, many banks actually tightened underwriting requirements for approvals, said Divvy CEO Hefets. So while lenders were busier than ever, much of that volume was driven by people who already owned homes refinancing with the lower rates.</p>
<p>Like most companies, Divvy was initially unsure as to how the pandemic would impact its business. But as the year went on – and the whole world spent more time at home than ever, the company only saw increased demand.</p>
<p>“We actually paused home buying for March and April and just kind of stood still waiting to see what would happen to the world,” Hefets said. “And when it felt like the world became stable again, we said, ‘Okay, let’s get back out there.’ ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107024" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107024" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2107024" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg 1875w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adena_Hefets_7893-1.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107024" class="wp-caption-text">Divvy Homes CEO and co-founder Adena Hefets</p></div></p>
<p>Ultimately, over the course of 2020, Divvy expanded operations from 8 to 16 total markets and financed five times as many homes as it had in pre-pandemic times. It also worked with its existing customers by offering flexibility and rent relief in  the way of waived late fees and flexible payment scheduling, for example.</p>
<p>“Mortgages were harder to get yet we were seeing this mad rush of people who wanted to move out of multifamily and downtown areas,” Hefets recalls. “So while traditional financing dried up, we saw a really good tailwind for our business.”</p>
<p>Divvy declined to disclose the valuation at which this round was raised but Hefets said it was “very highly oversubscribed.”</p>
<h2>Rent to own</h2>
<p>So how does Divvy work?</p>
<p>Divvy claims to be different from other real estate tech companies in that it aims to digitize “the archaic, data-heavy processes buyers encounter along the way.” It works with renters who want to become homeowners by buying the home they want and renting it back to them for three years “while [they build] the savings needed to own it themselves.”</p>
<p>Rather than buy homes and look for renters, the company does the opposite. Customers pick out a home and Divvy purchases it on their behalf with the renter contributing an initial 1-2 percent of the home value. They move in at closing, and pay one monthly amount. Part of that money is a “market-rate” rent and about 25 percent goes toward building up their savings in the house so they can put a down payment (estimated at 10 percent value of the home) on to purchase from Divvy later. The renters can choose to cash out their equity or purchase the home before the three years are up, if they choose. They also have the option to re-up their contract if needed, to take a bit longer to save up for a larger down payment.</p>
<p>Divvy  started buying homes in the first half of 2018 and so far, the company is seeing nearly half of those renters buying back the homes.</p>
<p>“Even the most experienced players in the space, maybe have low single-digit buyback rates so it’s definitely quite a bit higher than what the rest of the industry is seeing,” Hefets told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>When it first started out, the prices of the homes it bought averaged around $140,000 to $150,000. Now the average home prices are more like just over $200,000, she said.</p>
<p>While Divvy’s mission involves wanting to make homeownership more accessible, Hefets points out that it’s a lucrative business model as well.</p>
<p>“The number of people who fall outside of the traditional mortgage box is growing,” she added, with more people struggling to be able to purchase a home.</p>
<h2>Investor POV</h2>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Alex Rampell led the first investment in Divvy. He recognizes that from the consumer perspective, it’s difficult to be able to save for a down payment “when you’re throwing away money on rent every month.”</p>
<p>“A huge number of people want to become homeowners but just can’t,” he said.</p>
<p>Rampel also appreciates that its model is not as speculative as the typical investor approach of first buying a home and then renting it out.</p>
<p>“So they’re not spending the first nine months after purchasing a home looking for a tenant,” he said. “They’re not speculating on an empty house and worrying what happens if they buy a home and can’t rent it out.”</p>
<p>For Tiger Global Partner Scott Shleifer, what Divvy has accomplished is “phenomenal.”</p>
<p>“Over the next ten years we believe they could help over one hundred thousand families become financially responsible homeowners,” he said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Divvy plans to use its fresh capital in part to expand to more markets with the lofty goal of serving more than 70 million Americans in over 20 markets by year’s end beyond cities such as Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Tampa. The 80-person company also plans to take its offering a step further by launching ancillary product offerings to take buyers throughout the home buying journey. It already helps customers through title &amp; escrow, inspections, negotiating and repairs. But ultimately, Divvy wants to “create a complete end-to-end experience” from providing realtors to serving as a lender, according to Hefets.</p>
<p>“That’s our bigger vision,” she said. “We’re not there yet.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the longest time, Acrobat was Adobe&#8217;s flagship desktop app for working with &#8212; and especially editing &#8212; PDFs. In recent years, the company launched Acrobat on the web, but it was never quite as fully featured as the desktop version, and one capability a lot of users were looking for, editing text and images in PDFs, remained a desktop-only feature. That&#8217;s changing. With its latest update to Acrobat on the web, Adobe is bringing exactly this ability to its online service.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Acrobat Web] is strategically important to us because we have more and more people working in the browser,&#8221; Todd Gerber, Adobe&#8217;s VP for Document Cloud, told me. &#8220;Their day begins by logging into whether it&#8217;s G Suite or Microsoft Office 365. And so we want to be in all the surfaces where people are doing their work.&#8221; The team first launched the ability to create and convert PDFs, but as Gerber noted, it took a while to get to the point where being able to edit PDFs in a performant and real-time way was possible. &#8220;We could have done it earlier, but it wouldn&#8217;t have been up to the standards of being fast, nimble and quality.&#8221; He specifically noted that working with fonts was one of the more difficult problems the team faced in bringing this capability online.</p>
<p>He also noted that even though we tend to think of PDF as an Adobe format, it is an open standard and lots of third-party tools can create PDFs. That large ecosystem, with the potential for variations between implementations, also makes it more difficult to offer editing capabilities for Adobe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJcaS3-ejb0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch, Adobe is also introducing a couple of additional browser-based features: protecting PDFs, splitting them into two and merging multiple PDFs. In addition, after working with Google last year to offer a handful of Acrobat shortcuts using the .new domain, Adobe is now launching a set of new shortcuts like <a href="http://EditPDF.new">EditPDF.new</a>. The company plans to roll out more of these over the course of the next year.</p>
<p>In total, Adobe says, the company saw about 10 million clicks on its existing shortcuts, which just goes to show how many people try to convert or sign PDFs every day.</p>
<p>As Gerber noted, a lot of potential users don&#8217;t necessarily think of Acrobat first. Instead, what they want to do is compress a PDF or convert it. Acrobat Web and the .new domains help the company bring a new audience to the platform, he believes. &#8220;It&#8217;s unlocking a new audience for us that didn&#8217;t initially think of Adobe. They think about PDFs, they think about what they need to do with them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s allowing us to expand our customer base by being relevant in the way that they&#8217;re looking to discover and ultimately transact. Our journey with Acrobat web actually started with that notion: let&#8217;s go after the non-branded searches.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adobe, of course, funnels to the Acrobat desktop app all branded searches where users are explicitly looking for Acrobat, but for the more casual user, it brings them to Acrobat Web where they can easily perform whatever action they came for without even signing up for the service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">5G has been on a tear the last few years as wireless operators and smartphone manufacturers have made a marketing push touting higher bandwidth and lower latency for users. Yet, for all the attention that 5G gets from consumers, some of the most important new applications for the next-generation wireless technology are actually on the enterprise side. The canonical example is self-driving cars, which will presumably rely on a combination of edge computing, low latency and high bandwidth in order to work.</p>
<p>Yet, there are far more applications that are perhaps even more interesting and more readily deployable today than AVs. On farms, connectivity can help with managing equipment, monitoring livestock, and analyzing water usage to optimize plant growth. Logistics companies need to monitor global supply chains, tracking shipping containers as they wend their way around the world from port to port.</p>
<p>There’s just one problem: 5G wireless is hard to implement in rural areas where base stations are unprofitable to deploy and therefore few and far between. On the oceans of course, there are no wireless base stations at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DC-based <a href="https://omnispace.com">Omnispace</a> wants to offer ubiquitous 5G-compliant connectivity for enterprise users using a hybrid of wireless ground technology and satellites. The idea is that by integrating these two different modes — terrestrial and space — into one cohesive package, end users like agriculture and logistics companies wouldn’t have to transition their IoT connectivity between different types of technologies in order to secure the promise of 5G.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $60 million equity investment led by Joshua Pack of Fortress Investment Group, who serves as the burgeoning firm’s head of credit investing and also <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fortress-investment-group-spac-fortress-value-files-for-a-%24300-million-ipo-2020-03-06">co-leads one of the firm’s SPACs</a>, Fortress Value Acquisition. Existing investors Columbia Capital, Greenspring Associates, TDF Ventures and Telcom Ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Omnispace started in 2012 as a holding company for wireless spectrum assets, particularly around the 2Ghz “S band” spectrum, which were purchased from the remnants of ICO Global, a satellite-based provider that had previously gone into bankruptcy. CEO Ram Viswanathan, who joined Omnispace in early 2016, said that the company started looking at how to use a technology layer to integrate its various assets together, eventually identifying an opportunity around global 5G connectivity with specific applications in IoT.</p>
<p>“The 5G rollout is going to be gated by the scope and rollout of mobile operators,” Viswanathan said. “Neither all of the landmass or customers are going to be covered” using traditional ground-based wireless technology. “Satellite’s main utility is really extending the reach of the network into more remote and rural areas.”</p>
<p>Viswanathan has spent decades in the satellite and wireless market, most recently as the co-founder of Devas Multimedia, an India-focused connectivity startup that has been embroiled in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nclt-admits-antrix-petition-to-wind-up-devas-multimedia-7156600/">a long-running legal spat with the government there over the cancelation of the firm’s satellite launch</a>, with U.S. courts recently ordering a government-affiliated commercialization business to <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-court-asks-isros-commerical-arm-to-pay-12-billion-compensation-to-bengaluru-start-up/article32979594.ece">pay Devas $1.2 billion in compensation</a>.</p>
<p>While there is perhaps an easy comparable with SpaceX’s <a href="https://www.starlink.com">Starlink</a> project, Omnispace is not focused on the consumer broadband market, but rather enterprise and IoT use cases. Furthermore, Omnispace is a hybrid network using a mix of different technologies, whereas Starlink is focused only on space deployment.</p>
<p>Omnispace is using its new capital from Fortress to flesh out its services and finish up pilot trials with some mobile operators and prepare the network for commercial usage starting in 2023, with the network ready in 2022. Viswanathan said that “our aim is to provide the service globally” with “a footprint that covers everywhere.”</p>
<p>Omnispace has contracted with Thales Alenia, part of the French space and defense conglomerate Thales Group, to execute on its space strategy. On the terrestrial side, it is tying together its spectrum assets and piloting with several mobile operators to bring out a cohesive solution, with early strength in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://folxhealth.com/">Folx Health</a> is leveraging the explosion of virtual care services to offer greater access to healthcare focused on the needs of the LGBTQIA+ community, and has raised $25 million in new funding to help it grow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of a revolution in care that&#8217;s targeting the needs of specific communities with access to physicians that understand those needs. And it&#8217;s all made possible by virtual interactions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have a good sense of the nature of the need and the depth of the pain in the community,&#8221; said A.G. Breitenstein, the founder and chief executive of Folx Health. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a non-binary lesbian and healthcare industry veteran, I have seen and experienced firsthand just how broken the current system is for the queer and trans community,” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Breitenstein said Folx would be using the cash to try and expand to all fifty states and increase the available products and services the healthcare company would look to make available to the queer and trans community.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it’s HRT, PrEP, sexual health or family creation, health care is essential for us to be who we are. It’s about time we build a platform for ourselves, so Queer and Trans people feel seen, heard, and celebrated,” she said in a statement. </span></p>
<p>That was one reason why Bessemer Venture Partners leapt at the chance to lead the new financing round for Folx, according to Morgan Cheatham, an investor out of Bessemer&#8217;s New York office. The other was the size of the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a high level, 2% of the population identify as transgender,&#8221; said Cheatham. &#8220;At that math, when we looked at that, we were able to see a multibillion dollar market opportunity not just to provide [hormone replacement therapy], but to provide a healthcare destination for this community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Telescoping out to the opportunity to provide care to the LGBTQ community broadly, when that population represents about 10% to 20% of the population is a &#8220;deca-billion opportunity,&#8221; said Cheatham.</p>
<p>Breitenstein envisions offering family planning services, broad primary care, and sexual health and wellness care in addition to the hormone therapies that the company currently offers.</p>
<p>Folx joins a cohort of companies tackling health issues specifically for the LGBTQIA+ community which include the mental healthcare service, <a href="https://www.joinviolet.com/">Violet</a>; <a href="https://www.includedhealth.com/">Included Health</a>, an employee benefit service; and<a href="https://getplume.co/"> Plume</a>, which focuses on care for the transgender community.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We believed in the vision and the approach that she’s taking. She&#8217;s building a healthcare experience that is celebratory and dignified rather than one that pathologizing healthcare,&#8221; said Cheatham. </span></p>
<p>For Bessemer and Cheatham, the investment speaks to broader opportunities to identify specific populations that need care tailored to their specific experience. That includes companies like <a href="https://www.sporahealth.com/">Spora Health</a> and <a href="https://www.livechair.co/">Live Chair Health</a>, which focus on providing healthcare specifically to people of color.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our individual identities whether it be socioeconomic status, race, gender… All of these things inform how we interface with the medical industrial complex,&#8221; Cheatham said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define Ventures and Polaris Venture Partners will also participate in the round, which follows quickly on the heels of Folx&#8217;s launch from stealth in December 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its patients, Folx Health is offering Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT: testosterone or estrogen) with monthly plans starting at $59 a month. Folx Health will also begin releasing its sexual health and wellness offerings starting with Erectile Dysfunction (ED) treatment, soon to be followed by at-home STI Testing and Treatment, all customized for the specifics of Queer and Trans bodies, the company said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he services will include unlimited on-demand clinical support with at-home lab testing (for most plans) and home-delivered medications (costs may vary based on medication). The company&#8217;s services are now available in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.</span></p>
<p>The company is also launching a Folx Library, which will serve as a content hub and resource for Queer and Trans health, written by Folx clinicians and its broader community.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our partnership with Folx is a historical moment. It’s challenging to articulate how transformative Folx is for our community. We do so mindful of the brilliant and brave Queer and Trans people who fought for this moment to happen,” said Cheatham in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a government review, the U.K.&#8217;s financial services regulator will instructed to regulate the buy now, pay later industry made popular by companies such as Klarna, and AfterPay (known as Clearpay in the U.K.).</p>
<p>A further consultation with the industry is underway and then, when parliamentary time allows, new laws regulating buy now, pay later will be passed.</p>
<p>This will see the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) asked to bring in stricter controls for interest-free buy now, pay later agreements, including firms being asked to undertake more comprehensive affordability checks before lending, and ensuring customers are treated fairly, &#8220;particularly those who are vulnerable or struggling with repayments&#8221;. Until now, because the industry has been unregulated since it falls outside of other interest-bearing credit products, such as credit cards, consumers have been left with little formal recourse when things go wrong.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Many consumers do not view interest-free buy-now-pay-later as a form of credit, so do not apply the same level of scrutiny, and checks undertaken by providers tend to focus on the risk for the firm rather than how affordable it is for the customer,&#8221; says the U.K. Treasury.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/woolard-review-unsecured-credit">review</a>, undertaken by the FCA’s Christopher Woolar, also rightfully highlights the issue of credit checks and the lack of visibility between lenders. &#8220;Although the average transaction tends to be relatively low, shoppers can take out multiple agreements with different providers – and the Review finds it would be relatively easy to accrue around £1,000 of debt that credit reference agencies and mainstream lenders cannot see,&#8221; notes the Treasury.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6j111ZuaqV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Making sense of Klarna</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=6j111ZuaqV" data-secret="6j111ZuaqV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The review also estimates that buy now, pay later in the U.K. is worth £2.7 billion ($3.7 billion), with 5 million people USING buy now, pay later since the pandemic-induced boom in online shopping, with many already in arrears from other forms of credit.</p>
<p>Up until now, interest-free buy now, pay later offered by retailers has fallen outside of U.K. regulation designed to protect consumers from credit-based financial products, something Alice Tapper, a financial campaigner in the U.K. who last June started the #regulateBuyNowPayLater campaign, previously told me is &#8220;a classic case of regulation not keeping up with tech giants&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The consumer credit act, written back in the 1970s was not drafted with algorithms and split-second lending decisions in mind,&#8221; she explained. “What this means in practice is zero consumer protection. Consumers are given no information about risk at the point of purchase or in ads. No mention of debt collection or responsible spending. This is particularly concerning for young and vulnerable consumers, who may have no prior experience of using credit products.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Klarna, for example, has always maintained it isn&#8217;t against further regulation per se. The devil, of course, will be in the detail, which is still being worked out. “I think good regulation that’s written in a meaningful way could make sense,” Klarna CEO and co-founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">told me late last year</a>. “We’re not against it at any point, as long as it makes sense, as long as it’s equal for all players in the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.holded.com/">Holded</a>, a platform billing itself as an ERP aimed at small businesses, has raised a €15M Series B funding round led by VC firm Elaia, together with Lakestar, Nauta Capital and Seedrocket.</p>
<p>Holded says it gives small business access to ERP-style planning across invoicing, accounting, sales, project management, inventory management and HR, in one dashboard. It’s attracted 80,000 customers to date. The money will be used to grow its technology and business teams. Its product is also used by accounting firms to digitalize their businesses and become value-added resellers. It will now open an office in Paris.</p>
<p>In a statement co-founder, Javi Fondevil said: “We knew the idea of centralizing all your business in one place was very powerful and the only reason why nobody did it before was that it’s extremely hard to design an intuitive self-serve ERP for Small Businesses.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pauline Roux, Partner at Elaia, said: “We strongly believe that the opportunity ahead to build solutions for small businesses is massive. In the case of ERPs, solutions tend to be very complex modular products and, as Small Businesses don’t have independent departments, they need an integrated and very intuitive solution. Most of the new ERPs are just doing the same as the incumbents but in the cloud. Holded developed the first ERP we have seen without modules, long implementation times or consultants needed, they’ve really changed the whole experience.” </p>
<p>The ERP startup space is hotting-up. In January Xentral, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for the average online small business, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/germanys-xentral-nabs-20m-led-by-sequoia-to-help-online-facing-smbs-run-back-offices-better/">picked up</a> a Series A of $20 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s something difficult to reconcile watching Spot walk up a flight of stairs in some industrial setting. After years of watching viral videos of Boston Dynamics robots perform aesthetically impressive feats, there’s a banality in the quadruped performing those dull, dirty and dangerous tasks that roboticist love to talk about.</p>
<p>But six and half months after the company opened Spot up for sale (and more than 400 sold, per BD), companies have been deploying the advanced piece of machinery in some downright dreary settings. Yesterday morning, I had the opportunity to pilot the robot around one of them, from the comfort of my own desk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="x3FzdWtCJW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/following-hyundai-acquisition-boston-dynamics-ceo-discussing-the-robotics-pioneers-future/">Following Hyundai acquisition, Boston Dynamics’ CEO discusses the robotics pioneer’s future</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This week the Hyundai-owned robotics pioneer is introducing Scout, a browser-based interface for remotely controlling the robot. The arrival will also be joined by a self-charging “Enterprise” edition of the robot and the already announced Spot Arm. All of the new hardware is available starting today through Boston Dynamics’ site (it’s one of those “call for a quote” pricing deals), though Scout will also be compatible with any version of the robot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106972" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106972" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enterprise_Industrial_Inspection_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106972" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>That said, the company is recommending it be paired with the self-docking Enterprise version. After all, the robot runs about 90 minutes on a charge, so if you’re intending to use it to monitor a situation without people present, that’s probably the way to go.</p>
<p>I’ve driven Spot around a few times in person &#8212; and like those, there’s a bit of a learning curve here. Boston Dynamics estimates it will take around 15 minutes to get you fully up to speed, but after a minute or two, I was able to send the robot up and down a flight of stairs at BD HQ. There are, thankfully, a whole bunch of cameras and other sensors built into the $75,000 robot to help you avoid doing something really stupid.</p>

<p>The system will work with Bluetooth gaming controllers, but for my demo, I was stuck with the keyboard. There’s a basic WASD control scheme that should be familiar if you’ve done any PC gaming. The arrow keys, meanwhile, can be used to switch between four cameras, giving you a view from all sides. There are a number of additional views, including a terrain mode that gives you a kind of top-down rendered view of the robot. That’s probably the best way to view all of the immediate obstacles &#8212; or better still, you can do a picture in picture to get views at once.</p>
<p>I found myself using “click to go” a lot, as well. It essentially works the way it sounds: You click on a point on the ground and Spot walks toward it. The feature is designed primarily for those with connection issues &#8212; imagine, say, you’ve got poor Spot deployed on some oil rig somewhere.</p>
<p>“[W]e have a power plant customer who had a possible equipment failure. They were able to use the robot to repeatedly inspect something that, if it failed could have been dangerous to a human inspector,” Spot’s Chief Engineer Zack Jackowski told TechCrunch. “So they logged in, checked on this pipe repeatedly and were able to avoid an expensive shut down.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106974" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106974" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106974 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Arm_Industrial_Gripper_Cam_Credit-to-Boston-Dynamics.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106974" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>There’s also a “stair mode” that positions the robot for walking up and down stairs. The feature needs to be manually toggled on and off, though the robot should be able to walk up a flight of stairs in normal mode (I did this in my demo, and didn’t appear to give anyone on staff a heart attack). For the time being, the functionality is limited to line of sight. Jackowski adds, “We have all sorts of crazy plans to extend that to building scale, but the first thing we want to get out there is line of vision.”</p>
<p>In addition to a new docking connector on the Robot’s bum, the Enterprise version will also sport an enhanced CPU and improved wireless connectivity. It will ship either as a bundle with the dock or solo.</p>
<p>Sadly, we weren’t able to take the new arm out for a spin, but Jackowski did offer some detail on that functionality, noting, “you issue the arm commands, like ‘move your hand here’ or ‘pick up this object’ or ‘turn this valve,’ and the robot’s actually smart enough to figure out, ‘hey, if I’m going to turn that valve, I need to stand over here, I need to shift my weight like this, I need to figure out how to keep the right part of my wrist limp to accommodate how that valve moves.’ ”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch company Astra, which just reached space this past December with a test launch from Alaska, will be going public on the NASDAQ via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Holicity. The recent SPAC craze has already extended to the New Space sector, and Virgin Galactic was among the in this wave of a new path to public listing, so there is precedent for space launch in particular, but Astra will be the first to list on the NASDAQ.</p>
<p>The terms of the deal will result in an anticipated $500 million in cash for Astra, from a combined $300 million held by Holicity in trust and a $300 million injection via a PIPE (private investment in public equity) from funds under management by BlackRock. The arrangement sets a pro forma enterprise valuation of Astra at around $2.1 billion – that valuation of the company minus the $500 million in cash the SPAC merger brings in. Astra expects it to complete by the second quarter of this year, after which the company will trade under the ticker &#8216;ASTR.&#8217;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launch startup Astra&#8217;s rocket reaches space&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/launch-startup-astras-rocket-reaches-space-for-the-first-time/embed/#?secret=nQdIa6koOS" data-secret="nQdIa6koOS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Astra manufactures its own rockets, which are designed to carry small orbital payloads, at a facility in Alameda, California. Thus far, it has then shipped its launch vehicles to Kodiak, Alaska for flight – requiring just a handful of people on the ground at the actual spaceport to mount and launch the rocket, with the majority of the team overseeing the flight operating remotely out of a mission control facility back in California. The company&#8217;s model focuses on high output production of relatively inexpensive rockets, which can be responsively shipped and launched virtually anywhere depending on needs.</p>
<p>With its successful test in December, Astra achieved a pay-off of years of quiet work building and iterating its launch model. The startup was originally pursuing a DARPA-funded competition to achieve rapid response launch capabilities, but that contest expired with the prize unclaimed. The successful test in December still proved out the viability of Astra&#8217;s model – though it fell slightly short of achieving orbital velocity for actual payload delivery. The company said that this was a relatively easy remaining issue to fix, wholly manageable via software tweaks, and it intends to deliver its first commercial satellites beginning this summer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Astra aims to be launching payloads on a daily cadency by 2025, and in a blog post accompanying the SPAC news, Astra founder and CEO Chris Kemp said that it&#8217;s also intent on &#8220;building a platform of space services&#8221; that implies ambitions beyond its work today on rockets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, <a href="http://mee.gov.cn/xxgk2018/xxgk/xxgk02/202101/t20210105_816131.html">China flipped the switch on a nationwide carbon trading market</a>, in what could be one of the most significant steps taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 &#8212; if the markets can work effectively.</p>
<p>China is the <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/each-countrys-share-co2-emissions">world&#8217;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases</a> and its share of the world&#8217;s emissions output continues to climb.</p>
<p>As the Chinese government works to curb its environmental impact, policies like a carbon trading system could spur the adoption of new technologies, increasing demand for goods and services from domestic startups and tech companies around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Carbon markets, implemented in some parts of the U.S. and widely across Europe, put a price on industrial emissions and force companies to offset those emissions by investing in projects that would remove an equivalent portion of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re <a href="https://time.com/5748374/carbon-markets-paris-agreement/">a key component of the 2015 Paris Agreement, but they&#8217;re also a controversial one</a>. That&#8217;s because if they&#8217;re not implemented properly and managed effectively they can be a “massive loophole” for emitters, as Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at Carbon Markets Watch, told <em>Time</em> last year.</p>
<p>This is especially true of China. <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3010679/chinas-green-efforts-hit-fake-data-and-corruption-among-grass">Corruption in China is endemic</a> and the country has <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/27/chinese-communist-party-environment-co2/">long sacrificed environmental policy and stewardship at the altar of economic growth</a>. China&#8217;s not alone in making that calculus, but the decisions have happened at a scale orders of magnitude larger than almost any other nation (with the exception of the U.S.)</p>
<p>The efficacy of the policy is also effected by the hierarchies that exist within the bureaucracy of the Chinese Communist Party. As <a href="https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/chinas-national-carbon-market-is-about-to-launch/">ChinaDialogue noted</a>, the measures were issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, which carry lower legal authority than if they came from the NDRC, the leading governing body for macroeconomic policy across China and the overseer of the nation&#8217;s major economic initiatives.</p>
<p>That said, no country as large as China, which accounts for 28% of the world&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, has ever implemented a national carbon emissions trading market.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1622990" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1622990" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1622990" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gettyimages-934775218.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1622990" class="wp-caption-text">BEIJING, CHINA &#8211; MARCH 20: Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech during the closing session of the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People on March 20, 2018 in Beijing, China.

<p>China first started testing regional emissions trading systems back in 2011 in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangdong, Tianjin, Hubei, Chongqing and Fujian. Using a system that instituted caps on emissions based on carbon intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) rather than an absolute emissions cap, the Chinese government began rolling out these pilots across its power sector and to other industries.</p>
<p>After a restructuring in 2018, the plan, which was initially drafted under the auspices of the National Development and Reform Commission was kicked down to the Ministry of Ecology and the Environment. The devolution of China&#8217;s cap and trade emissions program came as the United States was withdrawing from the Paris Agreement amid an abdication of climate regulation or initiatives under the Presidency of Donald Trump.</p>
<div class="wp-block-cd-story-image block--story-image">
<div class="block--story-image__column">
<div class="block--story-image__content">
<div class="block--story-image__caption">Initially intended to begin with trading simulations in 2020, China&#8217;s emissions schemes were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic and pushed back to the back half of the year with an implementation of actual trading starting yesterday.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For now, the emissions trading system covers China&#8217;s power industry and roughly 2,000 energy generation facilities. That alone represents 30% of the nation&#8217;s total emissions and over time the trading system will encompass heavy industry like cement, steel, aluminum, chemicals and oil and gas, <a href="https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/chinas-national-carbon-market-is-about-to-launch/">according to ChinaDialogue</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the government is allocating emissions allowances for free and will begin auctioning allowances &#8220;at the appropriate time according to the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That kind of language, and concerns raised by state-owned enterprises and financial services firms flagging the effect carbon pricing could have on profitability and lending risk shows that the government in Beijing is still putting more weight on the economic benefits rather than environmental costs of much of its industrial growth.</p>
<p>That said, a survey of market participants cited by ChinaDialogue indicated that prices are expected to start at 41 yuan (US$6.3) per ton of CO2 and rise to 66 yuan per ton in 2025. The price of carbon in China is expected to hit 77 yuan by 2030.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a commission on carbon prices formed in 2017 and helmed by the economists Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern indicated that carbon needed to be priced at somewhere between $40 and $80 by 2020 and somewhere in the $50 to $100 range by 2030 if the markets and prices were to have any impact on behavior.</p>
<p>No nation has actually hit those price targets, although the European Union has come the closest &#8212; and seen the most reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a result.</p>
<p>Still, the plan from the Chinese government does include public reporting requirements for verified company-level emissions. And the existence of a market, if the government decides to put real prices in place and consequences for flouting the system, could be a huge boon for the monitoring and management equipment startups that are developing tech to track emissions.</p>
<p>As the analysts at ChinaDialogue note:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The hardest part of carbon pricing is often getting it started. The moment that the Chinese government decides to increase ambition with the national ETS, it can. The mechanism is now in place, and it can be ramped up if the momentum and political will provided by President Xi’s climate ambition continues. In the coming years, this could see an absolute and decreasing cap, more sectors covered, more transparent data provision and more effective cross-government coordination. This is especially so with energy and industrial regulators who will need to see the ETS not as a threat to their turf, but as a measure with significant co-benefits for their own policy objectives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The growth of remote working and managing workforces that are distributed well beyond the confines of a centralized physical office &#8212; or even a single country &#8212; have put a spotlight on the human resources technology that organizations use to help manage those people. Today, one of the HR startups that&#8217;s been seeing a surge of growth is announcing a round of funding to double down on its business.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.oysterhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oyster</a>, a startup and platform that helps companies through the process of hiring, onboarding and then providing contractors and full-time employees in the area  of &#8220;knowledge work&#8221; with HR services like payroll, benefits and salary management, has closed a Series A round of $20 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is already working in 100 countries, and CEO and Tony Jamous (who co-founded the company with Jack Mardack) said in an interview that the plan is to expand that list of markets, and also bring in new services, particularly to address the opportunity in emerging markets to hire more people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Oyster does not cover candidate sourcing or any of the interviewing and evaluation process: those could be areas where it might build its own tech or partner to provide them as part of its one-stop shop. It has dabbled in virtual job fairs, as a pointer to one potential product that it might explore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;There 1.5 billion knowledge workers coming into the workforce in next 10 years, mostly from emerging economies, while in developed economies there are some 90 million jobs unfilled,&#8221; Jamous said. &#8220;There are super powers you can gain from being globally distributed, but it poses a major challenge around HR and payroll.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Emergence Capital, the B2B VC that has backed the likes of Zoom, Salesforce, Bill.com and our former sister site Crunchbase, is leading the funding. The Slack Fund (Slack&#8217;s strategic investment vehicle), and London firm Connect Ventures (which has previously backed the company at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/connect-ventures-three/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seed stage</a>) are also participating.  The investment will accelerate <span class="il">Oyster</span>’s rapid growth, and support its mission of enabling people to work from anywhere.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed. The startup has raised about $24 million to date.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One of the great ironies of the global health pandemic is that while our worlds have become much smaller &#8212; travel and even local activities have been drastically curtailed and many of us spend day in, day out at home &#8212; the employment opportunity and scope of how organizations are expected to operate has become significantly bigger. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Public health-enforced remote working has led to companies de-coupling workers from offices, and that has opened the door to seeking out and working with the best talent, regardless of location.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This predicament may have become more acute in the last year, but it&#8217;s been one that has been gradually coming into focus for years, helped by trends in cloud computing and globalization. Jamous said that the idea for Oyster came to him was something that he&#8217;s been thinking about for years, but became more apparent when he was still at his previous startup, Nexmo &#8212; the cloud communications provider that was <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/vonage-holdings-corp-to-acquire-nexmo-inc-second-largest-cpaas-company-globally-578242471.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired by Vonage for $230 million</a> in in 2016. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">At Nexmo we wanted to be a great local employer. We were headquartered in two countries but wanted to have people everywhere,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We spent millions building employment infrastructure to do that, becoming knowledgable about local laws in France, Korea and more countries.&#8221; He realized quickly that this was a highly inefficient way to work. &#8220;We weren’t ready for the complexity and diversity of issues that would come up.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After he moved on from Nexmo and did some angel investing (he backs other distributed work juggernauts like Hopin, among others), he decided that he would try to tackle the workforce challenge as the focus of his next venture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That was in mid-2019, pre-pandemic. It turned out that the timing was spot on, with every organization looking in the next year at ways to address their own distributed workforce challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The emerging market focus, meanwhile, also has a direct link to Jamous himself: he left his home country of Lebanon to study in France when he was 17, and has essentially lived abroad since then. But as with many people who move into developed from emerging markets, he knew that the base of technical talent in his home country was something that was worth tapping and nurturing to help residents and the countries themselves improve their lots in life; and he thought he could use tech to help there, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">Related to that wider social mission, Oyster</span> has a pending application to become a B-Corporation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jamous is not the only one that has founded an HR company based on his personal experience: Turing&#8217;s founders have cited their own backgrounds growing up in India and working with people remotely from there as part of their own impetus for building Turing; and Remote&#8217;s founder hails from Europe but built Gitlab (where he had been head of product) based on a similar premise of tapping into the talent he knew existed all around the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And indeed, Oyster is not alone in tackling this opportunity. The list of HR startups looking to be the ADP&#8217;s of the world of distributed work include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deel</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hibob-raises-70m-on-a-500m-valuation-for-its-new-take-on-hr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hibob</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/papaya-global-raises-40m-for-a-payroll-and-hr-platform-aimed-at-global-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papaya Global</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/factorial-raises-16m-to-take-on-the-hr-world-with-a-platform-for-smbs/">Factorial</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/lattice-a-people-management-platform-picks-up-45m-at-a-400m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/rippling-nabs-145m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-build-out-its-all-in-one-platform-for-employee-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rippling</a>. And these are just some of the HR startups that have raised money in the last year; there are many, many more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The attraction of Oyster seems to come in the simplicity of how the services are provided &#8212; you have options for contractors, and full-timers, and full, larger staff deployments in other countries. You have options to add on benefits for employees if you choose. And you have some tools to work out how hires fit into your bigger budgets, and also to guide you on remuneration in each local market. Pricing starts at $29 per person, per month for contractors, to $399 for working with full employees, to other packages for larger deployments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster works with local partners to provide some aspects of these services, but it has built the technology to make the process seamless for the customer. As with other services, it essentially handles the employment and payroll as a local provider on behalf of its customers, but can do so under contract terms that reconcile both a company&#8217;s own policies and those of the local jurisdictions (which can differ widely between each other in areas like vacation time, redundancy terms, maternity leave and more).</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;It has a few well funded competitors, but that’s usually a good signal,&#8221; said Jason Green, the Emergence partner who led on its investment. &#8220;But you want to bet on the horse that will lead the race, and that comes down to execution. Here, we are b<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">etting on a team that’s done it before, an entrepreneur experienced in building a company and selling it. Tony&#8217;s made money and knows how to build a business. But more than that, he&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">mission driven and that will matter in the space, and to employees.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you were itching to launch an email newsletter via Twitter, following its acquisition of the Dutch newsletter platform Revue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">last month</a>, it appears you&#8217;ll have to wait a little bit longer for the official unveiling &#8212; although some Twitter users are reporting being able to sign up for the newsletter publishing tool right now.</p>
<p>The social media company confirmed to TechCrunch it&#8217;s reverted Revue&#8217;s Publisher offer back to private beta for the moment &#8212; saying this means it&#8217;s only accessible to existing customers at this time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it also appears to have quietly flipped the launch switch over the last 12 hours or so &#8212; at least for some users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier today, a number of TechCrunch staffers were able to go through the process of setting up a Twitter Revue newsletter &#8212; including our very own Editor-in-Chief, Matthew Panzarino.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">setting up my twtrevue <a href="https://t.co/VTAZPFSCTY">pic.twitter.com/VTAZPFSCTY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1356367183425667072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time of writing India-based reporter, Manish Singh, also has access to the interface &#8212; which prompts Twitter users to set up a free newsletter to reach their audience, flagging features such as the ability to embed tweets, import email lists, analyze engagement and earn money from subscribers.</p>
<p>So it looks as if Twitter has been testing a newsletter launch in a number of markets. It&#8217;s less clear whether/if it aborted a planned launch. We&#8217;ve asked the company for more details and will update this post with any response.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HiwNWoHQEn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/embed/#?secret=HiwNWoHQEn" data-secret="HiwNWoHQEn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been on a very long digital detox you&#8217;ll have noticed that newsletters have been having quite the moment of late. The rise of platforms that help writers monetize their content via an email-delivery format presents a clear risk/opportunity to Twitter, a company that relies on an army of users freely and publicly contributing short-form content.</p>
<p>But with Twitter launching its own in-house newsletter, tweets can potentially inflate in value &#8212; becoming the top of the funnel for Twitter users to build a community of followers who they made be able to convert to paying subscribers for longer form content, delivered in a newsletter format.</p>
<p>Twitter told us today that it has put new sign-ups to Revue on ice so it can focus on improving the offering in order to effectively meet the demand of new customers &#8212; and make Revue an even more powerful tool for publishers.</p>
<p>It added that it&#8217;s <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">working quickly to roll out a new version that&#8217;s open to new customers, with a spokeswoman pointing to a mailing list for interested parties to sign up to get the latest updates <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/publisher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.getrevue.co/publisher&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612345241390000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFaQtBNNX_JiUCkksom8APbhnhz7w">here</a>.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iXxeztrShb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">Twitter is already working on integrating newsletters on its site, following Revue acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is already working on integrating newsletters on its site, following Revue acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/embed/#?secret=iXxeztrShb" data-secret="iXxeztrShb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly why Twitter might have aborted a launch &#8212; or whether it was just quietly testing sign-ups in select markets, which at least three of our writers happened to be able to access. As we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">last month</a>, it had already been working to integrate the newsletter into its platform and is clearly moving at a clip to get Revue plugged in so it can start to capitalize on the hype and momentum around paid newsletters.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, preventing users from finding a home for their longer form thoughts elsewhere is also likely front of mind for Twitter &#8212; as competition for attention in the social sphere heats up, such as from the likes of (rival) newsletter platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/substack-series-a/">Substack</a> (which has been building momentum since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/substack-sinocism-launch/">2017</a>); and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">buzzy live-voice chat app Clubhouse</a> (which has recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">captivated the clique-loving technorati</a>).</p>
<p>But it seems Twitter feels its Revue newsletters aren&#8217;t quite ready for the prime time just yet.</p>
<p>For those eager to know more about how &#8216;Twitter + Revue&#8217; will work in practice, here&#8217;s the lowdown from our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc">@refsrc</a> &#8212; who does have early access.</p>
<p>The newsletter feature, available from the three-dot “More” menu option on Twitter’s web interface, enables a user to sign up for Revue with a few clicks using their social account. Once onboard, users can begin drafting their newsletter and drag their recent tweets to it &#8212; if they so choose.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107127" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107127" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2107127 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="934" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revue-twitter-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107127" class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The newsletter platform, which competes with among others <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/substack-series-a/">Andreessen Horowitz-backed Substack</a>, maintains integration support for a number of third-party services including Facebook, Instagram, Pocket, Product Hunt, Instapaper, and even RSS feeds. Once users have integrated these services, they can drag and drop stories from those feeds to the newsletter.</p>
<p>In the current avatar, users can manually add email addresses of subscribers, or import a list from Mailchimp or a CSV file. On the welcome screen, which noted reverse engineer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">Jane Manchun Wong first spotted last week</a>, Twitter also advertises that its newsletter can help writers and publishers earn money from paid subscribers.</p>
<p>Like before, Revue lets users schedule their newsletters. All in all, there doesn’t appear to be any additional features in this entire workflow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.seyna.eu">Seyna</a> is getting a new CEO. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-leguillon-67001937/">Stephen Leguillon</a> is joining the company as chief executive while Philippe Mangematin is stepping back from day-to-day activities for personal reasons — he’ll become honorary chairman.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the company, Seyna is an insurtech startup that has obtained an insurance license focused on property and casualty. This is a significant move as the French regulator (ACPR) hasn’t handed out a new license in this category since 1983.</p>
<p>The company’s go-to-market strategy is also interesting as it doesn’t sell insurance products to consumers directly. Instead, the company is building out insurance-as-a-service products. It partners with other companies that offer Seyna’s insurance products under their own brands.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, Seyna offers an API to generate insurance contracts on demand —&nbsp;an API is a programming interface that lets two services interact with each other. You can also connect directly to Seyna’s interface to manage contracts.</p>
<p>Seyna has created its own core insurance system, which is an important differentiating factor compared to legacy players. The startup can generate many different variants that cover around 20 different insurance products — pet insurance, ticket cancelation, rent guarantee, etc. Clients include Garantme and Decathlon.</p>
<p>The company’s new CEO Stephen Leguillon previous co-founded La Belle Assiette, a company that lets you hire a chef for a dinner at home and that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/la-belle-assiette/">I covered</a> on TechCrunch. He added a second product called GoCater, a corporate catering service — GoCater was letter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/gocater-spins-out-from-la-belle-assiette-to-build-a-corporate-catering-marketplace/">spun out</a> from La Belle Assiette and acquired by ezCater.</p>
<p>Seyna has raised a €14 million seed round ($17 million at today’s rate) from Global Founders Capital, Allianz France, Financière Saint James and several business angels. Insurance companies require a ton of capital to operate, that’s why the seed round seems quite big for the French market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/whoisprakhar">Prakhar Singh</a> and ex-Paystack employee </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijbkid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abdul Hassan</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have known each other for seven years, building different tech products individually and collectively along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining </span><a href="https://paystack.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, Hassan co-founded OyaPay, a payments startup the year before. After leaving the Stripe-owned company in 2019, he launched a data startup called Voyance where Singh, who had already exited one of his products &#8212; </span><a href="https://transferpay.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transferpay.ng</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an offline payments startup &#8212; was a software engineer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, the duo started working on </span><a href="https://mono.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a project that would allow companies to access their customers&#8217; financial accounts in Nigeria.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By streamlining various data in a single API, companies and third-party developers can retrieve vital information like account statements, real-time balance, historical transactions, income, expense and account owner identification. Of course, this isn&#8217;t without users&#8217; consent as they are required to login with their internet or mobile login credentials before any transaction takes place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a series of tests and iterations, Mono launched its beta version in August, with Hassan as CEO and Singh as CTO. A month later, the startup closed a $500,000 pre-seed investment from early-stage investors like</span><a href="https://ventureburn.com/2019/07/lateral-capital-review-deals/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/02/05/how-ventures-platform-fund-works/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.gpalminvestments.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden Palm Investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://rallycapventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rally Cap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was one of the notable pre-seed rounds on the continent because of the length of time it took from launch to funding, a trait other API fintech startups in the region share, albeit with significantly longer timelines.  </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How fintech and serial founders drove African pre-seed investing to new heights in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020/embed/#?secret=PBlSuzh8AE" data-secret="PBlSuzh8AE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a region where more than half of the population is </span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG"><span style="font-weight: 400;">either unbanked or underbanked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these open finance players are trying to improve financial inclusion on the continent. Open finance thrives on the notion that with access to a financial ecosystem via open APIs and new routes to move money, access financial information and make borrowing decisions, the barriers and costs of entry for the unbanked and underbanked might come down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for Hassan, Mono&#8217;s play overlaps open finance and open banking. Although the two terminologies portray what these African startups want to accomplish, the CEO believes that they are subject to regulation from the government and apex financial institutions. Mono is a data company playing in the fintech space, he says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He likened Mono to how Google was in its early days when it started with a simple mission to organize the world&#8217;s information and make it accessible. Decades later, Google has metamorphosed into an internet giant playing in a plethora of sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you ask me, I&#8217;ll say we don&#8217;t see ourselves entirely in open banking or finance,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re concerned about how we can get data from different sources and aggregate into a database where businesses can get access to them with our users’ consent. Down the line, we can use this data for different use cases and solve various problems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono has already secured partnerships with more than 16 financial institutions in Nigeria and has a little over a hundred businesses like Carbon, Renmoney, Flutterwave and Indicina using its platform. They process about 5 million datasets per hour, the CEO claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These clients are mainly lending companies with a few others in proptech and health tech, which allow users to pay for their services in installments. But there are plans to diversify this clientele. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such way will be to improve onboarding processes on applications through its one-click signup feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a user&#8217;s perspective, here&#8217;s how it works when considering two savings applications: Users submit their KYC to the first savings app. But for one reason or the other, maybe due to a better interest rate, some users switch to a second savings app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there&#8217;s a little hassle in that a second KYC is needed for this process. What Mono has done with the one-click signup feature is to let users transfer their data from the first app to the second without repeating the process. And to that end, Mono has partnered with two of Nigeria&#8217;s leading savings and investment platforms to roll out the service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First, we&#8217;ve enabled companies with a new infrastructure that allows them to get access to customers&#8217; financial accounts and understand their history before giving them loans or any financial service. Now, we think with the new generation of companies coming up in Africa, Mono will be the one to power their onboarding processes,&#8221; Hassan remarks on the platform&#8217;s offerings.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107026" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107026" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2107026" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Twitter-Post.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107026" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mono</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any investor, Mono&#8217;s sticky features, coupled with explosive growth, looks too good of an opportunity to pass on. Today, the six-month-old startup announced that it has been accepted into Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 batch. It will receive $125,000 in seed funding with an opportunity to receive follow-up investment after graduating in March. The startup also joins 39 other African startups per YC data which have passed through the accelerator since 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting into the accelerator helps Mono with one of its biggest challenges. According to Hassan, Mono has come across users who are still skeptical to input their internet banking details on the platform due to personal experiences with online fraud in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To date, we&#8217;ve been focusing on building, and I think we&#8217;ve gotten to a stage where we&#8217;re seeing some people not wanting to use their internet banking on Mono.&#8221; But with YC&#8217;s backing and a conscious offline marketing plan afterwards, the founder thinks Mono&#8217;s credibility can get a lift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Paystack, where Hassan was a product manager, he was privileged to experience firsthand the company&#8217;s innovation and growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">before it was acquired by Stripe last year</a>. He says he learned the ropes of product development and management, and hiring &#8212; lessons that have stuck with him to Mono, a company now with 13 staff across Nigeria and India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan for Mono is to be a global company and getting into YC provides the perfect opportunity to do so. The company is also planning an imminent pan-African expansion to Ghana and Kenya, and from all indication, Mono might execute one if not the two before the end of Q1. Setting the company up for expansion and the hiring spree that comes with it will require capital, so a seed round is in the works to facilitate the whole process.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital ordering and paying at restaurants was already gaining much ground in China before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The tap-to-order method on a smartphone is part of the greater development in China where cash and physical documentation is increasingly being phased out. Many restaurants across large cities go as far as making digital menus mandatory, cutting staff costs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there has been pushback from the public and the authorities over aggressive digitization. An <a href="http://gongyi.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0201/c151132-32018656.html">article</a> published this week by People&#8217;s Daily, an official paper of the Chinese Communist Party, was titled: &#8220;Scan-to-order shouldn&#8217;t be the only option.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from harming consumers&#8217; freedom of choice and removing the human interaction that diners might appreciate, mandatory smartphone use also raises concerns over data privacy. Ordering on a phone often requires access to a person&#8217;s profile on WeChat, Alipay, Meituan or other internet platforms enabling restaurants&#8217; digital services. With that trove of data, businesses will go on to span users with ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These approaches harm consumers&#8217; data protection rights,&#8221; the People&#8217;s Daily quotes a senior personnel at the consumer rights unit of China Law Society, China&#8217;s official organization of legal academic professionals, as saying.</p>
<p>China has similarly targeted the ubiquity of cashless payments. In 2018, China’s central bank <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-payment-idUSKBN1O902F">called</a> rejecting cash as a form of payment &#8220;illegal&#8221; and &#8220;unfair&#8221; to those not accustomed to electronic payments, such as senior citizens.</p>
<p>The elderly also face a dilemma as digital health codes, which are normally generated by tracking people&#8217;s movement history using location data from SIM cards, becomes a norm amid the pandemic. Without a smartphone-enabled health pass, senior citizens could be turned away by bus drivers, subway station guards, restaurant staff and gatekeepers at other public venues.</p>
<p>To bridge the digital divide, the southern province of Guangdong recently <a href="http://smzt.gd.gov.cn/mzzx/mzyw/content/post_3185598.html">began</a> allowing citizens to check their health status by tapping their physical ID cards on designated scanners.</p>
<p>Cashless payment is an irreversible trend though. Between 2015 and 2020, the digital payments penetration rate amongst China&#8217;s mobile internet users went from less than 60% to over 85%, according to <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/rootimages/uploadimg/1589535470391296/1589535470391296.pdf?filepath=ZBWvETi1XzcBKtOIkqelkI6LjXtsGgSA5nY19tMgqpxXM3yR3AbrYaldQRZRixKUS2HIKQQ6RgOUhhY5QbgarDEjTcORl73kmCTdYOvdSjs=&amp;fText=%E5%85%A8%E6%96%87%20%E7%AC%AC45%E6%AC%A1%E3%80%8A%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%8A%B6%E5%86%B5%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A%E3%80%8B2020425">official data</a>. Moreover, the government is hastening the pace to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/">roll out digital yuan</a>, which, unlike third-party payments methods, is issued and managed by the central bank and serves as the statutory, digital version of China’s physical currency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years after launching its $56 million debut fund, <a href="https://kindredventures.com/">Kindred Ventures</a>, a San Francisco-based pre-seed and seed-stage venture fund founded by Steve Jang and Kanyi Maqubela, has closed its second fund with $100 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>Jang is himself a founder who later jumped into investing. In more recent years, he cofounded <a href="https://www.bitski.com/">Bitski</a>, a crypto-asset wallet startup, and previously founded Schematic Labs, an early social music app that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/rhapsody-soundtracking/">brought into</a> Rhapsody in 2014, and co-created the music streaming service imeem, whose assets were later <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/myspace-music-acquires-shutters-imeem/">acquired</a> by MySpace.</p>
<p>Jang was also an early advisor to and investor in Uber, and individually invested in a number of other breakout companies, including the delivery company Postmates, the synthetic biology company Zymergen, the fitness company Tonal, and the crypto exchange Coinbase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maqubela has similarly worn the hats of both founder and investor, spending six years as an investor with the seed- and early-stage firm Collaborative Fund before joining forces with Jang, as well as cofounding <a href="https://www.heartbeathealth.com/">Heartbeat Health</a> &#8212; a platform that invites patients who are at risk of heart disease and other chronic ailments to talk remotely with experts for care management.</p>
<p>The fund is notable, including because it doesn&#8217;t zero in on one or two sectors of tech. Why is that interesting? Well, because the venture landscape is now so crowded that institutional investors typically prefer to see seed-stage funds with a specific sector focus or an angle of some sort. It&#8217;s a way for these limited partners to better diversify their own investments and keep from backing managers who are investing in the very same deals.</p>
<p>Indeed, that Jang and Maqubela secured commitments from a mix of major university endowments, foundations, fund-of-funds, and strategic investors <em>despite</em> being generalists is something a feat.</p>
<p>No doubt investor interest ties to some of their earlier investments, like Coinbase &#8212; bets that underscore they are in the right entrepreneurial circles. Yet they say that another aspect of their pitch also resonated with investors, which is their &#8220;high concentration, high conviction&#8221; approach. Part of their workflow, for example, involves creating a Signal group or Slack channel as soon as they invest in a team so there can be a constant back-and-forth and to bolster the sense that Jang and Maqubela are extensions of a founding team.</p>
<p>Kindred says it also schedules weekly one-on-one chats with the founders it funds until their startup has designated a product launch date, after which &#8220;we move into a less rigorous, less frequent meetings,&#8221; says Jang, describing the firm&#8217;s approach very &#8220;programmatic and designed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But another way Kindred tries to gain an edge over competitors is by moving as close to the concept stage as possible &#8212; even helping to form startups. Jang and Maqubela point back to Heartbeat Health and Bitski, which they helped incubate and spin out. Another startup born of their &#8220;formation investing&#8221; approach is a payments company called <a href="https://www.ottopay.com/">Otto</a>, and they say to expect more to come.</p>
<p>In some cases, they start the company and assemble the founding team. In other cases, they help a new founder evolve from concept to prototype to landing the right cofounder. What it asks for in exchange is an ownership stake that ranges from between 5% of a company to 20% percent, with an average ownership position of 11%, they say, and ticking upward as the firm matures.</p>
<p>As for deal flow, they say they source their deals through introductions from the founders in their portfolio, through their own outreach based on ideas that excite them, and from employees of past portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though the bets they make range widely in focus, different themes do emerge, including around digital health, where in addition to Heartbeat Health and Tonal they backed <a href="https://www.color.com/">Color</a>, whose at-home tests can help people understand if they are at risk of hereditary cancer, as well as whether they have been exposed to COVID-19. (It closed its newest round at a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/color-raises-167-million-funding-at-1-5-billion-valuation-to-expand-last-mile-of-u-s-health-infrastructure/"> $1.5 billion</a> valuation earlier this month.)</p>
<p>Kindred is focused on community, too, with bets that include the audio social network Clubhouse. And Kindred is writing checks to the occasional security company, including <a href="https://www.anjuna.io/our-team">Anjuna Security</a>, which aims to protects applications and data from insiders by seamlessly encrypting everything end to end.</p>
<p>Not last, finance is plainly an area of interest. In addition to Coinbase, for example, Kindred more recently invested in <a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dYdX</a>, an open trading platform for crypto assets that just last announced it had raised $10 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>As for how the two &#8212; who wound up funding 25 companies altogether in their first fund &#8212; can continue to cover so much ground as they set out to invest this new, bigger vehicle, Maqubela says the question came up &#8220;more than half the time&#8221; in conversations about this next fund with its investors. But their secret sauce is no great mystery, they insist, saying they just happen to be highly curious people who are willing to get up to speed however possible when they meet a founder with whom they want to partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ultimately comes down to who Kanyi is and who I am,&#8221; says Jang, &#8220;and we&#8217;re both voracious about learning, it&#8217;s what drives us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though both have experience and know-how about a wide number of verticals at this point, they&#8217;re &#8220;absolutely novices&#8221; at times, and they don&#8217;t let that stop them, both say.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re inspired by the founder, their intellect, their dedication to a problem, and why they&#8217;re doing what they&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re happy to go learn as quickly as possible,&#8221; offers Jang. &#8220;We&#8217;re very dutiful students.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20210201">Google has agreed</a> to pay $2.59 million to more than 5,500 current employees and former job applicants as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor over allegations of systemic discrimination as it relates to compensation and hiring. Google has also agreed to reserve $250,000 a year for the next five years to address any potential pay equity adjustments that may come up. That brings Google&#8217;s total financial commitment to $3.8 million &#8212; a drop in the bucket for the company, whose parent company Alphabet has a market cap of $1.28 trillion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OFCCP/foia/files/2021-01-15_Google_ERCA_PA_Redacted.pdf">The settlement</a> comes after the DOL&#8217;s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs found pay disparities affecting female software engineers at Google&#8217;s offices in Mountain View, as well as in offices in Seattle and Kirkland, Washington. The OFCCP also found differences in hiring rates that &#8220;disadvantaged female and Asian applicants&#8221; for engineers roles at Google&#8217;s locations in San Francisco, Sunnyvale and Kirkland. The OFCCP&#8217;s evaluation covered September 1, 2014 through August 31, 2017.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Google has agreed to pay $1.35 million in back pay and interest to 2,565 female software engineers at the company ($527.50 per employee), and $1.25 million in back pay and interest to 1,757 women and 1,219 Asian applicants for software engineering roles for which they were not hired ($414 per person).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lastly, Google will reserve $1.25 million of the money to go toward pay-equity adjustments for the next five years for U.S. engineers at Google&#8217;s Mountain View, Kirkland, Seattle and New York offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe everyone should be paid based upon the work they do, not who they are, and invest heavily to make our hiring and compensation processes fair and unbiased,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;For the past eight years, we have run annual internal pay equity analysis to identify and address any discrepancies. We’re pleased to have resolved this matter related to allegations from the 2014-2017 audits and remain committed to diversity and equity and to supporting our people in a way that allows them to do their best work.&#8221;</p>
<p><span lang="EN" xml:lang="EN">&#8220;The U.S. Department of Labor acknowledges Google’s willingness to engage in settlement discussions and reach an early resolution,&#8221; Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs</span> Regional Director Jane Suhr said in a press release. &#8220;The technology industry continues to be one of the region’s largest and fastest growing employers. Regardless of how complex or the size of the workforce, we remain committed to enforcing equal opportunity laws to ensure non-discrimination and equity in the workforce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a creator-economy world, if you’re only as good as your last YouTube video, then your next YouTube video had better be bigger and louder than the last.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vibely.io/">Vibely</a>, a new startup co-founded by Asana alumni<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teriyu/"> Teri Yu</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theresaylee/"> Theresa Lee</a>, wants to turn the constant, and often exhausting, beast of content creation on its head. The startup has created a premium, creator-controlled community platform that allows fans to gather and be monetized in new ways, beyond what is possible on YouTube or TikTok.</p>
<p>The core of Vibely, and what the co-founders hope will keep users coming back, is the ability to let any creator make a challenge for their fans to enjoy. For example, a creator whose brand evokes thoughtfulness could ask fans to sketch out their personal growth goals or take action around a new year’s resolution everyday. Or a fitness influencer could motivate fans to work out for a sprint of days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Most people in the creator economy are thinking about how to immediately monetize and get that instant gratification of like money here,” Yu said, which is why creators sell merchandise or hop on Cameo. “We’re focusing on long-term strategic communities.” Yu describes her startup’s shift as a mindset change, from a linear relationship between creators and fans to a multi-directional relationship between fans, superfans, new fans and creators.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106186" style="width: 348px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106186" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2106186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png" alt="" width="338" height="731" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BlissBean.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vibely</p></div></p>
<p>Vibely’s pitch is two-fold. For fans, the platform gives them a chance to chat with other fans from around the world. It also lets fans participate in community challenges and have a place to plan virtual hangouts over shared love for makeup or dance. The startup helps creators simultaneously, by giving them a one-stop shop to announce plans, do call to actions and create an ambassador program. It lets the “creator scale their time and have a multi-directional relationship with the community under or beneath them.”</p>
<p>Notably, Vibely is trying to be different from Patreon or OnlyFans, which is basically paywalled content for fans. Vibely doesn’t need creators to post more content, it just needs them to pop into a premium community and interact with fans in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>The startup is formalizing a sporadic daily occurrence: When a creator posts content, their comment sections in YouTube, Instagram and TikTok light up with fans discussing every detail you can imagine, from a suggestive hair flip to if that background poster has a hidden message. Creators often pop in to respond to a spicy thread or a random compliment, which incentivizes fans to keep swarming the content section.</p>

<p>The startup has spent little on customer acquisition cost and relied heavily on word of mouth. In December, Vibely launched a part-in-person, part-virtual creator house to pair top TikTok creators with their followers, generating some buzz. In 2020, Vibely had more than 600 communities with 392,000 messages sent and 37,000 challenges completed. Creators include Lavendaire, with 1.3 million YouTube subscribers and Rowena Tsai, who has 520,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Yu says that there is one day where Kim Kardashian might have a community on the platform, but the main &#8220;bread and butter&#8221; of Vibely is searching for creators who represent a true interest, value or belief system. This can be a book influencer or a religious creator, for example.</p>
<p>“[Creators] are controlling their own destiny,” Yu said. “On Instagram or Facebook, you might create content but the algorithm decides at the end of the day whether or not your audience sees it. With Vibely, they have 100% control since this is their community.” The startup is planning to make money through membership dues and in-app mechanics like social currencies and rewards.</p>
<p>Vibely’s moonshot goal is to be a more positive, and supportive, Discord, a platform used by gamer communities across the world. So far, Yu says that less than .1% of Vibely users have been flagged by other users, although notably would not share total user numbers. There is also an ambassador program that appoints a user to oversee a community, as well as a global community manager on the team.</p>
<p>“The ceiling of where [Discord] can support is really only going to be gamers,” she said. “But creators want to protect their brand right now and make sure people have a positive experience,” so they are looking for another place to set up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106183" style="width: 645px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106183" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2106183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png" alt="" width="635" height="483" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png 938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Discord-vs-Vibely.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106183" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vibely</p></div></p>
<p>While moderation is apparently going well so far, Vibely will most certainly encounter problems as more and more users join its platform. In the world of challenges, craze and hype led by fanatics could potentially become harmful if someone takes it too far. While Vibely aims to be a judgement-free zone for people to connect around the world, scale has a uniquely pessimistic way of forking that from time to time. Some consumer apps have responded to this truth by aggressively hiring on-staff moderators, but that<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"> too can become grueling work.</a></p>
<p>To hit the ground running, Vibely announced today that it has raised $2 million in seed financing from backers including Steve Chen, the co-founder of YouTube; Justin Rosenstein, the co-founder of Asana and co-creator of Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Social Dilemma&#8221; documentary; Scott Heiferman, the co-founder of Meetup; Turner Novak, formerly an investor at Gelt, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google rethinks its gaming strategy, Microsoft rolls out its quantum computing platform and UiPath is now valued at $35 billion. This is your Daily Crunch for February 1, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Google shutters internal game studios</strong></p>
<p>When Google announced its Stadia cloud platform, it also said it was forming Stadia Games and Entertainment, an internal studio that would create titles for the platform. Now it seems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-shuts-down-its-internal-stadia-game-studios/">the company is abandoning this approach</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a surprising move, not just because Google has yet to release a single game from the studio, but also because the company opened studios in Montreal and Los Angeles, as well as acquiring Typhoon Studios — so it seems like a real investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given our focus on building on the proven technology of Stadia as well as deepening our business partnerships, we’ve decided that we will not be investing further in bringing exclusive content from our internal development team SG&amp;E, beyond any near-term planned games,” Google exec Phil Harrison said in a blog post.</p>
