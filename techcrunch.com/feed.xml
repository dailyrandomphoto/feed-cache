</div><p id="speakable-summary">If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, then one might say the cybersecurity industry is insane.</p>
<p>Criminals continue to innovate with highly sophisticated attack methods, but many security organizations still use the same technological approaches they did 10 years ago. The world has changed, but cybersecurity hasn’t kept pace.</p>
<p>Distributed systems, with people and data everywhere, mean the perimeter has disappeared. And the hackers couldn’t be more excited. The same technology approaches, like correlation rules, manual processes, and reviewing alerts in isolation, do little more than remedy symptoms while hardly addressing the underlying problem.</p>
<p>Credentials are supposed to be the front gates of the castle, but as the SOC is failing to change, it is failing to detect. The cybersecurity industry must rethink its strategy to analyze how credentials are used and stop breaches before they become bigger problems.</p>
<h2>It’s all about the credentials</h2>
<p>Compromised credentials have long been a primary attack vector, but the problem has only grown worse in the mid-pandemic world. The acceleration of remote work has increased the attack footprint as organizations struggle to secure their network while employees work from unsecured connections. In April 2020, the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/493198-fbi-sees-spike-in-cyber-crime-reports-during-coronavirus-pandemic">FBI said</a> that cybersecurity attacks reported to the organization grew by 400% compared to before the pandemic. Just imagine where that number is now in early 2021.</p>
<p>It only takes one compromised account for an attacker to enter the active directory and create their own credentials. In such an environment, all user accounts should be considered as potentially compromised.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the hundreds of breach reports I’ve read have involved compromised credentials. More than 80% of hacking breaches are now enabled by brute force or the use of lost or stolen credentials, according to the<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf"> 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>. The most effective and commonly-used strategy is credential stuffing attacks, where digital adversaries break in, exploit the environment, then move laterally to gain higher-level access.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://brandproject.com/">BrandProject</a> —a firm that&#8217;s backed successful direct-to-consumer commerce startups like Freshly (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/nestle-acquires-freshly/">acquired by Nestlé</a>), Persona <a href="https://www.nestle.com/media/news/nestle-health-science-acquisition-persona">(also acquired by Nestlé</a>) and Chef&#8217;s Plate (<a href="https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/12735-hellofresh-to-acquire-canadian-meal-kit-company">acquired by Hello Fresh</a>) — is announcing that it has raised $43 million for what it says is its first traditional venture fund.</p>
<p>Founded Andrew Black, who previously co-founded Virgin Mobile Canada and served as president of LEGO Americas, BrandProject previously invested from a $12 million fund tied BrandProject Studio, where the money is just a small part of what&#8217;s being offered — apparently six of the firm&#8217;s eight team members are entirely focused on supporting startups, often serving as de facto CTOs, CFOs and CMOs.</p>
<p>With the new BrandProject Capital fund, the firm will be able to make larger investments in (somewhat) more mature companies. Black estimated that the new fund will be writing checks of between $1 million and $3 million; the goal is for half of the deals to be new investments, while the other half consists of follow-on investments in startups from BrandProject Studio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be supporting the same type of businesses out of Studio or Capital, but with Studio, nothing&#8217;s too early for us — we&#8217;re all about team, team, team,&#8221; said Partner Hayden Williams. &#8220;But if it&#8217;s a Capital deal, we&#8217;re going to look for some evidence that something working, even if it&#8217;s a small scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The focus will continue to be direct-to-consumer brands, and although the pandemic has led to tremendous e-commerce growth, Black said it hasn&#8217;t changed the BrandProject strategy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139825" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?w=680" alt="BrandProject Team" width="680" height="387" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png 4695w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=2048,1165 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BrandProject-Team.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139825" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BrandProject</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven’t adjusted our investment focus at all because of COVID,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ve always invested behind categories, brands and segments that we just think the world needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the limited partners who invested in the new fund is probably BrandProject&#8217;s biggest success story — Freshly co-founder and CEO Michael Wystrach, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/nestle-acquires-freshly/">sold his healthy meal startup to Nestlé for $1.5 billion</a>. Wystrach recalled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/brandproject-consumer-startup-incubator/">reading about BrandProject in TechCrunch</a> and, after looking the firm up, sending unsolicited meals to Partner Jay Bhatti in New York.</p>
<p>At that point, Freshly had only raised friends-and-family funding, and Wystrach admitted, &#8220;We would have taken a check from anyone.&#8221; But he said he was lucky that Bhatti liked the food and the firm decided to invest, with Black becoming an interim co-CEO, Bhatti serving as interim CTO and Partner Andrew Bridge serving as an interim CMO.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I loved about BrandProject is that they never came in and told us what kind of business we’re building,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;It was never a case where they said, &#8216;You need to do this.&#8217; It was our business, and they were team members in helping us build the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate the idea behind the new fund, Wystrach compared the investment ecosystem to the U.S. schools: &#8220;Where Andrew and the team come in, they’re K through 8 or maybe K through 6, they&#8217;re very hands on &#8230; With the new fund, maybe they’re moving to middle school.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://soona.co">Soona</a>, a startup aiming to satisfy the growing content needs of the e-commerce ecosystem, is announcing that it has raised $10.2 million in Series A funding led by Union Square Ventures.</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/soona-seed-funding/">wrote about Soona in 2019</a>, the model focused on staging shoots that can deliver videos and photos in 24 hours or less. The startup still operates studios in Austin, Denver and Minneapolis, but co-founder and CEO Liz Giorgi told me that during the pandemic, Soona shifted to a fully virtual/remote model — customers ship their products to Soona, then watch the shoot remotely and offer immediate feedback, and only pay for the photos ($39 each) and video clips ($93 each) that they actually want.</p>
<p>In some cases, the studio isn&#8217;t even necessary — Giorgi said that 30% of Soona&#8217;s photographers and crew members are working from home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Soona has now worked with more than 4,000 customers, including Lola Tampons, The Sill and Wild Earth, with revenue growing 400% last year. Giorgi said that even as larger in-person shoots become possible again, this approach still makes sense for many clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we sell online that does not require a visual, but not every single visual requires a massive full-day shoot,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139790" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139790" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139790" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?w=680" alt="Soona" width="680" height="617" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?resize=768,697 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?resize=680,617 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/book-a-photo-or-video-shoot.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139790" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Soona</p></div></p>
<p>Giorgi also suggested that Soona&#8217;s approach has unlocked a &#8220;new level of scalability,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Internally at Soona, we really believe in the remote-shoot experience. It&#8217;s not only more efficient, it&#8217;s a lot more fun not having to fly a brand manager from Miami and have them spend a full day at a warehouse in New York. That&#8217;s not only cost-prohibitive, it&#8217;s also a time-consuming and exhausting process for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/soona-seed-funding/">a $1.2 million seed round</a>. Giorgi said the Series A will allow Soona to develop a subscription product with more collaboration tools and more data about what kinds of visual content is most effective.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BMvYBT9ic7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/">So you want to raise a Series A</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;So you want to raise a Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/series-a-how-to/embed/#?secret=BMvYBT9ic7" data-secret="BMvYBT9ic7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;There’s an opportunity to own the visual ecosystem of e-commerce from beginning to end,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Giorgi also noted that Soona continues to employ its <a href="https://soona.co/candorclause/">&#8220;candor clause&#8221;</a> requiring investors to disclose whether they&#8217;ve ever faced complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination. In fact, the clause has been expanded to cover complaints around racism, ableism or anti-LGBTQ discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways it’s a gate that prevents bad actors from being involved [&#8230;] but it really drives a deeper connection with the investor and the founder,&#8221; Giorgi said. &#8220;We can have conversations about our values and how we see the world. We get to have a conversation about equality and justice at at time when we&#8217;re talking a lot about equity and the cap table.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later is a way of paying for purchases via installment loans that generally have no interest. The concept has grown in popularity in recent years, especially in markets such as the United States, Europe and Australia. Numerous players abound, all fighting for market share &#8212; from Affirm to Klarna to Afterpay, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But notably, none of these bigger players have yet to penetrate another very large market &#8212; Latin America. Enter </span><a href="https://www.nelo.mx/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup founded by former Uber international growth team leads, which is building buy now, pay later in Mexico. The company is already live with more than 45 merchants and over 150,000 users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based fintech-focused VC firm Homebrew led its recent seed round of $3 million, which also included participation from Susa Ventures, Crossbeam, Rogue Capital, Unpopular Ventures and others. With the latest capital infusion, Nelo has raised a total of $5.6 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo is not the only player in the Mexican market. A number of others, including Alchemy and Addi, have recently outlined plans for buy now, pay later offerings in the region. But where Nelo has an advantage, believes CEO Kyle Miller, is its established relationships with about 45 merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I’m excited about is the relationship with the merchants,” Miller told TechCrunch. “If we find a large global one and increase conversion for them, that is our defensibility [against competitors]. What’s important here is signing on merchants, since they usually only have one offering in their checkout.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and co-founder Stephen Hebson used to work for Uber’s international growth team, growing financial services products in India, Mexico, China and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got to see a cross market where countries were accelerating and where others weren’t,” Miller recalls. “For example, China was a leader in mobile payments and digital finance in India was completely transformed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in markets like Mexico, the percentage of cash payments for trips was very high. And to Miller and Hebson, this spelled opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo launched its first product in Mexico in January 2020, similar to a debit card offering from a neobank. In the middle of the year, the company launched credit installment loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It became immediately clear that it was going to be our most popular feature,” Miller said. “By the end of the year, it was the vast majority of our business and something that our users were telling their friends about. We were solving a real pain point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, cash remains the dominant method of payment in Mexico, with <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit">an estimated 86% of all payments</a> being in the form of cash. According to eMarketer, the region was the <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-will-fastest-growing-retail-ecommerce-market-this-year">fastest-growing e-commerce market</a> in the world in 2020, with 37% year over year growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to credit is something we take for granted in the U.S.,” Miller said. “By the end of the year, we realized this was the future of business, and we decided to focus just on credit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Nelo launched its first product via an Android app and will be launching a web app soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers can use its offering like a credit card, connecting directly with merchants such as Netflix and Spotify. Many users are paying for things like utility bills and cell phone bills, turning them from prepaid to postpay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its current product, the company has lent about $2 million, and is seeing growth of about 20% month over month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing massive demand for this new product in the way of organic signups,” Miller said, “for all the reasons Buy Now, Pay Later has been successful in markets like the U.S., Europe and Australia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying for installments is already common in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, so the concept is not foreign to residents in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We expected this is soon going to be a competitive market, so we’re hiring data scientists and engineers to continue improving our product, and grow,” Miller said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo has about 14 employees with an engineering team in New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Satya Patel says he’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">excited about Nelo because he believes the startup “solves a serious problem related to the lack of credit for Mexican consumers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit card penetration is less than 10% in Mexico and other forms of credit are effectively non-existent,” he wrote via email. “Nelo makes it possible for Mexicans to easily and inexpensively increase their purchasing power at the point of sale. And importantly, Nelo is delivering this solution online, supporting growing interest in e-commerce, and also offline, where consumers regularly shop today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patel adds that what Nelo is building is valuable because he is not aware of any reliable, comprehensive consumer credit rating data set in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are building underwriting models based on proprietary data and growing the merchant network at an incredible rate,” he said. “This buy now, pay later opportunity is untapped in Mexico but requires a very different approach than what has been successful in other markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nelo team, according to Patel, understands the nuances of the market and “is executing at an exceptional pace.”</span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“If you build it, they will come” is a mantra that’s been repeated for more than three decades to embolden action. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3c_pJ_CLJQ">line</a> from “Field of Dreams” is a powerful saying, but I might add one word: “If you build it <strong>well</strong>, they will come.”</p>
<p>America’s <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/lifeline-program-low-income-consumers">Lifeline program</a>, a monthly subsidy designed to help low-income families afford critical communications services, was created with the best intentions. The original goal was to achieve universal telephone service, but it has fallen far short of achieving its potential as the Federal Communications Commission has attempted to convert it to a broadband-centric program.</p>
<p>The FCC’s Universal Service Administrative Company estimates that only <a href="https://www.usac.org/lifeline/learn/program-data/#:~:text=Lifeline%20Participation%20%20%20State%20%20%20January,%20%2024%25%20%2049%20more%20rows%20">26%</a> of the families that are eligible for Lifeline currently participate in the program. That means that nearly three out of four low-income consumers are missing out on a benefit for which they qualify. But that doesn’t mean the program should be abandoned, as the Biden administration’s newly released infrastructure plan suggests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Now is the right opportunity to complete the transformation of Lifeline to broadband and expand its utilization by increasing the benefit to a level commensurate with the broadband marketplace and making the benefit directly available to end users.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Rather, now is the right opportunity to complete the transformation of Lifeline to broadband and expand its utilization by increasing the benefit to a level commensurate with the broadband marketplace and making the benefit directly available to end users. Instead, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">fact sheet</a> on the plan recommends price controls for internet access services with a phaseout of subsidies for low-income subscribers. That is a flawed policy prescription.</p>
<p>If maintaining America’s global competitiveness, building broadband infrastructure in high-cost rural areas, and maintaining the nation’s rapid deployment of 5G wireless services are national goals, the government should not set prices for internet access.</p>
<p>Forcing artificially low prices in the quest for broadband affordability would leave internet service providers with insufficient revenues to continue to meet the nation’s communications infrastructure needs with robust innovation and investment.</p>
<p>Instead, targeted changes to the Lifeline program could dramatically increase its participation rate, helping to realize the goal of connecting Americans most in need with the phone and broadband services that in today’s world have become essential to employment, education, healthcare and access to government resources.</p>
<p>To start, Lifeline program participation should be made much easier. Today, individuals seeking the benefit must go through a process of self-enrollment. Implementing “coordinated enrollment&#8221; — through which individuals would automatically be enrolled in Lifeline when they qualify for certain other government assistance benefits, including SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps) and Medicaid — would help to address the severe program underutilization.</p>
<p>Because multiple government programs serve the same constituency, a single qualification process for enrollment in all applicable programs would generate government efficiencies and reach Americans who are missing out.</p>
<p>Speaking before the American Enterprise Institute back in 2014, former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn <a href="https://docplayer.net/8728441-Lifeline-reform-means-more-than-just-another-broadband-cable-service.html">said</a>, “In most states, to enroll in federal benefit programs administered by state agencies, consumers already must gather their income-related documentation, and for some programs, go through a face-to-face interview. Allowing customers to enroll in Lifeline at the same time as they apply for other government benefits would provide a better experience for consumers and streamline our efforts.”</p>
<p>Second, the use of the Lifeline benefit can be made far simpler for consumers if the subsidy is provided directly to them via an electronic Lifeline benefit card account — like the SNAP program’s electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card. Not only would a Lifeline benefit card make participation in the program more convenient, but low-income</p>
<p>Americans would then be able to shop among the various providers and select the carrier and the precise service(s) that best suits their needs. The flexibility of greater consumer choice would be an encouragement for more program sign-ups.</p>
<p>And, the current Lifeline subsidy amount — $9.25 per month — isn’t enough to pay for a broadband subscription. For the subsidy to be truly meaningful, an increase in the monthly benefit is needed. Last December, Congress passed the temporary Emergency Broadband Benefit to provide low-income Americans up to a $50 per month discount ($75 per month on tribal lands) to offset the cost of broadband connectivity during the pandemic. After the emergency benefit runs out, a monthly benefit adequate to defray the cost of a broadband subscription will be needed.</p>
<p>In order to support more than a $9.25 monthly benefit, the funding source for the Lifeline program must also be reimagined. Currently, the program relies on the FCC’s Universal Service Fund, which is financed through a “tax” on traditional long-distance and international telephone services.</p>
<p>As greater use is made of the web for voice communications, coupled with less use of traditional telephones, the tax rate has increased to compensate for the shrinking revenues associated with landline phone services. A decade ago, the tax, known as the “contribution factor,” was <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/contribution-factor-quarterly-filings-universal-service-fund-usf-management-support">15.5%</a>, but it’s now more than double that at an unsustainable <a href="https://www.neca.org/docs/default-source/wwpdf/public/da21308.pdf">33.4%</a>. Without changes, the problem will only worsen.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see that the financing of a broadband benefit should no longer be tied to a dying technology. Instead, funding for the Lifeline program could come from a “tax” shared across the entire internet ecosystem, including the edge providers that depend on broadband to reach their customers, or from direct congressional appropriations for the Lifeline program.</p>
<p>These reforms are realistic and straightforward. Rather than burn the program down, it’s time to <strong>rebuild </strong>Lifeline to ensure that it fulfills its original intention and reaches America’s neediest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s self-styled and handpicked &#8220;Oversight Board&#8221; will make a decision on whether or not to overturn an indefinite suspension of the account of former president Donald Trump within &#8220;weeks&#8221;, it said in a brief update statement on the matter today.</p>
<p>The high-profile case appears to have attracted major public interest, with the FOB tweeting that it&#8217;s received more than 9,000 responses so far to its earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">request for public feedback</a>.</p>
<p>It added that its commitment to &#8220;carefully reviewing all comments&#8221; after an earlier extension of the deadline for feedback is responsible for the extension of the case timeline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The board&#8217;s statement adds that it will provide more information &#8220;soon&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2): The Board’s commitment to carefully reviewing all comments has extended the case timeline, in line with the Board’s bylaws. We will share more information soon.</p>
<p>&mdash; Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1383058864074063874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Trump&#8217;s indefinite suspension from Facebook and Instagram was announced by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">on January 7</a>, after the then-president of the U.S. incited his followers to riot at the nation’s Capitol &#8212; an insurrection that led to chaotic and violent scenes and a number of deaths as his supporters clashed with police.</p>
<p>However, Facebook quickly referred the decision to the FOB for review &#8212; opening up the possibility that the ban could be overturned in short order as Facebook has said it will be bound by the case review decisions issued by the board.</p>
<p>After the FOB accepted the case for review it initially said it would issue a decision within 90 days of January 21 &#8212; a deadline that would have fallen next Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, it now looks like the high-profile, high-stakes call on Trump&#8217;s social media fate could be pushed into next month.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familiar development in Facebook-land. Delay has been a longtime feature of the tech giant&#8217;s crisis PR response in the face of a long history of scandals and bad publicity attached to how it operates its platform. So the tech giant is unlikely to be uncomfortable that the FOB is taking its time to make a call on Trump&#8217;s suspension.</p>
<p>After all, devising and configuring the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/meet-facebooks-latest-fake/">bespoke case review body</a> &#8212; as its proprietary parody of genuine civic oversight &#8212; is a process that has taken Facebook years already.</p>
<p>In related <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-ask-oversight-panel-to-review-decisions-not-to-remove-content/">FOB news this week</a>, Facebook announced that users can now request the board review its decisions <em>not</em> to remove content &#8212; expanding the board&#8217;s potential cases to include reviews of &#8220;keep ups&#8221; (not just content takedowns).</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction: The FOB previously extended the deadline for case submissions; it has not done so again as we originally stated.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you only stayed up to date with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase direct listing this week</a>, you&#8217;re forgiven. It was, after all, one heck of a flotation.</p>
<p>But underneath the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s public debut, other IPO news that matters did happen this week. And the news adds up to a somewhat muddled picture of the current IPO market.</p>
<p>To cap off the week, let&#8217;s run through IPO news from UiPath, Coinbase, Grab, AppLovin and Zenvia. The aggregate dataset should help you form your own perspective about where today&#8217;s IPO markets really are in terms of warmth for the often unprofitable unicorns of the world.</p>
<p>Recall that we&#8217;re in the midst of a slightly more turbulent IPO window than we saw during the last quarter. After seemingly watching every company&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">price above-range and then charge higher on opening day</a>, several companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">pulled their offerings</a> as the second quarter started. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">was a surprise</a>.</p>
<p>Since then we&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/compass-ceo-hails-ipo-as-a-fundraising-event-amid-challenging-market/">seen Compass go public</a>, but not at quite the level of performance it might have anticipated, and, then, this week, much has happened.</p>
<p>What follows is a minidigest of IPO news from the week, tagged with our best read of just how bullish (or not) the happening really was:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">UiPath&#8217;s first IPO price interval</a>:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neutral to bearish<span style="color: #000000;">.</span></span> Though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">we anticipate that UiPath will set a higher IPO price interval</a> before it begins to trade, that its first swing at-bat was a valuation cut of around $9 billion did not set our hearts aflame. And we could be wrong about it getting valued more richly before starting to trade.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM and LG Chem announced Friday plans to build a second U.S. battery cell factory — a $2.3 billion facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee that will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade.</p>
<p>Construction on the plant, which is located next to GM&#8217;s existing Spring Hill factory, will begin immediately, the company&#8217;s CEO and Chairman Mary Barra said in a press conference. The battery factory is expected to be completed by late 2023, and create 1,300 jobs.</p>
<p>Once fully operational, the joint venture&#8217;s two battery factories will have production capacity of more than 70 gigawatt hours, which LG Chem Energy Solutions CEO Jong Hyun Kim noted is two times bigger than the Tesla gigafactory in Nevada. Tesla’s factory in Sparks, Nevada, which is part of a partnership with Panasonic, has a 35 GW-hour capacity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The foundation of GM&#8217;s shift to EVs is its Ultium platform, and the Ultium lithium-ion batteries, which will be built at the Spring Hill factory. These new batteries will use less of the rare earth material cobalt and feature a single common cell design that can be configured more efficiently for higher energy density and a smaller space than current GM batteries, Barra said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Battery Resourcers raises $20M to commercialize its recycling-plus-manufacturing operations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/embed/#?secret=f1snKyPiyI" data-secret="f1snKyPiyI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This versatility means we can put more battery power into a wider variety of vehicles, and at a better price for customers,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;It&#8217;s truly a revolution in electric vehicle technology that will help democratize EV ownership for millions of customers, which will change lives and change the world.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">GM has used LG Chem as a lithium-ion and electronics supplier for at least a decade. The companies began working together in 2009. That relationship deepened as GM developed and then launched the Chevy Bolt EV. In 2019, GM and LG Chem formed a joint venture to mass produce battery cells as the automaker began to shift toward more electric vehicles. The two companies said at the time that they would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/05/gm-lg-chem-to-invest-2-3-billion-to-in-ev-battery-joint-venture/">invest up to a total of $2.3 billion</a> into the new joint venture and establish a battery cell assembly plant on a greenfield manufacturing site in the Lordstown area of Northeast Ohio that will create more than 1,100 new jobs.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Steel construction began in July 2020 on the Ultium Cells LLC battery cell manufacturing facility in Lordstown, a nearly 3-million-square-foot factory that will mass produce Ultium battery cells and packs. The Lordstown factory will be able to produce 30 gigawatts hours of capacity annually.</p>

<p>The batteries produced at the Lordstown factory, along with GM&#8217;s underlying electric architecture, will be used in a broad range of products across its Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands, as well as the Cruise Origin autonomous shuttle that was revealed in January 2020. The Cadillac Lyriq EV flagship and an all-electric GMC Hummer, which will be revealed this fall and go into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, will use the Ultium battery system. GM plans to reveal the Lyriq at a virtual event August 6.</p>
<p>This modular architecture, called “Ultium,” (same as the battery) will be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front, rear and all-wheel drive configurations. At the heart of the new modular architecture will be the large-format pouch battery cells manufactured at this new factory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation platform UiPath <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">filed its first S-1/A</a> this week, setting an initial price range for its shares. The numbers were impressive, if slightly disappointing because what UiPath indicated in terms of its potential IPO value was a lower valuation than it earned during its final private fundraising. It&#8217;s hard to say that a company looking to go public at a valuation north of $25 billion is a letdown, but compared to preceding levels of hype, the numbers were a bit of a shock.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Here at The Exchange, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">we wondered</a> if the somewhat slack news regarding UiPath&#8217;s potential IPO valuation was a warning to late-stage investors; the number of unicorns being minted or repriced higher feels higher than ever, and late-stage money has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">never been more active in the venture-backed startup world</a> than it has been recently.</p>
<p>If UiPath were about to eat about $10 billion in worth to go public, it wouldn&#8217;t be the best indicator of how some of those late-stage bets will perform.</p>

And those numbers are very interesting, so much so that The Exchange is now generally expecting UiPath to target a higher price interval before it debuts.</p>
<p>That should either limit or close its private/public valuation gap, and, we imagine, lower a few investors&#8217; blood pressure. Let&#8217;s look at the numbers.</p>
<h2>UiPath&#8217;s fascinating 2020</h2>
<p>The top-line numbers for UiPath&#8217;s 2020 are impressive. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">we&#8217;ve discussed</a>, the company grew its revenues from $336.2 million in 2019 to $607.6 million in 2020, while boosting its gross profit margin by 7 percentage points to 89% last year. That&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>And it improved its net margins from -155% in 2019 to just -15% in 2020. The company&#8217;s rapid growth, improving revenue quality and extreme deficit reduction were among the reasons it was a bit surprising to see its estimated public-market value come in so far underneath its final private price.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s dig into the company&#8217;s quarterly results &#8212; a big thanks to the reader who sent us in this direction &#8212; to get a clearer picture of UiPath. Here&#8217;s the data:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.level.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that aims to give companies a more flexible way to offer benefits to employees, has raised $27 million in a Series A funding round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khosla Ventures</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operator Collective</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and leading angels also participated in the financing, along with previous backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Round Capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was reportedly raised at a “nine-figure” valuation, but the company did not provide more specifics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2018, New York City-based Level says it’s “rebuilding insurance from the ground up” via flexible networks and real-time claims with the goal of helping employers and employees get the most out of their benefit dollars. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers can customize plans to do things like offer 100% coverage across treatments. The company also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">touts the ability to process claims in four hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s lightning fast when compared to 30- to 60-day claims often processed by traditional payers,” said Founder and CEO Paul Aaron, who was one of the first employees at Square, led the network team at Oscar Health and is an inventor of several patents in the payments space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level first launched</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">employer-sponsored dental</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits in the summer of 2019 and started serving its first beta customers that fall. It also now offers vision plans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has more than 10,000 members from companies such as Intercom, Udemy, KeepTruckin and Thistle that have paid for care via its platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Insurance is confusing and often feels unfair. Networks restrict where you can go, billing takes weeks and you always seem to owe more than you expect,” Aaron said. “We believe paying with insurance should be as easy as any other purchase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level says it is taking a full-stack approach and building end-to-end tools, from automated underwriting to real-time benefit analytics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to launch </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new insurance product aimed at “helping smaller businesses offer bigger benefits” that typically only enterprises have the ability to offer. The company also aims to help employers get money back for any unused benefits after paying a fixed amount each month. Ultimately, the goal is to be able to offer a full suite of products that will allow companies of all sizes &#8212; from two employees to 20,000 &#8212; provide better benefits for their teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level claims that its self-insured dental and vision products let companies offer more coverage to their teams while often cutting nearly 20% from their benefits budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Employers already spend so much money on benefits, and neither they nor their teams get enough out of it,” said Jana Messerschmidt from Lightspeed Venture Partners, in a written statement. “Businesses of all sizes need to compete for talent with innovative benefits that help people get more from their paychecks. Level offers a far superior employee experience, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re getting bang for your buck.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Khosla&#8217;s Samir Kaul said he believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level can do for insurance and benefits &#8220;what Square Cash did for person-to-person payments.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investor </span><a href="https://level.com/blog/first-round-offers-better-dental-coverage-while-saving"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Round Capital claims to have saved 47%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by switching from fully insured to Level. And, </span><a href="https://level.com/blog/thistle-saved-41-on-dental-benefits-with-level"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thistle says it saw 41% in savings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by switching to Level. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. It was yet another busy week, but that just means we had a great time putting the show together and recording it. Honestly, we had a lot of fun this week, and we hope you crack a smile while we dig through the latest as a team.</p>
<p>Ready? Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Coinbase direct listing! Here are our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">notes on its S-1</a>, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">direct listing reference price</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">its results</a>. And we even wrote about the impact that it might have on other startup verticals!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/5-questions-about-grabs-epic-spac-investor-deck/">Grab&#8217;s impending SPAC</a>! As it turns out, Natasha loves SPACs now, and even Danny and Alex had very little to say that was rude about this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1381995585591513088">Degreed became a unicorn,</a> proving yet again that education for the enterprise is a booming sub-sector.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">Outschool also became an edtech unicorn</a>, thanks to a new round led by Coatue and everyone&#8217;s rich cousin, Tiger Global. The conversation soon devolved into how Tiger Global is impacting the broader VC ecosystem, thanks to a fantastic analysis piece that you have to read<a href="https://randle.substack.com/p/playing-different-games"> here. </a></li>
<li>Papa <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/2137375/">raised $60 million</a>, also from Tiger Global. What do you call tech aimed at old folks? Don&#8217;t call it elder tech, we have a brand new phrase in store. Let&#8217;s see if it catches on.</li>
<li>AI chips! Danny talks the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2021/04/14/ai-chip-startup-groq-founded-by-ex-googlers-raises-300-million-to-power-autonomous-vehicles-and-data-centers/?sh=10fc9bbd65e3">through grokking Groq</a>, so that we can talk about TPUs without losing our minds. He&#8217;s a good egg.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/slice-series-d/">Slice raised more money</a>. Not from Tiger Global. We have good things to say about it.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google&#8217;s historical collection of location data has got it into hot water in Australia where a case brought by the country&#8217;s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has led to a federal court ruling that the tech giant misled consumers by operating a confusing dual-layer of location settings in what the regulator describes as a &#8220;world-first enforcement action&#8221;.</p>
<p>The case relates to personal location data collected by Google through Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google-misled-consumers-about-the-collection-and-use-of-location-data">ACCC</a>, the court ruled that &#8220;when consumers created a new Google Account during the initial set-up process of their Android device, Google misrepresented that the ‘Location History’ setting was the only Google Account setting that affected whether Google collected, kept or used personally identifiable data about their location&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In fact, another Google Account setting titled ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ also enabled Google to collect, store and use personally identifiable location data when it was turned on, and that setting was turned on by default,&#8221; it wrote.</p>
<p>The Court also ruled that Google misled consumers when they later accessed the ‘Location History’ setting on their Android device during the same time period to turn that setting off because it did not inform them that by leaving the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting switched on, Google would continue to collect, store and use their personally identifiable location data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similarly, between 9 March 2017 and 29 November 2018, when consumers later accessed the ‘Web &amp; App Activity’ setting on their Android device, they were misled because Google did not inform them that the setting was relevant to the collection of personal location data,&#8221; the ACCC added.</p>
<p>Similar complaints about Google&#8217;s location data processing being deceptive &#8212; and allegations that it uses manipulative tactics in order to keep tracking web users’ locations for ad-targeting purposes &#8212; have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/google-faces-gdpr-complaint-over-deceptive-location-tracking/">raised by consumer agencies in Europe</a> for years. And in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">February 2020</a> the company&#8217;s lead data regulator in the region finally opened an investigation. However, that probe remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Whereas the ACCC said today that it will be seeking &#8220;declarations, pecuniary penalties, publications orders, and compliance orders&#8221; following the federal court ruling. Although it added that the specifics of its enforcement action will be determined &#8220;at a later date&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not clear exactly when Google will be hit with an order &#8212; nor how large a fine it might face.</p>

<p>The tech giant may also seek to appeal the court ruling.</p>
<p>Google said today it&#8217;s reviewing its legal options and considering a &#8220;possible appeal&#8221; &#8212; highlighting the fact the Court did not agree wholesale with the ACCC&#8217;s case because it dismissed some of the allegations (related to certain statements Google made about the methods by which consumers could prevent it from collecting and using their location data, and the purposes for which personal location data was being used by Google).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Google&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>The court rejected many of the ACCC’s broad claims. We disagree with the remaining findings and are currently reviewing our options, including a possible appeal. We provide robust controls for location data and are always looking to do more &#8212; for example we recently introduced auto delete options for Location History, making it even easier to control your data.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mountain View denies doing anything wrong in how it configures location settings &#8212; while simultaneously claiming it&#8217;s always looking to improve the controls it offers its users &#8212; Google&#8217;s settings and defaults have, nonetheless, got it into hot water with regulators before.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">Back in 2019</a> France&#8217;s data watchdog, the CNIL, fined it $57 million over a number of transparency and consent failures under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation. That remains the largest GDPR penalty issued to a tech giant since the regulation came into force a little less than three years ago &#8212; although France has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">more recently</a> sanctioned Google $120 million under different EU laws for dropping tracking cookies without consent.</p>
<p>Australia, meanwhile, has forged ahead with passing legislation this year that directly targets the market power of Google (and Facebook) &#8212; passing a mandatory news media bargaining code in <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">February</a> which aims to address the power imbalance between platform giants and publishers around the reuse of journalism content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has made telemedicine video visits in the U.S. almost commonplace, but in Latin America, where broadband isn’t widely available, 1Doc3 is using text and chat to provide access to care. Today, the Colombia-based company announced a $3 million pre-Series A led by MatterScale Ventures and Kayyak Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m on a nice MacBook for this interview, but that’s not the case of most people in LatAm,” said Javier Cardona, co-founder and CEO of 1Doc3. The company’s name is a play on the phonetics of 1, 2, 3 in Spanish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching your primary care doctor when you’re not feeling well is getting harder and harder, and 1Doc3 aims to solve that problem in LatAm by offering a telemedicine platform powered by AI that does symptom assessment, triage and pre-diagnosis before connecting the patient to a doctor.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 97% of our consultations, you’re connected to a doctor in a matter of minutes,” Cardona said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the doctor, the patient can also get their prescriptions delivered to their home through 1Doc3. The startup, like others in the space, is trying to close the loop so patients can get care quickly without having to leave their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Colombia, the company already has operations in Mexico and plans to use part of the funding to expand further in the region as well as building out a marketing and sales team, which it hasn’t had thus far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Doc3 reaches customers directly and by establishing corporate partnerships where the companies themselves pay for their employees’ medical care through the startup. One of Cardona’s goals is to bring the unit economics down so that smaller businesses can also afford 1Doc3, which for corporates, now charges between $3-4 a month/employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For big companies, the money isn’t an issue, but our region is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses,” Cardona said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which was founded in 2013 and was a finalist in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/1doc3-at-the-finals-of-startup-battlefield-latin-america-2018/">TechCrunch’s Latin American Battlefield</a> in 2018, experienced massive growth in 2020, going from 2,500 to 35,000 consultations per month from February to December 2020, respectively, which led the company to be cashflow positive last year. In March of 2021, the company had $120,000 in MRR.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many startups, the jolt to found 1Doc3 came from a personal experience faced by the founder.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was in Tanzania I had a medical need and I was definitely not going to go to a doctor in Tanzania, and I couldn’t reach any doctor online, not even in the U.S., and I became a little obsessed with this problem,” said Cardona, who was working in the Middle East and Africa at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round brings the total raised by 1Doc3 to $5 million. Other investors that participated in the round include Swanhill Capital, Simma Capital and existing investors The Venture City, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">EWA capital (previously Mountain Nazca Colombia) and Startup Health.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think cyberattacks are scary, what if those attacks were directed at your cardiac pacemaker? Medtronic, a medical device company, has been in </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/medical-device-maker-medtronic-finally-fixes-its-hackable-pacemaker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hot water over the last couple of years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because its pacemakers were getting hacked through their internet-based software updating systems. But in a new partnership with </span><a href="https://www.sternumiot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an IoT cybersecurity startup based in Israel, Medtronic has focused on resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was not with the medical devices themselves, but with the remote systems used to update the devices. Medtronic’s previous solution was to disconnect the devices from the internet, which in and of itself can cause other issues to arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medtronic was looking for a long-term solution that can help them with future developments,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natali Tshuva, Sternum’s founder and CEO. The company has already secured about 100,000 Medtronic devices.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum’s solution allows medical devices to protect themselves in real time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s this endless race against vulnerability, so when a company discovers a vulnerability, they need to issue an update, but updating can be very difficult in the medical space, and until the update happens, the devices are vulnerable,&#8221; Tshuva told TechCrunch. &#8220;Therefore, we created an autonomous security that operates from within the device that can protect it without the need to update and patch vulnerabilities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is easier to protect new devices than to go back and protect legacy devices. Over the years hackers have gotten more and more sophisticated, so medical device companies have had to figure out how to protect the devices that are already out there.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market already has millions — perhaps billions — of medical devices connected, and that could be a security and management nightmare,” Tshuva added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to potentially doing harm to an individual, hackers have been taking advantage of device vulnerability as the gateway of choice into a hospital’s network, possibly causing a breach that can affect many more people. Tshuva explained that hospital networks are secured from the inside out, but devices that connect to the networks but are not protected can create a way in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, health systems have been known to experience the most data breaches out of any sector, accounting for 79% of all reported breaches in 2020. And in the first 10 months of last year, we saw a 45% increase in cyberattacks on health systems, according to data by </span><a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-accounts-for-79-of-all-reported-breaches-attacks-rise-45"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health IT Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Sternum’s partnership with Medtronic, the company also launched this week an IoT platform that allows, “devices to protect themselves, even when they are not connected to the internet,” Tshuva said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sternum, which has raised about $10 million to date, also offers cybersecurity for IoT devices outside of healthcare, and, according to Tshuva, the company focuses on areas that are “mission-critical.” Examples include railroad infrastructure sensors and management systems, and power grids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tshuva, who grew up in Israel, holds a master’s in computer science and worked for the Israeli Defense Force&#8217;s 8200 unit — similar to the U.S.’s National Security Alliance — said she always wanted to make an impact in the medical field. “I looked to combine the medical space with my life, and I realized I could have an impact on remote care devices,” she said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is to be sued in Europe over the major leak of user data that dates back to 2019 but which only<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/answers-being-sought-from-facebook-over-latest-data-breach/"> came to light recently</a> after information on more than 533 million accounts was found posted for free download on a hacker forum.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/facebook/">Digital Rights Ireland</a> (DRI) announced it&#8217;s commencing a &#8220;mass action&#8221; to sue Facebook, citing the right to monetary compensation for breaches of personal data that&#8217;s set out in the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Article 82 of the GDPR provides for a &#8220;right to compensation and liability&#8221; for those affected by violations of the law. Since the regulation came into force, in May 2018, related civil litigation has been on the rise in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Ireland-based digital rights group is urging Facebook users who live in the European Union or European Economic Area to check whether their data was breached &#8212; via the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">haveibeenpwned</a> website (which lets you check by email address or mobile number) &#8212; and sign up to join the case if so.</p>
<p>Information leaked via the breach includes Facebook IDs, location, mobile phone numbers, email address, relationship status and employer.</p>
<p>Facebook has been contacted for comment on the litigation. <strong>Update:</strong> A Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand people&#8217;s concerns, which is why we continue to strengthen our systems to make scraping from Facebook without our permission more difficult and go after the people behind it. As LinkedIn and Clubhouse have shown, no company can completely eliminate scraping or prevent data sets like these from appearing. That&#8217;s why we devote substantial resources to combat it and will continue to build out our capabilities to help stay ahead of this challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s European headquarters is located in Ireland &#8212; and earlier this week the national data watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ireland-opens-gdpr-investigation-into-facebook-leak/">opened an investigation</a>, under EU and Irish data protection laws.</p>
<p>A mechanism in the GDPR for simplifying investigation of cross-border cases means Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) is Facebook&#8217;s lead data regulator in the EU. However it has been criticized over its handling of and approach to GDPR complaints and investigations &#8212; including the length of time it&#8217;s taking to issue decisions on major cross-border cases. And this is particularly true for Facebook.</p>
<p>With the three-year anniversary of the GDPR fast approaching, the DPC has multiple open investigations into various aspects of Facebook&#8217;s business but has yet to issue a single decision against the company.</p>
<p>(The closest it&#8217;s come is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">preliminary suspension order</a> issued last year, in relation to Facebook&#8217;s EU to U.S. data transfers. However, that complaint long predates GDPR; and Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">immediately filed to block the order</a> via the courts. A resolution <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">is expected later this year</a> after the litigant filed his own judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s processes.)</p>
<p>Since May 2018 the EU&#8217;s data protection regime has &#8212; at least on paper &#8212; baked in fines of up to 4% of a company&#8217;s global annual turnover for the most serious violations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/embed/#?secret=WCCD9ObAJb" data-secret="WCCD9ObAJb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Again, though, the sole GDPR fine issued to date by the DPC against a tech giant (Twitter) is very far off that theoretical maximum. Last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">December</a> the regulator announced a €450,000 (~$547,000) sanction against Twitter &#8212; which works out to around just 0.1% of the company&#8217;s full-year revenue.</p>
<p>That penalty was also for a data breach &#8212; but one which, unlike the Facebook leak, <em>had</em> been publicly disclosed when Twitter found it in 2019. So Facebook&#8217;s failure to disclose the vulnerability it discovered and claims it fixed by September 2019, which led to the leak of 533 million accounts now, suggests it <em>should</em> face a higher sanction from the DPC than Twitter received.</p>
<p>However, even if Facebook ends up with a more substantial GDPR penalty for this breach the watchdog&#8217;s caseload backlog and plodding procedural pace makes it hard to envisage a swift resolution to an investigation that&#8217;s only a few days old.</p>
<p>Judging by past performance it&#8217;ll be years before the DPC decides on this 2019 Facebook leak &#8212; which likely explains why the DRI sees value in instigating class action-style litigation in parallel to the regulatory investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compensation is not the only thing that makes this mass action worth joining. It is important to send a message to large data controllers that they must comply with the law and that there is a cost to them if they do not,&#8221; DRI writes on its <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/facebook/">website</a>.</p>
<p>It also submitted a complaint about the Facebook breach to the DPC <a href="https://www.digitalrights.ie/complaint-to-dpc-in-relation-to-facebook-data-dump-breach/">earlier this month</a>, writing then that it was &#8220;also consulting with its legal advisors on other options including a mass action for damages in the Irish Courts&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the GDPR enforcement gap is creating a growing opportunity for litigation funders to step in in Europe and take a punt on suing for data-related compensation damages &#8212; with a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/oracle-and-salesforce-hit-with-gdpr-class-action-lawsuits-over-cookie-tracking-consent/">other mass actions announced last year</a>.</p>
<p>In the case of DRI its focus is evidently on seeking to ensure that digital rights are upheld. But it told <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2021/0416/1210188-facebook-data-case/">RTE</a> that it believes compensation claims which force tech giants to pay money to users whose privacy rights have been violated is the best way to make them legally compliant.</p>
<p>Facebook, meanwhile, has sought to play down the breach it failed to disclose in 2019 &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s &#8220;old data&#8221; &#8212; a deflection that ignores the fact that people&#8217;s dates of birth don&#8217;t change (nor do most people routinely change their mobile number or email address).</p>
<p>Plenty of the &#8220;old&#8221; data exposed in this latest massive Facebook leak will be very handy for spammers and fraudsters to target Facebook users &#8212; and also now for litigators to target Facebook for data-related damages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pakistan has temporarily blocked several social media services in the South Asian nation, according to users and a government-issued notice reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In an order titled “Complete Blocking of Social Media Platforms,” the Pakistani government ordered Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to block social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Telegram from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. local time (06.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. GMT) Friday.</p>
<p>The move comes as Pakistan looks to crack down against a violent terrorist group and prevent troublemakers from disrupting Friday prayer congregations following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-deploys-paramilitary-forces-quell-deadly-islamist-protests-2021-04-14/">days of violent protests</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this week Pakistan banned the Islamist group Tehrik-i-Labaik Pakistan after arresting its leader, which prompted protests, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur based in Pakistan told TechCrunch that even though the order is supposed to expire at 3 p.m. local time, similar past moves by the government suggests that the disruption will likely last longer.</p>

<p>Though Pakistan, like its neighbor India, has temporarily cut phone call access in the nation in the past, this is the first time Islamabad has issued a blanket ban on social media in the country.</p>
<p>Pakistan has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/pakistan-blocks-tiktok-again-over-immoral-and-objectionable-videos/">explored ways to assume more control</a> over content on digital services operating in the country in recent years.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocado</a>, the U.K. online grocer that has been making strides reselling its technology to other grocery companies to help them build and run their own online ordering and delivery operations, is making an investment today into what it believes will be the next chapter of how that business will grow: it is <a href="https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/OCDO/ocado-invests-in-oxbotica-iw123prduuvbh2j.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking a £10 million ($13.8 million) stake in Oxbotica</a>, a U.K. startup that develops autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>Ocado is treating this as a strategic investment to develop AI-powered, self-driving systems that will work across its operations, from vehicles within and around its packing warehouses through to the last-mile vehicles that deliver grocery orders to people&#8217;s homes. It says it expects the first products to come out of this deal &#8212; most likely in closed environments like warehouses rather the less structured prospect of open streets &#8212; to be online in two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not constraining ourselves to work in any one use case,&#8221; said Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology at Ocado, in an interview. But to roll out autonomous systems everywhere, he added, &#8220;we realize there are areas where we will need regulatory compliance,&#8221; among other factors. The deal is nonexclusive, and both can work with other partners if they choose, the companies confirmed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment is coming as an extension to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/oxbotica-raises-47m-to-deploy-its-autonomous-vehicle-software-in-industrial-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxbotica&#8217;s Series B</a> that it announced in January, bringing the total size of the round &#8212; which was led by bp ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant <a href="http://bp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bp</a>, and also included BGF, safety equipment maker Halma, pension fund HostPlus, IP Group, Tencent, Venture Science and funds advised by Doxa Partners &#8212; to over $60 million. Oxbotica has not disclosed valuation but Paul Newman, co-founder and CTO of Oxbotica, confirmed in an interview that the valuation went up with this latest investment.</p>

<p>The timing of the news is very interesting. It comes just one day (less than 24 hours in fact) after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/walmart-helps-push-cruises-latest-investment-round-to-2-75b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart in the U.S. took a stake in Cruise</a>, another autonomous tech company, as part of recent $2.75 billion monster round.</p>
<p>Walmart, <a href="https://corporate.asda.com/newsroom/2021/02/16/completion-of-acquisition-of-asda-by-the-issa-brothers-and-tdr-capital-ltd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until February</a>, owned one of Ocado&#8217;s big competitors in the U.K., ASDA; and Ocado has made its first forays into the U.S., by way of its deal to power <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/kroger-launches-its-first-ocado-powered-shed-a-massive-robot-filled-fulfillment-center-in-ohio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kroger&#8217;s online grocery business</a>, which went live this week, too. So it seems that competition between these two is heating up on the food front.</p>
<p>More generally, there has been a huge surge in the world of online grocery order and delivery services in the last year. Earlier movers like online-only Ocado, Tesco in the U.K. (which owns both physical stores and online networks) and Instacart in the U.S. have seen record demand, but they have also been joined by a lot of competition from well-capitalized newer entrants also keen to seize that opportunity, and bringing different approaches (next-hour delivery, smaller baskets, specific products) to do so.</p>
<p>In Ocado&#8217;s home patch of Europe, other big names looking to extend outside of their home turf include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/norways-kolonial-rebrands-as-oda-bags-265m-on-a-900m-valuation-to-grow-its-online-grocery-delivery-business-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oda</a> (formerly Kolonial); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic (which in March bagged $230 million in funding); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24, it raised $100 million); <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Picnic</a> out of the Netherlands (which has yet to announce any recent funding but it feels like it’s only a matter of time, given it too has <a href="https://ecommercenews.eu/picnic-doubles-revenue-eyes-expansion-to-france/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly laid out international ambitions</a>). Even Ocado has <a href="http://techmeme.com/200612/p23#a200612p23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised huge amounts of money</a> to pursue its own international ambitions. And that&#8217;s before you consider the nearly dozens of next-hour, smaller grocery delivery plays.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everli, the European marketplace for online grocery shopping, bags $100M Series C&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/embed/#?secret=o8EwvhkFiu" data-secret="o8EwvhkFiu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A lot of these companies will have had a big year last year, not least because of the pandemic and how it drove many people to stay at home, and stay away from places where they might catch and spread the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>But now, the big question will be how that market will look in the future as people go back to &#8220;normal&#8221; life.</p>
<p>As we pointed out earlier this week, Ocado has already laid out how demand is lower, although still higher than pre-pandemic times. And indeed, the new-new normal (if we can call it that) may well see the competitive landscape tighten some more.</p>
<p>That could also be one reason why companies like Ocado are putting more money into working on what might be the next generation of services: one more efficient and run purely (or at least mostly) on technology.</p>
<p>The rationale of forking out big for autonomous tech, which is still largely untested and very, very expensive technology, to save money is a long-term play. Logistics today accounts for some 10% of the total cost of a grocery delivery operation. But that figure goes up when there is peak demand or anything that disrupts regularly scheduled services.</p>
<p>My guess is also that with all of the subsidized services that are flying about right now, where you see free deliveries or discounts on groceries to encourage new business &#8212; a result of the market getting so competitive &#8212; those logistics have bled into being an even bigger cost.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise to see the biggest players in this space looking at ways that it might leverage advances in technology to cut those costs and speed up how those operations work, even if it&#8217;s just a promise of discounts in years, not weeks. Of course, investors might see it otherwise if that doesn&#8217;t go to plan.</p>
<p>In addition to this collaboration with Oxbotica, Ocado said it will be looking to make more investments and/or partnerships as it grows and develops its autonomous vehicle capabilities. While this is the company&#8217;s first investment into Oxbotica, it has made a number of investments into other startups, and collaborated to work on the next stage of technology. This has included research to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/ocado-is-developing-robot-hands-that-wont-bruise-bananas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a robotic arm</a> &#8212; robotic pickers is something it will be introducing soon &#8212; as well as the <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/investors/ocado-acquires-kindred-systems-and-haddington-dynamics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent acquisition of two robotics companies</a>, Kindred and Haddington, for $262 million; and investments in robotics startups <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2019/ocado-acquires-minority-stake-robotics-start-karakuri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karakuri</a> and <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/media/press-releases/year/2020/ocado-group-acquires-minority-stake-robotics-start-myrmex-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myrmex</a>; and more.</p>
<p>Notably, Oxbotica and Ocado are not strangers. They started to work together on a delivery pilot back in 2017. You can see a video of how that delivery service looks here:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/JklP055_lFs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;This is an excellent opportunity for Oxbotica and Ocado to strengthen our partnership, sharing our vision for the future of autonomy,&#8221; said Newman, in a statement. &#8220;By combining both companies&#8217; cutting-edge knowledge and resources, we hope to bring our Universal Autonomy vision to life and continue to solve some of the world&#8217;s most complex autonomy challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as with all self-driving technology &#8212; incredibly complex and full of regulatory and safety hurdles &#8212; we are still fairly far from full commercial systems that actually remove people from the equation completely.</p>

<p>&#8220;For both regulatory and complexity reasons, Ocado expects that the development of vehicles that operate in low-speed urban areas or in restricted access areas, such as inside its CFC buildings or within its CFC yards, may become a reality sooner than fully-autonomous deliveries to consumers&#8217; homes,&#8221; Ocado notes in its statement on the deal. &#8220;However, all aspects of autonomous vehicle development will be within the scope of this collaboration. Ocado expects to see the first prototypes of some early use cases for autonomous vehicles within two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Newman noted that while on-street self-driving might still be some years away, it&#8217;s less of a moonshot concept today than it used to be, and that Oxbotica is on the road to it already. &#8220;You can get to the moon in stages,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz lifted the final veil Thursday on its flagship EQS sedan after weeks of teasers, announcements and even a pre-production drive in which TechCrunch participated. The company peeled off the camouflage of the EQS — the electric counterpart to the Mercedes S Class — and revealed an ultra-luxury and tech-centric sedan.</p>
<p>The exterior is getting much of the attention today; but it&#8217;s all of the tech that got ours, from the microsleep warning system and 56-inch hyperscreen to the monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. There is even a new fragrance called No.6 MOOD Linen and is described as &#8220;carried by the green note of a fig and linen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not one thing because this car is 100 things,&#8221; Ola Källenius, the chairman of the board of management of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz, told TechCrunch in an interview the morning of the EQS launch. &#8220;And it&#8217;s those 100 little things that make the difference and that makes a Mercedes a Mercedes.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mercedes is betting that the tech, coupled with performance and design, will attract buyers. This is a high-stakes game for Mercedes. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America that will erase any memory of its troubled — and now nixed — launch of the EQC crossover in the United States.</p>
<h2>Quick nuts and bolts</h2>
<p>Before diving into the all the techy bells and whistles, here are the basics. The EQS is the first all-electric luxury sedan under the automaker&#8217;s new EQ brand. The first models being introduced to the U.S. market will be the EQS 450+ with 329 hp and the EQS 580 4MATIC with 516 hp. Mercedes didn&#8217;t share the price of these models. It did provide a bevy of other details on its performance, design and range.</p>
<p>The EQS that will be available in the U.S. has a length that is a skosh over 17 feet, precisely 205.4 inches long, which is the Goldilocks equivalent to the Mercedes S Class variants.</p>

<p>The vehicle has a co-efficient drag of 0.202, which sneaks below Tesla&#8217;s Model S and the upcoming Lucid Motors Air, making its the most aerodynamic production car in the world. All EQS models have an electric powertrain at the rear axle. The EQS 580 4MATIC also has an electric powertrain at the front axle, giving it that all-wheel drive capability. The EQS generates between 329 hp and 516 hp, depending on the variant. Mercedes said a performance version is being planned that will have up to 630 hp. Both the EQS 450+ and the EQS 580 4MATIC have a top speed of 130 miles per hour. The EQS 450+ will have a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 5.5 seconds, while its more powerful sibling will be able to achieve that speed in 4.1 seconds.</p>
<p>The EQS will have two possible batteries to choose from, although Mercedes has only released details of one. The heftiest configuration of the EQS has a battery with 107.8 kWh of usable energy content that can travel up 478 miles on a single charge under the European WLTP estimates. The EPA estimates, which tend to be stricter, will likely fall below that figure.</p>
<p>The vehicle can be charged with up to 200 kW at fast charging stations with direct current, according to Mercedes. At home or at public charging stations, the EQS can be charged with AC using the on-board charger.</p>
<p>Now on to some of the technological highlights within the vehicle.</p>
<h2>ADAS</h2>
<p>There are loads of driver assistance features in the EQS, which are supported by a variety of sensors such as ultrasound, camera, radar and lidar that are integrated into the vehicle. Adaptive cruise, the ability to adjust the acceleration behavior, lane detection and automatic lane changes as well as steering assist helps the driver follow the driving lane at speeds up to 130 mph are some of the ADAS features. The system also recognizes signposted speed limits, overhead frameworks and signs at construction zones, and includes warnings about running a stop sign or a red light.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the microsleep warning function, which becomes active once the vehicle reaches speeds over 12 mph. This feature works by analyzing the driver&#8217;s eyelid movements through a camera on the driver&#8217;s display, which is only available with MBUX Hyperscreen.</p>

<p>There are several active assist features that will intervene if needed. An active blind spot assist can give a visual warning of potential lateral collisions in a speed range from around 6 mph to 124 mph. However, if the driver ignores the warnings and still initiates a lane change, the system can take corrective action by one-sided braking intervention at the last moment if the speed exceeds 19 mph, Mercedes said. The feature remains active even while parked and will warn against exiting if a vehicle or cyclist is passing nearby.</p>
<p>There is also an active emergency stop assist feature that will brake the vehicle to a standstill in its own lane if the sensors and software recognizes that the driver is no longer responding to the traffic situation for a longer period. The brakes are not suddenly applied. If the driver is unresponsive, it begins with an acoustic warning and a visual warning appears in the instrument cluster. Those warnings continue as the vehicle starts to slowly decelerate. Hazard lights are activated and the driver&#8217;s seatbelt is briefly tensioned as a haptic warning. The final step is what Mercedes describes as a &#8220;short, strong brake jolt&#8221; as an additional warning followed by the car decelerating to a standstill, with an optional single lane change if necessary.</p>
<p>Mercedes is also offering the option of DRIVE PILOT, which is an SAE Level 3 conditional automated driving system feature. This would allow hands-free driving. Regulations in Europe prevent that level of automation to be deployed in production vehicles on public roads. However, Källenius told media in Germany on Thursday that the company is on &#8220;on the verge of trying to certify the first volume production car Level 3 system in Germany in the second half of this year,&#8221; <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/mercedes-eqs-offer-hands-self-driving-tech">Automotive News Europe reported</a>.</p>

<h2>The car that learns</h2>
<p>Many of the technological gee-whiz doodads in the EQS tie back to an underlying AI that is designed to learn the driver&#8217;s behavior. That is achieved through software and a dizzying number of sensors. Mercedes said that depending on the equipment, the EQS will have up to 350 sensors that are used to record distances, speeds and accelerations, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver&#8217;s blink of an eye or the passengers&#8217; speech.</p>
<p>The sensors capture information, which is then processed by electronic control units (computers) and software algorithms then take over to make decisions. TechCrunch automotive reviewer Tamara Warren noticed the vehicle&#8217;s ability to learn her preference during a half day with the EQS.</p>
<p>Mercedes ran through a number of examples of how these sensors and software might work together, including an optional driving sound that is interactive and reacts to different parameters, such as position of the accelerator pedal, speed or recuperation.</p>
<p>The intuitive learning is mostly apparent through interactions with the MBUX infotainment system, which will proactively show the right functions for the user at the right time. Sensors pick up on change in the surroundings and user behavior and will react accordingly. Mercedes learned from data collected from the first-generation MBUX, which debuted in the 2019 Mercedes A Class, and found most of the use cases fall in the Navigation, Radio/Media and Telephone categories.</p>
<p>That user data informed how the second-generation MBUZ, and specifically the one in the EQS, is laid out. For instance, the navigation app is always in the center of the visual display unit.</p>

<p>The MBUX uses natural language processing and so drivers can always use their voice to launch a radio station or control the climate. But Mercedes is really pushing the EQS&#8217; intuitive learning capabilities. This means that as a driver uses the vehicle, items that might be typically buried in the menu will appear up front, or offered up depending on the time or even location of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;The car gets to know you as a person and your preferences and what you do,&#8221; said Källenius. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like it serves up the option that you want to do next, before you even think about it you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You get a pizza delivered before you even get hungry,&#8221; Källenius said, jokingly. &#8220;That&#8217;s phenomenal in terms of intuition.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Mercedes there are more than 20 other functions such as birthday reminders that are automatically offered with the help of artificial intelligence when they are relevant to the customer. These suggestion modules, which are displayed on the zero-layer interface, are called &#8220;Magic Modules.&#8221; Here is how it might work: if the driver always calls a particular friend or relative on the way home on certain evenings, the vehicle will deliver a suggestion regarding this particular call on this day of the week and at this time. A business card will appear with their contact information and &#8212; if this is stored &#8212; their photo, Mercedes said. All the suggestions from MBUX are coupled with the logged-in profile of the user. This means that if someone else drives the EQS on that same evening, with their own profile logged-in, this recommendation is not displayed.</p>
<p>If a driver always listens to a specific radio program on their commute home, this suggestion will be displayed, or if they regularly use the hot-stone massage, the system will automatically suggest the comfort function in colder temperatures.</p>
<p>This also applies to the vehicle&#8217;s driving functions. For example, the MBUX will remember if the driver has a steep driveway or passes over the same set of speed bumps entering their neighborhood. If the vehicle approaches that GPS position, the MBUX will suggest raising the chassis to offer more ground clearance.</p>
<h2>Health and wellness</h2>
<p>Remember those sensors? There&#8217;s a way for drivers to take it a step further and link their smartwatch — Mercedes-Benz vivoactive 3, the Mercedes-Benz Venu or another compatible Garmin — to the vehicle&#8217;s so-called energizing coach. This coach responds to the user&#8217;s behavior and will offer up one of several programs such as &#8220;freshness,&#8221; &#8220;warmth,&#8221; &#8220;vitality&#8221; or &#8220;joy&#8221; depending on the individual. Via the Mercedes me app, the smartwatch sends vital data of the wearer to the coach, including pulse rate, stress level and sleep quality. The pulse rate recorded by the integrated Garmin wearable is shown in the central display.</p>
<p>What does this all mean in practice? Depending on the user&#8217;s wants and the AI system&#8217;s understanding of what he or she wants, the lighting, climate, sound and seating might change. This is, of course, all integrated with the voice assistant &#8220;Hey Mercedes&#8221; so drivers can simply make a statement to trigger the program they want.</p>
<p>If the driver says &#8220;I am stressed,&#8221; the Joy program will be launched. If the driver says &#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; they are then prompted to take a break the Vitality program.</p>
<p>Mercedes S Class owners might already be familiar with these options, although the automaker notes that EQS builds on the system. There are now three new energizing nature programs called forest glade, sounds of the sea and summer rain, as well as training and tips options. Each program launches different and immersive sounds, created in consultation with the acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton. For instance, &#8220;forest glade&#8221; will deliver a combination of birdsong, rustling leaves and a gentle breeze. The program is rounded off by warm music soundscapes and subtle fragrance.</p>
<p>Sounds of the sea will produce soft music soundscapes, wave sounds and seagull sounds. Blasts of air from the air conditioning system completes the effect. Meanwhile &#8220;summer rain&#8221; offers up sounds of raindrops on leafy canopies, distant thunder, pattering rain and ambient music soundscapes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139541" style="width: 6585px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139541" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2139541 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg" alt="2022_Mercedes_EQS__64" width="6575" height="4383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg 6575w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__64.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6575px) 100vw, 6575px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2139541" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>For those long drives that require a break, Mercedes added a power nap feature. Once power nap is selected (and no, never when driving), the program runs through three phases: falling asleep, sleeping and waking up. The driver&#8217;s seat moves into a rest position, the side windows and panorama roof sunshade are closed and the air ionization is activated. Soothing sounds and the depiction of a starry sky on the central display support falling asleep, according to Mercedes. Once it is time to wake up, a soundscape is activated, a fragrance is deployed and a brief active massage and seat ventilation begins. The seat raises and the sunshade in the roof liner opens.</p>
<h2>Voice</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the &#8220;Hey Mercedes&#8221; voice assistant uses natural language processing and can handle an array of requests. Mercedes said the assistant can now do more, and certain actions such as accepting a phone call can be made without the activation keyword &#8220;Hey Mercedes.&#8221; The assistant can now explain vehicle functions.</p>
<p>The assistant can also recognize vehicle occupants by their voices. There is in fact individual microphones placed at each seating area within the vehicle. Once they have been learned, the assistant can access personal data and functions for that specific user.</p>
<p>The voice assistant in the EQS can also be operated from the rear, according to Mercedes.</p>
<p>These personal profiles are stored in the cloud as part of &#8220;Mercedes me.&#8221; That means the profiles can also be used in other Mercedes-Benz vehicles with the new MBUX generation. Security is built in and includes a PIN and then combines face and voice recognition to authenticate. This allows access to individual settings or verification of digital payment processes from the vehicle, the automaker said.</p>
<h2>Screens and entertainment</h2>
<p>Finally, yes the screens. All of the screens. The 56-inch hyperscreen gets the most attention, but there are screens throughout the EQS. What is important about them is how they communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The hyperscreen is actually three screens that sit under a common bonded glass cover and visually merge into one display. The driver display is 12.3 inches, the central display is 17.7 inches and front passenger display is 12.3 inches. The MBUX Hyperscreen is a touchscreen and also throws in haptic feedback and force feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes when I think about the first design and what we&#8217;ve actually done here, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Are we mad to try to create a one meter 41 centimeters curved bonded glass, one piece in the car,&#8221; said Källenius. &#8220;The physical piece in its own right — it&#8217;s a piece of technological art.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139465" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139465" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2139465 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg" alt="2022_Mercedes_EQS" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2022_Mercedes_EQS__55.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2139465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>A lot of attention was paid to the backseat because the EQS, like its S Class counterpart, is often used to chauffeur the owner. Mercedes won&#8217;t call this a rear-seat entertainment system and instead refers to it as a multi-seat entertainment system because everything is connected.</p>
<p>Källenius explained that if a driver wants the two rear passengers to watch a different movie, a simple drag and swipe motion on the main screen will throw that new programming back to the rear. The passengers can also throw movies from left to right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) has <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-releases-draft-legislation-to-protect-americans-personal-data-from-hostile-foreign-governments">proposed a draft bill</a> that would limit the types of information that could be bought and sold by tech companies abroad, and the countries it could be legally sold in. The legislation is imaginative and not highly specific, but it indicates growing concern at the federal level over the international data trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shady data brokers shouldn’t get rich selling Americans’ private data to foreign countries that could use it to threaten our national security,&#8221; said Sen. Wyden in a statement accompanying the bill. They probably shouldn&#8217;t get rich selling Americans&#8217; private data at all, but national security is a good way to grease the wheels.</p>
<p>The Protecting Americans&#8217; Data From Foreign Surveillance Act would be a first step toward categorizing and protecting consumer data as a commodity that&#8217;s traded on the global market. Right now there are few if any controls over what data specific to a person — buying habits, movements, political party — can be sold abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This means that, for instance, an American data broker could sell the preferred brands and home addresses of millions of Americans to, say, a Chinese bank doing investment research. Some of this trade is perfectly innocuous, even desirable in order to promote global commerce, but at what point does it become dangerous or exploitative?</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t any official definition of what should and shouldn&#8217;t be sold to whom, the way we limit sales of certain intellectual property or weapons. The proposed law would first direct the secretary of Commerce to identify the data we should be protecting and to whom it should be protected against.</p>
<p>The general shape of protected data would be that which &#8220;if exported by third parties, could harm U.S. national security.&#8221; The countries that would be barred from receiving it would be those with inadequate data protection and export controls, recent intelligence operations against the U.S. or laws that allow the government to compel such information to be handed over to them. Obviously this is aimed at the likes of China and Russia, though ironically the U.S. fits the bill pretty well itself.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A new Senate bill would create a US data protection agency&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gilliband-law-data-agency/embed/#?secret=VKULcBPjwC" data-secret="VKULcBPjwC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There would be exceptions for journalism and First Amendment-protected speech, and for encrypted data — for example storing encrypted messages on servers in one of the targeted countries. The law would also create penalties for executives &#8220;who knew or should have known&#8221; that their company was illegally exporting data, and creates pathways for people harmed or detained in a foreign country owing to illegally exported data. That might be if, say, another country used an American facial recognition service to spot, stop and arrest someone before they left.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a little woolly, it is — but that&#8217;s more or less on purpose. It is not for Congress to invent such definitions as are necessary for a law like this one; that duty falls to expert agencies, which must conduct studies and produce reports that Congress can refer to. This law represents the first handful of steps along those lines: getting the general shape of things straight and giving fair warning that certain classes of undesirable data commerce will soon be illegal — with an emphasis on executive responsibility, something that should make tech companies take notice.</p>
<p>The legislation would need to be sensitive to existing arrangements by which companies spread out data storage and processing for various economic and legal reasons. Free movement of data is to a certain extent necessary for globe-spanning businesses that must interact with one another constantly, and to hobble those established processes with red tape or fees might be disastrous to certain locales or businesses. Presumably this would all come up during the studies, but it serves to demonstrate that this is a very complex, not to say delicate, digital ecosystem the law would attempt to modify.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the early stages of this type of regulation, and this bill is just getting started in the legislative process, so expect a few months at the very least before we hear anything more on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has banned right-wing provocateur James O&#8217;Keefe, creator of political gotcha video producer Project Veritas, for violating its &#8220;platform manipulation and spam policy,&#8221; suggesting he was operating multiple accounts in an unsanctioned way. O&#8217;Keefe has already announced that he will sue the company for defamation.</p>
<p>The ban, or &#8220;permanent suspension&#8221; as Twitter calls it, occurred Thursday afternoon. A Twitter representative said the action followed the violation of rules prohibiting &#8220;operating fake accounts&#8221; and attempting to &#8220;artificially amplify or disrupt conversations through the use of multiple accounts,&#8221; as noted <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation">here</a>.</p>
<p>This suggests O&#8217;Keefe was banned for operating multiple accounts, outside the laissez-faire policy that lets people have a professional and a personal account, and that sort of thing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ssharp-eyed users noticed that O&#8217;Keefe&#8217;s last tweet unironically accused reporter Jesse Hicks of impersonation, including an image showing a partly redacted phone number supposedly belonging to Hicks. This too may have run afoul of Twitter&#8217;s rules about posting personal information, but Twitter declined to comment on this when I asked. (<strong>Update</strong>: The image was in fact redacted, I thought it was done by the person who took the screenshot but the first digits were removed in the original tweet.)</p>
<p>Supporters of O&#8217;Keefe say that the company removed his account as retribution for his most recent &#8220;exposé&#8221; involving surreptitious recordings of a CNN employee admitting the news organization has a political bias. (The person he was talking to had, impersonating a nurse, matched with him on Tinder.)</p>
<p>For his part O&#8217;Keefe said he would be suing Twitter for defamation over the allegation that he operated fake accounts. Chief Legal Officer Jered T. Ede told TechCrunch that &#8220;James O’Keefe has only one account. He does not have fake accounts. Twitter’s statement is simply false.&#8221;</p>
