										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take a dollop of machine learning, a handful of radar sensors and a market that is clamoring for autonomous cars not mowing down hordes of pedestrians, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a particularly frothy fundraising environment. Hot on the heels from the $10 million round <a href="https://spartanradar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spartan Radar</a> announced <a href="https://spartanradar.com/blog/spartan-radar-raises-10-million-in-seed-funding-to-advance-autonomous-vehicle-radar-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in August</a>, the company today announced it snagged another $15 million from investors led by <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Movers Lab</a>. Additional investors include 8VC and Mac VC.</p>
<p>Not half shabby for a company that didn&#8217;t exist two years ago &#8212; it was founded in 2020. The company is putting itself in the mix in the intersection between the car&#8217;s radar and its self-driving tech. It argues that the radar technology on current and next-generation autonomous vehicles (AV) is pretty decent, but that the car often doesn&#8217;t know what to make of what the radar &#8220;sees,&#8221; and ends up making mistakes in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The automotive industry&#8217;s pivot to lower levels of automation makes radar more attractive than lidar,&#8221; Spartan Radar founder and CEO Nathan Mintz maintains. &#8220;While showing lots of initial promise, lidar is failing to live up to all the hype, but the need for high-resolution systems hasn&#8217;t gone away. The processing power finally exists to utilize advanced algorithms like super-resolution in real time to make radar a far better option for automakers.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company calls its product Biomimetic Radar and claims that it can mimic <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human perception processes for enhanced focus and context. It says its algorithms dramatically speed up processing and reduce radar’s historic shortcomings, including lower resolution and false detections. This, in turn, clears the way for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems#ADAS_levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAS level 2</a> and beyond in terms of safety and commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The company’s software can be deployed on almost all existing radar systems, and while the company didn&#8217;t comment on any specific deals it has in the pipeline, the two rapid-fire funding rounds would suggest there are customers waiting in the wings.</span></p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we are seeing evidence that lidar-based systems can behave like the distracted drivers they were intended to replace. Spartan’s radar systems are a leap forward in autonomous vehicle technology, bringing AVs and ADAS systems to where they need to be for the needs of the industry today,” said David Siminoff, general partner at Prime Movers Lab, who will be joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>“After billions of dollars in investments and several AV companies going public, the industry is finally ready to move beyond R&amp;D to commercialize at scale in defined use-cases like last-mile delivery, trucking and robo-taxi. OEMs and AV developers need safe, robust sensor solutions that are ready to go to market next year and we&#8217;re prepared to meet that need,” Mintz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Ford has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">introduced</a> an F-100 Eluminator concept that upgrades the circa-1978 pickup truck with two of the company&#8217;s new Eluminator electric crate motor kit. The powerplants, taken from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Mustang Mach-E GT</a>Performance Edition, give the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#8217;t discuss performance benchmarks or range, but it&#8217;s safe to presume you could smoke some sports cars with that kind of power.</p>
<p>The truck has more customizations beyond the EV motors, including the vertical center-stack touchscreen from the Mach-E. You&#8217;ll also see custom aluminum Forgeline wheels, a billet aluminum dash from JJR Fabrication and avocado-tanned leather from MDM Upholstery. This may look like a classic truck, but it&#8217;s not appointed like one.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t buy this concept, as you might have guessed. Instead, Ford would rather you buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries, controllers and traction inverters. You&#8217;d only want to buy the motor right now if you have the resources to complete the rest of the puzzle yourself. This does, however, hint at a future where many beloved combustion engine cars can get a second life through an EV transplant.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Canada</a>, now Australia has found that controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens&#8217; facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service &#8212; which it sells to law enforcement agencies and others.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy">statement</a> today, Australia&#8217;s information commissioner and privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, said Clearview AI&#8217;s facial recognition tool breached the country&#8217;s Privacy Act 198<em>8 </em>by:</p>
<ul>
<li>collecting Australians’ sensitive information without consent</li>
<li>collecting personal information by unfair means</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to notify individuals of the collection of personal information</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to ensure that personal information it disclosed was accurate, having regard to the purpose of disclosure</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to implement practices, procedures and systems to ensure compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In what looks like a major win for privacy down under, the regulator has ordered Clearview to stop collecting facial biometrics and biometric templates from Australians; and to destroy all existing images and templates that it holds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) undertook a joint investigation into Clearview with the UK data protection agency, the Information Commission&#8217;s Office (IOC).</p>
<p>However the UK regulator has yet to announce any conclusions.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/clearview-statement/">statement</a> today &#8212; which possibly reads slightly flustered &#8212; the ICO said it is &#8220;considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action that may be appropriate under the UK data protection laws&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the ICO declined to elaborate further &#8212; such as on how long it will be thinking about maybe doing something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UK citizens should be hoping the regulator doesn&#8217;t take as long &#8220;considering&#8221; Clearview as it has chewing over (but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">failing to act against) adtech&#8217;s lawfulness problem</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other European regulators have already hit users of Clearview with sanctions&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sweden&#8217;s data watchdog slaps police for unlawful use of Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/embed/#?secret=GT1atsyXsB" data-secret="GT1atsyXsB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back on the other side of the world, the OAIC isn&#8217;t wasting any time acting against Clearview nor mincing its words.</p>
<p>In public comments on the OAIC&#8217;s decision (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11284/Commissioner-initiated-investigation-into-Clearview-AI,-Inc.-Privacy-2021-AICmr-54-14-October-2021.pdf">pdf</a>) finding Clearview breached Australian law, Falk said: &#8220;The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair. It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.&#8221;</p>
<p>“By its nature, this biometric identity information cannot be reissued or cancelled and may also be replicated and used for identity theft. Individuals featured in the database may also be at risk of misidentification,&#8221; she also said, adding: “These practices fall well short of Australians’ expectations for the protection of their personal information.”</p>
<p>The OAIC also found the privacy impacts of Clearview AI’s biometric system were &#8220;not necessary, legitimate and proportionate, having regard to any public interest benefits&#8221;.</p>
<p>“When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes,” said Falk.</p>
<p>“The indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.”</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s regulator said that between October 2019 and March 2020 Clearview AI provided trials of its tool to some local police forces &#8212; which conducted searches using facial images of individuals located in Australia.</p>
<p>The OAIC added that it is currently finalising an investigation into the Australian Federal Police’s trial use of the tech to decide whether the force complied with requirements under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code to assess and mitigate privacy risks. So it remains to be seen if local law enforcement will get a sanction.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sweden&#8217;s data protection watchdog warned the country&#8217;s cops over what it said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">unlawful use of Clearview&#8217;s tool</a> &#8212; issuing a €250,000 fine in that instance.</p>
<p>Returning to the OAIC, it said Clearview defended itself by arguing that the information it handled was not personal data &#8212; and that, as a company based in the US, it did not fall under the jurisdiction of Australia&#8217;s Privacy Act’s. Clearview also claimed to the regulator that it had stopped offering services to Australian law enforcement shortly after the OAIC’s investigation began.</p>
<p>However Falk dismissed Clearview&#8217;s arguments, saying she was satisfied it must comply with Australian law and that the information it handled was personal information covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>She also said the case reinforces the need for Australia to strengthen protections through a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/review-of-the-privacy-act">current review of the Privacy Act</a>, including restricting or prohibiting practices such as data scraping personal information from online platforms. And she added that the case raises<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> additional questions about whether online platforms are doing enough to prevent and detect scraping of personal data.</span></p>
<p>“Clearview AI’s activities in Australia involve the automated and repetitious collection of sensitive biometric information from Australians on a large scale, for profit. These transactions are fundamental to their commercial enterprise,” said Falk. “The company’s patent application also demonstrates the capability of the technology to be used for other purposes such as dating, retail, dispensing social benefits, and granting or denying access to a facility, venue or device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the OAIC&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will be appealing &#8212; sending this statement (below), attributed to Mark Love, BAL Lawyers, representing Clearview AI:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Clearview AI has gone to considerable lengths to co-operate with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. In doing so, Clearview AI has volunteered considerable information, yet it is apparent to us and to Clearview AI that the Commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI conducts its business. Clearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearview AI intends to seek review of the Commissioner&#8217;s decision by the (Australian) Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Not only has the Commissioner’s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, Clearview AI has not violated any law nor has it interfered with the privacy of Australians. Clearview AI does not do business in Australia, does not have any Australian users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The controversial facial recognition company has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/class-action-suit-against-clearview-ai-cites-illinois-law-that-cost-facebook-550m/">litigation on home soil in the US</a> &#8212; under Illinois&#8217; Biometric Information Privacy Act.</p>
<p>While, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/">earlier this year</a>, Minneapolis voted to ban the use of facial recognition software for its police department &#8212; effectively outlawing local law enforcement&#8217;s use of tools like Clearview.</p>
<p>The fallout from Clearview AI&#8217;s scraping of the public web and social media sites to amass a database of over 3BN images in order to sell a global identity-matching service to law enforcement may have contributed to an announcement made by Facebook&#8217;s parent company Meta yesterday &#8212; which said it would be deleting its own facial biometric data mountain.</p>
<p>The tech giant cited &#8220;growing concerns about the use of the technology as a whole&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BpIEhbqZMZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/facebook-face-recognition-data-deleting/">Facebook says it will delete facial recognition data on more than a billion users</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In addition to the above statement, Clearview&#8217;s founder, Hoan Ton-That, has also issued a personal response (pasted below) to the OAIC&#8217;s decision &#8212; in which he expresses his disappointment and argues that the privacy commissioner&#8217;s decision misinterprets the value of his &#8220;crime fighting&#8221; technology to society.</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;I grew up in Australia before moving to San Francisco at age 19 to pursue my career and create consequential crime fighting facial recognition technology known the world over.  I am a dual citizen of Australia and the United States, the two countries about which I care most deeply.  My company and I have acted in the best interests of these two nations and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts.  We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law. I respect the time and effort that the Australian officials spent evaluating aspects of the technology I built.  But I am disheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to society.  I look forward to engaging in conversation with leaders and lawmakers to fully discuss the privacy issues, so the true value of Clearview AI’s technology, which has proven so essential to law enforcement, can continue to make communities safe.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder has already undergone a big revamp with its recent <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences">launch</a> of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section inside the app that will enable more interactive experiences, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">the second &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, real-time chat, interest-based matching, and more. Now, parent company Match Group is detailing its longer-term vision for Tinder and Explore, which will expand to include exclusive, shared, and live experiences and a virtual goods-based economy, supported by Tinder&#8217;s new in-app currency, Tinder Coins. In addition, Match spoke today about its broader plans for a dating &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; and avatar-based virtual experiences that may later roll out to apps across its portfolio, including Tinder.</p>
<p>In terms of the virtual economy, the first phase of its development includes Tinder Coins, which are already being tested in several markets, including a few countries in Europe, Match said.</p>
<p>Next year, Tinder Coins will become available to global users to make in-app purchases of Tinder&#8217;s a la carte products, like Boost and Super Like &#8212; tools aimed at helping online daters get more matches. They&#8217;ll also be used for new pay-as-you-go products that were previously only available with a subscription, like the See Who Likes You feature. And they&#8217;ll be used to incentivize certain behaviors on the app, like encouraging members to verify their profiles or add videos to their bio, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228443" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228443" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-10.48.01-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match Group</p></div></p>
<p>Longer-term, however, Tinder will evolve its app to include virtual goods and a trading ecosystem, which is being planned for 2022 and beyond. This strategic initiative was detailed during Tinder parent company Match Group&#8217;s Q3 earnings, including in its Shareholder Letter and on its earnings call with investors on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Across its dating app portfolio, Match Group had <a href="https://ir.mtch.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Match-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> Q3 revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year, and 16.3 million paid subscribers, up 16%. But the company was transparent about the fact that the Covid pandemic has had an impact on its business &#8212; lockdowns early in the pandemic had forced a pivot towards virtual experiences. And now, some users are still less inclined to meet in-person, compared with before the pandemic. In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/match-forecast-misses-estimates-on-lingering-covid-in-asia?sref=gni836kR">citing lingering Covid effects in Asia</a>, Match Group forecasted weaker Q4 growth than expected with $810-$820 million in revenue instead of the analyst forecast of $838 million.</p>
<p>To address this changing market for online dating, Tinder has leaned into virtual experiences that take place inside the app, instead of only pushing people to get offline for connections. That&#8217;s led to the launch of Tinder Explore, and now, it&#8217;s driving plans for the forthcoming virtual goods-based economy Tinder has in the works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228456" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228456" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>According to Match Group CEO Shar Dubey, speaking to investors on today&#8217;s call, Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods will &#8220;help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out &#8212; particularly in a one-to-many surface area that &#8216;Explore&#8217; experiences will enable,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And so the way we envision virtual goods is that it&#8217;s something users will be able to collect, as well as give and gift to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dubey said Tinder in 2022 would be working to design the virtual goods, categorize them, create their value structure, and determine where to best showcase the items on users&#8217; Tinder profiles. This will involve testing virtual goods then iterating and refining the product further, based on those tests. Despite the work that still needs to be done, the exec was optimistic about this plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we get this right, I do think this could be a multi-year revenue vector for Tinder which doesn&#8217;t exist today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In addition to developing a virtual goods economy inside Tinder, Match Group also spoke to its larger plans for leveraging Hyperconnect, the Seoul-based social app maker it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">acquired for $1.73 billion</a> earlier in 2021. So far, Hyperconnect has not performed as well as expected, in part due to Covid and in part due to other issues &#8212; including marketing performance and product delays, the company admitted.</p>
<p>But Match still believes in Hyperconnect&#8217;s long-term value to its business, Dubey said.</p>
<p>She talked specifically about Hyperconnect&#8217;s test of an avatar-based dating app and &#8220;metaverse&#8221; experience called Single Town, where users interact using real-time audio and meet each other in virtual spaces, like a bar, where they have live audio conversations. Users can express interest in one another in the virtual world, then choose to connect privately to continue their conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform, and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world,&#8221; Dubey said of the test.</p>
<p>This type of interactivity is something Match Group eventually wants to leverage across its portfolio, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic, and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting, and getting to know people. Technology is finally getting there. And this underlying technology platform Hyperconnect has built that powers Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily,&#8221; Dubey noted, but without naming which Match-owned apps she had in mind.</p>
<p>However, it seems a metaverse-like platform for dating could later tie into something like Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods economy, though the company didn&#8217;t state this was the plan. But based on current social trends, it&#8217;s obvious how a dating app&#8217;s users could one day buy items to accessorize their avatar or buy gifts for other users, which are purchased with virtual currency &#8212; much like in other &#8220;metaverse&#8221; platforms, like Roblox, Fortnite, or withing Meta&#8217;s (Facebook&#8217;s) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming">Horizon.</a></p>
<p>In its Shareholder Letter, Match Group only hinted towards the possibilities for this dating metaverse and the experiences it creates.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new experience provides a glimpse into how metaverse experiences could be applicable to dating and it is the sort of innovation that will help us evolve our portfolio as we enter the next phase of dating,&#8221; the letter stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect,&#8221; explained Match Group CFO and COO Gary Swidler, on the call. &#8220;It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There&#8217;s many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, A.I. capabilities that they&#8217;ve got, things in moderation, and safety. There&#8217;s a number of things that we&#8217;re working very hard at leveraging,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new metaverse elements and the experience that we&#8217;re seeing in that beta test &#8212; that is something that potentially we can build into either standalone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio,&#8221; Swidler said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natfriedman/">Nat Friedman</a> is stepping down from his role on November 15 to become the Chairman Emeritus of the Microsoft-owned service. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-dohmke-24855b10/">Thomas Dohmke</a>, who only recently became GitHub&#8217;s chief product officer, will step into the CEO role.</p>
<p>When Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, there was quite a bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-promises-to-keep-github-independent-and-open/">worry in the developer community</a> that it would be an overbearing presence and turn the code sharing and collaboration service into a Microsoft-first platform. With Friedman, who thanks to his developer and open source background brought a lot of community goodwill with him when he took the job, GitHub remained independent and platform-neutral during his three-year tenure.</p>
<p>As Dohmke told me, that&#8217;s not going to change under his leadership. As he noted in an interview ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Friedman had asked him to come on board after the acquisition. The German-born Dohmke is probably best known as the co-founder and CEO of HockeyApp, which Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/11/microsoft-buys-hockeyapp-to-add-developer-tools-to-its-mobile-effort/">acquired in 2015</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In 2018, Nat picked me to lead the GitHub deal from the Microsoft side,&#8221; said Dohmke, who had risen in the ranks of Microsoft&#8217;s developer division since the acquisition of HockeyApp. &#8220;It was a really exciting time for me. It was kind of like getting back to my CEO roots even then because I was leading all the different deal functions. GitHub has a lot of aspects outside of the product and engineering world that needed to be figured out. And then Nat asked me to join GitHub with him, which I gladly accepted. I ran strategic programs and special projects at GitHub.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228438" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228438" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg" alt="new GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228438" class="wp-caption-text">new GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke</p></div></p>
<p>One of his first projects was to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/github-free-users-now-get-unlimited-private-repositories/">private repos free for all developers</a> in early 2019. And while most developers are probably aware of that, Dohmke himself admits that he doesn&#8217;t have the public profile that Friedman had when he stepped into the CEO role, but he stressed that his background as a developer and open source advocate fits into the overall line of GitHub CEOs of the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope people will look back on the last few years with Nat as the leader of GitHub and be excited and grateful for all the things that have shipped and made GitHub a better place for software development,&#8221; Dohmke said. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;re looking back at this era as one of the great eras of GitHub. During the time of the Microsoft deal, people were nervous about what this will mean for GitHub&#8217;s independence. Are we getting closer to Microsoft? I think we have proven over the last few years that we will stay independent, that we will stay cloud-neutral and that we do the right thing for the developers and that we put the developers first. Hopefully, they see this transition as a continuation of the tradition of GitHub CEOs being developers. The previous CEOs, we are all developers, Nat was a developer, I&#8217;m a developer. I hope everybody&#8217;s excited about where we will go as a company and how we will innovate and make developers more productive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He did note that his overall style is a bit different, though, with his focus more on execution than necessarily being a visionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last few years that we have been working together very closely, a lot of our styles have aligned and we have very close conversations almost daily. I think Nat is a little bit more visionary and seeing the future &#8212; and I have a little more of the execution-style of focusing on what has to ship now. But I think we both share that we are very customer-obsessed,&#8221; Dohmke explained.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, though, Dohmke, who still likes to take on a few mobile-centric <a href="https://github.com/ashtom?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private coding projects in his spare time</a>, isn&#8217;t planning to make any major changes right away. Instead, a lot of what he described is the continuation of the trajectory that GitHub is already on &#8212; and to continue its march to getting 100 million developers onto its platform. In his view, there are four pillars to this.</p>
<p>First of all, the company will continue to build out AI projects like <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copilot</a>. As Dohmke noted, in the last few years, GitHub worked a lot on the CI/CD side of software development &#8212; everything that happens after the pull request. &#8220;With artificial intelligence and Copilot, we&#8217;re bringing this to the inner loop, to what developers are doing on their laptops, what they&#8217;re doing in their editor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The second pillar he described is <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codespaces</a>, GitHub&#8217;s cloud-based developer environment, backed by Visual Studio Code. The idea here, he said, is to ensure that GitHub can meet developers where they are &#8212; and free them from having to set up complex development environments for every new project.</p>
<p>The third pillar is, unsurprisingly, the GitHub community. &#8220;If you think about creator communities today, we think about TikTok, and YouTube and Substack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But really, open source was one of the original creative communities going back to the &#8217;90s. If you think about the early days of open source, the early days of Linux &#8212; this is all about creating stuff and sharing stuff with the world and partnering with each other to create this universe of software. And so we think GitHub is becoming more and more of a creative community, or, if you will, it was one of the original creator communities when it started in 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security, in Dohmke&#8217;s mind, is the fourth pillar for GitHub to build on top off &#8212; and that has obviously been a focus for the company for a while. Dohmke himself helped lead some of the acquisitions in this space, including the <a href="https://dependabot.com/blog/hello-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dependabot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/github-acquires-code-analysis-tool-semmle/">Semmle</a> acquisitions in 2019.</p>
<p>Dohmke only became GitHub&#8217;s CPO in August, and it looks like he didn&#8217;t expect to be in this new role quite this quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In August, I didn&#8217;t know that I would already become the CEO, but from talking to Nat as a friend, from talking to Nat as a peer, a partner within GitHub, I knew at some point that his heart is elsewhere and he wants to go back to his entrepreneurial roots and explore the startup scene more,&#8221; Dohmke told me. &#8220;So this has been for a while coming and we were preparing for an orderly transition.&#8221; As part of his role in the GitHub leadership team, he had already been in all product reviews for the last three years.</p>
<p>Friedman confirms that he wants to return to the startup scene. &#8220;With all that we’ve accomplished in mind, and more than five great years at Microsoft under my belt, I’ve decided it’s time for me to go back to my startup roots,&#8221; he writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;What drives me is enabling builders to create the future. I’ve loved working with and learning from developers who are building new tools and new projects, solving thorny problems, and creating magic out of code. That’s why I’m moving on to my next adventure: to support, advise, and invest in the founders and developers who are creating the future with technology and tackling some of the biggest opportunities of our day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame him. He sold the Xamarin to Microsoft in 2016 and stayed longer than most would&#8217;ve expected. In part, that&#8217;s surely due to the fact that he was offered the role as GitHub&#8217;s CEO. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on what he does next. There is a good chance it will involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian">monkey</a> as a mascot, after all.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? The issue of venture capital expectations in certain sectors where startups may not be the best fit. And what happens when they raise a mountain of capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> had former founder and present-day indie journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/fulligin">Vincent Woo</a> to come on the show with us. Why? Because he&#8217;s written extensively about Lambda School, one of our subjects of the day.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>We started with Ro, and Natasha&#8217;s excellent piece on the matter: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">Employees detail rising tensions at Ro as healthcare unicorn struggles to grow beyond first win.</a></li>
<li>Next we chatted Lambda School, which has a well-documented history of raising venture capital and attracting controversy. Most recently, Woo published a piece about the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10">coding bootcamp&#8217;s misleading claims on job placement</a>. The company is perhaps a cautionary tale of how venture-level growth can struggle in certain sectors. Education is hard and may not scale like software.</li>
<li>At the heart of conversation was a question: <em>In this time of high valuations and easy access to large amounts of capital, how can VC incentives lead some startups into a cycle of pain? </em>We didn&#8217;t land on a single conclusion, and that was kind of the point of the episode. Venture capital isn&#8217;t inherently bad or good, but the money can come with a list of demands (and pressures) that cause risk-taking founders to make mistakes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/30/startups/">A recalibration is necessary, </a>but, as we talk about every week, the &#8220;up and to the right&#8221; market will take its time getting there.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was good fun to focus on a single topic, but we&#8217;re back with our news roundup Friday morning! Chat soon!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The market is speaking with activity numbers that lower-priced, more-useful NFTs connected to an interactive world can generate not only lots of economic value, but also lots of fans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve been thinking about the NFT market quite a lot lately, mostly scratching my head at some of the prices folks are willing to pay for certain ownership signatures on particular blockchains. I just can&#8217;t get that excited about a pixelated ape.</p>
<p>Notably, I am in the huge majority on that point, even amongst the crypto faithful. Data <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft">from Dappradar indicates</a> that in the last 24 hours, just 31 traders swapped a mere 18 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. That&#8217;s a pretty darn slim market. You might even call it illiquid.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But there are areas of activity in the NFT market that are both liquid and lower-cost that make far more sense to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Again leaning on Dappradar data, the busiest hive of NFT activity is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, which has seen 56,099 traders execute 88,027 transactions in the last day. Axie&#8217;s world is seeing a multiple of trading activity that the second-busiest NFT grouping saw in the last day, NBA Top Shot with 16,113 traders and 27,929 total transactions.</p>
<p>We can divvy up the NFT market into a few categories, I think, to help understand what we&#8217;re seeing here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value-extracting NFTs:</strong> The transference of real-world value into a digital item. A famous sports moment, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Value-defending NFTs:</strong> Low-volume image sets that earn digital cachet, leading to low-volume but expensive digital items.</li>
<li><strong>Value-generating NFTs:</strong> NFTs that unlock an activity that are not artificially supply constrained.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon unloaded a whole slew of new smart home devices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/heres-everything-amazon-announced-today/">back in late September</a>, but a smattering of products are still trickling out ahead of the holidays. Certainly a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-alexa-can-help-you-create-a-smarter-healthier-home">Smart Air Quality Monitor</a> isn’t as exciting as, say, a giant Echo Show, home robot or even a thermostat, but the at least the inherent value in such a product it clear.</p>
<p>The device is designed to measure the air for particulate matter, including carbon monoxide, dust and volatile organic compounds – essentially chemicals in the air that could harm you. There’s also built in temperature and humidity detection. As<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W8KS8D3?th=1"> the product page</a> notes, the device doesn’t have a built-in microphone or speaker, meaning it relies on a connected Echo device or the Alexa app to send alerts when something is off. So, one fewer microphone in your house. That&#8217;s a plus.</p>
<p>The company says the device was the product of user feedback during a testing period, noting,</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>By making small adjustments like venting rooms more frequently, opening windows while cooking, and opting to turn on air purifiers and humidifiers, testers experienced a noticeable improvement in their overall air quality. With these small adjustments, they also told us they were able to breathe easier in their homes and sleep better throughout the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with alerts, it also gauges changes over time to the levels it monitors, so users can see how different activities impact these issues. The Smart Air Quality Monitor is up for pre-order today and starts shipping next month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ethyca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethyca</a>, the privacy-by-design technology startup that has built a unique set of APIs, detection tools and analytics to make it easier for organizations to adhere to data privacy policies like GDPR, is taking a couple of big steps today as it gets deeper into the business of data protection.</p>
<p>First, the New York-based startup is open sourcing a set of developer tools it has built called <a href="https://ethyca.com/fides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fides</a>, so that developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases. Second, it has picked up an additional $7.5 million in funding so that it can continue developing and commercializing its proprietary tools, specifically APIs to make it easier for those building or monitoring privacy compliance to do so.</p>
<p>The funding, an extension to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/ethyca-raises-13-5m-to-help-businesses-automate-data-privacy-and-compliance/">June 2020 Series A</a> of $13.5 million, is coming from existing investors &#8212; specifically Lee Fixel, IA Ventures , Lachy Groom’s LGF and Table Management (Bill Ackman), and it brings that Series A to $21 million. Ethyca has raised $27.5 million to date, and has amassed dozens of customers that include the likes of Away, IDEO and InVision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2228430" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ck-headshot-1-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Founder and CEO Cillian Kieran (pictured, right) said that Fides was actually the motivation for starting Ethyca in the first place. His thesis in 2018 was that privacy was becoming a more critical and essential aspect of building and running digital services &#8212; not only because data protection regulations and the demands of cybersecurity challenges were increasingly demanding it, but so too were the users of those services who were becoming more aware of how their data was being used (and sometimes abused).</p>
<p>Added to that, of course, is the role of the developer, or the organization itself, in the equation. Many believe that to get data protection right, you have to build it in from the very beginning, both as a priority and as an actual technical part of how a system works &#8212; a concept that people often refer to as &#8220;privacy by design.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ethyca&#8217;s APIs are aimed at essentially building versions of those tools to make it easier to monitor and account for privacy within an existing workflow, Fides gets to the heart of it all for those who are building, to program it in from the start. Fides itself is described by Ethyca as an open source definition and configuration language for describing privacy constructs in data and software systems. It is being released initially with two OSS tools, Fides Ops and Fides Control, that respectively cover orchestration of privacy rights in an organization&#8217;s data infrastructure, and the validation of privacy rules in CI/CD workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Essentially, we have inserted privacy into the CI/CD pipeline,&#8221; Kieran said. He likens how it works to companies like Snyk, which is used by developers and starts looking for security loopholes and vulnerabilities before code is ever put into production. &#8220;Fides can do the same with the privacy.&#8221; Snyk, I&#8217;ll point out, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/snyk-snags-another-530m-as-valuation-rises-to-8-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed in valuation</a> in recent times, a sign of the high priority placed right now on addressing security and data protection at the devops level.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the case of Fides, the idea is that the toolkit will, for example, be able to detect when code is calling in user behavior, data and location at the same time. If the business doesn&#8217;t permit that, Fides will flag the relevant part of the code to fix it before it goes into production. It can also be used to automate data rights requests, such as when a person asks to be unsubscribed or have their data deleted from a system &#8212; something that typically can take many hours or weeks to carry out manually (as it often is).</p>
<p>Ethyca&#8217;s Pro (paid) tools already integrate with some 700 apps to monitor for data protection and privacy policy alignment, and in addition to the many private companies on its books, works with a number of publicly-traded larger enterprises and technology companies that it declines to name public (but believe me when I say&#8230; they are big and exactly the kinds of companies that have needed to hone in on better privacy and data protection measures).</p>
<p>Fides meanwhile already integrates with database platforms like Amazon&#8217;s DynamoDB and Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, MongoDB, MariaDB, Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and it has signed on Slack and Github as supporters of its open source community.</p>
<p>The funding will let Ethyca continue to hire to build out that commercial business while continuing to contribute to what it believes needs to be at the heart of how privacy is built in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our investment and ongoing excitement in Ethyca reflects the need for a developer-first approach to privacy and compliance as code,&#8221; said IA Ventures’ Brad Gillespie, in a statement. &#8220;The release of Fides is the culmination of three years of work for the team and a first step towards defining a much-needed open standard for privacy. With Fides, Ethyca shows they’re thinking proactively about how best to solve the higher-order challenges that will shape data privacy discussions over the coming decade. We&#8217;re thrilled to support them in their ambitious plan to shift privacy left into the Software Development Life Cycle through open-source developer tools.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deal with a growing array of privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, they are looking for solutions that help them not only understand their customers better, but also help them comply with those laws in a less labor-intensive way.</p>
<p><a href="https://blotout.io/">Blotout</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blotout">Y Combinator winter 2021</a> cohort, announced a $3 million seed round today to help solve that problem. The early stage startup has built a customer data platform (CDP) from the ground up with a focus on data privacy. The round was led by First Rays Venture Partners with participation from Y Combinator, Pascal Capital, Launchpad Capital and FuboTV co-founder Sung Ho Choi.</p>
<p>Company founder and CEO ​​Mandar Shinde says that companies need access to the full breadth of customer data to both understand them better and to comply with a growing number of privacy laws. He says that many of today&#8217;s tools miss key data, and Blotout has been designed specifically for those requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Unlike most of the companies that analyze data post collection, we are actually enabling the pipe at collection time and integrating all of the privacy stack into the collection itself. So you have consent and collection [built] into your own infrastructure,&#8221; Shinde explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228406" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228406" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="TC - Blotout Product Screenshot" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228406" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blotout</p></div></p>
<p>The company lets you install their solution on your cloud of choice such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google and then capture the data as it comes into your system, using Blotout to collect the permissions and comply with each law, while giving the customer full control of the data.</p>
<p>Alok Nandan, Partner at lead investor First Rays Ventures says that Blotout&#8217;s approach to build a new compliance solution from the ground up on top of a CDP was what attracted his firm to invest in the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people talk about first party data, but to execute first party data you need to build the whole Martech stack from the ground up. People are kind of band-aiding it together and saying it&#8217;s first party data by doing post facto data processing, but the way to build it is in a clean slate way, which is what Blotout has done,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees spread out across the Bay Area, India and Europe. COO Matthew Boulos says he is growing the team pretty aggressively because it&#8217;s an ambitious product and will require lots of data engineering talent. Boulos acknowledges that it&#8217;s a challenge to build a diverse team in this hiring environment, but he says being a worldwide team helps in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to pretend that we solved all of this, but one of the things that we are learning is how to not only bring in that diverse talent, but also how to create an environment that makes it possible for people to function as they are, where they don&#8217;t need to sort of comport themselves to something that may not be, but to be authentic…,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company founders went through Y Combinator last winter, and even though they both have industry experience, they felt it would give them a leg up on financing, and as today&#8217;s announcement bears out, that seems to have worked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based Neuron Mobility, an e-scooter-sharing company, is updating its N3 scooters with a new operating system and additional on-board sensors that will help it detect and correct dangerous or inconsiderate riding behavior. The company will be trialing about 1,500 upgraded scooters in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom over the next six months.</p>
<p>Neuron&#8217;s new scooters will rely on high-accuracy location technology and rapid geo-fence detection in order to correct or warn users of unsafe behaviors, like aggressive swerving, skidding, curb jumping, tandem riding and sidewalk riding. The new sensors and IoT layer allow the scooter to speak to the rider in many different languages and guide them toward correcting their own behavior, or it might give riders a safety evaluation after a ride and send educational materials on how to ride safely via email. In extreme circumstances, the scooter will be able to simply slow riders to a stop, combined with an audio message like: &#8220;You are leaving the service area, head back or power will be cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the long-term, all riders will get an individual safety rating, which Neuron hopes will incentivize good behavior, target certain riders for safety training and ban repeat offenders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;But what is the actual impact of this technology layer in a real-world setting, in the hands of real users?&#8221; Zachary Wang, CEO of Neuron, told TechCrunch. &#8220;That is the key focus of the trial. We want to study across thousands of scooters and different geographical areas, working with different city councils to really understand where do we want to draw the line? How should we implement this technology in a way that best suits the needs of cities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuron is the latest e-scooter operator to implement this type of rider assistance system. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/">Bird recently launched its new location-based sidewalk riding detection technology</a> in hundreds of scooters in Milwaukee and San Diego. Over the summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">Superpedestrian acquired Navmatic</a> so it could implement the company&#8217;s high-accuracy positioning software in order to detect dangerous riding behavior and stop it in real time.</p>
<p>Companies like Spin, Voi and Helbiz are also trialing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter advanced driver assistance systems</a> (ADAS), but their systems use cameras attached to the vehicles, along with other sensors, to come to similar conclusions about a rider&#8217;s behavior or parking.</p>
<p>While Neuron is, admittedly, a little late to the party, it is probably the only company publicly introducing this kind of tech that has developed it purely in-house. Bird&#8217;s location accuracy is made possible through a partnership with u-blox, a Swiss company that produces wireless semiconductors and high-precision positioning modules; Spin and Helbiz are working with Drover AI, and Voi with Luna, on their respective computer vision modules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For accurate location tracking, Neuron is implementing a multi-constellation, multi-band global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which uses radio from satellites to provide highly precise geo-spatial positioning. New accelerometers and six-axis gyroscope sensors help detect how fast the vehicle is traveling, what the acceleration is like, what angles the vehicle is turning on and whether or not it&#8217;s going up or down a slope &#8212; all of which help the vehicle determine if the rider is driving aggressively, as well as work in tandem with the positioning software to get an even more accurate location.</p>
<p>The rapid geo-fence detection takes in all of this data and processes it locally and quickly using edge computing, rather than cloud computing, which Neuron says results in 10 centimeter-level accuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working over the past 12 months to bundle all this technology together, because to make one work, we need a lot of additional sensors, and we need to be able to know the position before we can process the information locally,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>While all of Neuron&#8217;s new technological capabilities are present at the same time on each scooter, not all features will be tested simultaneously. For example, in cities like Ottawa, e-scooters are only allowed to ride on the road or bike paths, so it&#8217;s the sidewalk detection technology that will be featured heavily there. Meanwhile in Australia, riders must ride on the sidewalk, so Neuron will trial its high-accuracy location technology as it relates to designated parking locations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Neuron is currently present in 23 markets throughout Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Korea. The trial will be taking place in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ottawa in Canada, Brisbane and Darwin in Australia, and Slough in the United Kingdom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Merge, an integrations platform that focuses on B2B use cases, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Addition, with participation from existing investor NEA, which led the company&#8217;s $4.5 million seed round, and a number of angel investors. In addition to the new funding, the company also today announced partnerships with HR providers BambooHR and application tracking system Lever.</p>
<p>Merge co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shensiding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shensi Ding</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gil Feig</a> told me that when the company announced its seed funding, there were about 100 companies on its platform. Today that number is 600 and Ding noted that this now includes a number of public companies. As is often the case with seed-stage startups, Merge spent a lot of the last few months building the right tools for these larger customers, including single-tenant hosting for those enterprises that need those kinds of assurances. But the team also added features like CSV uploads, SAML SSO custom field mapping, more detailed logging and more.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s vision is to become the de facto standard for B2B integrations. Right now, its focus is on HR, payroll, accounting and recruiting, but that&#8217;s mainly because the team is still small and had to focus its efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228211" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228211" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228211" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We are planning on crossing many categories and not only focusing on a few,&#8221; Ding said. &#8220;This was just the beginning. But to be honest, one thing that Gil and I previously experienced at our previous companies was that those broad integrations companies are too broad. They don&#8217;t really cover enough players in a space where if you have a customer who&#8217;s on one platform, sure, that one customer might be covered, but then the 10 other customers you&#8217;re trying to onboard probably aren&#8217;t covered by those broad integrations platforms. Having comprehensive coverage in existing categories has been really huge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Feig also stressed, Merge doesn&#8217;t see itself as a workflow automation platform that wants to compete with Microsoft&#8217;s Power Automate and similar platforms. Instead, the team is positioning Merge as a tool to help B2B companies build customer-facing integrations. The average B2B company needs to integrate with dozens of vendors &#8212; and those integrations can often be brittle. Merge offers them a unified API that can then power all of these user-facing experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing these bigger companies work on or acquire products like <a href="https://boomi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell Boomi</a> and that sort of thing,&#8221; Feig explained. &#8220;They really are still workflow automation, which are mainly beneficial for internal use cases, like &#8216;when something happened on Salesforce, notify the sales team on Slack.&#8217; The benefit overall of what we&#8217;re doing is the fact that we&#8217;re unified, the fact that you get 20, 30, 40 API&#8217;s all unified into a single format. That one build produces all of those integrations whereas those classic workflow products that more and more people are rolling out still require you to build one-by-one. They just move the implementation from code to having to drag and drop blocks in a UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Merge features about 50 integrations. Unsurprisingly, the team plans to use the new funding to expand into more categories and to expand its engineering and sales team to do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Merge is revolutionizing customer-facing integrations in the B2B space by helping developers integrate fast and integrate once,&#8221; said Lee Fixel, Founder of Addition. &#8220;Their track record demonstrates Merge is solving a common problem with the right product, and we’re excited to support the company on its continued growth trajectory.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish freight technology company Einride announced the launch of its operations in the United States. On Thursday, the company will officially begin testing its transport solutions – like its autonomous &#8216;pods,&#8217; electric trucks and &#8216;Saga&#8217; operating system – with partners like GE Appliances (GEA), Bridgestone and Oatly.</p>
<p>The company also announced that it would introduce a U.S. version of its pod which has been adapted to suit American road conditions and regulations, as well as a flatbed pod, a module vehicle built to accommodate a range of shipping needs, such as transporting containers from shipyards.</p>
<p>Einride operates one of Europe&#8217;s largest fleets of electric trucks. Its autonomous pods, which are built without a front cab, and thus, without room for a human safety operator, are also electric. Some of the other major players in the autonomous freight game, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/">Kodiak Robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">TuSimple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo</a>, are not necessarily pursuing an electric-only approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Between 7% and 8% of global CO2 emissions come from heavy road freight transport,&#8221; Robert Falck, CEO and founder of Einride, told TechCrunch. &#8220;One of the drivers for starting Einride is that I&#8217;m very worried that by optimizing and making road freight transport autonomous, but based on diesel, it&#8217;s likely that we will actually increase emissions because it would become that much cheaper to operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s partnership wth GEA will involve the deployment of seven autonomous and electric trucks that will run at at the company&#8217;s 750 acre campus in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as other locations in Tennessee and Georgia. The company predicts GEA will save 870 tons of carbon dioxide emissions within the first year of launch, and the plan is to expand the partnership with GEA rapidly over the course of the next few years with additional trucks to be added.</p>
<p>The Bridgestone collaboration is more of a technology partnership aimed at co-creating sustainable mobility solutions for electrified and autonomous Class 8 vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The collaboration allows Einride to collect new layers of safety and efficiency-related data from Bridgestone’s smart-sensing tires, while enabling Bridgestone to integrate its advanced mobility technologies into Einride’s onboard vehicle platforms,&#8221; a spokesperson for Einride told TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>Einride will supply connected electric trucks and digital services under a subscription agreement to Bridgestone for its U.S. shipping logistics network, with the aim of electrifying the majority of Bridgestone’s landside transport needs by 2025.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oatly, an oat milk company, is already a partner of Einride&#8217;s in Europe and is now expanding that partnership to the U.S. Einride wouldn&#8217;t share many details about the American expansion, but Falck said that it will look similar to how Einride digitalized and electrified Oatly&#8217;s European transportation beginning in 2020. In Europe, and presumably in the U.S., Einride provides Oatly with electric trucks and its Saga platform, which has helped the company go electric quicker and reduce its carbon footprint by 87% on selected routes, according to Einride.</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s U.S. launch also coincides with an update to the Saga platform. Saga, which comes from the old Norse word for &#8220;all knowing,&#8221; is the IoT system that runs through Einride&#8217;s electric trucks and pods. It&#8217;s how the company optimizes routes and runs a large electric fleet, and Einride hopes it will become a sort of universal operating system that will help transform the heavy freight industry and empower companies to electrify their fleets.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The current trucking industry is extremely fragmented and not very coordinated,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to go electric, but it&#8217;s not about range and it&#8217;s not about how much you can actually deploy electric. If we use our Saga platform and our operating system, you can actually electrify up to 40% of the U.S. road freight transport system with a competitive business case using existing technology. It&#8217;s more about deploying new way of thinking rather than just improving the hardware.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Because Einride&#8217;s pods don&#8217;t employ on-board safety operators, the company has also employed a new way of thinking about how to achieve Level 4 autonomy. (Level 4 means the vehicles can handle all aspects of driving in <em>certain</em> conditions without human intervention, according to SAE International.)</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s entire system has to be built differently due to the lack of a safety driver, says Falck. Other companies collect miles with a human operator in the front seat, but Falck calls what Einride has done the &#8220;toddler approach,&#8221; where it teaches the vehicle to first crawl, then walk slowly until it gradually increases its capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with traditional Level 4 and then increased usability in applications, combining autonomous with the remote driver ability, so that gives us the flexibility and the benefits of autonomous and human agility and decision making,&#8221; said Falck.</p>
<p>The startup has been testing its AV system on public roads in Europe since 2019, but doesn&#8217;t yet have a date to start testing in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we don&#8217;t have a safety driver in the vehicle, or even room for a safety driver, we have to take a different approach to get the legislation,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;It <span style="font-weight: 400;">varies from nation to nation and state to state, but at the core, it&#8217;s about guaranteeing the safety in the application itself.</span> That&#8217;s also been our approach since the start to be able to verify the safety case in all applications without the driver in the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>A remote truck driver, or &#8216;pod operator&#8217; will oversee Einride&#8217;s pods and take over in certain situations.  Falck says he doesn&#8217;t believe in Level 5 autonomy, or one in which AVs essentially drive and think better than humans, and aims for Einride&#8217;s system to always have humans in the loop for better agility and decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Machines still work for the benefit of humans,&#8221; said Falck. &#8220;We&#8217;re still quite far from having that level of AI that the whole industry has been chasing for more than 15 years now, and for us, there are a lot of situations where you can get the benefits of autonomous but also the benefits of having a human in the loop. For instance, if you want to back up to a different gate or want to interact with the drivers around you. It&#8217;s really a benefit to have that human decision-making and doesn&#8217;t impact the business case too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Einride said it has hired its first pod operator, who has a background in trucking as well as a trucking license, and will reveal them at an event later this year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the U.S. launch announcement, Einride also said it would officially establish a U.S. headquarters in New York, where parts of the leadership team will be based, as well as regional offices in Austin, San Francisco and in the South East. It does not plan to build factories in the U.S. at this time.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cloudbeds provides software to lodging businesses that combines previously siloed functions into one integrated, cloud-based tool.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As U.S. hotel occupancy <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covid-hit-hotel-industry-hard-data-shows-it-s-still-n1280061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit pre-pandemic levels</a> this summer, the hospitality industry is bracing for what is expected to be a rush of activity as people resume travel.</p>
<p>There are some tailwinds pushing those sails: The largest population of future travelers was born after 1979, and after saving more money over the last decade they now have more discretionary spending and want to use it to travel, said Adam Harris, co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.cloudbeds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudbeds</a>.</p>
<p>“The pandemic was unwelcoming for everyone, but travel is a $1 trillion industry, one of the top five largest in the world,” he added. “The demand that was there in 2019 is now even stronger because they’ve been cooped up at home for a year and a half.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228006" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228013" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228013" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png" alt="Cloudbeds" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Product_Images_2021_mobile.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228013" class="wp-caption-text">Cloudbeds product. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cloudbeds</p></div></p>
<p>Harris and Richard Castle founded San Diego-based Cloudbeds in 2012 to provide hospitality management software to lodging businesses, from independent hotels to vacation rentals, that combines previously siloed business functions, like operations, revenue, distribution and growth marketing, into one integrated, cloud-based tool.</p>
<p>As a result of all that pent-up energy, Harris believes we will soon see travel numbers never seen before. To capitalize on that, the company secured $150 million led by new investor SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>Cloudbeds started a relationship with SoftBank two years ago, and Harris noted the investor is “one of the best travel investors in the world,” most recently infusing capital into travel companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/softbank-backed-travel-tech-startup-yanolja-acquires-korean-e-commerce-company-interpark/">Yanolja</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/">GetYourGuide</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/klook-200-milllion-funding/">Klook</a>.</p>
<p>Andrew Zloto, director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that in today’s market it was “critical” for hotels to adopt technology so that they can compete, and that the global pandemic was a driver for the accelerated adoption we are seeing.</p>
<p>“We believe Cloudbeds has harnessed this opportunity to fundamentally change how the hospitality industry uses technology,” he said. “Cloudbeds has taken what has traditionally been a siloed, complex web of technology services and combined it into a single platform that’s a great solution for properties of all sizes. By simplifying and consolidating critical business tools, the company is working to level the playing field for independent hoteliers and help them to thrive in a constantly evolving market.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining SoftBank are new investors Echo Street and Walleye Capital and existing investors Viking Global Investors, PeakSpan Capital and Counterpart Ventures. This latest funding round takes Cloudbeds&#8217; total venture funding raised to date to $253 million.</p>
<p>Armed with the new funding, the company will continue to expand on R&amp;D, invest in education and advocacy and grow its teams in engineering, product and sales. The company will also round out its leadership with a focus on having a team in place for a pre-IPO, Castle said.</p>
<p>Harris did not want to disclose growth metrics, but did say that Cloudbeds was one of only a handful of companies that grew last year despite the pandemic. It currently serves over 22,000 global customers across 157 countries.</p>
<p>“We believe the company can be a $20 billion company,” he added. “If you look at the race amongst competitors, we are in the lead. We have to deploy some cash, and that keeps us up at night a bit. We now have predictability in our business model, and the goal is to build an IPO candidate and mature the organization.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Allbirds' IPO pricing backs up our view that tech-enabled unicorns going public can hope for an upper-single-digit revenue multiple provided they can make a good case to public market investors.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of somewhat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">slack earnings from the recently public Robinhood</a>, you might have expected the public-offering game to slow a bit. Nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Last night, consumer DTC shoe company Allbirds, backed by an ocean of private capital, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88103/DTC-shoe-brand-Allbirds-prices-upsized-IPO-above-the-range-at-$15">priced its IPO at $15 per share</a>, $1 above its expected range. The company also registered an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653909/000162828021021285/allbirdss-1mef.htm">extra million shares</a> for its offering, adding to its heft and the general positive vibe of its upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>This brings us back to our ongoing conversation regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">the value of tech-enabled unicorns</a> busy finding public-market liquidity.</p>
<p>Recall that when Rent the Runway <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">priced its IPO</a>, it was worth &#8220;just over 7x its July 31, 2021 run rate (quarter times four).&#8221; The fact that the company has since suffered sharp declines from $21 to roughly $16 per share post-debut is not material; we care about IPO prices, not post-listing moves.</p>
<p>Earlier, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">we noted</a> that at $14 per share and the previously slightly lower share count, Allbirds would be worth just under 9x its current annual run rate on a fully-diluted basis. At $15 per share, and with an extra million shares, Allbirds is worth mid-9x its current run rate, depending on how you count shares.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s very early so please don&#8217;t get too hung up on modestly relaxed math!)</p>
<p>Allbirds&#8217; IPO pricing, then, backs up our general view that tech-enabled unicorns going public can hope for an upper-single-digit revenue multiple provided they can make a good case to the larger pool of public-market investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Battery Ventures' State of the OpenCloud report provides a set of data points that pretty clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a> released its <a href="https://www.battery.com/opencloud-2021/">State of the OpenCloud</a> report today, providing a set of data points that clearly outline the accelerated growth of cloud services in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The report helps explain <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">the race to invest capital</a> into startups that we’ve been observing over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/saas-earnings-rise-as-pandemic-pushes-companies-more-rapidly-to-the-cloud/">to start using cloud services</a> — infrastructure, platform or SaaS — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">earlier and quicker than they might have otherwise</a>. That resulted in big investments, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">eye-popping IPOs</a>, and tremendous revenue growth for software companies of all stripes, especially those built atop open-source code.</p>
<p>Consider this tidbit from the report: &#8220;The average infrastructure-software IPO valuation has increased 10 times over the last 10 years, and there are more infrastructure-software companies valued at $10 billion or more than ever before.” What&#8217;s more, the data implies a healthy pipeline of major cloud IPOs.</p>
<p>Battery believes that the cloud market could eventually be worth $1 trillion. When you consider that the vast majority of work, development and computing will be done in the cloud at some point, the investment group’s round-number projection may prove modest.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This report makes it clear that despite the tremendous growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s our takeaway. While the digital transformation is evident and startling, this report makes it clear that despite the nigh-incredible growth numbers we have seen recently, we are still just scratching the surface of the cloud&#8217;s potential.</p>
<h2>Public cloud acceleration</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">Amazon’s AWS public cloud platform is big business</a>. Amazon breaks out its results on a quarterly basis, showing the world exactly how much cloud revenue it generates, as well as the resulting operating profit. Microsoft also breaks out growth for its Azure service, but with other services included in the reporting category, the exact number is harder to nail down.</p>
<p>Battery’s report gives us per-platform data. In Q2 2021, the venture capital firm reckons that AWS reached a $59 billion run rate, while Azure hit $37 billion and Google Cloud reached $19 billion — and this was before the companies reported Q3 results.</p>

<p>Critically, Battery&#8217;s Q2 figures were up an aggregate 44% compared to a year earlier — the growth has accelerated from an early-pandemic low of 36% in Q2 of last year. Indeed, since the second quarter of 2020, public cloud growth has either held steady or risen.</p>
<p>Given the sheer amount of dollars involved in these figures, the acceleration of growth from 36% to 44% is incredibly material: The three cloud platforms closed Q2 2021 on a combined run rate of $115 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration has ordered nearly all federal agencies to patch hundreds of security bugs, some that were first found the best part of a decade ago.</p>
<p>The new binding operational directive, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday, gives federal agencies six months to fix <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">more than 300 security vulnerabilities</a> that it has identified as carrying &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to their networks. Agencies have just two weeks to fix the more recent bugs from 2021, the directive said.</p>
<p>CISA said these security bugs, some of which date back to 2014 and 2015, are a &#8220;frequent attack vector&#8221; for cybercriminals targeting federal agencies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The directive, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-to-order-federal-agencies-to-fix-hundreds-of-cyber-flaws-11635937200?st=t65m61h2hompm75&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">first reported</a> by The Wall Street Journal, applies to most civilian federal agencies, but carves out exceptions for networks run by the military and under the Defense Department or the intelligence community, which are managed separately.</p>
<p>Federal agencies are largely left to manage their cybersecurity efforts, like rolling out security patches. Since 2015, federal agencies were <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/15-01/">first mandated</a> to fix &#8220;critical&#8221; security bugs within a month of public disclosure, and in 2019 that was <a href="https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/19-02/">expanded to include</a> fixes for high-severity bugs as well.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/30/government-investigation-finds-federal-agencies-failing-at-cybersecurity-basics/">the government&#8217;s own watchdog</a> has said some federal agencies still struggle with the cybersecurity basics. According to the Journal, many of the bugs in the new directive weren&#8217;t previously covered, a tacit nod to how seemingly less-impactful bugs can still cause significant damage or disruption if exploited.</p>
<p>“The Directive lays out clear requirements for federal civilian agencies to take immediate action to improve their vulnerability management practices and dramatically reduce their exposure to cyber attacks,&#8221; said CISA Director Jen Easterly in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;While this Directive applies to federal civilian agencies, we know that organizations across the country, including critical infrastructure entities, are targeted using these same vulnerabilities. It is therefore critical that every organization adopt this Directive and prioritize mitigation of vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s public catalog,&#8221; said Easterly.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Langevin, a member of the House Armed Services&#8217; subcommittee on cyber, said the CISA directive &#8220;will go a long way towards strengthening network security and improving our federal cyber hygiene.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Archive.ai founders believe the future of marketing will be a culture of “building with you” versus the “talking at you” approach they believe traditional digital marketing is doing now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When marketers Paul Benigeri and Geoffrey Woo were at their former companies, in food tech and e-commerce infrastructure, respectively, they experienced how manual and repetitive digital marketing workflows were, especially as the number of disparate and unintegrated marketing tools grew.</p>
<p>With the goal of making their own lives easier, they formed <a href="http://archive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive.ai</a> in March to build technology that connects databases and distribution channels so they talk to each other and to address what they believe will be the future of marketing — “building with you” — versus the “talking at you” approach the founders believe traditional digital marketing is doing.</p>
<p>Its two initial products are Archive, a Shopify app that automatically detects, classifies and saves Instagram stories relating to a brand, and Archive Communities, which makes influencer marketing programmatic so that brands can more quickly scale their community-building efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227888" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228392" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg" alt="Archive.ai" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/archive-ai_cover_option_4-1.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228392" class="wp-caption-text">Archive.ai dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Woo, who is chairman of Archive.ai, said via email that the company is pioneering a new approach to digital marketing it calls &#8220;community marketing.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This takes ideas from influencer marketing, affiliate marketing, loyalty programs and community management,” he said. “Much of the existing services operate in silos and don&#8217;t inter-operate well. Also since Apple banned the Facebook tracking pixel with iOS 14 in recent months, a lot of the paid social media advertising has become exorbitantly inefficient for most e-commerce companies.”</p>
<p>Before incorporating, the company was a profitable project, according to Woo. Its list of enterprise customers includes Four Sigmatic, CEO Benigeri’s former company Health Via Modern Nutrition and some household names he was not ready to say yet. There are over 40 alpha testers on Archive App with more than 200 people on the waitlist. The company expects to go live with Archive App before the end of November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, to “properly build a next-generation community marketing technology company,” as Woo put it, the company decided to go after some venture capital. Today, it announced $4.068 million in funding led by Stripe.</p>
<p>Also joining in on the round were Lux Capital, Sugar Capital and Anti Fund, as well as a group of individual investors that included Ramp CEO Eric Glyman and CTO Karim Atiyeh, Attentive CEO Brian Long and CPO Andrew Jones, Applied Intuition CEO Qasar Younis and Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company tripled its headcount to 36 people, and its monthly recurring revenue grew 58% since April. The company also intends to triple the engineering team to focus on workflow automations and machine learning to assist and streamline marketing tasks and decisions.</p>
<p>In addition, plans include building out a marketing team. Kwan Kim recently joined Archive.ai as head of growth after being the first digital marketing hire for Recurly and scaling the company to its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/accel-kkr-acquires-recurly--edf88647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition by Accel-KKR</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archive gives businesses an easy way to review and, more importantly, understand what their customers are actually saying — the north star for every smart company,” Chris Sperandio, corporate development lead at Stripe, said in a written statement. “We’re excited to invest in Archive and, in doing so, to help their users grow internet-enabled commerce.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kneron has launched its first automotive-grade chip — fueled by funds from Foxconn, Alibaba, Sequoia, Horizons Ventures, and Qualcomm — that it says could revolutionize the path to vehicle autonomy.</p>
<p>The chip industry has been dominated by legacy and tech companies like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. Kneron – which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/delta-electronics-kneron/">raised over $100 million to date</a> – has quickly emerged as a startup that deserves attention. Its chips are already being used by Otus, which supplies aftermarket advanced driver assistance systems to Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi. With the new chip, the Kneron KL530, the startup is looking to take a greater share of the automotive market.</p>
<p>The Kneron KL530 has two major innovations, according to CEO Albert Liu: it supports Vision Transformers (ViT), as opposed to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); and it has a 4-bit data processor. Together, he says this results in more accurate image detection and decreased processing time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both ViTs and CNNs are deep learning models, but up until this point transformers have been very difficult to implement in hardware, Liu said. “[The] transformer itself is a whole new class of architecture design, which can beat the accuracy and performance [of CNN chips] significantly,” he added. “Anything related to time-series judgment, for example, voice recognition or behavior recognition, the transformer can have much better performance.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228140" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228140" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228140" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg" alt="Kneron CEO Albert Liu" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kneron-CEO_Albert-Liu-3-1-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228140" class="wp-caption-text">Kneron CEO Albert Liu</p></div></p>
<p>As opposed to CNNs, ViTs make inferences holistically, not just based on specific features but an amalgamation of all features in a space. Liu gave the example of a big white truck against a cloudy sky backdrop. A CNN might infer that the big white object must also be part of the sky – putting the vehicle at risk of hitting the truck – while a ViT would process not only the visual white area but also the things delineating it as a truck, like the wheels, and the boundary around it.</p>
<p>The KL530’s other major innovation is the 4 bit data processor, which can reduce data processing times compared to 32 bit and 8 bit processors. It can also process more frames per second, reducing processing time by up to 66%, without a commensurate increase in power consumption. It can detect more apertures within any given time, so things like facial recognition can be sped up by up to half a second.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That means more safety in automotive applications,” Liu said, because decision-making can occur that much faster.</p>
<p>Overall, Kneron says the new chip has up to two times more TOPS/watt over its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/kneron-launches-its-new-ai-chip-to-challenge-google-and-others/">custom chip KL520</a>. The chip also has an image system processor, which enables a 1080P resolution, blind spot detection, classification, distance measuring, and hazard recognition.</p>
<p>The chip will be released in two versions, one for the aftermarket and one to be built directly into the vehicle. The chips will be used in the forthcoming vehicles that Foxconn is manufacturing under its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/foxconn-unveils-three-new-ev-prototypes/amp/">Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan’s Yulon Motor</a>. Kneron is in the process of delivering sample orders to other customers, and anticipates entering mass production by the first quarter of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chevy Bolt recall was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/lg-will-cover-nearly-the-entire-cost-of-gms-chevy-bolt-ev-recall/">huge and expensive setback</a> for GM — and arguably the broader EV market.</p>
<p>The sheer number of vehicles — about 141,000 — highlighted the fact that neither battery cell supplier LG Chem nor GM could pinpoint exactly which batteries had defects. The companies only knew that problems within LG Chem&#8217;s battery cell manufacturing operations could increase the risk of fire in some, not all, cars.</p>
<p>One company, Voltaiq, is working to make sure that these types of &#8220;just replace all the batteries in all the cars&#8221; recalls don&#8217;t become commonplace.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226528" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s so-called Enterprise Battery Intelligence (EBI) platform doesn&#8217;t add more sensors to the battery, instead, it uses data already available from the pack and presents it to automakers, tech companies and battery manufacturers in a way that&#8217;s easy to understand and that can help them assess the health of the system.</p>
<p>It goes beyond what&#8217;s already out there on the road today and works down the supply chain with cell suppliers. Founded in 2012, Voltaiq helps make sense of all that data and presents it in a way that helps when things are about to go sideways. It can also signal to a company when something isn&#8217;t up to snuff at any point in time from the mines and R&amp;D to testing and installation in a device.</p>
<p>Voltaiq&#8217;s tech has already won over some automakers. The system is used by Mercedes-Benz, two of the Detroit Big Three automakers (although they would not share the names of those companies) and tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all comes down to the fact that the battery is fundamentally different than any other component in our modern devices. Everything else is mechanical or semiconductor in nature,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Tal Sholklapper told TechCrunch. Sholklapper noted that batteries are almost like a living, breathing being, with complex, nuanced and unpredictable behavior over their entire life cycle. Understanding how these sometimes volatile components tick requires sorting through a lot of data, and that&#8217;s where Voltaiq comes in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voltaiq says that the analytics software it provides reduces hundreds of hours of sorting through information and surfacing just the data that&#8217;s required by a company and its researchers. The system can also help do spot checks of batteries being delivered by suppliers. In some cases, its customers have noted that these checks have found formulation changes in battery chemistry that a cell supplier had implemented but not informed Voltaiq&#8217;s client.</p>
<p>One case Voltaiq shared was that before they were brought on by one automaker, the OEM had an issue that caused a massive delay. About a month before a vehicle was set to launch, the battery they were supplied failed qualification. In other words, it wasn&#8217;t going to work. By the time the company was able to secure a new battery supplier, it was 18 months after the initial launch date. The startup could have detected that issue before it was delivered and could have helped the supplier or alerted the OEM of the problem.</p>
<p>Voltaiq wouldn&#8217;t comment on the woes that GM and LG Chem are experiencing. The Voltaiq platform&#8217;s ability to spot issues before its installed in a vehicle, perform regular health checks and be able to identify which batch of batteries have the potential to experience a problem, could reduce the types of recalls GM is going through right now.</p>
<p>There are other companies out there doing what Voltaiq does. However, Voltaiq&#8217;s co-founders contend that competition mostly comes from its potential customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is engineering data, there&#8217;s still this desire for the OEMs to own it and do it in-house. So we see this, like, build versus buy behavior,&#8221; co-founder and CTO Eli Leland said.</p>
<p>Two customers that initially tried that approach were Microsoft and Google. Both figured they could tackle it themselves. Now they&#8217;re Volatiq customers.</p>
<p>Most companies don&#8217;t see themselves as battery companies. And yet, batteries are central to the devices they&#8217;re selling — and customers are buying. From voice-assistant powered speakers and the latest EVs to the energy storage facilities on the electric grid in places like Hawaii and Australia, the chemistry that keeps the lights on, the wheels rolling and the tunes pumping could do with some better understanding.</p>
<p>For all those applications and more, knowing what&#8217;s going on in the lithium-ion pack is becoming more important than ever. Just ask GM.</p>
