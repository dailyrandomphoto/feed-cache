										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shortly after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">announced</a> it would begin testing a better way to display images on its app, it&#8217;s now doing the same for YouTube videos. According to a new <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?s=20">post</a> on Twitter&#8217;s Support account, the company will today start testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly from your home timeline within the Twitter iOS app. That means you&#8217;ll be able to click and play a video without having to leave the conversation you&#8217;re currently viewing.</p>
<p>Before this change, YouTube videos wouldn&#8217;t show a preview on iOS, so you&#8217;d have to click the link to start watching. This would take you out of the conversation to another screen where you could play the video or tap again to open the YouTube iOS app, if you preferred.</p>
<p>Now, you&#8217;ll be able to scroll and watch videos without losing your place on the Twitter timeline.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Starting today on iOS, we’re testing a way to watch YouTube videos directly in your Home timeline, without leaving the conversation on Twitter. <a href="https://t.co/V4qzMJMEBs">pic.twitter.com/V4qzMJMEBs</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1372592575849189381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says it&#8217;s initially testing the feature on iOS in the U.S., Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia, before rolling it out globally. It didn&#8217;t offer a time frame for when this would be available to all Twitter users.</p>
<p>The company had announced earlier this month it would be working towards a better media-viewing experience on its app, including for both sharing and viewing media, like photos and videos. With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">the photo preview test</a> launched to iOS and Android last week, Twitter is now giving users a more accurate preview of what images look like, for example. Before, it would crop images automatically &#8212; often hiding key portions of a photo.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1369680674672807940">announced</a> the ability for users to upload 4K images on both Android and iOS, accessible through a new feature in your &#8220;Data Usage&#8221; settings in the Twitter app.</p>
<p>These changes are not only welcome from a user annoyance perspective, they&#8217;re also tied into Twitter&#8217;s newly announced ambitions to become a platform that serves creators. The company said it&#8217;s soon introducing a new subscription-based service<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/"> called &#8220;Super Follow&#8221;</a> that will allow creators to publish subscriber-only content on Twitter, like newsletters, deals, and other exclusive content, which likely includes exclusive media. But in order to support creators, who often have their content spread across social platforms around the web, Twitter has to make the process of sharing that content &#8212; whether photos, videos or anything else &#8212; feel seamless and native to the app.</p>
<p>Twitter will likely have a few more updates on this front in the days and weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to make significant advances in attracting customers away from the big incumbents by providing more modern, user-friendly tools to manage their money. Today, one of the trailblazers in this area, <a href="http://kuda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda Technologies</a>, is announcing funding to continue building out its specific ambition: to provide a modern banking service for Africans and the African diaspora, or as co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi describes them, &#8220;every African on the planet, wherever you are in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which currently offers mobile-first banking services in Nigeria, has picked up $25 million in a Series A being led by Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by Peter Thiel, with Target Global and other unnamed investors participating. This is the first time that Valar &#8212; which has <a href="https://valar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> in a number of fintech startups, including N26, TransferWise, Stash, and just in the last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlockFi</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-closes-52m-series-a-from-valar-ventures-backed-by-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BitPanda</a> &#8212; has backed an African startup.</p>
<p>Kuda currently provides services for consumers to save and spend money, and it has recently introduced overdrafts (essentially revolving credit for individuals). Ogundeyi said in an interview that the plan is to use these new funds to continue expanding its credit offerings, to build out services for businesses, to add in more integrations, and to move into more markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for Kuda, which is co-headquartered in London and Lagos.</p>
<p>When we last wrote about the startup, four months ago, it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/nigerias-kuda-raises-10m-to-be-the-mobile-first-challenger-bank-for-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just closed a seed round of $10 million</a> led by Target Global. That was, at the time &#8212; and I think still is &#8212; the largest-ever seed round raised by a startup out of Africa, and thus as much of a milestone for the tech industry there as it was for Kuda itself.</p>
<p>At the time of the seed round, Kuda had registered 300,000 customers: now, that figure has more than doubled to 650,000, and tellingly, that base is spending more money through the Kuda app.</p>
<p>&#8220;In November we were doing about $500 million in transactions per month,&#8221; Ogundeyi said, for services like bill payments, card transactions, and phone top-ups. &#8220;We closed February at $2.2 billion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Kuda is also different from many of these, specifically because it taps into some financial practices that are unique to its market.</p>
<p>As Ogundeyi describes it, most people who are employed by companies will have &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; at banks, where companies pay in a person&#8217;s wages on a regular basis. These will typically be at incumbent banks, but they do not offer the same ranges of services to customers. No mobile apps, no facilities to buy mobile top-ups or make other kinds of bill payments, no AI-based calculators to figure out your monthly spend and provide suggestions on how to manage your budget, and so on.</p>
<p>That has opened a gap in the market for others to provide those services in their place. Kuda&#8217;s deposits, Ogundeyi said, typically start as basic transfers that people make from those &#8220;salary accounts&#8221; elsewhere. These start out small, maybe 20% of a person&#8217;s wages, but as those users find themselves using Kuda&#8217;s payment and other tools more, they are increasing how much they transfer in each payment period.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the trust increases you’re naturally more comfortable having money with Kuda,&#8221; he said. The next stage from that will be people depositing money directly with Kuda. A small minority already do this, he added, although the startup &#8220;has a bit more work to do&#8221; to get more companies integrated into its platform. (This is one of the areas that will be developed with this latest round of funding.)</p>
<p>In turn, having more money in Kuda accounts is likely to spur another wave of services being turned on at the startup, such as loans with more competitive interest rates, because they will not just be based on how much money people have but also their spending histories on the platform. &#8220;We can offer loans to salaried customers instantly as long as their salary is with Kuda,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Much of this is being enabled because of how Kuda is built. A lot of challenger banks have tapped into a world of finance and banking APIs built by another wave of fintech startups, partnering with other banks to provide backend deposit and other services: their value-add is in building efficient customer service and tools to help people manage and borrow money in smarter ways.</p>
<p>Kuda, on the other hand, has its own microfinance banking license from the central bank of Nigeria. This means that on top of building those same money management services, Kuda can also issue<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> debit cards (in partnership with Visa and Mastercard), manage </span>p<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ayments and transfers, and build all of the services in the stack itself, including those salary account services and loans. (Kuda does have partnerships with incumbent banks, specifically Zenith Bank, Guaranteed Trust and Access Bank, for people to come in for physical deposits and withdrawals when needed.)</span></p>
<p>While the service is still only live in Nigeria, the &#8220;vision is still to serve all Africans in Africa as well as outside of it,&#8221; Ogundeyi said.</p>
<p>The first step of that will likely be Nigerians outside of Nigeria &#8212; most likely in the UK, where Kuda already has a headquarters, and where it has a ready market: London alone has been estimated to be home to upwards of 1 million Nigerian immigrants and people of Nigerian descent (the number of UK residents actually born in Nigeria is considerably smaller, more like <a href="https://www.worldremit.com/en/stories/story/2019/10/29/nigerians-in-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">200,000</a>: that is the diaspora at work).</p>
<p>He added that the startup is also at work on preparing for the next countries on the continent to expand its service, another area where this funding will go: &#8220;It will let us fast track teams, on-the-ground operational teams,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The bigger picture is that the market for financial services targeting Africans has been on a significant upswing and so we will be seeing a lot more activity coming out of the region, not just from home-grown startups, but also out of other tech companies increasingly doing more business in that part of the world.</p>
<p>Cases in point: in addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe acquiring Nigerian payments company Paystack last year</a>, just earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayPal announced a deal with Flutterwave</a> to bring PayPal services to more merchants in the region &#8212; specifically so that PayPal customers can pay merchants in the region using PayPal rails. Square&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/into-africa-tech-leaders-weigh-in-on-jack-dorseys-planned-move-to-the-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey, meanwhile never did make his intended move to the continent</a> &#8212; Covid-19 has derailed many plans, as we all know &#8212; but it shows that the company trying not to overlook opportunities there, either.</p>
<p>PayPal, to be clear, has been active in Nigeria <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/17/paypal-extends-payment-services-to-nigeria-9-other-countries/?sh=2c7a198f649b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2014</a> but partnering with a significant player in the region represents an important step for it: Flutterwave itself earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $170 million</a> and became Africa&#8217;s latest unicorn, in what is still a pretty small list.</p>
<p>The fact that there is so much more to be done with payments and more financial services leaves the door open wide for Kuda to move in a number of different directions if it chooses. Having customers in two countries, especially with one foot in the developed market and another in an emerging market, for example, gives the company an interesting window into the world of remittances.</p>
<p>Money transfer has been one of the very biggest, and most important financial services for African diasporas &#8212; alongside those from many other emerging markets.</p>
<p>Even in cases where people are &#8220;unbanked&#8221; and have no other financial footprints, they have been turning to remittance services to send money home to their families from abroad. Kuda, with its integrations into people&#8217;s salaries, could easily become an efficient, one-stop-shop conduit for that activity too. (That&#8217;s one reason, likely, that remittance startup, Remitly, has also moved into starting to offer accounts to its users in originating countries.)</p>
<p>All of this to say that Valar&#8217;s making a new kind of bet here, but one laden with possibilities and a differentiated approach compared to the rest of its investment activities.</p>
<p>“Nigeria is at a tipping point in the adoption of digital banking,&#8221; noted Andrew McCormack, a general partner and co-founder at Valar, who led its investment here. &#8220;With the rapidly growing, youthful population who are open to new financial alternatives, Kuda is well-positioned to benefit and will transform the landscape of African banking. We are excited to lead their Series A and continue on the journey alongside Kuda.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Laura Crabtree spent a good chunk of her childhood watching rocket launches on television and her entire professional career launching rockets, first at Northrup Grumman and then at SpaceX.</p>
<p>Now, the former senior missions operations engineer at SpaceX is the co-founder and chief executive of a new LA-based space startup called <a href="https://www.epsilon3.io/">Epsilon3</a>, which says it has developed the operating system for launch operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tools I had wanted did not exist,&#8221; said Crabtree. So when she left SpaceX to pursue her next opportunity, it was a no-brainer to try and develop the toolkit she never had, the first-time entrepreneur said. &#8220;I started looking at ways in which I could help the space industry become more efficient and reduce errors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining Crabtree in the new business is Max Mednik, a serial entrepreneur whose last company, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Epirus</a>, raised at least $144.7 million from investors including 8VC, Bedrock Capital and L3 Harris Technologies, and Aaron Sullivan, a former Googler who serves as the chief software engineer. Mednik worked at Google too before turning his attention to entrepreneurship. His previous businesses ranged from financial services software to legal services software, Mednik too had an interest in aerospace. His first job offers out of school were with SpaceX, JPL, and Google. And Aaron Sullivan another former</p>
<p>Part of a growing network of SpaceX alumni launching businesses, Epsilon3, like its fellow travelers First Resonance and Prewitt Ridge, is creating a product around an aspect of the design, manufacturing mission management and operations of rockets that had previously been handled manually or with bespoke tools.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They make mission management software for the launchers and for the satellite companies that are going to be the payload of the rocket companies,&#8221; said Alex Rubacalva, the founder and managing partner of Stage Venture Partners, an investor in the company&#8217;s recent seed round. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just the design and spec but for when they’re actually working what are they doing; when you’re uplinking and downlinking data and changing software.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As launch market matures, space opportunities on the ground take off&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/as-launch-market-matures-space-opportunities-on-the-ground-take-off/embed/#?secret=gdH8NFAckX" data-secret="gdH8NFAckX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rubacalva acknowledged that the market for Epsilon3 is entirely new, but it&#8217;s growing rapidly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was an analysis based on the fact that access to space used to be really expensive and used to be the provenance of governments and ten or 20 commercial satellite operators in the world. And it was limited by the fact that there were only a handful of companies that could launch,&#8221; Rubacalva said. &#8220;Now all of a sudden there’s going to be thirty different space flights. Thirty different companies that have rockets… access to space used to scarce, expensive, and highly restricted and it’s no longer any of those things now.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>The demand for space services is exploding with <a href="https://www.360researchreports.com/global-space-launch-services-market-17251139">some analysts estimating</a> that the launch services industry could reach over $18 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very similar story and we all come from different places within SpaceX,&#8221; said Crabtree. <a href="https://www.firstresonance.io/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9MuCBhBUEiwAbDZ-7qD6ykEgr1hEG3Pgt9b186qxq1NYZgKEErKtXf3Dgm0-XJKXWHhrExoC1sMQAvD_BwE">First Resonance</a>, provides software that moves from prototyping to production; <a href="https://www.prewittridge.com/">Prewitt Ridge</a>, provides engineering and management tools; and Epsilon3 has developed an operating system for launch operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;You’ve got design development, manufacturing, integration tests and operations. We’re trying to support that integration of tests and operations,&#8221; said Crabtree. </span></p>
<p>While First Resonance and Prewitt Ridge have applications in aerospace and manufacturing broadly, Crabtree&#8217;s eyes, and her company&#8217;s mission, remain fixed on the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re laser focused on space and proving out that the software works in the highest stakes and most complex environments,&#8221; said Mednik. There are applications in other areas that require complex workflows for industries as diverse as nuclear plant construction and operations, energy, mining, and aviation broadly, but for now and the foreseeable future, it&#8217;s all about the space business.</p>
<p>Mednik described the software as an electronic toolkit for controlling and editing workflows and procedures. &#8220;You can think of it as Asana project management meets Github version control,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be for integration of subsystems or systems and operations of the systems.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Named for the planet in Babylon Five, Epsilon3 could become an integral part of the rocket missions that eventually do explore other worlds. At least, that&#8217;s the bet that firms like Stage Venture Partners and MaC Ventures are making on the business with their early $1.8 million investment into the business.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the Epislon3&#8217;s early customers are coming from early stage space companies that are using the platform for live launches. These would be companies like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/stoke-space-wants-to-take-reusable-rockets-to-new-heights-with-9m-seed/"> Stoke Space</a> and other new rocket entrants. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;For us, space and deep tech is hot,&#8221; said MaC Ventures co-founder and managing partner, Adrian Fenty. The former mayor of Washington noted that the combination of Mednik&#8217;s serial entrepreneur status and Crabtree&#8217;s deep, deep expertise in the field.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We had been looking at operating systems in general and thinking that there would be some good ones coming along,&#8221; Fenty said. In Epsilon3 the company found the combination of deep space, deep tech, and a thesis around developing verticalized operating systems that ticked all the boxes. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;In doing diligence for the company&#8230; you just see how big space is and will become as a business,&#8221; said Michael Palank, a co-founder and managing partner at MaC Ventures predecessor, M Ventures alongside Fenty. &#8220;A lot of the challenges here on earth will and only can be solved in space. And you need better operating systems to manage getting to and from space.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In New York City, if you order a toasted bagel with cream cheese at a deli, you have to pay sales tax. Ask for that same bagel unprepared? You won’t. In Illinois, candy is subject to sales tax, but candy with flour is considered a regular grocery item. Meaning: A Kit Kat is tax-free, but M&amp;Ms will cost you extra. And in Colorado, your daily coffee cup is considered essential packaging, while the lid is not, making it subject to a nonessential packaging tax.</p>
<p>These examples may seem trivial, but they illustrate the idiosyncrasies of sales tax — a fee consumers pay on their purchases that must ultimately be reconciled with the appropriate jurisdictions. Though sales tax is arguably the most complex type of indirect tax, businesses must also contend with other indirect taxes such as use tax, property tax and value-added tax (VAT).</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Such taxes may be easy to understand conceptually, but their calculation is convoluted in practice — particularly for sales tax, which is governed by <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/state-sales-tax-jurisdictions-in-the-us-2020/">more than 11,000</a> unique jurisdictions in the U.S. alone. There is no reliable methodology businesses can use to calculate annual remittances based on previous years’ accounting formulas because local tax code changes as much as 25% every year.</p>
<p>For large corporations, sales tax compliance drives sky-high financial planning and analysis spending, and small businesses face an even worse predicament because they can neither afford outsourced tax preparation nor have the expertise to handle this filing. No matter a company’s size, failure to pay the correct amount of sales tax can result in severe penalties and even bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Now, a new legion of startups is emerging to help companies manage the intricacies of indirect taxes, including <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/">TaxJar</a>, <a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/">Taxdoo</a> and <a href="https://www.fonoatech.com/">Fonoa</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Why does this matter now?</strong></h2>
<p>Smaller businesses have, until fairly recently, managed to limp through tax season by selling goods and services locally, and thus operating within relatively consolidated tax jurisdictions. But e-commerce changed this in at least two profound ways.</p>
<p>The first is that even the smallest businesses have transformed from simple brick-and-mortar ventures to complex entities transacting in multiple places online, including via their own storefronts and websites, third-party vendors such as Amazon and Etsy, and wholesale channels. Previously, a small business may have calculated a single type of sales tax — traditionally for storefront enterprises. Now, they may have to calculate different taxes across an increasing number of channels and their resulting tax codes.</p>
<p>Second, e-commerce expanded companies’ geographic reach, allowing them to sell across state and country lines. Until recently, this was an unqualified advantage to small businesses, which benefited from outdated laws requiring most businesses to pay taxes only where they had established nexus, or physical presence. But the 2018 Supreme Court case of South Dakota v. Wayfair put an end to that, with the court ruling that businesses with digital revenue levels above a certain threshold must pay taxes in all states and municipalities in which they sell.</p>
<p>To a large extent, businesses have met the resulting increase in their tax obligations either sloppily or not at all. But the economic fallout from the pandemic is making such noncompliance far less tenable as state and local governments face fiscal shortfalls. With states traditionally relying on sales tax as a primary source of revenue (second only to federal receipts), local governments are beginning not only to enforce their tax codes more vigilantly but also to <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/covid-19-impacts-on-sales-tax-landscape">create new laws</a> that broaden the scope of taxable goods and services.</p>
<p>Given that the financial losses of the pandemic are projected to extend for years, it is unlikely states will revert to their previously relaxed standards of enforcement. Instead, it is far more plausible that COVID-19 will prove an opportunity for states to find new ways to capitalize on sales taxes related to e-commerce.</p>

Clearly, it’s the future, but what is it, and how can you turn your organization into a no-code company to get ahead of the trend?</p>
<p>No-code is changing how organizations build and maintain applications. It democratizes application development by creating “citizen developers” who can quickly build out applications that meet their business-facing needs in real time, realigning IT and business objectives by bringing them closer together than ever.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</p>
<p>Anyone can now create and modify their own tools without complex coding skills using no-code’s easy-to-use visual interfaces and drag-and-drop functionality. This creates organizational flexibility and agility, addresses growing IT backlogs and budgets, and helps fill the IT gap caused by a shortage of skilled developers.</p>
<p>Despite the many benefits, adopting a no-code platform won’t suddenly turn you into a no-code company. It’s a process. Here are three steps to help your transition:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Future-proof your tech strategy</strong></h2>
<p>For a long time, the threat of digital disruption and the subsequent need for digital transformation has been driving IT strategy. The pandemic made this threat all the more acute. Most organizations were forced to rapidly rethink their tech strategy in the new digital normal.</p>
<p>This strategy has been effective for many organizations, but it’s also been largely reactive. Organizations have been fighting to keep up with the acceleration of digital trends. The opportunity with no-code, which is still in its early days, is to make that tech strategy more proactive.</p>
<p>We find that many organizations still think about tech strategy from a predominantly IT lens without considering organizational structural changes that could be around the corner. Think about it: Having a critical mass of citizen developers in five years could dramatically change how your organization allocates resources, organizes departments and even hires talent.</p>
<p>Don’t future-proof your tech strategy for a slightly evolved version of your current organization, future-proof it for a fundamentally more democratized environment where everyone can build their own applications for their own needs. That’s a profound change. Here are three things to consider:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>, Atlassian&#8217;s wiki-like collaborative workspace, has been around for more than 15 years, and is often a core knowledge-sharing tool for the companies that implement it. But for the most part, Confluence is a business tool and looks like it, with walls of text and the occasional graph, table or image. But user expectations have changed, and so it&#8217;s maybe no major surprise that Atlassian is now bringing a stronger emphasis on design to the service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/confluence/supercharge-content-in-confluence">update</a>, for example, brings to the service features like cover images, title emojis and customizable space avatars (that is, &#8220;icons that <span style="font-weight: 400;">denote a &#8216;space&#8217; or section of Confluence&#8221;)</span>. The team also recently introduced smart links, which allow you to paste links from services like YouTube and Trello and have the service immediately recognize them and display them in their native format. Other new features include the ability to schedule when a new page is published and the ability to convert pages to blog posts (because, as it turns out, Atlassian has seen a bit of a resurgence in corporate blogging &#8212; mostly for internal audiences &#8212; during the pandemic).</p>

<p>&#8220;We ended up doing something that we called &#8216;love sprint,&#8217; where we prioritize about 30 features for the enhancements, which are all &#8212; if you think about the themes &#8212; about how you design information in this world where you have to read more, where you have to write more,&#8221; Natalia Baryshnikova, the head Of Product Management for Atlassian&#8217;s Confluence Experience Group, told me. &#8220;And there&#8217;s the attention span that&#8217;s kind of pushing its limits. So how do you design for that situation? How do you discover our content?&#8221;</p>
<p>Baryshnikova tells me that the team took a close look at how content production, management and delivery works in the social media world. But some of the new features are also purely a reaction to a changing work environment. Take the ability to schedule when pages are published, for example. Employees who work from home may work especially late or early right now, for example, in order to prioritize childcare. But they still want the content they produce to be seen inside the company, and that can be hard when you would otherwise publish it at 11 p.m., for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2127029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2127029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2127029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png" alt="" width="1024" height="592" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scheduled-Publish.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2127029" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>And having your content get noticed is getting harder because Confluence usage has dramatically increased in the last 12 months. As Atlassian noted today, more than 60,000 companies are now using the service. And inside those companies, those users are also far more active than ever before. The number of Confluence pages created from March 2020 to March 2021 increased by more than 33%. The average user now creates 11% more pages, but the product&#8217;s superusers have often doubled or tripled their output.</p>
<p>The use of Confluence has also helped many companies reduce their number of meetings, but as Baryshnikova noted, &#8220;not only are pages competing with meetings &#8212; but pages are competing with pages.&#8221; So using good graphics, for example, is a way for a user&#8217;s content to stand out in the noise of corporate content production. Which, I have to admit, strikes me as a somewhat strange dynamic. But I guess that just like on the web, in order to stand out in a corporate environment, you have to make the documents you produce stand out in order to get noticed. Maybe that &#8212; as well as the lack of watercooler conversations &#8212; is also the reason corporate blogging is seeing an uptick right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad is the latest proptech company to go public via a SPAC merger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix, Ariz.-based company announced Thursday its plans to go public by merging with Supernova Partners Acquisition Company in a deal valued at $3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction is expected to close in the second, or early third, quarter of 2021. The combined company will be named Offerpad Solutions and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “OPAD.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2015, Offerpad started out as primarily an iBuyer (meaning it bought homes from sellers who signed up online) and has since evolved its platform in an effort to be a one-stop shop for people looking to buy or sell a home. For example, it now also offers home improvement advances, as well as title and mortgage services. The company has raised $155 million in equity funding from investors such as LL Funds, in addition to hundreds of millions more in debt over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Offerpad says it has completed 30,000 transactions and achieved nearly $7 billion in gross transaction volume. The company projects it will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generate revenue of $1.4 billion this year, up from an estimated $1.1 billion in 2020. That compares to revenue of  $100 million in 2016. Offerpad also says it has had &#8220;positive per-home contribution margins&#8221; since 2016. </span></p>
<p>The company has ambitious goals, projecting revenue of $2.4 billion in 2022 and $3.9 billion in 2023. It is currently active in 16 markets, recently adding <a href="https://blog.offerpad.com/welcome-denver-and-nashville-to-the-offerpad-family/">Denver and Nashville</a> to the list.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supernova Partners, which spun up the SPAC for this deal, is led by Spencer Rascoff &#8212; a serial entrepreneur with plenty of prop tech experience who co-founded Hotwire, Zillow, dot.LA and Pacaso, and who led Zillow as CEO for nearly a decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIPE investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Zimmer Partners, as well as national homebuilder Taylor Morrison Home Corp.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="41NRwgVgUH"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">This is a good time to start a proptech company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This is a good time to start a proptech company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/embed/#?secret=41NRwgVgUH" data-secret="41NRwgVgUH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad says that by partnering with Supernova to become a public company, it expects it will be able “to accelerate its growth to capture more” of the market. The company currently operates in over 900 cities and towns across the country and plans to expand nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rascoff believes Offerpad “is incredibly well-positioned to grab a huge piece” of the online real estate market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“iBuying has barely scratched the surface of real estate, one of the biggest addressable markets in the world,” he said in a written statement. “In general, real estate continues to be mostly analog, in contrast to other industries like grocery, autos and pharmaceuticals, but consumers demand online solutions. As they bring more transactions online, we believe online real estate as a whole is poised to grow rapidly in the coming years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offerpad competes with companies such as Opendoor, Redfin and Zillow, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the transaction, existing Offerpad shareholders will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company and are expected to own approximately 75% of the combined entity at closing. Offerpad’s founder and CEO Brian Bair will receive high-vote stock that is expected to represent approximately 35% of the voting power of the combined company.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this month, real estate tech startup Doma, formerly known as <a href="https://www.statestitle.com/">States Title</a>, announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/proptech-startup-states-title-now-doma-going-public-via-spac-in-3b-deal/">go public</a> through a merger with SPAC Capitol Investment Corp. V in a deal valued at $3 billion, including debt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vega.xyz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a decentralized protocol for creating and trading on derivatives markets, has raised $5 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrington Capital and Cumberland DRW co-led the round, which also included participation from Coinbase Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Signum Capital, CMT Digital, CMS Holdings, Three Commas and a slew of others. The new investment brings Vega’s total funding raised to more than $10 million, according to Crunchbase </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vega-protocol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega founder Barney Mannerings launched the Vega project in 2018 with the mission of giving anyone the ability to create and launch a derivatives market. The company claims that by eliminating centralized gatekeepers and decentralizing governance, it can allow for instant settlement, remove conflict of interest from markets, reduce fees and enable the throughput necessary for high-volume derivatives trading. In short, it claims to be realizing the promise of blockchain technology applied to financial business models, which is mostly around eliminating operators sitting in the middle that essentially profit mainly by passing money from one party to another.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By allowing anyone to create and launch a derivatives market, we aim to give people the tools they need to hedge risks unique to their region, profession or situation,&#8221; Mannerings said. &#8220;Derivatives trading has been a pillar of traditional finance for a long time, but DeFi has not been able to achieve the capital efficiency and throughput required to make decentralized derivatives trading viable, until now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Vega is still under development. The startup launched its &#8220;t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estnet&#8221; (a testing version of its network, as the name implies) in the second quarter of 2020 and has had a number of iterations since.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZWRM9V7iZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/embed/#?secret=AZWRM9V7iZ" data-secret="AZWRM9V7iZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital on resources “to ship and test high-quality code,” among other things. This summer, Vega is gearing up to launch a “mainnet-ready” release of its protocol code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Mannerings said the company expects to see the first validators launch a Vega network that plugs into the Ethereum mainnet for the first time, allowing trading of real crypto assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company’s wallet software that is required to access the testnet is free and open-sourced, meaning that anyone can download to create a wallet and use the testnet. Vega has so far given out around 500 IDs for its hosted wallet, which allows people to use testnet without running the wallet themselves. There have been other IDs created, but the company has not been able to track just how many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjan Vinod, investment analyst at investor ParaFi Capital, said his firm is both a DeFi investor and user and, as such, has been monitoring the evolution of new blockchain-based financial primitives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The multi-trillion dollar derivatives market has been a missing piece in the core DeFi stack,” he wrote via email. “Leveraging a proof of stake protocol, integrated liquidity incentives, and permissionless market creation, Vega is bringing a novel and first-principles approach to decentralized derivatives. Vega disrupts the intermediaries traditionally controlling market creation, settlement, collateral management, and pricing in the derivatives market.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trading platforms are being valued more like high-margin video games than software stocks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid all the news of the last few days, you might have missed that <a href="https://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a>, an Israeli consumer stock-trading service, is going public in the United States via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about the SPAC bit: If you want a rundown of the deal itself, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">Mary Ann has you covered</a>. What matters for our purposes is that eToro competes with Robinhood in the United States, though it retains a strong European user base. And, thanks to the fact that it is SPACing itself onto the public markets, we now have lots of its financial data to play with.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You can see where we&#8217;re going with this. With Robinhood somewhere between a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/business/robinhood-gamestop.html">sheaf of lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/robinhood-hires-google-veteran-to-lead-product-ahead-of-ipo.html">an IPO</a>, the eToro data could provide an interesting insight into the world in which its zero-cost trading competitor operates. If we want to better understand Robinhood, perhaps eToro can provide some clarity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;re going into the eToro investor deck, first asking ourselves what we think of its numbers and financial health and valuation. Then we&#8217;ll compare what we learned against what we know about Robinhood&#8217;s own business. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>eToro is going public</h2>
<p>The eToro-SPAC deal is a big one, weighing in at over $10 billion in calculated value. Whether the markets will support the valuation isn&#8217;t clear, but the debut matters for the Israeli startup market and the returns of a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etoro/company_financials">goodly number</a> of venture capitalists and other capital pools.</p>
<p>What do its SPAC-backers see in eToro that could be worth so much? Let&#8217;s get into the deck, which you can open up <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/investors/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>To illustrate both its recent growth and also how relaxed the rules are on what companies can share in their SPAC presentations, eToro has included its full-year 2020 results and its January 2021 results. Why? Because, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/as-coinbase-looks-to-list-robinhood-rides-the-crypto-boom/">like Robinhood and others</a>, it had a big start to the year. So, eToro wants to show off how well.</p>
<p>For example, this chart shows that eToro had a good 2020, and an <em>incredible</em> start to 2021:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126922" style="width: 440px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126922" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126922 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png" alt="" width="430" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126922" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eToro</p></div></p>
<p>Impressive, right? eToro later breaks the 2020/2021 split into numbers, noting that it recorded an average of 192,000 registrations per month in 2019, 440,000 per month in 2020 and 1.223 million in January 2021. The implication the company is trying to impart on investors is obvious: If you like our past growth, just look at what this teaser 2021 data point could mean!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is expanding customer deliveries via electric cargo vehicle to San Francisco, making the Bay Area the second of 16 total cities the company expects to bring its Rivian-sourced EVs to in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco&#8217;s unique terrain and climate were a couple of the reasons Amazon said it chose the city for its second round of testing. Its EVs, which were designed and built in partnership with Rivian, can last up to 150 miles on a single charge. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/amazon-begins-testing-customer-deliveries-using-rivian-electric-vans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon began testing its electric delivery van in Los Angeles in early February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of its Climate Pledge, which involves the purchase of 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/amazon-debuts-its-first-fully-electric-delivery-vehicle-created-in-partnership-with-rivian/">unveiled the vans last October</a>, and has said it aims to have 10,000 of the vehicles operational by next year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Area deliveries will initially come out of Amazon&#8217;s station in Richmond, California, just one of the many delivery stations the e-commerce giant is redesigning to service its new fleet of EVs. A recent $200 million investment into a new delivery station in the heart of San Francisco signals Amazon’s push to significantly increase deliveries in the city. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what we&#8217;ve seen, this is one of the fastest modern commercial electrification programs, and we’re incredibly proud of that,” said Ross Rachey, director of Amazon’s global fleet and products in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon isn’t the only company to recognize the logic behind electrifying delivery fleets for short trips within cities: DHL says zero-emission vehicles already make up 20% of its fleet, UPS has placed an order for 10,000 EVs and FedEx has pledged to replace 100% of its fleet with electric vehicles by 2040. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In cybersecurity, nothing is &#8220;unhackable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security bugs are an unavoidable consequence of an online world, but how companies receive and respond to hackers can make or break them. Get it right, and you build bonds with the security and hacker community and improve your security by fixing flaws before malicious actors do. Get it wrong — well, you can imagine the rest.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re thrilled that Katie Moussouris, founder and chief executive at Luta Security, will give a crash course in bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage 2021</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moussouris is a pioneer and one of the leading experts in vulnerability disclosure, and has helped some of the largest companies and government departments — from Microsoft to the Pentagon — change how they respond to hackers and security researchers. This cultural shift helped transform the security industry, creating a way for hackers to find, report and get paid for the vulnerabilities they find, while carving out an entire industry dedicated to helping to crowdsource and coordinate security fixes.</p>
<p>In 2016, Moussouris founded Luta Security to advise companies and governments on the benefits of security research and how to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> session, you will hear the good, the bad and the ugly that startups will face when managing vulnerability disclosures.</p>
<p>Moussouris joins a growing list of speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>, an event packed with breakout sessions focused on all the core competencies that a startup needs to be successful. Here’s a preview of some of the sessions going down at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>:</p>
<ul>

		David Edmonson is vice president of State Policy and Government Relations at <a href="http://technet.org/">TechNet</a>, the national network of technology companies that promotes the growth of the innovation economy through bipartisan advocacy at the federal and state level in all 50 states.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">American tech companies are engaged in a worldwide competition for top talent that can pick and choose where they want to live or where they want to launch the next great startup. With the expansion of remote work and tech talent spread across the country, there are larger amounts of venture capital investment and opportunity available to companies. States should enact policies that embrace businesses and are welcoming for entrepreneurs and employees. However, far too many states are doing the opposite and trying to enact anti-equality legislation that will hurt business.</p>
<p>There are a number of states that are currently considering anti-LGBTQ legislation, including Montana, Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Missouri, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, North Dakota, Mississippi and Alabama. These bills would cause irrevocable harm to tech employees and their families who may already be marginalized and susceptible to harassment.</p>
<p>The tech industry should therefore be more vigilant than ever in opposing discriminatory state-level legislation that would target workers and their families, become an economic liability, and negatively impact businesses’ ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Anti-LGBTQ bills are not just harmful on the human level, they’re bad economics, as well.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Tech employees want to know that they will be treated fairly as they move through their daily lives and that they, their colleagues and their families are protected from discrimination. And tech companies want to do business in states where they can recruit top talent to promote innovation. Laws that discriminate are a major barrier to that effort.</p>
<p>And states that care about the growth of their innovation economies should not erect institutional barriers to opportunity and make it harder to convince people to call their state home.</p>
<p>Anti-LGBTQ bills are not just harmful on the human level, they’re bad economics, as well.  As states struggle to rebuild their economies post-pandemic, anti-LGBTQ legislation would negatively affect travel, tourism and business investments.</p>
<p>There is precedence. When North Carolina passed a law banning transgender people from using public restrooms in 2016, it cost the state approximately $630 million in less than a year, and 2,000 new jobs were lost due to halted corporate investments. In Indiana, citing a dangerous <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/03/28/angies-list-canceling-eastside-expansion-rfra/70590738/">anti-LGBTQ law</a>, Indianapolis-based Angie’s List froze a $40 million, 1,000-job expansion. Visit Indy found that the <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/25/official-rfra-cost-indy-up-12-conventions-and-60m/79328422/">state lost</a> at least 12 conventions and $60 million in revenue after the passage of the legislation.</p>
<p>In Arizona, an economic development <a href="https://tucson.com/business/boycott-over-sb-cost-ariz-million-in-convention-business-study/article_1a966732-f33b-11df-814c-001cc4c03286.html">study</a> estimated potential economic damage of more than $140 million in lost meetings and conventions over three years after passage of a bill that was hostile to LGBTQ people and subsequently vetoed by their governor.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why TechNet, on behalf of our <a href="http://technet.org/membership/members">member companies</a>, recently spoke out against proposed anti-LGBTQ legislation in Montana, New Hampshire and elsewhere, making the case that welcoming, inclusive states are now 21st century economic imperatives. We plan to do so in any state that proposes similar discriminatory legislation.</p>
<p>We recognize the work these states have done to help the technology sector grow and be competitive in a national and global economy, but we caution legislators from doing anything that would make it more challenging to compete for the talented and highly educated workers many companies are looking to hire.</p>
<p>Businesses — and states — thrive when they are open to everyone. LGBTQ people are our family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors and community leaders. They deserve the same rights and opportunities.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Montana, Tennessee and elsewhere are preparing to send unconscionable anti-LGBTQ bills to their governors shortly for signing. We strongly encourage state lawmakers to reject these extreme proposals to ban the LGBTQ community from fully participating in all aspects of society.</p>
<p>The technology industry will continue to take a strong public stance in opposing these bills, as they would be immensely harmful to our families, our employees, and the communities in which we thrive.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/nvidia-officially-launches-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-for-5-per-month/">Last year</a>, when Nvidia originally introduced paid plans for GeForce Now, the company was pretty transparent with its user base. You could pay $4.99 per month to access the Founders edition, but the company was going to raise the subscription fee at some point. And it sounds like Nvidia has made up its mind and thinks the paid subscription is worth $9.99 per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>If you’re not familiar with GeForce Now, it lets you start a game on a powerful gaming PC in a data center near you. You get a video stream on your computer, mobile phone, tablet or TV of the game running in a data center — GeForce Now uses a web app on iOS and iPadOS and is available on a limited number of Android TV devices. When you press a button on your controller, the action is relayed to the server so you can interact with the game. All of this happens in tens of milliseconds, making it one of the smoothest cloud gaming experiences available right now.</p>
<p>Compared to Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, Nvidia isn’t starting its own game store. GeForce Now customers launch games they already own. The platform supports Steam, Epic Games, GOG.com and Ubisoft’s launcher.</p>
<p>Game publishers have to opt in to GeForce Now, which means that you can’t launch <em>all</em> your games that you own in your Steam library. Right now, GeForce Now supports around 800 games that you can find <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to try GeForce Now, you can start playing for free. Nvidia offers a free membership that should be considered as a free trial. First, you have to wait in a queue until a free server is available — it can take five, 10 or 15 minutes.</p>
<p>After that, you’re limited to one-hour sessions. When you’ve played for an hour, you’re kicked out of the server. You can still start the game again, but you’ll have to go through the queue one more time.</p>
<p>If you become a paid member, games start nearly instantly and you can play up to six hours at a time. Similarly, you can start the game instantly after your six hours are up. Paid members also get RTX-enabled graphics.</p>

<p>When it comes to specifications, Nvidia has several configurations with different CPUs, graphic cards and RAM. If you play Fortnite, you might not get the best rig as you can get very high graphics on a medium-range PC. But if you launch Cyberpunk 2077, the service tries to prioritize better rigs.</p>
<p>Nvidia says it has attracted nearly 10 million users for its cloud gaming service. It’s unclear how many of them are paying for a subscription.</p>
<p>The company doubled the number of data centers in the last year. There are now more than 20 data centers operated by Nvidia or local partners. The company plans to expand capacity in existing data centers, and add new data centers in Phoenix, Montreal and Australia.</p>
<p>There will be some quality-of-life updates as well, such as the ability to link games with your account to make it easier to launch them and more aggressive preloading of games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B payments space has been on fire for a while, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only fueled mass adoption of digitizing finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regions like Latin America, the need for innovation in the sector is even more paramount than in the United States with so many people still relying on outdated processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Mexico City-based startup, <a href="http://www.higo.io">Higo.io</a>, is out to transform B2B payments for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) in Latin America, starting with its home country.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodolfo Corcuera, Juan José Fernández and Daniel Tamayo founded the company in January 2020, recognizing that the process of paying vendors for business owners is largely “manual and cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, small businesses mostly handle payables with nothing more than spreadsheets and email and legacy bank accounts,” CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfo-corcuera-meier-58377844/">Corcuera</a> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio formed Higo to automate processes and provide visibility into cash flow, particularly for small businesses. “Informal” businesses make up about 23% of Mexico’s GDP, according to data from <a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/boletines/2019/especiales/ENAPROCE2018.pdf">INEGI</a>, the government&#8217;s National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Higo launched its SaaS platform last November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the startup has raised $3.3 million from a group of U.S.-based investors including Homebrew (which led the round), Susa Ventures, Haystack and J Ventures. The financing is the latest in a string of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/mexico-city-based-pay-on-demand-startup-minu-nabs-14m-series-a/">fintech-related fundings</a> in Mexico that TechCrunch has covered as of late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo wants shake up the payments scene in the region by creating an alternative to traditional banking for businesses to pay each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build the Venmo for B2B payments in Latin America,” Corcuera told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the goal is to help SMB owners deal less with tedious tasks and more on generating revenues and profits for their businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers so far include hundreds of small business owners and the company aims to have “thousands” of customers by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-invoicing is ubiquitous in the States and in the U.S., receiving a PDF invoice is enough,” Corcuera told TechCrunch. “But in Mexico, it has to be electronic to be [tax] <a href="https://www.sat.gob.mx/ordenamiento/18355/ley-del-impuesto-sobre-la-renta">deductible by law</a>. With our platform, invoices are automatically populated so businesses can have visibility into what has to be paid, what vendors they owe and when they owe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera is no stranger to running companies, having launched a housecleaning marketplace at the age of 23 in 2013. He also founded Tandem, an office management platform, in 2018, to help office managers streamline their procurement needs. As is often the case for founders, it was during the process of growing that company that Corcuera realized how painful and time consuming it was for businesses to manage their payables and receivables. That led him to come up with the concept behind Higo.io. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallardo was previously COO at Swap, a Mexican challenger bank, and also was one of the founding members of Uber’s Mexican operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Higo plans to use its new capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in part to boost its six-person staff, particularly beefing up its engineering team so that it can “scale as fast as possible,” according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company&#8217;s efforts are focused exclusively on the Mexican market, which in of itself is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Later we will expand in Latin America. We see a very clear opportunity in similar markets across the region,&#8221; Corcuera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Satya Patel said his San Francisco-based VC firm believes there’s a massive opportunity in Latin America given the move to digital payments. The investment in Higo marks Homebrew’s third in the region in the past 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an exceptional team focused on a problem that is visceral for businesses in Mexico in particular,” Patel told TechCrunch. “They are able to provide businesses with a real-time view of their cash flow and working capital. Without it, they are at risk. So the opportunity is to tackle this acute pain point being felt by a lot of businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The region&#8217;s payments ecosystem, he said, is still very nascent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being the intermediary for B2B tax information gives Higo an opportunity to provide a real alternative to the traditional way Mexicans are used to doing banking and business,” Patel added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.openreel.com">OpenReel</a>, a startup that makes it easier for teams to record videos remotely, has raised $19 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Lee Firestone told me that he and CTO Joe Mathew first started a video agency together, but when they were given &#8220;a pretty significant project&#8221; that involved remote production, they weren&#8217;t satisfied with any of the existing solutions and ended up &#8220;spending over a year to build this technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of teams that have figured out their own approach to remote video production, particularly in the past year. (Here at TechCrunch, it has mostly involved shipping cameras and lights to writers, followed by lots of tech troubleshooting conversations.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But OpenReel&#8217;s &#8220;remote camera&#8221; technology is supposed to make the process much simpler, while also giving production members more control. The software allows a remote director to control a webcam or mobile device, along with up to four people recording and four people viewing the shoot in real time. The footage (which can be 4K quality) is stored locally, then automatically uploaded after the shoot. And it supports additional features like a teleprompter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you talk to our clients &#8230; they would have had to put together multiple different pieces of technology, shipping or not shipping things, and even with all that, they would not have gotten the quality and seamless experience for both sides,&#8221; Firestone said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2VtcHhbLb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/video-creation-and-editing-platform-invideo-raises-15-million/">Video creation and editing platform InVideo raises $15 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Video creation and editing platform InVideo raises $15 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/video-creation-and-editing-platform-invideo-raises-15-million/embed/#?secret=u2VtcHhbLb" data-secret="u2VtcHhbLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not surprisingly, demand grew dramatically in 2020, with Firestone recalling that the platform went from supporting &#8220;thousands of video shoots a year&#8221; to &#8220;10 or 20 times that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the company said that annual recurring revenue has increased 12x over the past year as clients like Dell, HubSpot, ViacomCBS and TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon Media have used it to record things like marketing videos, internal communications, customer testimonials and more. It has more than 200 enterprise clients, as well as &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of small and medium business customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a pent-up demand for content in these organizations that our technology &#8230; unlocks,&#8221; Firestone said. And he doesn&#8217;t anticipate that changing as in-person filming becomes safer post-pandemic.</p>
<p>The Series A comes from Five Elms Capital, bringing OpenReel&#8217;s total funding — debt and equity — to $23.9 million. Firestone said the money will allow the company to develop new product features (one possibility: support for livestreamed videos, rather than just pre-recorded footage), as well as continued global growth, after an international push last year that saw the platform launching across 125 countries.</p>
<p>“Five Elms loves investing in businesses that challenge the old way of doing things, and OpenReel does just that,&#8221; said Five Elms&#8217; Thomas Kershisnik in a statement. “OpenReel has proven itself as an important component of the remote technology stack as well as a vital tool in the broader content creation toolbox empowering enterprises to enhance their content and create more of it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before we get too far into this week’s roundup, I want to kick things off with an interview we haven’t published anywhere else. Earlier this week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/ford-expands-robotics-research-with-75-million-u-m-facility/"> we noted that Ford will be deploying some 100 researchers and engineers</a> to the new $75 million facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>The automaker told TechCrunch the set up is not an incubator, so much as “an extension of our global research and advanced engineering network.” Beyond the autonomous driving research, the company will be devoting a lot of research to how it can use third-party robots like Boston Dynamics’ Spot and Agility’s Digit, the latter of which was the centerpiece to a partnership <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/agilitys-two-legged-robot-digit-is-for-sale-and-ford-is-the-first-customer/">Ford announced a couple of CESes ago.</a></p>
<p>Currently, the company currently has two Digit robots, purchasing the first two commercial units. Based on how the partnership pans out, Agility could, perhaps, be a prime acquisition target for a company more actively engaged with the robotics community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shortly after the event wrapped up, we hopped on the phone with Ford’s Technical Expert Mario Santillo, who will help head up the expanded robotics efforts. Some highlights below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1831007" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1831007" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1831007" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agility-GIF-1.gif" alt="Ford Agility Robotics" width="700" height="394" /><p id="caption-attachment-1831007" class="wp-caption-text">Ford is partnering with startup Agility Robotics to research and test the use of is bipedal Digit robot. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford/Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p><strong>What kind of work is Ford doing in robotics, beyond the autonomous driving space?</strong></p>
<p>We’re really looking at all area of robotics. My team is focused anywhere from the manufacturing environment to more customer-facing applications, like Digit getting out of some delivery vehicle to deliver a package to your doorstop. Working with University of Michigan, they’re really looking for us to provide better use cases. We would like to &#8212; not necessarily develop the robots &#8212; but use robots like Digit or Spot to make them smarter and deliver things that Ford really cares about and to ultimately help humanity.</p>
<p><strong>How close are you actually working with the team at Agility?</strong></p>
<p>We’re working very closely. We’re in almost daily stand-ups in terms of getting everything up and running. We just got our Digit in Dearborn, just a couple of months ago. We have another Digit, which is sitting out in Palo Alto, so they’re a little ahead of us, in terms of actually getting real use cases. We work very well with Agility Robotics. There’s nothing hidden from either side. We just want to come together in a partnership and similar to the University of Michigan, we want to come together to make this thing better, useful and safe.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the actual research, what role does the university play?</strong></p>
<p>The university is starting with the teaching of the next generation of roboticist, so that’s a huge role. The work they’re doing really spans all areas of robotics: air, land, sea, space, you name it. It’s amazing to see how interconnected things are. The walking lab, they’re specifically focusing on doing rehabilitation robotics, and that can directly lead into our Digit being more capable walking over rough terrain.</p>

<p><strong>For the moment, Digit is a primary focus.</strong></p>
<p>Digit is a clear, direct link, but Ford has a lot of wheeled robots, and a lot of work can feed into how we might better use these, based on research that’s going on at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>Is Ford actively looking into acquiring startups or technologies in the robotics space?</strong></p>
<p>I think Ford is always interested in evaluating new needs and companies as they come. I wouldn’t necessarily say, “no.”</p>

<p>In fundraising news, Hai Robotics completed a “nearly” $15 million Series B+ that adds to the Series B it announced late last year. The Shenzhen-based producers of the Haipick shelving system are one of a number of Chinese logistics robotics manufactures worth following. The system is tall and skinny, capable of moving up to eight boxes at once.</p>
<p>The company says it’s capable of improving warehouse operating efficiency by up to 4x. Like a number of entrants in the category, the pandemic has proven a big opportunity, as more people turn to e-commerce and companies look toward automation to avoid unnecessary shutdowns.</p>

<p>And just because I’m excited about baseball happening again, the Red Sox announced that they’ll be deploying UV disinfecting robots at Fenway this year. At the moment, the team appears to have only purchased three robots from <a href="https://www.surfacide.com/">Surfacide</a> (also the legal name for the murder of a proprietary Microsoft tablet). So this will likely be a small part of a larger effort focused on, “disinfecting close quarters like team clubhouses, training rooms, as well as higher-traffic fan areas such as suites and restrooms.”</p>
<p>The robotic umpires, meanwhile, will have to wait a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/12/976383147/minor-league-baseball-to-experiment-with-robotic-umpires">while longer for their MLB debut</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The running line from any CEO of an acquired company is that the company can do so much more with resources of the company that acquired it than it could on its own. Just seven months after being acquired, <a href="http://drone.io">Drone</a> co-founder Brad Rydzewski says that his company really has benefited greatly from being part of <a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a>, and today the company announced a significant overhaul of the open-source project.</p>
<p>The artist formerly known as Drone is now called &#8220;Harness CI Community Edition&#8221; and Rydzewski says the Harness CEO and founder Jyoti Bansal kept his word when he said he was 100% committed to continue developing the open-source Drone product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past seven months since the acquisition, a lot of community work has been around taking advantage of the resources that Harness has been able to afford us as a project &#8212; like having access to a designer, having access to professional writers &#8212; these are luxuries for most open-source projects,&#8221; Rydzewski told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that having access to these additional resources has enabled him to bring a higher level of polish to the project that just wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without joining Harness. At the same time, he says the CI team, which has grown from the project&#8217;s two co-founders to 15 people, has also been able to build out the professional CI tool as it has become part of the Harness toolset.</p>

<p>Chief among the updates to the community edition is a new sleeker interface that has a much more professional look and feel, according to Rydzewski. In addition, developers can see how projects move along the pipeline in a visualization tool, while benefiting from real-time debugging tools and new governance and security features.</p>
<p>All of this is an embarrassment of riches for Rydzewski, who was used to working on a shoestring budget prior to joining Harness. &#8220;Drone came from very humble beginnings as an open-source project, but now I think it can hold its own next to any product in the market today, even products that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security compliance may not be the hottest conversation starter, but it&#8217;s a critical and often grueling process that companies have to endure every year to show that their security practices are up to par. It&#8217;s a burden that bogs down startups more than others, and so it&#8217;s fitting that startups are trying to find a better way.</p>
<p>Enter security compliance startup Secureframe, founded by Shrav Mehta and Natasja Nielsen, which thinks it has.</p>
<p>The company is announcing it has raised $18 million at Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins and with participation from Gradient Ventures and Base10 Partners, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/secureframe-raises-4-5m-to-help-businesses-speed-up-their-compliance-audits/">led its $4.5 million seed round</a>, less than a year after it was founded in January 2020.</p>
<p>Secureframe helps businesses maintain two key cybersecurity certifications, SOC 2 and ISO 27001, which many companies require before they will do business. Secureframe&#8217;s compliance platform integrates with dozens of the most used cloud providers and apps to understand its customers&#8217; security posture. The benefit, the company says, is that it can help companies get their certifications and become compliant in weeks, rather than months.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Address cybersecurity challenges before rolling out robotic process automation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/address-cybersecurity-challenges-before-rolling-out-robotic-process-automation/embed/#?secret=bYy4AcJw8u" data-secret="bYy4AcJw8u" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Shrav Mehta, the company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s paying off, with a tenfold increase in revenue growth over the six months alone, and with more than 100 new customers, like software house Hasura and Omni, a Y Combinator graduate from the summer 2020 batch.</p>
<p>Mehta said the fresh funding round will help the company grow beyond the two certifications into an enterprise-grade risk and compliance management platform, such as the U.S. health privacy rules like HIPAA, and PCI compliance for secure card processing.</p>
<p>In the long term, Mehta said, he wants the company to design and offer its own compliance certifications.</p>
<p>In remarks, Kleiner Perkins&#8217;s Josh Coyne said Secureframe is leading the effort to modernize security compliance. &#8220;Secureframe is turning the industry on its head by automating compliance certifications end-to-end, serving as the single source of truth for commercial compliance,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Sentry’s Performance Monitoring software is used by development teams to trace bugs and performance issues to poor-performing API calls, database queries and other potential causes. Sentry’s Flutter SDK, originally built in partnership with Google, now supports Kotlin, Java for Android, Swift, Objective-C for iOS and C/C++.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other new features for its Flutter SDK include the ability to symbolicate, or transform into a human-readable format, Flutter-obfuscated Android builds; capture breadcrumbs, or a detailed record of events that happened before an issue, for user interface events and HTTP requests; and fatal crash support and offline caching, so app developers still get reports even if a user’s device goes offline.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sentry chief executive officer Milin Desai said, &#8220;These additions further expand our footprint, ensuring that all developers have visibility into the impact of their code—from frontend to backend—closing the observability gap and ensuring superior user experiences across all platforms and frameworks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sentry is currently used by about 68,000 organizations around the world that need to monitor the performance of their apps and fix bugs, like slow-loading pages, that frustrate users and result in lost revenue. Its customers include Atlassian, Cloudflare, Disney, GitHub and Microsoft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team at Google’s Area 120 in-house incubator says the idea for <a href="https://www.threadit.area120.com/">ThreadIt</a> came well before COVID-19 made remote work a necessity for large swaths of the globe. Of course, the pandemic certainly accelerated interest in the product among the team behind it.</p>
<p>“It’s adjusted the lens through which everyone sees it,” Keller Smith, general manager and founder, ThreadIt, tells TechCrunch. “It was a trend that was growing even before COVID-19, but, of course, the whole world changed overnight.”</p>
<p>ThreadIt, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/how-we-built-new-tool-without-ever-meeting-person/">which launches today</a> as a browser-accessible service and Chrome plug-in, is an attempt to address a perceived hole in the market. The system, which allows users to record short video messages, is positioned to sit somewhere between long-form, live- video teleconferencing and short texts and emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The steps for getting started are pretty straightforward. You:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record yourself speaking (you can rerecord if you mess up the first time)</li>
<li>Shoot the video off to selected colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interface borrows some key features from other Google offerings, including a drop-down that lets you determine how recipients can interact with the video, be it just viewing or adding their own clip. The app threads together short videos, organizing things chronologically into a single video conversation. The team behind the app notes that it’s been dogfooding ThreadIt, having never actually met in person.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=btp8lXo8hb" data-secret="btp8lXo8hb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Certainly the zeitgeist is right. Remote work is going to continue to be a reality for many, even well after the pandemic has mercifully faded. And, of course, short-form video clips are once again having a moment. TikTok or Vine, for work, perhaps, only with more straightforward approach to making and watching short, informational video.</p>
<p>“We found that by adding a little bit of structure and allowing you to break it up and show little pieces of your work, that actually creates a much shorter message that’s much more on-point,” says Smith. “That was actually one gap we saw in what was out there today.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXyj4n_Q1to?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=5&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The app, which is available to access starting today, is in kind of a public beta mode, as is Area 120’s custom. Essentially the team will gauge interest and collect feedback to see if the project is worth continuing to pursue. Services that have graduated include code education tool Grasshopper and travel app Touring Bird.</p>
<p>That means, among other things, that its still in early stage. As such, there are no doubt going to be a number of desired features that aren’t present. Having dealt with some health issues earlier this year that made speaking difficult, for instance, I would love to see a straight text-reply feature for those who can’t &#8212; or otherwise would prefer not to &#8212; appear on camera.</p>
<p>Deeper Google productivity app integration would make sense as well, though I suspect part of growing the app is deciding how much of a standalone to make it. Additional Gmail integration would be good, for example, but you don’t want to have to rely on that platform if the new app is designed to augment it.</p>
<p>The service can be accessed on smartphones via the mobile Chrome browser, but a standalone app would probably make sense down the road, as well. “That’s something that we would look at going forward,” says Smith. “That’s a great example of looking for the interest and response and then being able to go deeper with that.”</p>
