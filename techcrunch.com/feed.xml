										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week we saw some major backing of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/in-the-race-towards-web-3-financial-privacy-secret-network-attracts-backing-from-key-players/">Secret Network blockchain</a>, as significant blockchain players Arrington Capital and Blocktower Capital invested in the privacy-first smart contract platform. What this is signaling is the rise of privacy-oriented financial blockchain projects, which are crucial if “DeFi” (decentralized finance) is to have any kind of future. We have come to expect privacy in our ’normal’ financial lives, so we will expect it in the blockchain world.</p>
<p>Today there’s a new signal that this privacy movement in DeFi is taking off with the announcement from privacy decentralized finance company <a href="https://sienna.network/">Sienna Network</a> that it has raised $11.2 million from institutional investors and its public supporters. Of that raise, the private token sale raised $10 million from investors including NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, Skyvision Capital and others. It also raised $1.2 million on the DaoMaker and Polkastarter exchanges.</p>
<p>Sienna Network is built on the afore-mentioned Secret Network, and pitches itself as a privacy-first and cross-chain decentralized finance platform allowing asset holders to switch to privacy-oriented tokens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sienna is one of an increasing number of blockchain startups tackling the industry-wide problem of &#8216;front-running’. This &#8211; says Sienna &#8211; is where bad actors hijack future trades on public DeFi blockchains.</p>
<p>Monty Munford, chief evangelist and core contributor to Sienna Network said: &#8220;Sienna helps access to the privacy-preserving blockchain in a user-friendly way due to the blockchain’s inherent privacy design. Sienna saves no login information, no wallet data, no transaction data, or anything else. It does not even track its website or give any information to any Third Party.”</p>
<p>Here’s how a front-running scam works: A transaction on Ethereum can be preempted by someone else simply by them paying a higher transaction fee. It&#8217;s the close equivalent in the real world of trumping a trade on the stock market, just because you paid a higher fee to a broker. In other words, it’s a disaster if it continues to happen, and the entire infrastructure of decentralized finance is threatened because of this threat.</p>
<p>Commenting, Tor Bair, CEO Secret Network said: &#8220;We believe Sienna will be a key pillar of Secret DeFi and help drive mass adoption of a more secure decentralized financial ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google, which reaches more than half a billion people in India, is turning its services into tools to help the world&#8217;s second largest internet market fight the pandemic.</p>
<p>Google said on Monday it has rolled out a range of updates to its Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Pay services in India to display and boost authoritative and credible information about the coronavirus to help people in the South Asian nation find vaccination centers and other resources to navigate the crisis.</p>
<p>Google Search, which has been offering updates on the virus for more than a year, now also displays information panels with vaccine registration details in India and highlights the official Indian government website for the vaccine at the top.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Search and Maps that have been showing 2,500 testing centers in India now similarly also show locations of over 23,000 vaccination centers across the country in English and eight Indian languages. The company said it is working with India&#8217;s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to source this information.</p>
<p>Google, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, said it is also testing a Q&amp;A function in Google Maps in India to enable people to ask about and share local information on the availability of beds and medical oxygen in select locations in the country.</p>
<p>The new features rollout comes as India reports over 350,000 infections and over 3,500 fatalities everyday. The nation’s healthcare infrastructure is struggling to serve patients, having largely run out of beds and medical supplies. On May 1, India opened vaccination to those aged between 18 to 45, leaving people in scrambles as they struggled to register on the government website and secure the appointment for a vaccination dose.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/vaccine-finder-locater-india/">scores</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/walmarts-flipkart-to-cover-insurance-for-all-sellers-in-india-and-waive-additional-fees/">firms</a>, startups, entrepreneurs and investors have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">stepped up to fill this gap</a>. And Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp have become the real-time helpline as people exchange leads with one another.</p>
<p>Google said it is also using its various channels to help extend the reach of health information campaigns in India. This “includes the ‘Get the Facts’ around vaccines campaign, to encourage people to focus on authoritative information and content for vaccines. We’re also surfacing important safety messages through promotions on the Google homepage, Doodles and reminders within our apps and services,” it wrote in <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/05/an-update-on-our-covid-response.html">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTube, Google has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YTIndia">curated a set of playlists</a> with videos that offer authoritative information about the vaccine, the spread of the virus, and facts from experts. The company said it has also rolled out a COVID Aid campaign on Google Pay to enable users to donate to non-profit organizations such as GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation, Goonj, Save the Children, Seeds, UNICEF India (National NGOs) and United Way.</p>
<p>The company said a similar campaign to support several other foundations has raised over $4.6 million.</p>
<p>“As India battles this devastating wave, we’ll keep doing all we can to support the selfless individuals and committed organizations on the front lines of the response. There’s a long way to go—but standing together in solidarity, working together with determination, we can and will turn the tide,” <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/05/an-update-on-our-covid-response.html">read</a> a blog post signed by Covid Response team at Google India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telkomsel, a unit of Indonesia’s largest telecom operator Telkom, has invested an additional $300 million in ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, the two firms said Monday, just months after the network provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/indonesian-telecom-network-telkomsel-invests-150-million-in-gojek/">wrote a $150 million check</a> to the Southeast Asian firm.</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid Gojek working to seal a proposed merger with e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/tokopedia-ma-gojek-idUSL4N2M22GY">$18 billion deal</a> would result in a new entity called GoTo, according to media reports. Telkomsel’s investment today likely makes it one of GoTo’s top eight investors.</p>
<p>Gojek &#8212; which has raised over $3.45 billion to date from high-profile investors including Google, Facebook, PayPal, Visa, and Tencent &#8212; and Telkomsel said their strategic partnership will “open up new synergies as the two companies scale up digital services and deliver new, innovative solutions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two firms have maintained a deal since 2018 to subsidize the cost of mobile data consumed by the ride-hailing firm’s driver partners.</p>
<p>With more than 170 million subscribers, Telkomsel is the largest telecom operator in Indonesia. In addition to ride-hailing, Gojek has expanded to several additional businesses, including digital payments and food delivery in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Today’s news follows a $150 million investment Telkomsel made in Gojek in November last year. The two firms have since integrated several aspects of their services to accelerate digitization of micro, small and medium enterprises and bringing greater cost savings for driver partners.</p>
<p>Some of these include integration of Telkomsel MyAds with GoBiz, which enables Gojek&#8217;s MSME partners to use MyAds to efficiently expand their outreach to Telkomsel users, and easy onboarding for Gojek MSME partners to become Telkomsel reseller partners through the DigiPOS Aja! Application.</p>
<p>The two firms also co-market gaming services through Telkomsel’s Dunia Games and GoPay in collaboration with Tencent, providing greater value for PUBGM users, they said.</p>
<p>“Telkomsel is optimistic that this latest investment will open more opportunities for society to access advanced digital technology-based innovations developed by homegrown companies,” said Telkomsel chief executive Setyanto Hantoro in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether learning online or taking a class in person, every student knows all too well how important it is to have good notes from your classes as a key way to remember and apply what you&#8217;ve been taught. Now, an Amsterdam-based startup called <a href="https://www.studocu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StuDocu</a>, which has built a big and profitable business by way of a platform to help source and share the best student-created class notes, is announcing $50 million in funding on the heels of huge growth &#8212; a sign of demand and opportunity in the space.</p>
<p>The Series B is coming from Partech, the French VC, and it comes as StuDocu is gaining some critical mass: the startup says it now reaches 15 million users across 2,000 universities in 60 countries. What&#8217;s notable about that scale is not just the size but the fact that it had been achieved while the company was previously largely bootstrapped: Both <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/90237-70/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/studocu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a> note only about $1.5 million raised before now, but in fact CEO Marnix Broer tells me that it had quietly raised just under $10 million before now with previous investors including Piton Capital, Peak Capital and Point Nine Capital.</p>
<p>A lot of the focus in edtech in the last year of Covid-19 living has been on technology that helps people learn remotely as well (or maybe even better) than they might have done in more traditional, physical environments: improved streaming experiences, better approaches for teaching via a screen, tools for managing the experience, and so on. StuDocu both fits that mold, but also, in a way, is a throwback to the more basic approach we associate with learning: sitting in a class and taking notes during the lessons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That was the environment in which four students came together and first formed StuDocu.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, where StuDocu is based, a large amount of one&#8217;s evaluation in an undergraduate class is based on how you do in the final exams, and so the notes have perhaps even more disproportionate value.</p>
<p>CEO Marnix Broer, along with his friends Jacques Huppes, Lucas van den Houten and Sander Kuijk, saw an opportunity while still students back in 2013 to leverage the power of the internet and crowdsourcing, to make it easier for people who were studying the same course at university to connect together online and help each other by uploading notes from their courses and exchanging them with each other &#8212; the power of many being one way of better covering your bases in the knowledge department.</p>
<p>(Huppes has stepped away from the company in an active role but remains an advisor, the other two are still there, Broer said.)</p>
<p>Initially the product was &#8220;completely free,&#8221; he said, and was organically a popular enough concept that it not only picked up users at their university in Delft, but also a number of other schools. Then, as the founders approached graduation, &#8220;we decided we needed to earn some money,&#8221; and with the concept still going strong, they turned their attention to making their tool into a business.</p>
<p>Through a couple of iterations, &#8220;We finally came up with trying to keep as much free as we can in a freemium model,&#8221; Broer said. In StuDocu&#8217;s case, using the data they had amassed about how much certain documents were viewed, downloaded and recommended over others, they created a top 20% of all documents, which were labelled premium, &#8220;so you either upload your own docs or pay a small subscription fee to access them.&#8221; Conversely, this also means that 80% of documents on the site are all still free.</p>
<p>StuDocu also built a few pieces of technology into its platform to help fight against scammers or people trying to game it: the only users who it now measures to determine what is premium content are premium users themselves, who do not get any indication of what is premium content on the site and what is not, and are more likely more serious and heavier users of StuDocu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the best quality documents to stay up and the rest to drift down the pile, so that our users only experience great notes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we know if a few upload garbage we haven’t lost money on it. We just gave access for free and should not have. At the end of the day, it’s a community and we believe that will ensure the quality stays high.&#8221; They also incentivise people to review documents with lottery tickets and other rewards.</p>
<p>And it has increasingly been adding in more ways of scanning materials to determine that what people are submitting are actual notes about the subject at hand, rather than blank documents or random unrelated writing. A recent search partnership with Algolia, Broer said, should also help with more granualar document searches, rather than simply searching by university and course to find materials.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a compelling business model that helps square the issue that a lot of user-generated content sites have, which is that the vast majority are consumers rather than creators. Broer said that currently some 15% of its users pay for the service, 15% access it by uploading content, and 70% of its base are using it free and not uploading anything.</p>
<p>Through its gradual building up of a business from a tool that they built to help themselves, StuDocu went, Broer said, from &#8220;working in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squat</a>&#8220;, to taking a small and cheap space with interns, to what Broer describes &#8220;a normal office.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of other edtech companies that have identified the potential of providing platforms for students to help each other with learning. <a href="https://brainly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a>, another big one out of Europe (specifically Poland) built its concept not around notes but students helping each other answer homework questions, similar to <a href="https://www.chegg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chegg</a>. <a href="https://nexusnotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NexusNotes</a> out of Australia also has built a platform aimed at amassing notes; <a href="https://www.academia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academia</a> includes not just notes but also research papers; <a href="https://www.docsity.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docsity</a> also focuses on both class notes and papers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/studysmarter-books-15m-for-a-global-personalized-learning-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StudySmarter</a> also out of Europe also brings in notes but also applies AI to shape a person&#8217;s learning progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most similar and StuDocu&#8217;s biggest competitor of all is <a href="https://www.coursehero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Course Hero</a> out of the U.S., which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at around $1.1 billion</a> (a notable number here too, since StuDocu is not disclosing valuation).</p>
<p>&#8220;We consider ourselves the leading global player,&#8221; Broer noted, with more than 30 local languages supported across its catalog of courses and notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We help millions of students and have millions of documents, but at the same time we consider ourselves a hyper-local marketplace,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Three hundred people who are on the same law course can now communicate and share knowledge with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding will be an interesting test of both extending that hyper-local concept to more places, but also tapping into opportunities where the help that might come could have a much bigger impact.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, going down another age bracket younger than university to students of high school age (14 and up), the majority of them are studying to prepare for two sets of tests, GCSEs that you take in year 11 (aged 16/17 usually) and A-Levels you take in year 13 (18/19 years old), both based around very specific subjects and thus based on very particular curriculums that literally the whole country studies together. That is to say, even if individual schools or teachers might have different approaches or teach better or worse, at the end of the day, all the students will be taking the same examinations in their specified subjects.</p>
<p>This presents an interesting opportunity to a company like StuDocu, which could build a much bigger network of users as a result on an even smaller proportion of contributed, strong notes (since more of the users will all be needing the same materials). This is also a model used in other places, and Broer said StuDocu is well on its way to testing and slowly expanding in specifically these kinds of markets at the moment.</p>
<p>And you could argue that even if standardized tests were not a part of the equation, students will want better notes to use for other kinds of coursework, such as essay writing, or simply to help retain knowledge as they continue to learn. With some 200 million people currently in university education, there are a lot of opportunities to find variations on the premise.</p>
<p>There might also be possibilities down the line to work more closely also with universities to build out the course materials &#8212; also a big area considering that a lot of professors already provide notes for their lectures to students &#8212; although Broer said that for now its focus is remaining on students and their needs, since in many cases professors still do not do this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for all of these reasons that investors are there for StuDocu&#8217;s funding.</p>
<p>“StuDocu is a platform already helping millions of students around the world, and we’re excited to partner with this talented team in their mission to make education more accessible to all.” comments Bruno Crémel, a general partner at Partech, in a statement. “When we met the team at StuDocu, we were wildly impressed with their data-driven culture and by how much students really love using their services. We look forward to working closely with Marnix and his team as they accelerate StuDocu’s global expansion and develop even more innovative ways to support students in meeting their learning goals.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse finally has an Android app that you can download from the Play Store &#8212; provided you live in the U.S.</p>
<p>The voice-based social network launched its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clubhouse.app">beta Android app</a> on Play Store for users in the U.S. on Sunday, and said it will gradually make the new app available in other English-speaking countries and then the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The social network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">valued at about $4 billion</a> in its most recent fundraise, launched as an iPhone-only app last year. The app quickly gained popularity last year, attracting several high-profile celebrities, politicians, investors, and entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">developing the Android app</a> early this year and started to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">test the beta version</a> externally this month. In a town hall earlier Sunday, the startup said availability on Android has been the most requested product feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan over the next few weeks is to collect feedback from the community, fix any issues we see and work to add a few final features like payments and club creation before rolling it out more broadly,&#8221; the team <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/welcome-android-users">wrote</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149613" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149613" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2149613 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="359" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg 2662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=1536,538 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=2048,717 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149613" class="wp-caption-text">Clubhouse download figures across some of its popular markets, according to estimates by mobile insight firm AppMagic. (Though Clubhouse&#8217;s precise download figures from other mobile insight firms vary, they all agree that Clubhouse app&#8217;s popularity has dropped in recent months.)</p></div></p>
<p>As Clubhouse struggles to maintain its growth &#8212; data from mobile insight firms including <a href="http://appmagic.rocks">AppMagic</a> suggests that Clubhouse installs have drastically dropped in recent months &#8212; the Android app could prove pivotal in boosting the startup&#8217;s reach across the globe.</p>
<p>Clubhouse could potentially &#8212; on paper &#8212; also supercharge its growth by allowing any user to join the service without an invitation. But the startup said retaining the waitlist and invite system is part of its effort to &#8220;keep the growth measured.&#8221; (Clubhouse has faced several moderation challenges in recent months.)</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s launch on Android comes at a time when scores of technology giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, and Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, have either launched their similar offerings &#8212; or announced plans to do so.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s clone of Clubhouse, called Spaces, has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to the A16z and Tiger Global-backed-startup. An unplanned Twitter Spaces, available on Android as well, hosted by a high-profile Indian startup founder on earlier Sunday attracted hundreds of listeners within a few minutes, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we head into the summer and continue to scale out the backend, we plan to begin opening up even further, welcoming millions more people in from the iOS waitlist, expanding language support, and adding more accessibility features, so that people worldwide can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them,&#8221; Clubhouse team wrote.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s beta Android app currently lacks a number of features such as the ability to follow a topic, in-app translations, localization, ability to create or manage a club, link Twitter and Instagram profiles, payments, as well as the ability to change the profile name or user name.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Android, we believe that Clubhouse will feel more complete,&#8221; read the blog post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disasters may not always be man-made, but they are always responded to by humans. There’s a whole panoply of skills and professions required today to respond to even the tiniest emergency, and that doesn’t even include the needs during pre-disaster planning and post-disaster recovery. It’s not a very remunerative industry for most and the mental health effects from stress can linger for decades, but the mission at the core of this work — to help people in the time of their greatest need — is what continues to attract many to partake in this never-ending battle anyway.</p>
<p>In the last three parts of this series on the future of technology and disaster response, I’ve focused on, well, technology, and specifically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">the sales cycle for new products</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/can-speculative-fiction-teach-us-anything-in-a-world-this-crazy/">the sudden data deluge now that Internet of Things (IoT) is in full force</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/">the connectivity that allows that data to radiate all around</a>. What we haven’t looked at enough so far is the human element: the people who actually respond to disasters as well as what challenges they face and how technology can help them.</p>
<p>So in this fourth and final part of the series, we’ll look at four areas where humans and technology intersect within disaster response and what future opportunities lie in this market: training and development, mental health, crowdsourced responses to disasters, and our doomsday future of hyper-complex emergencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2 id="Training in a hellfire">Training in a hellfire</h2>
<p>Most fields have linear approaches to training. To become a software engineer, students learn some computer science theory, add in some programming practice, and voilà (note: your mileage may vary). To become a medical doctor, aspiring physicians take an undergraduate curriculum teeming with biology and chemistry, head to medical school for two deadened years of core anatomy and other classes and then switch into clinical rotations, a residency, and maybe fellowships.</p>
<p>But how do you train someone to respond to emergencies?</p>
<p>From 911 call takers to EMTs and paramedics to emergency planning officials and the on-the-ground responders who are operating in the center of the storm as it were, there are large permutations in the skills required to do these jobs well. What’s necessary aren’t just specific hard skills like using call dispatch software or knowing how to upload video from a disaster site, but also critically-important softer skills as well: precisely communicating, having sangfroid, increasing agility, and balancing improvisation with consistency. The chaos element also can’t be overstated: every disaster is different, and these skills must be viscerally recombined and exercised under extreme pressure with frequently sparse information.</p>
<p>A whole range of what might be dubbed “edtech” products could serve these needs, and not just exclusively for emergency management.</p>
<p>Communications, for instance, isn’t just about team communications, but also communicating with many different constituencies. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a>, said that “a lot of these skills are social skills — being able to work with different groups of people in culturally and socially appropriate ways.” He notes that the field of emergency management has heightened attention to these issues in recent years, and “the skillset we need is to work with those community structures” that already exist where a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in the tech industry the last few years, cross-cultural communication skills remain scarce. One can always learn this just through repeated experiences, but could we train people to develop empathy and understanding through software? Can we develop better and richer scenarios to train emergency responders — and all of us, really — on how to communicate effectively in widely diverging conditions? That’s a huge opportunity for a startup to tackle.</p>
<p>Emergency management is now a well-developed career path. “The history of the field is very fascinating, [it’s] been increasingly professionalized, with all these certifications,” Clark-Ginsberg said. That professionalization “standardizes emergency response so that you know what you are getting since they have all these certs, and you know what they know and what they don’t.” Certifications can indicate singular competence, but perhaps not holistic assessment, and it’s a market that offers opportunities for new startups to create better assessments.</p>
<p>Like many of us, responders get used to doing the same thing over and over again, and that can make training for new skills even more challenging. Michael Martin of emergency data management platform <a href="https://rapidsos.com">RapidSOS</a> describes how 911 call takers get used to muscle memory, “so switching to a new system is very high-risk.” No matter how bad existing software interfaces are, changing them will very likely slow every single response down while increasing the risk of errors. That’s why the company offers “25,000 hours a year for training, support, integration.” There remains a huge and relatively fragmented market for training staff as well as transitioning them from one software stack to another.</p>
<p>Outside these somewhat narrow niches, there is a need for a massive renaissance in training in this whole area. My colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">Natasha Mascarenhas recently wrote an EC-1 on Duolingo</a>, an app designed to gamify and entrance students interested in learning second languages. It’s a compelling product, and there is no comparative training system for engaging the full gamut of first responders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Duolingo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/embed/#?secret=UPcJTBYjoT" data-secret="UPcJTBYjoT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Art delaCruz, COO and president of <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org">Team Rubicon</a>, a non-profit which assembles teams of volunteer military veterans to respond to natural disasters, said that it’s an issue his organization is spending more time thinking about. “Part of resilience is education, and the ability to access information, and that is a gap that we continue to close on,” he said. “How do you present information that’s more simple than [a learning management system]?” He described the need for “knowledge bombs like flash cards” to regularly provide responders with new knowledge while testing existing ideas.</p>
<p>There’s also a need to scale up best practices rapidly across the world. Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at <a href="https://www.projecthope.org">Project Hope</a>, a non-profit which empowers local healthcare workers in disaster-stricken and impoverished areas, said that in the context of COVID-19, “a lot of what was going to be needed [early on] was training — there were huge information gaps at the clinical level, how to communicate it at a community level.” The organization <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/news/explore/2020/projecthopeCHRHS">developed a curriculum with Brown University’s Watson Institute</a> in the form of interactive PowerPoints that were ultimately used to train 100,000 healthcare workers on the new virus, according to Cotter.</p>
<p>When I look at the spectrum of edtech products existing today, one of the key peculiarities is just how narrow each seems to focus. There are apps for language learning and for learning math and developing literacy. There are flash card apps like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> that are popular among medical students, and more interactive approaches like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/labster-gets-millions-from-a16z-to-bring-virtual-science-lab-software-to-the-world/">Labster for science experiments</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">Sketchy for learning anatomy</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for all the talk of boot camps in Silicon Valley, there is no edtech company that tries to completely transform a student in the way that a bona fide boot camp does. No startup wants to holistically develop their students, adding in hard skills while also advancing the ability to handle stress, the improvisation needed to confront rapidly-changing environments, and the skills needed to communicate with empathy.</p>
<p>Maybe that can’t be done with software. Maybe. Or perhaps, no founder has just had the ambition so far to go for broke — to really revolutionize how we think about training the next generation of emergency management professionals and everyone else in private industry who needs to handle stress or think on their feet just as much as frontline workers.</p>
<p>That’s the direction where Bryce Stirton, president and co-founder of public-safety company <a href="https://www.respondercorp.com">Responder Corp</a>, has been thinking about. “Another area I am personally a fan of is the training space around VR,” he said. “It’s very difficult to synthesize these stressful environments,” in areas like firefighting, but new technologies have “the ability to pump the heart that you need to experience in training.” He concludes that “the VR world, it can have a large impact.”</p>
<h2 id="Healing after disaster">Healing after disaster</h2>
<p>When it comes to trauma, few fields face quite the challenge as emergency response. It’s work that almost by definition forces its personnel to confront some of the most harrowing scenes imaginable. Death and destruction are given, but what’s not always accounted for is the lack of agency in some of these contexts for first responders — the family that can’t be saved in time so a 911 call taker has to offer final solace, or the paramedics who don’t have the right equipment even as they are showing up on site.</p>
<p>Post-traumatic stress is perhaps the most well-known and common mental health condition facing first responders, although it is hardly the only one. How to ameliorate and potentially even cure these conditions represents a burgeoning area of investment and growth for a number of startups and investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riskandreturn.com">Risk &amp; Return</a>, for instance, is a venture firm heavily focused on companies working on mental health as well as human performance more generally. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/">In my profile of the firm a few weeks ago</a>, managing director Jeff Eggers said that “We love that type of technology since it has that dual purpose: going to serve the first responder on the ground, but the community is also going to benefit.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CUI61bzSWs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/">With a third of its capital deployed, Risk &#038; Return is transforming how we think about emergency response</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a third of its capital deployed, Risk &#038; Return is transforming how we think about emergency response&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/embed/#?secret=CUI61bzSWs" data-secret="CUI61bzSWs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Two examples of companies from its portfolio are useful here to explore as examples of different pathways in this category. The first is <a href="https://www.altoneuroscience.com">Alto Neuroscience</a>, which is a stealthy startup founded by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/amit-etkin">Amit Etkin</a>, a multidisciplinary neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Stanford, to create new clinical treatments to post-traumatic stress and other conditions based on brainwave data. Given its therapeutic focus, it’s probably years before testing and regulatory approvals come through, but this sort of research is on the cutting-edge of innovation here.</p>
<p>The second company is <a href="https://www.neuroflow.com/">NeuroFlow</a>, which is a software startup using apps to guide patients to better mental health outcomes. Through persistent polling, testing, and collaboration with practitioners, the company’s tools allow for more active monitoring of mental health — looking for emerging symptoms or relapses in even the most complicated cases. NeuroFlow is more on the clinical side, but there are obviously a wealth of wellness startups that have percolated in recent years as well like <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.calm.com">Calm</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of therapeutics and software though, there are entirely new frontiers around mental health in areas like psychedelics. That was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/5-startup-theses-that-will-transform-the-2020s/">one of the trends I called out as a top five area for investment in the 2020s</a> earlier this year, and I stand by that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/osmind-pitches-clinical-management-and-data-analysis-for-mental-health-practices-using-psychedelics/">We’ve also covered</a> a startup called <a href="https://osmind.org/">Osmind</a> which is a clinical platform for managing patients with a psychedelic focus.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4kwEd1dQdR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/5-startup-theses-that-will-transform-the-2020s/">5 startup theses that will transform the 2020s</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 startup theses that will transform the 2020s&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/5-startup-theses-that-will-transform-the-2020s/embed/#?secret=4kwEd1dQdR" data-secret="4kwEd1dQdR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Risk &amp; Return itself hasn’t made an investment in psychedelics yet, but Bob Kerrey, the firm’s board chairman and the former co-chair of the 9/11 Commission as well as former governor and senator of Nebraska, said that “it’s difficult to do this if you are the government, but easier to do this in the private sector.”</p>
<p>Similar to edtech, mental health startups might get their start in the first responder community, but they are hardly limited to this population. Post-traumatic stress and other mental health conditions affect wide swaths of the world’s population, and solutions that work in one community can often translate more broadly to others. It’s a massive, massive market, and one that could potentially transform the lives of millions of people for the better.</p>
<p>Before moving on, there’s one other area of interest here, and that is creating impactful communities for healing. First responders and military veterans experience a mission and camaraderie in their service that they often lack once they are in new jobs or on convalescence. DelaCruz of Team Rubicon says that one of the goals of bringing veterans to help in disaster regions is that the veterans themselves “reconnect with identity and community — we have these incredible assets in these men and women who have served.” It’s not enough to just find a single treatment per patient — we oftentimes need to zoom out to the wider population to see how mental health ripples out.</p>
<p>Helping people find purpose may not be the easiest challenge to solve as a startup, but it’s certainly a major challenge for many, and an area fermenting with new approaches now that the the social networking wave has reached its nadir.</p>
<h2 id="Crowdsourcing disaster response">Crowdsourcing disaster response</h2>
<p>Decentralization has been all the rage in tech in recent years — just mention the word blockchain in a TechCrunch article to get at least 50 PR emails about the latest NFT for a toilet stain. While there is obviously a lot of noise, one area where substance may pan out well is in disaster response.</p>
<p>If the COVID-19 pandemic showed anything, it was the power of the internet to aggregate as well as verify data, build dashboards, and deliver highly-effective visualizations of complex information for professionals and laypeople alike. Those products were developed by people all around the world often from the comfort of their own homes, and they demonstrate how crowds can quickly draft serious labor to help respond to crises as they crop up.</p>
<p>Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, said that “COVID has really blown so much of what we think about out of the water.” With so many ways to collaborate online right now, “that’s what I would say is very exciting … and also practical and empowering.”</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsberg of RAND calls it the “next frontier of disaster management.” He argues that “if you can use technology to broaden the number of people who can participate in disaster management and respond to disasters,” then we might be reaching an entirely new paradigm for what effective disaster response will look like. “Formal structures [for professional frontline workers] have strengthened and that has saved lives and resources, but our ability to engage with everyday responders is still something to work on.”</p>
<p>Many of the tools that underpin these crowdsourced efforts don’t even focus on disasters. Sury pointed to <a href="https://www.tableau.com">Tableau</a> and data visualization platform <a href="https://flourish.studio">Flourish</a> as examples of the kinds of tools that remote, lay first responders are using. There are now quite robust tools for tabular data, but we’re still relatively early in the development of tools for handling mapping data — obviously critical in the crisis context. <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded.ai</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai/">I profiled earlier this year</a>, is working on building scalable geospatial analytics in the browser. A lot more can be done here.</p>

<p>Oftentimes there are ways to coordinate the coordinators. <a href="https://www.developforgood.org">Develop for Good</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/develop-for-good-student-volunteers/">I looked at late last year</a>, is a non-profit designed to connect enterprising computer science students to software and data projects at non-profits and agencies that needed help during the pandemic. Sometimes these coordinators are non-profit orgs, and sometimes, just very active Twitter accounts. There’s a lot more experimentation possible on how to coordinate efforts in a decentralized way while still engaging with professional first responders and the public sector.</p>
<p>Speaking of decentralization, it’s even possible that blockchain could play a role in disaster and crisis response. Many of these opportunities rest on using blockchain for evidence collection or for identity. For example, earlier this week Leigh Cuen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/radical-ethereum-entrepreneurs-are-redefining-what-rape-kit-means/">took a careful look at an at-home sexual assault evidence collection kit</a> from <a href="https://www.leda.co">Leda Health</a> that uses the blockchain to establish a clear time for when a sample was collected.</p>

<p>There is a lot more potential to harness the power of crowdsourcing and decentralization, and many of these projects have applications far outside disaster management itself. These tools not only solve real problems — they provide real community to people who may not be related to the disaster itself, but are enthusiastic to do their part to help others.</p>
<h2 id="The black swans of black swans">The black swans of black swans</h2>
<p>In terms of startups, the three markets I identified — better training, better mental health, and better crowdsourcing collaboration tools, particularly around data — collectively represent a very compelling set of markets that will not only be valuable for founders, but can rapidly improve lives.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6596.html">Normal Accidents</a>, Charles Perrow talks about how an increasing level of complexity and coupledness in our modern technical systems all but guarantee disasters to occur. Add in a warming world as well as the intensity, frequency, and just plain unusualness of disasters arriving each year, and we are increasingly seeing entirely novel forms of emergencies we have never responded to before. Take most recently the ultra-frigid conditions in Texas that sapped power from its grid, leading to statewide blackouts for hours and days in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsberg said, “We are seeing these risks emerge that aren’t just typical wildfires — where we have a response structure that we can easily setup and manage the hazard, [we’re] very good at managing these typical disasters. There are more of these atypical disasters cropping up, and we have a very hard time setting up structures for this — the pandemic is a great example of that.”</p>
<p>He describes these challenges as “trans-boundary risk management,” disasters that cross bureaucratic lines, professions, societies, and means of action. “It takes a certain agility and the ability to move quickly and the ability to work in ways outside typical bureaucratic structures, and that is just challenging full stop,” he said.</p>

	</p>
<p>Even as we begin to have better point solutions to the individual problems that disasters and their responses require, we can’t be remiss in neglecting the more systematic challenges that these emergencies are bringing to the fore. We have to start thinking about bringing humans together faster and in more novel ways to be the most effective, while coupling them flexibly and with agility to the best tools that meet their needs in the moment. That’s probably not literally “a startup,” but more a way of thinking about what it means to construct a disaster response fresh given the information available.</p>
<p>Amanda Levin, a policy analyst at the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, said that “even if we mitigate, there are huge pressures and huge impacts today from a warming world … even if we stop emissions today, [they] will still persist.” As one of my interviewees in government service who asked to go unnamed noted about disaster response, “You always are coming up short somewhere.” The problems are only getting harder, and we humans need much better tools to match the man-made trials we created for ourselves. That’s the challenge — and opportunity — for a tough century ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another 60 Starlink satellites — making 180 delivered to orbit in under two weeks — but the launch early Sunday morning was more notable because it set a new, key record for Falcon 9 rocket reusability. This marked the 10th flight of the first-stage rocket booster used for the launch, which sets a record for re-use for SpaceX as the rocket booster with the most successful mission under its belt.</p>
<p>The launch took place at 2:42 AM EDT, flying from Cape Canaveral in Florida. SpaceX also successfully returned the booster to its drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean for a tenth successful landing for the rocket, too, making it a record-setter in that regard as well, and setting up the possibility that it could fly yet again. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said it could be &#8220;possible&#8221; for a Falcon 9 booster to fly &#8220;100+&#8221; times with servicing and component replacement.</p>
<p>This Falcon 9 has previously flown on missions including the original uncrewed demonstration mission of Crew Dragon, SpaceX&#8217;s astronaut spacecraft, and seven prior Starlink launches. SpaceX has shown just how reusable its rockets are with its aggressive Starlink launch schedule, most of which have employed rocket boosters that have flown a number of missions before, including other launches for the broadband internet megaconstellation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since SpaceX is both launch provider and customer on Starlink, it&#8217;s actually crucial for the company to realize as many cost savings as possible during its frequent flights building the network of low Earth orbit satellites. Re-use of the boosters is a key ingredient, and one where the cost savings definitely accrue over time. Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1295883862380294144">previously said</a> that the economics are such that for its external customer flights, it&#8217;s at about &#8220;even&#8221; on the second use of a booster, and &#8220;ahead&#8221; in terms of costs by the third. During its Starlink launch program, SpaceX has repeatedly set and broken its own reusability records, indicating a key means of keeping the costs of building out its in-space satellite infrastructure is using flight-proven boosters as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is the 27th Starlink launch thus far, and SpaceX has another planned just six days from now on May 15, with at least one more likely in the works for later this month after that. The company hopes to have its broadband network built out to the point where it has global reach by the end of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the heart of Duolingo is its mission: to scale free education and increase income potential through language learning. However, the same mission that has helped it grow to a business valued at $2.4 billion with over 500 million registered learners, has led to tensions that continue to define the business.</p>
<p>How do you survive as a startup if you don’t want to charge users? How do you design a startup that isn’t too hard to lose people, but isn’t too easy to compromise education? How do you balance monetization goals while also keeping education as a product free?</p>
<p>For my first EC-1, I spent months with Duolingo executives, investors, and of course, competitors, to answer some of these questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">How a bot-fighting test turned into edtech’s most iconic brand, Duolingo </a>(3,300 words/13 minutes)</li>

</ul>
<p>One of my favorite details in the story that got left on the cutting room floor was Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn comparing his company to the elliptical. I was pressing him on the efficacy of Duolingo, and the long-standing critique that it still can&#8217;t teach a user how to speak a language fluently.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now, there&#8217;s a difference between whether you know you’re doing the elliptical or yoga or running, but by far, the most important thing is that you’re doing something [other than] just walking around,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What von Ahn is getting at is that Duolingo’s biggest value proposition is that it helps people get motivated to learn a language, even if it’s just five minutes — or an elliptical workout — a day. He thinks motivation is harder than the learning itself. Do you agree?</p>

<h2>There’s always a Tesla angle</h2>
<p>When I was working in Boston, the newsroom saying was &#8220;there’s always a Boston Angle.” In a remote, tech-dominated world, I’ll tweak it: There’s always a Tesla angle. While we all prepare for Elon Musk to grace the SNL stage, there’s a story you might want to check out.</p>

<h2>The clash of the CFOs</h2>
<p>While Equity usually keeps it light and punny, we chewed into a deeper topic this week: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/the-morality-and-efficacy-of-going-public-earlier/?+Exits%29">the morality of going public. </a>Startups are staying private longer than ever before, but one CFO argues that it’s a moral obligation to leave the nest and provide returns to the general public. We had that CFO on the show, along with another CFO at a company pursuing a SPAC. It ended up being the most interesting clash of the CFOs I’ve been a part of.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The growth of venture capital as an asset class has a role to play in this whole mess and has kept the nest warm for many startups. We talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/the-morality-and-efficacy-of-going-public-earlier/?+Exits%29">if the tides are turning</a>, or we’re saying goodbye to a world in which a company like Salesforce would debut price <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108800363785245318">for $11 per share. </a></p>

<h2>Where telehealth goes from here</h2>
<p>As I start to cover digital health, one of the biggest questions I ask and get asked is where telehealth goes from here. Virtual caretaking had an uptick in usage because of the pandemic but is now starting to slow as the world reopens and vaccinations are on the rise. For telehealth startups, it means crafting a pitch that explains why virtual care makes sense for the conditions you serve.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>I talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/expressable-seed/">how to become pandemic-proof in healthcare</a> with Expressable, a virtual speech therapy startup that just raised millions in venture capital money. Part of the startups’ product differentiation is an edtech platform that motivates consumers to asynchronous practice speech exercises with the help of parents and friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On this week&#8217;s Found podcast, we sat down with <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com">Dandelion</a> co-founder and President Kathy Hannun. Kathy came up with the idea for Dandelion while working at Google X, tackling some of the world&#8217;s most intractable problems, and making them tractable through the application of technology. Kathy realized that harnessing geothermal energy was a way to make an entirely new category of sustainable energy accessible at scale to markets where it makes the most sense over other green energy options.</p>
<p>Kathy told us all about how she ended up with her dream job at X, and then decided to make the leap from that to building her own company from the ground up to address a solution she saw an obvious need for. She also explains how despite dealing with some natural imposter syndrome finding herself at Google&#8217;s moonshot division solving problems with some of the smartest people in the world, but also how her natural inclination is to believe that she can solve any challenge she&#8217;s faced through, through a combination of dedication and learning.</p>
<p>We also heard from Kathy about making the difficult decision to change a fundamental element of how Dandelion&#8217;s business works, fairly late in the game, after realizing that the existing strategy wasn&#8217;t working. Her tough call literally came while she was scaling a mountain — it&#8217;s hard to get more allegorical than that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re looking at the Apple-Epic trial, Apple&#8217;s App Store advertising expansion, App Tracking Transparency opt-in rates, TikTok&#8217;s new SDKs for third-party apps, Google&#8217;s plans for its own take on privacy labels, and more.</p>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Apple-Epic Trial kicks off</h3>
<p><strong>This was the first week of <a href="https://www.axios.com/apples-app-store-epic-games-fortnight-trial-3cb9eac4-83d6-4ad3-a0ad-c98bfcd65192.html">the Epic Games antitrust lawsuit </a>against Apple over App Store fees,</strong> and already it&#8217;s yielding some interesting content &#8212; mainly thanks to the internal Apple emails that have become part of the trial&#8217;s exhibits. So far, we&#8217;ve learned how Apple thought about App Store fees in the past, have gotten a peek inside internal conversations, learned of special deals it cut for Hulu and how it thought about punishing Netflix for ditching IAP, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the highlights you may have missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&#8217;s App Store head Phil Schiller, previously Apple&#8217;s marketing chief, a decade ago <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/apple-s-schiller-floated-cutting-app-store-fees-a-decade-ago?sref=gni836kR">questioned if the 70/30 split would last</a>. In an email to Eddy Cue, he suggested that once the App Store reached $1 billion in profitability, Apple should cut its fees to 20-25%.</li>
<li>Despite having said he&#8217;s fighting for all developers, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in court admitted <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/04/epic-ceo-apple-offer-testimony/">he would have accepted a special deal</a> for a lower commission if Apple had offered one.</li>
<li>Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows?sref=gni836kR">disputing testimony from financial researcher</a> Ned Barnes, which said the App Store had operating margins of almost 78% in 2019. Barnes said he had access to P&amp;L estimates for fiscal year 2020, and statements from 2013-15, which aided in his calculations. Apple rebutted that it doesn&#8217;t allocate costs for the App Store so any documents discussing it wouldn&#8217;t have included expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Competition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple&#8217;s App Store VP Matt Fischer was <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-store-head-says-apple-promotes-competitors-apps-all-time?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheIphoneBlog+%28iMore%29">questioned over a 2016 email</a> where an employee said Fischer felt strongly about not featuring competitor apps on the App Store. Fischer said the employee who wrote the email was &#8220;very misinformed&#8221; and Apple has promoted competitors long before he joined the team in 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>App Store rejections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple said <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-says-less-1-app-rejections-appealed-developers">it rejected 33-36% of apps submitted to the App Store</a> from 2017-2019. Despite the number of rejections, less than 1% of developers appeal Apple&#8217;s decision. Most of the decisions about rejections are still upheld.</li>
<li>2017: 5.177 million submissions, 1.69 million rejections (33%)</li>
<li>2018: 4.79 million submissions, 1.7 million rejections (35%)</li>
<li>2019: 4.8 million submissions, 1.74 million rejections (36%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Juicy emails</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple offered Hulu and others special deals that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/apple-hulu-special-api-access/">gave them App Store API access</a>. In a 2018 email, an Apple exec confirmed Hulu was one of the whitelisted developers that had been given access to the subscription cancel/refund API which they had been using since 2015 to support instant upgrades using a two-family setup before subscription upgrade/downgrade capabilities were built.</li>
<li>Emails revealed Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/">tried to convince Netflix</a> not to drop support for IAPs and questioned whether it should take punitive measures when Netflix&#8217;s tests were underway.</li>
<li>Apple emails <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/04/apple-managers-were-conflicted-over-app-store-ads-before-launch?utm_medium=rss">revealed</a> internal conflict over the launch of App Store ads before launch, saying that ads would be at odds with Apple&#8217;s statements that it makes products without monetizing users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other tidbits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fischer <a href="https://www.imore.com/app-store-chief-epic-games-payment-hotfix-i-was-blindsided?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheIphoneBlog+%28iMore%29">said he was &#8220;blindsided&#8221;</a> by the payment update that kicked off Epic&#8217;s battle with the App Store, noting the developer and Apple had a good relationship previously. He recalled dropping everything to promote Fortnite&#8217;s Travis Scott concert on the App Store, which he described as a &#8220;really cool concept.&#8221;</li>
<li>Fortnite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417447/fortnite-revenue-9-billion-epic-games-apple-antitrust-case?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">made more than $9 billion</a> in 2018 and 2019. It <a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1389295991602380803">made</a> $5.1 billion in 2020.</li>
<li>Fortnite <a href="https://www.imore.com/october-potential-release-date-fortnite-geforce-now">may be returning to iOS</a> through Nvidia&#8217;s cloud streaming service GeForce NOW.</li>
<li>It was revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22419087/epic-v-apple-trial-sony-playstation-fortnite-cross-play-fee">Epic paid Sony additional royalties</a> beyond the 70/30 split to compensate for cross-play. Apple&#8217;s argument is that it&#8217;s being singled out over the 30% cut, when Epic was actually paying more to Sony but didn&#8217;t go after the console maker with the same complaint.</li>
<li>Apple and Epic had <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/apple-and-epic-once-planned-a-subscription-bundle-combining-fortnite-crew-apple-music-and-apple-tv/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29">once planned a subscription bundle</a> that would have offered Fortnite Crew, Apple Music and Apple TV+ in a $20/mo package. The cut of subscription revenue each would take would have been based on whether the user signed up through Apple or through Fortnite.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google to add a &#8220;Safety&#8221; section on Google Play in 2022</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Months after Apple’s App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">introduced privacy labels for apps</a>, Google says its own mobile app marketplace, Google Play, will follow suit&#8230;sorta</strong>. The company this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">pre-announced its plans</a> to introduce a new “safety” section in Google Play, rolling out in Q2 2022, which will require app developers to share what sort of data their apps collect, how it’s stored and how it’s used.</p>
<p>This includes what sort of personal information their apps collect, like users’ names or emails, and whether it collects information from the phone, like the user’s precise location, their media files or contacts. Apps will also need to explain how the app uses that information — for example, for enhancing the app’s functionality or for personalization purposes &#8212; and include their privacy policy, otherwise face &#8220;policy enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>But where Apple&#8217;s labels focus on what data is being collected for tracking purposes and what’s linked to the end user, Google’s additions seem to be more about whether or not you can trust the data being collected is being handled responsibly, by allowing the developer to showcase if they follow best practices around data security. It also gives the developer a way to make a case for why it’s collecting data right on the listing page itself. And Google says developers can showcase if their labels have been independently verified.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>TikTok is expanding its integrations with third-party apps</strong>. The company announced the launch of two new SDKs, the TikTok Login Kit and Sound Kit, that will allow apps on mobile, web and consoles to authenticate users via their TikTok credentials, build experiences that leverage users’ TikTok videos and share music and sounds back to TikTok from their own apps. The Login Kit allows an app’s users to sign in quickly using their TikTok log-in credentials, similar to other social log-ins offered by Facebook or Snap. Once signed in, users can then access their TikTok videos in the third-party app, potentially fueling entire new app ecosystems with TikTok content. Meanwhile, the Sounds Kit will let app users share their sounds or music back to TikTok as sounds.</p>

<p><strong>As Apple cracks down on the ad tech industry&#8217;s ability to personalize ads using user data, it is expanding its own advertising business with a new App Store ad slot.</strong> The new and more prominent ad placement is found on the App Store’s Search tab, which sees millions of visits from Apple device owners every month. The ad will appear in the Suggested section at the top of the list of apps.</p>
<p>Like Apple&#8217;s existing Search results campaigns, there’s no minimum spend required for a Search tab campaign, as these ads are called. Developers can spend as little or as much as they want, then start, stop or adjust the campaign at any time, says Apple. Ad pricing is based on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) model. The actual cost is the result of a second price auction, which calculates what the developer will pay based on what the next closest bidder is willing to pay. Impressions are counted when at least 50% of the ad is visible for one second.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s prompt that asks its users to opt into tracking on iOS 14.x uses scare tactics</strong> that suggests that Facebook could have to start charging for its app, if users didn&#8217;t agree to tracking.

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/wealthsimple-raises-610m-at-a-4b-valuation/">This mobile news application</a> lets you set your language and locale, then read through news summaries customized to you. But we wish they&#8217;d double down on a news reels feature &#8212; which is basically just a TikTok for news videos. Right now it presents a robotic narration of headlines overtop video news footage, that you then swipe through or double tap to like, as you would on TikTok. This could be even more useful, though, if the app would partner with news publishers already producing quality video content and make those the central focus of the video feed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-bike startup <a href="https://cowboy.com/">Cowboy</a> has launched the Cowboy 4, its newest generation of urban electric bikes. The bike will come in two different frames, a traditional frame, and a step-through.<br />
The C4 is basically an upgrade on the previous version 3, while the ‘C4 ST’ is a step-through model which the company is predicting will appeal to young people used to city bikes.</p>
<p>The C4 and C4 ST are both priced at £2,290/€2,490 inclusive of mudguards and are available for pre-order with a €100/£100 deposit starting from today cowboy.com, with deliveries starting in September 2021.</p>
<p>Cowboy has raised $46.1M in venture capital and largely extent competes with VanMoof (which raised $61.1M) and Furo Systems (£750K) to a lesser extent. The basic differences between the three are that Cowboy is moving closer to leverage the cloud and apps as its main differentiation, VanMoof tends to built things (like a screen) <em>into</em> the bike (and has an app), and Furo is more about ease of maintenance, and weight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cowboy says both bikes feature 50% more torque via their automatic transmission. There are no gears to change, with the engine kicking in as you turn the cranks. The removable battery weighs 2.4kg, giving the bike a range of up to 70km.</p>
<p>The heaviest version of the bikes is 19.2 kg including battery and both will hit 25 km/h (15 mph).</p>
<p>Adrien Roose, Cowboy Co-Founder and CEO said in a statement: “The Cowboy 4 completely redefines life in and around cities. By designing two frame types featuring our first-ever step-through model, an integrated cockpit, and a new app, we are now able to address a much larger audience and cater to many more riders to move freely in and around cities,” he added. “Our mission is to help city dwellers move in a faster, safer and more enjoyable way than any other mode of urban transportation. Be it wandering through the city or staying fit, it’s a reconnection with your senses and a rediscovery of the simple thrill of riding a bike.”</p>
<p>The step-through model is optimized to suit riders 160-190cm in height, while the normal C4 will accommodates riders 170-195cm tall.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149553" style="width: 752px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149553" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg" alt="Mike Butcher meets Cowboy&#039;s Adrien Roose" width="742" height="461" class="size-full wp-image-2149553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg 742w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cowboy-butcher.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149553" class="wp-caption-text">Mike Butcher meets Cowboy&#8217;s Adrien Roose</p></div></p>
<p>Doing a very quick test of the new bikes in a London basketball court and around local streets, I found both bikes to be very nippy on the off and a pleasure to ride. Cowboy is probably right &#8211; the step-through version is likely to appeal to a wide variety of riders.</p>
<p>Roose told me the bike has been custom-designed. Only the saddle and the carbon belt are made by third-party companies Selle Royal and Gates, respectively. The brake cables are now integrated into the handlebars and stem, brakes and pedals have new angles, and the rear wheel has a ‘dropout’ design.</p>
<p>Cowboy will offer a custom-designed series of accessories starting with a rear rack and kickstand. The C4 and C4 ST will come in Absolute Black, Peyote Green, and Sand Dune, and are available to pre-order now, with deliveries beginning in September. Both models will feature pre-fitted mudguards.</p>
<p>The bikes also now feature a wireless charging mont on the stem featuring a built-in Quad Lock mount to hold the rider’s smartphone and wirelessly charge it via the bike’s internal battery.</p>
<p>Tanguy Goretti, Co-Founder, and VP Software added: “The new Cowboy app [will show] remaining battery range, air quality en route and a wide range of live fitness stats.”</p>
<p>The app also has a new navigation screen, 3D map rendering layout, turn-by-turn directions, air quality index for routes, live fitness data, leaderboard rankings; a new community feature offering the ability to join curated group rides across capital cities in Europe.</p>
<p>Cowboy is also offering a free repair network across Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Austria and Luxembourg; 6 days a week customer support;  and a subscription plan operated in partnership with Qover which includes theft detection, theft insurance throughout Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The internet is now our nervous system. We are constantly streaming and buying and watching and liking, our brains locked into the global information matrix as one universal and coruscating emanation of thought and emotion.</p>
<p>What happens when the machine stops though?</p>
<p>It’s a question that E.M. Forster was intensely focused on more than a century ago in a short story called, rightly enough, &#8220;The Machine Stops,&#8221; about a human civilization connected entirely through machines that one day just turn off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those fears of downtime are not just science fiction anymore. Outages aren’t just missing a must-watch TikTok clip. Hospitals, law enforcement, the government, every corporation — the entire spectrum of human institutions that constitute civilization now deeply rely on connectivity to function.</p>
<p>So when it comes to disaster response, the world has dramatically changed. In decades past, the singular focus could be roughly summarized as rescue and mitigation — save who you can while trying to limit the scale of destruction. Today though, the highest priority is by necessity internet access, not just for citizens, but increasingly for the on-the-ground first responders who need bandwidth to protect themselves, keep abreast of their mission objectives, and have real-time ground truth on where dangers lurk and where help is needed.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">the sales cycles might be arduous as we learned in part one</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire/">the data trickles have finally turned to streams</a> in part two, the reality is that none of that matters if there isn’t connectivity to begin with. So in part three of this series on the future of technology and disaster response, we’re going to analyze the changing nature of bandwidth and connectivity and how they intersect with emergencies, taking a look at how telcos are creating resilience in their networks while defending against climate change, how first responders are integrating connectivity into their operations, and finally, exploring how new technologies like 5G and satellite internet will affect these critical activities.</p>
<h2 id="Wireless resilience as the world burns">Wireless resilience as the world burns</h2>
<p>Climate change is inducing more intense weather patterns all around the world, creating second- and third-order effects for industries that rely on environmental stability for operations. Few industries have to be as dynamic to the changing context as telecom companies, whose wired and wireless infrastructure is regularly buffeted by severe storms. Resiliency of these networks isn’t just needed for consumers — it’s absolutely necessary for the very responders trying to mitigate disasters and get the network back up in the first place.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, no issue looms larger for telcos than access to power — no juice, no bars. So all three of America’s major telcos — Verizon (which owns TechCrunch’s parent company Verizon Media, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">although not for much longer</a>), AT&amp;T and T-Mobile — have had to dramatically scale up their resiliency efforts in recent years to compensate both for the demand for wireless and the growing damage wrought by weather.</p>
<p>Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at T-Mobile, said that the company has made resilience a key part of its network buildout in recent years, with investments in generators at cell towers that can be relied upon when the grid cannot. In “areas that have been hit by hurricanes or places that have fragile grids … that is where we have invested most of our fixed assets,” he said.</p>
<p>Like all three telcos, T-Mobile pre-deploys equipment in anticipation for disruptions. So when a hurricane begins to swirl in the Atlantic Ocean, the company will strategically fly in portable generators and mobile cell towers in anticipation of potential outages. “We look at storm forecasts for the year,” Naillon explained, and do “lots of preventative planning.” They also work with emergency managers and “run through various drills with them and respond and collaborate effectively with them” to determine which parts of the network are most at risk for damage in an emergency. Last year, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/tracking-historic-weather-conditions-with-stormgeo">the company partnered with StormGeo</a> to accurately predict weather events.</p>
<p>Predictive AI for disasters is also a critical need for AT&amp;T. Jason Porter, who leads public sector and the company’s FirstNet first-responder network, said that AT&amp;T teamed up with Argonne National Laboratory to create a climate-change analysis tool to evaluate the siting of its cell towers and how they will weather the next 30 years of “floods, hurricanes, droughts and wildfires.” “We redesigned our buildout … based on what our algorithms told us would come,” he said, and the company has been elevating vulnerable cell towers four to eight feet high on “stilts” to improve their resiliency to at least some weather events. That “gave ourselves some additional buffer.”</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has also had to manage the growing complexity of creating reliability with the chaos of a climate-change-induced world. In recent years, “we quickly realized that many of our deployments were due to weather-related events,” and the company has been “very focused on expanding our generator coverage over the past few years,” Porter said. It’s also been very focused on building out its portable infrastructure. “We essentially deploy entire data centers on trucks so that we can stand up essentially a central office,” he said, empathizing that the company’s national disaster recovery team responded to thousands of events last year.</p>
<p>Particularly on its FirstNet service, AT&amp;T has pioneered two new technologies to try to get bandwidth to disaster-hit regions faster. First, it has invested in drones to offer wireless services from the sky. After Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana last year with record-setting winds, our “cell towers were twisted up like recycled aluminum cans … so we needed to deploy a sustainable solution,” Porter described. <a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2020/09/fn_one_hurricane_laura.html">So the company deployed what it dubs the FirstNet One</a> — a “dirigible” that “can cover twice the cell coverage range of a cell tower on a truck, and it can stay up for literally weeks, refuel in less than an hour and go back up — so long-term, sustainable coverage,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147530" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147530" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FirstNetHurricane_IN_STORY_768x475.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147530" class="wp-caption-text">AT&amp;T&#8217;s FirstNet One dirigible to offer internet access from the air for first responders. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AT&amp;T/FirstNet</p></div></p>
<p>Secondly, the company has been building out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=FirstNet+MegaRange&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">what it calls FirstNet MegaRange</a> — a set of high-powered wireless equipment that it announced earlier this year that can deploy signals from miles away, say from a ship moored off a coast, to deliver reliable connectivity to first responders in the hardest-hit disaster zones.</p>
<p>As the internet has absorbed more of daily life, the norms for network resilience have become ever more exacting. Small outages can disrupt not just a first responder, but a child taking virtual classes and a doctor conducting remote surgery. From fixed and portable generators to rapid-deployment mobile cell towers and dirigibles, telcos are investing major resources to keep their networks running continuously.</p>
<p>Yet, these initiatives are ultimately costs borne by telcos increasingly confronting a world burning up. Across conversations with all three telcos and others in the disaster response space, there was a general sense that utilities just increasingly have to self-insulate themselves in a climate-changed world. For instance, cell towers need their own generators because — as we saw with Texas earlier this year — even the power grid itself can’t be guaranteed to be there. Critical applications need to have offline capabilities, since internet outages can’t always be prevented. The machine runs, but the machine stops, too.</p>
<h2 id="The trendlines on the frontlines are data lines">The trend lines on the frontlines are data lines</h2>
<p>While we may rely on connectivity in our daily lives as consumers, disaster responders have been much more hesitant to fully transition to connected services. It is precisely in the middle of a tornado and the cell tower is down that you realize a printed map might have been nice to have. Paper, pens, compasses — the old staples of survival flicks remain just as important in the field today as they were decades ago.</p>
<p>Yet, the power of software and connectivity to improve emergency response has forced a rethinking of field communications and how deeply technology is integrated on the ground. Data from the frontlines is extremely useful, and if it can be transmitted, dramatically improves the ability of operations planners to respond safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Both AT&amp;T and Verizon have made large investments in directly servicing the unique needs of the first responder community, with AT&amp;T in particular gaining prominence with its FirstNet network, which it exclusively operates through a public-private partnership with the Department of Commerce&#8217;s First Responder Network Authority. The government offered a special spectrum license to the FirstNet authority in Band 14 in exchange for the buildout of a responder-exclusive network, a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which found that first responders couldn’t communicate with each other on the day of those deadly terrorist attacks. Now, Porter of AT&amp;T says that the company’s buildout is “90% complete” and is approaching 3 million square miles of coverage.</p>

<p>Why so much attention on first responders? The telcos are investing here because in many ways, the first responders are on the frontiers of technology. They need edge computing, AI/ML rapid decision-making, the bandwidth and latency of 5G (which we will get to in a bit), high reliability, and in general, are fairly profitable customers to boot. In other words, what first responders need today are what consumers in general are going to want tomorrow.</p>
<p>Cory Davis, director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon, explained that “more than ever, first responders are relying on technology to go out there and save lives.” His counterpart, Nick Nilan, who leads product management for the public sector, said that “when we became Verizon, it was really about voice [and] what’s changed over the last five [years] is the importance of data.” He brings attention to tools for situational awareness, mapping, and more that are a becoming standard in the field. Everything first responders do “comes back to the network — do you have the coverage where you need it, do you have the network access when something happens?”</p>
<p>The challenge for the telcos is that we <i>all</i> want access to that network when catastrophe strikes, which is precisely when network resources are most scarce. The first responder trying to communicate with their team on the ground or their operations center is inevitably competing with a citizen letting friends know they are safe — or perhaps just watching the latest episode of a TV show in their vehicle as they are fleeing the evacuation zone.</p>
<p>That competition is the argument for a completely segmented network like FirstNet, which has its own dedicated spectrum with devices that can only be used by first responders. “With remote learning, remote work and general congestion,” Porter said, telcos and other bandwidth providers were overwhelmed with consumer demand. “Thankfully we saw through FirstNet … clearing that 20 MHz of spectrum for first responders” helped keep the lines clear for high-priority communications.</p>
<p>FirstNet’s big emphasis is on its dedicated spectrum, but that’s just one component of a larger strategy to give first responders always-on and ready access to wireless services. AT&amp;T and Verizon have made prioritization and preemption key operational components of their networks in recent years. Prioritization gives public safety users better access to the network, while preemption can include actively kicking off lower-priority consumers from the network to ensure first responders have immediate access.</p>
<p>Nilan of Verizon said, “The network is built for everybody … but once we start thinking about who absolutely needs access to the network at a period of time, we prioritize our first responders.” Verizon has prioritization, preemption, and now virtual segmentation — “we separate their traffic from consumer traffic” so that first responders don’t have to compete if bandwidth is limited in the middle of a disaster. He noted that all three approaches have been enabled since 2018, and Verizon’s suite of bandwidth and software for first responders comes under <a href="https://www.telecompetitor.com/verizon-to-introduce-frontline-first-responder-network/">the newly christened Verizon Frontline brand</a> that launched in March.</p>
<p>With increased bandwidth reliability, first responders are increasingly connected in ways that even a decade ago would have been unfathomable. Tablets, sensors, connected devices and tools — equipment that would have been manual are now increasingly digital.</p>
<p>That opens up a wealth of possibilities now that the infrastructure is established. My interview subjects suggested applications as diverse as the decentralized coordination of response team movements through GPS and 5G; real-time updated maps that offer up-to-date risk analysis of how a disaster might progress; pathfinding for evacuees that’s updated as routes fluctuate; AI damage assessments even before the recovery process begins; and much, much more. In fact, when it comes to the ferment of the imagination, many of those possibilities will finally be realized in the coming years — when they have only ever been marketing-speak and technical promises in the past.</p>
<h2 id="Five, Gee">Five, Gee</h2>
<p>We’ve been hearing about 5G for years now, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/21/trump-calls-for-6g-cellular-technology-because-why-the-heck-not/">even 6G every once in a while just to cause reporters heart attacks</a>, but what does 5G even mean in the context of disaster response? After years of speculation, we are finally starting to get answers.</p>
<p>Naillon of T-Mobile noted that the biggest benefit of 5G is that it “allows us to have greater coverage” particularly given the low-band spectrum that the standard partially uses. That said, “As far as applications — we are not really there at that point from an emergency response perspective,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Porter of AT&amp;T said that “the beauty of 5G that we have seen there is less about the speed and more about the latency.” Consumers have often seen marketing around voluminous bandwidths, but in the first-responder world, latency and edge computing tends to be the most desirable features. For instance, devices can relay video to each other on the frontlines, without necessarily needing a backhaul to the main wireless network. On-board processing of image data could allow for rapid decision-making in environments where seconds can be vital to the success of a mission.</p>
<p>That flexibility is allowing for many new applications in disaster response, and “we are seeing some amazing use cases coming out of our 5G deployments [and] we have launched some of our pilots with the [Department of Defense],” Porter said. He offered an example of “robotic dogs to go and do bomb dismantling or inspecting and recovery.”</p>
<p>Verizon has made innovating on new applications a strategic goal, launching a <a href="https://www.5gfirstresponderlab.com">5G First Responders Lab</a> dedicated to guiding a new generation of startups to build at this crossroads. Nilan of Verizon said that the incubator has had more than 20 companies across four different cohorts, working on everything from virtual reality training environments to AR applications that allow firefighters to “see through walls.” His colleague Davis said that “artificial intelligence is going to continue to get better and better and better.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blueforcedev.com">Blueforce</a> is a company that went through the first cohort of the Lab. The company uses 5G to connect sensors and devices together to allow first responders to make the best decisions they can with the most up-to-date data. Michael Helfrich, founder and CEO, said that “because of these new networks … commanders are able to leave the vehicle and go into the field and get the same fidelity” of information that they normally would have to be in a command center to receive. He noted that in addition to classic user interfaces, the company is exploring other ways of presenting information to responders. “They don’t have to look at a screen anymore, and [we’re] exploring different cognitive models like audio, vibration and heads-up displays.”</p>
<p>5G will offer many new ways to improve emergency responses, but that doesn’t mean that our current 4G networks will just disappear. Davis said that many sensors in the field don’t need the kind of latency or bandwidth that 5G offers. “LTE is going to be around for many, many more years,” he said, pointing to the hardware and applications taking advantage of LTE-M standards for Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a key development for the future here.</p>
<h2 id="Link me to the stars, Elon Musk">Link me to the stars, Elon Musk</h2>
<p>Michael Martin of emergency response data platform <a href="https://rapidsos.com">RapidSOS</a> said that “it does feel like there is renewed energy to solve real problems,” in the disaster response market, which he dubbed the “Elon Musk effect.” And that effect definitely does exist when it comes to connectivity, where SpaceX’s satellite bandwidth project <a href="https://www.starlink.com">Starlink</a> comes into play.</p>

<p>Satellite uplinks have historically had horrific latency and bandwidth constraints, making them difficult to use in disaster contexts. Furthermore, depending on the particular type of disaster, satellite uplinks can be astonishingly challenging to setup given the ground environment. Starlink promises to shatter all of those barriers — easier connections, fat pipes, low latencies and a global footprint that would be the envy of any first responder globally. Its network is still under active development, so it is difficult to foresee today precisely what its impact will be on the disaster response market, but it’s an offering to watch closely in the years ahead, because it has the potential to completely upend the way we respond to disasters this century if its promises pan out.</p>
<p>Yet, even if we discount Starlink, the change coming this decade in emergency response represents a complete revolution. The depth and resilience of connectivity is changing the equation for first responders from complete reliance on antiquated tools to an embrace of the future of digital computing. The machine is no longer stoppable.</p>

<h2>A mega-exit for American fintech</h2>
<p>The news that public fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">Bill.com will buy <strong>Divvy</strong></a>, a Utah-based startup that helps small and midsized businesses manage their spend, was perhaps the biggest startup story of the week. Breaking late Thursday, the $2.5 billion transaction was long expected. Divvy had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9/company_financials">more than $400 million</a> from <strong>PayPal Ventures</strong>, <strong>New Enterprise Associates</strong>, <strong>Insight Partners</strong> and <strong>Pelion Venture Partners</strong>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch covered the impending sale, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">rumors of which sprung up</a> before Bill.com reported its Q1 earnings. To see the company drop the news at the same time as its earnings was not a surprise. For the burgeoning corporate payment space (more here on startups in the space like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"><strong>Ramp</strong></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/"><strong>Airbase</strong></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/"><strong>Brex</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">to noodle</a> on the financial results that Bill.com detailed regarding Divvy &#8212; they are pretty key metrics to help us value the startups that are competing to go public or find a similarly feathered corporate nest. In short, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/ramp-looks-to-raise-more-capital-as-the-corporate-spend-market-mints-unicorns/">corporate spend startup cohort</a> is doing great. It’s even spawning new startups like Latin American-focused <strong>Clara</strong>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">raised $3.5 million earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Broadly, the fintech market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/fintech-startups-set-vc-records-as-the-2021-fundraising-market-continues-to-impress/">had a huge Q1</a> and is blasting its way toward a record venture capital year, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">AI startups</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">the rest of the VC world</a>.</p>

<h2>5 investors discuss the future of RPA after UiPath&#8217;s IPO</h2>
<p>Much ink (erm, pixels) has been spilled about robotic process automation (RPA) recently, particularly in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/"><strong>UiPath’s</strong> IPO last month</a>.</p>
<p>But while some of the individuals <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a> interviewed about the future of RPA believe the technology is in its “early infancy,” the pandemic increased attention toward things we can let robots handle for us. And it’s hard to argue that repetitive tasks like billing and spreadsheeting and paper-pushing should <em>not</em> be outsourced to robots.</p>
<p>“RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human,” Ron writes. “Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a <strong>Slack</strong> message to accounts payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We’re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.”</p>
<p>Although RPA is the fastest-growing category in enterprise software, the market remains surprisingly small. Ron spoke to five investors about where the sector is headed, where there are opportunities and the biggest threats to the RPA startup ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What Tesla CEO Elon Musk says publicly about the company&#8217;s progress on a fully autonomous driving system doesn&#8217;t match up with &#8220;engineering reality,&#8221; according to a memo that summarizes a meeting between California regulators and employees at the automaker.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The memo, which <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/documents/28jcs0/california-dmv-tesla-robotaxi--fsd-notes/">transparency site Plainsite</a> obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request and subsequently released, shows that Musk has inflated the capabilities of the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system in Tesla vehicles, as well the company&#8217;s ability to deliver fully autonomous features by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy &#8220;full self-driving,&#8221; or FSD — a feature that Musk promises will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. FSD, which has steadily increased in price and capability, has been available as an option for years. However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. Once drivers enter a destination into the navigation system, they can enable &#8220;Navigate on Autopilot&#8221; for that trip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla vehicles are far from reaching that level of autonomy, a fact confirmed by statements made by the company&#8217;s director of Autopilot software CJ Moore to California regulators, the memo shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon&#8217;s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ,&#8221; according to the memo summarizing the conversation between regulators with the California Department of Motor Vehicles&#8217; autonomous vehicles branch and four Tesla employees, including Moore.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rdLaDFXvL4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/">Tesla&#8217;s decision to scrap its PR department could create a PR nightmare</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s decision to scrap its PR department could create a PR nightmare&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/embed/#?secret=rdLaDFXvL4" data-secret="rdLaDFXvL4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The memo, which was written by California DMV&#8217;s Miguel Acosta, states that Moore described Autopilot — and the new features being tested — as a Level 2 system. That description matters in the world of automated driving.</p>
<p>There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions — like adaptive cruise and lane keeping — are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 2 is an advanced driver assistance system, and has become increasingly available in new vehicles, including those produced by Tesla, GM, Volvo and Mercedes. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and its more capable FSD were considered the most advanced systems available to consumers. However, other automakers have started to catch up.</p>
<p>Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in <em>certain</em> conditions without human intervention and is what companies like Argo AI, Aurora, Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox are working on. Level 5, which is widely viewed as a distant goal, would handle all driving in all environments and conditions.</p>
<p>Here is an important bit via Acosta&#8217;s summarization:</p>
<blockquote><p>DMV asked CJ to address from an engineering perspective, Elon’s messaging about L5 capability by the end of the year. Elon’s tweet does not match <span class="">engineering reality per CJ. </span>Tesla is at Level 2 currently. The ratio of driver interaction would need to be in the magnitude of 1 or 2 million miles per driver interaction to move into higher levels of automation. Tesla indicated that Elon is extrapolating on the rates of improvement when speaking about L5 capabilities. Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Portions of this commentary were redacted. However, Plainsite was able to copy and paste the redacted part, which shows up as white space on a PDF, into another document.</p>
<p>The comments in the memo are contrary to what Musk has said repeatedly in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Musk is frequently asked on Twitter and in quarterly earnings calls for progress reports on FSD, including questions about when it will be rolled out via software updates to owners who have purchased the option. In a January earnings call, Musk said he was &#8220;highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of a human this year.&#8221; In April 2021, during the company&#8217;s first quarter earnings call, Musk said &#8220;it&#8217;s really quite, quite tricky. But I am highly confident that we will get this done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memo released this week provided other insights into Tesla&#8217;s push to test and eventually unlock greater levels of autonomy, including the number of vehicles testing a beta version of &#8220;Navigate on Autopilot on City Streets,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a feature that is meant to handle driving in urban areas and not just highways. Regulators also asked the Tesla employees if and how participants were being trained to test this feature, and how the sales team ensures that messaging about the vehicle capabilities and limitations are communicated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As of the March meeting, there were 824 vehicles in a pilot program testing a beta version of &#8220;city streets.&#8221;  About 750 of those vehicles were being driven by employees and 71 by non-employees. </span>Pilot participants are located across 37 states, with the majority of participants in California. As of March 2021, pilot participants have driven more than 153,000 miles using the City Streets feature, the memo states. The memo noted that Tesla planned to expand this pool of participants to approximately 1,600 later that month.</p>
<p>Tesla told the DMV that it is working on developing a video for the participants and that the next group of participants will include referrals from existing participants. &#8220;The new participants will be vetted by Tesla by looking at insurance telematics based on the VINs registered to that participant,&#8221; according to the memo.</p>
<p>Tesla also told the DMV that it is able to track when there are failures or when the feature is deactivated. Moore described these as &#8220;disengagements,&#8221; a term also used by companies testing and developing autonomous vehicle technology. The primary difference worth noting here is that these companies only use employees who are trained safety drivers, not the public.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up<a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"> here</a>.</i></em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<h2>Betting on upcoming startup markets</h2>
<p>This week <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a venture capital concern focused on investing in the Midwest of the United States, announced a new fund worth $31.8 million. As the firm noted in a release that The Exchange reviewed, its new fund is about three times the size of its preceding investment vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I caught up with M25 partner <a href="https://twitter.com/DMikeAsem">Mike Asem</a> to chat about the round. Asem joined M25 in 2016 after partner <a href="https://twitter.com/lalayak">Victor Gutwein</a> spearheaded the effort with a small $1 million fund. Asem and Gutwein have led the firm since its first material, if technically second fund.</p>
<p>Asem said that his team had targeted a $25 million to $30 million fund three, meaning that they came in a bit higher than anticipated in fundraising terms. That’s not a surprise in today&#8217;s venture capital market, given the pace at which capital is both invested into VC funds and startups.</p>
<p>The investor told The Exchange that M25 has been investing out of its third fund for some time, including <a href="https://www.getcashdrop.com/">CASHDROP</a>, a startup that I’ve heard good things about regarding its growth rate. (More <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-mobile-storefront-in-under-15-minutes-cashdrops-platform-secures-2-7m-in-seed-funding/">here</a> on the CASHDROP round that M25 put capital into.)</p>
<p>All that’s fine, but what makes M25 an interesting bet is that the firm <em>only</em> invests in Midwest-headquartered startups. Often when I chat to a fund that has a unique geographical focus, it’s merely that, a focus. As opposed to M25’s more hard-and-fast rule. Now with more capital and plans to take part in 12-15 deals per year, the group can double down on its thesis.</p>
<p>Per Asem, M25 has done about a third of its deals in Chicago, where it’s based, but has put capital into startups in 24 cities thus far. TechCrunch covered one of those companies, <a href="https://metafy.gg/">Metafy</a>, earlier this week when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/metafy-adds-5-5m-to-its-seed-round-as-the-market-for-games-coaching-grows/">closed more than $5 million in new capital</a>.</p>
<p>Why does M25 think that the Midwest is the place to deploy capital and generate outsize returns? Asem listed a number of perspectives that underpin his team’s thesis: The Midwest’s economic might, the network that his partner and him developed in the area before founding M25, and the fact that valuations can prove to be more attractive in the region at the stage that his firm invests. They are sufficiently different, he said, that his firm can generate material returns even with exits at around the $100 million mark, a lower threshold than most VCs with larger capital vehicles might find palatable.</p>
<p>M25 is not alone in its bets on alternative regions. The Exchange also chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/somakc?lang=en">Somak Chattopadhyay</a> of <a href="https://www.armorysv.com/">Armory Square Ventures</a> on Friday, a firm that is based in upstate New York and invests in B2B software companies in what we might call post-manufacturing cities. One of its investments has gone public, and the group’s latest fund is a multiple of the size of its first. Armory now has around $60 million in AUM.</p>
<p>All that’s to say that the venture capital boom is not merely helping firms like a16z raise another billion here, or another billion there. But the generally hot market for startups and private capital is helping even smaller firms raise more capital to take on less traditional spaces. It’s heartening.</p>
<h2>On-demand pricing, and grokking the insurance game</h2>
<p>This week The Exchange chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khozema-shipchandler">Twilio CFO Khozema Shipchandler</a> about his company’s earnings report. You can read more on the hard numbers <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twilio-earnings-are-still-trouncing-its-own-expectations-but-this-time-the-stock-isnt-playing-along-11620246273">here</a>. The short gist is that it was a good quarter. But what mattered most in our chat was Shipchandler riffing on where the center of gravity at Twilio will remain in <em>revenue</em> terms.</p>
<p>Briefly, Twilio is best known for building APIs that allow developers to leverage telecom services. Those developers and their employers pay for as much Twilio as they used. But over time Twilio has bought more and more companies, building out a diverse product set after its 2016-era IPO.</p>
<p>So we were curious: Where does the company stand on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/the-future-of-saas-is-on-demand-use-experts-to-drive-growth-and-engagement/">on-demand versus SaaS pricing debate that is currently raging</a> in the software world? Staunchly in the first camp, still, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">despite buying Segment</a>, which is a SaaS service. Per Shipchandler, Twilio revenue is still more than 70% on-demand, and the company wants to make sure that its customers only buy more of its services as they sell more of their own.</p>
<p>Startups, then, probably don’t have to give up on on-demand pricing as they scale. Twilio is huge and is sticking to it!</p>
<p>Then there was Root’s earnings report. Again, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/root-inc-announces-2021-first-211200537.html">here</a> are the core numbers. The Exchange is keeping tabs on Root&#8217;s post-IPO performance not only because it was a company we tracked extensively during its late private life, but also because it is a bellwether of sorts for the yet-private, neoinsurane companies. Which matters for fellow neoinsurance player Hippo, as it is going public via a SPAC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-timm-b2371a16/">Alex Timm,</a> Root’s CEO, said that his firm performed well in the first quarter, generating more direct written premium than anticipated, and at better loss-rates to boot. The company also remains very cash-rich post IPO, and Timm is confident that his company’s data science work has lots more room to improve Root’s underwriting models.</p>
<p>So, faster-than-expected growth, lots of cash, improving economics and a bullish technology take &#8212; Root’s stock is flying, right? No, it is not. Instead Root has taken a bit of a public-market pounding in recent months. The Exchange asked Timm about the disparity between how he views his company’s performance and future, and how it is being valued. He said that the insurance folks don’t always get its technology work and that tech folks don’t always grok Root’s insurance business.</p>
<p>That’s tough. But with years and years of cash at its current burn rate, Root has more than enough space to prove its critics wrong, provided that its modeling holds up over the next dozen quarters or so. Its share price can’t be <em>great</em> for the yet-private neoinsurance companies, however. Even if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/next-insurance-raises-250m-doubling-its-valuation-to-4b-in-under-a-year/">Next Insurance did just raise another grip of cash</a> at another new, higher valuation.</p>
<h2>Corporate spend’s big week</h2>
<p>As you’ve read by now, Bill.com is buying corporate-spend unicorn Divvy for $2.5 billion. I dug into the numbers behind the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">here</a>, if that’s your sort of thing.</p>
<p>But after collecting notes from the CEOs of Divvy competitors Ramp and Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">here</a>, another bit of commentary came in that I wanted to share. <a href="https://twitter.com/thejo?lang=en">Thejo Kote</a>, the corporate spend startup <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase’s</a> CEO and founder did some math on Divvy’s results that Bill.com shared with its own investors, arguing that the company’s March payment volume and active customer account implies that the company’s “average spend volume per customer was $44,400 per month.”</p>
<p>Is that good or bad? Kote is not impressed, saying that Airbase’s “average spend volume per customer is almost 10 [times] that of Divvy,” or around “$375,000 per month.” What’s driving that difference? A focus on larger customers, and the fact that Airbase covers more ground, in Kote’s view, than Divvy by encompassing software work that Bill.com itself and Expensify manage.</p>
<p>I bring you all of this as the war in managing spend for companies large and small is heating up in software terms. With Divvy off the table, Ramp is now perhaps the largest player in the space not charging for the software it wraps around corporate cards. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">recently launched</a> a software product that it charges for on a recurring basis. (More on Brex at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">this link</a>, if you are into it.)</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Two final notes for you, things that should make you either laugh, grimace, or howl:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/eliotwb/status/1389266357489831937">Wall Street Journal’s Eliot Brown tweeted</a> some data this week from <a href="https://t.co/XFdfrG79OD?amp=1">the Financial Times</a>, namely that amongst the roughly 40 SPACs that completed deals last year, a dozen and a half have lost more than half their value. And that the average drop amongst the combined entities is 38%. Woof.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/conorsen/status/1389578287685451778">welcome to peak everything</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More to come next week, </strong>including notes on the return of the Kaltura and Procore IPOs, and whatever it is we can suss out from the Krispy Kreme S-1 filing, as donuts are life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has just pushed edtech mainstream, but language-learning startup Duolingo had already spent the past decade figuring out how to build a successful edtech app.</p>
<p>In our latest installment of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec-1/">the EC-1 series</a>, Natasha Mascarenhas goes deep with the company to understand how it found product-market fit, then figured out how to grow like a consumer tech startup and monetize like a SaaS startup.

<p>If there has ever been a golden age for fintech, it surely must be now.</p>
<p>As of Q1 2021, the number of fintech startups in the U.S. crossed 10,000 for the first time ever — well more than double that if you include EMEA and APAC. There are now three fintech companies worth more than $100 billion (Paypal, Square and Shopify) with another three in the $50 billion-$100 billion club (Stripe, Adyen and Coinbase).</p>
<p>Yet, as fintech companies have begun to go public, there has been a fair amount of uncertainty as to how these companies will be valued on the public markets. This is a result of fintechs being relatively new to the IPO scene compared to their consumer internet or enterprise software counterparts. Furthermore, fintechs employ a wide variety of business models: Some are transactional, while others are recurring or have hybrid business models.</p>
<p>And fintechs now have a multitude of options in terms of how they choose to go public. They can take the traditional IPO route, pursue a direct listing or merge with a SPAC. Given the multitude of variables at play, valuing these companies and then predicting public market performance is anything but straightforward.</p>

<p>Many fintech startups have tried to become a market-maker between investors and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>However, the challenge with this two-sided market is: How do you get the investors to show up?</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to get retail investors, but family offices and other large check writers are even more challenging to lure.</p>

<p>With an increasing number of enterprise systems, growing teams, a rising proliferation of the web and multiple digital initiatives, companies of all sizes are creating loads of data every day.</p>
<p>This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.</p>
<p>The analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights.</p>
<p>Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.</p>
<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company’s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges, and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling — enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.</p>

<p>Flywire, a Boston-based magnet for venture capital, filed to go public Monday.</p>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company that attracted more than $300 million as a startup, according to Crunchbase, most recently raising a $60 million Series F last month. We don’t have its most recent valuation, but PitchBook data indicates that the company’s February 2020, $120 million round valued Flywire at $1 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>So what we’re looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though we thought that Robinhood would be the next such debut.</p>
<p>Fintech venture capital activity has been hot lately, which makes the Flywire IPO interesting. Its success or failure could dictate the pace of fintech exits and fintech startup valuations in general, so we have to care about it.</p>
<p>First, what does Flywire do and with whom does it compete? Then, a closer look at its financial results as we hope to get our hands around its revenue quality, aggregate economics and growth prospects.</p>
<p>After that, we’ll discuss valuations and which venture capital groups are set to do well in its flotation.</p>

<p>If it feels like IPO news slowed for a few weeks at the start of the second quarter, your gut is correct. Investors previously told The Exchange that the first, third and fourth quarters of 2021 would be hot periods for public debuts, but that Q2 would be slower. Their argument revolved around reporting cadences and how long it takes for certain periods of accounting work to be completed.</p>
<p>So we weren’t surprised when the second quarter’s IPO cycle began to feel a bit soft compared to the rapid-fire first quarter. And, as we’ve all heard in recent days, the great SPAC rush is slowing.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped a number of firms from defying expectations and going public all the same.</p>

<p>SAP CEO Christian Klein was appointed co-CEO with Jennifer Morgan in October 2019. He became sole CEO just as the pandemic was hitting full force across the world last April.</p>
<p>He was put in charge of a storied company at 39 years old. By October, its stock price was down and revenue projections for the coming years were flat.</p>
<p>That is definitely not the way any CEO wants to start their tenure, but the pandemic forced Klein to make some decisions to move his customers to the cloud faster. That, in turn, had an impact on revenue until the transition was completed. While it makes sense to make this move now, investors weren’t happy with the news.</p>
<p>There was also the decision to spin out Qualtrics, the company his predecessor acquired for $8 billion in 2018. As he looked back on the one-year mark, Klein sat down with TechCrunch to discuss all that has happened and the unique set of challenges he faced.</p>

<p>Domm Holland, co-founder and CEO of e-commerce startup Fast, appears to be living a founder’s dream.</p>
<p>His big idea came from a small moment in his real life. Holland watched as his wife’s grandmother tried to order groceries, but she had forgotten her password and wasn’t able to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>He built a prototype of a passwordless authentication system where users would fill out their information once and would never need to do so again. Within 24 hours, tens of thousands of people had used it.</p>
<p>Shoppers weren’t the only ones on board with this idea. In less than two years, Holland has raised $124 million in three rounds of fundraising, bringing on partners like Index Ventures and Stripe.</p>
<p>Although the success of Fast’s one-click checkout product has been speedy, it hasn’t been effortless.</p>
<p>For one thing, Holland is Australian, which means he started out as a Silicon Valley outsider.</p>
<p>Holland talks about how he built his network, why it’s important — not just for fundraising but for building the entire business — and how to avoid the mistakes he sees new founders make.</p>

<p>It’s only been three years since they hit the streets, but Revel’s blue electric mopeds have already become a common sight in New York, San Francisco and a growing number of U.S. cities.</p>
<p>However, Revel founder and CEO Frank Reig set his sights far beyond building a shared moped service.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of 2021, Revel has launched an e-bike subscription service, an EV charging station venture and an all-electric rideshare service driven by a fleet of 50 Teslas.</p>
<p>We caught up with Reig to talk about what he learned from building the company, how Revel’s business strategy has evolved and what lies ahead.</p>

<p>Divvy, a Utah-based corporate spend unicorn, is considering selling itself to Bill.com for a price that could top $2 billion. For the fintech sector, it’s big news.</p>
<p>Corporate spend startups including Ramp and Brex are raising rapid-fire rounds at ever-higher valuations and growing at venture-ready cadences. Their growth and the resulting private investment were earned by a popular approach to offering corporate cards, and, increasingly, the group’s ability to build software around those cards that took into account a greater portion of the functionality that companies needed to track expenses, manage spend access and, perhaps, save money.</p>
<p>It makes sense to see Bill.com decide to take on the yet-private corporate spend startups that are playing the field; why not absorb a growing customer base and fend off competition in a single move?</p>
<p>To get a better handle on how the startups that compete with Divvy feel about the deal, TechCrunch reached out to both Ramp CEO Eric Glyman, and Brex CEO Henrique Dubugras.</p>

<p>It’s an entrepreneur’s market in digital health today, with startups raising record-breaking funding at soaring valuations and debuting on public markets to eager investors.</p>
<p>The massive influx of capital to healthcare should not be surprising; the pandemic has made it starkly clear that digital health is the future of healthcare.</p>
<p>To that end, we should anticipate additional healthcare exits worth more than $1 billion in the near term. Which again, is great for entrepreneurs — as long as they understand how hard it is to build a unicorn in healthcare. Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, lots of investors jumped in to invest in digital health for the first time. But we’ve been investing for more than a decade.</p>
<p>H<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere are four instrumental strategies to building a unicorn in digital health that we know work.</span></p>

<p>There’s no shortage of commentary around the chief marketing officer title these days, and certainly no lack of opinions about the role’s responsibilities and meaning within a company.</p>
<p>There’s a reason for that. CMO is the shortest tenured C-suite role — the average tenure of a CMO is the lowest of all C-suite titles at 3.5 years.</p>
<p>That’s because the chief marketing officer’s role is increasingly complex. Qualifications require broad, strategic thinking while also maintaining tactical acumen across several functions. There’s a big disparity in what companies expect from CMOs. Some want a strategist with an eye for go-to-market planning, while others want a focus on close alignment with sales in addition to brand awareness, content strategy and lead generation.</p>
<p>Other companies want their CMO to emphasize product marketing and management. Ask 10 CMOs how they define their role and you’ll get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>Here, a tenured CMO shares his honest take on what the role actually means, plus the key attributes of today’s modern CMO.</p>

<p>People have been discussing the importance of expanding opportunities for women in venture capital and startup entrepreneurship for decades. And for some time it appeared that progress was being made in building a more diverse and equitable environment.</p>
<p>The prospect of more women writing checks was viewed as a positive for female founders, a cohort that has struggled to attract more than a fraction of the funds that their male peers manage. All-female teams have an especially tough time raising capital compared to all-male teams, underscoring the disparity.</p>
<p>Then COVID-19 arrived and scrambled the venture and startup scene, creating a risk-off environment during the end of Q1 and the start of Q2 2020. Following that, the venture world went into overdrive as software sales became a safe harbor in the business world during uncertain economic times. And when it became clear that the vaunted digital transformation of businesses large and small was accelerating, more capital appeared.</p>
<p>But data indicate that the torrent of new capital has not been distributed equally — indeed, some of the progress that female founders made in recent years may have eroded.</p>

<p>When it comes to acquiring or merging a business with another, it’s imperative that decision-makers know why they’re pursuing a deal and its potential impact on the company, good and bad.</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) may indeed be the best route to success, but there’s a lot of room for problems, and many leaders underestimate the role in-house legal teams can play in mitigating these problems and facilitating progress until they’re locked into a deal.</p>
<p>And that’s when issues become much more difficult to resolve and plans unravel.</p>
<p>While a CEO and board might fully appreciate in-house counsel, it’s equally important the team is supported across a company — from marketing to product development — in order to ensure an efficient closing and successful integration. The best way to do that is by bringing in-house counsel into the process early and often.</p>

<p>The number of SPACs in the deep tech sector was skyrocketing, but a combination of increased SEC scrutiny and market forces over the past few weeks has slowed the pace of new SPAC transactions.</p>
<p>The correction is an inevitable step on the path to mainstreaming SPACs as an alternative to IPOs, but it won’t cause them to go away.</p>
<p>Instead, blank-check vehicles will evolve and will occupy a small and specialized — but important — part of the startup financing landscape.</p>

<p>Uber followed Lyft in reporting its Q1 2021 earnings this week. And like its rival, its results take a little bit of work to understand.</p>
<p>We parsed them as a pair so that we understand what’s going on at the ride-hailing and food-delivery giant.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the big numbers: Uber’s revenue missed sharply, while its profitability beat expectations.</p>
<p>How did investors vet Uber’s performance? The company’s stock is off around 4% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Surprised by the revenue miss? Shocked by the profit beat? Startled by the sharp drop in the value of Uber’s stock? Let’s unpack the numbers.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s examine the buy now, pay later (BNPL) market, mostly through the lens of PayPal’s first-quarter results.</p>
<p>PayPal’s BNPL results are impressive — and not just to your humble servant, but to other fintech watchers as well — which begs the question: Can the platform effect that the PayPals of the world bring to bear suffocate a growing slice of the startup market?</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 lockdowns cascaded around the world last spring, companies large and small saw demand slow to a halt seemingly overnight. Enterprises weren’t comfortable making big, long-term commitments when they had no clue what the future would hold.</p>
<p>Innovative SaaS companies responded quickly by making their products available for free or at a steep discount to boost demand.</p>
<p>But these free offerings didn’t go away as lockdowns loosened up. SaaS companies instead doubled down on freemium because they realized that doing so had a real and positive impact on their business. In doing so, they busted the outdated myths that have held 82% of SaaS companies back from offering their own free plan.</p>

<p>Shortening the diagnostic odyssey of rare diseases and reducing the associated costs was, until recently, a moonshot challenge, but is now within reach.</p>
<p>About 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and technology and AI advances are combining to make genetic testing widely accessible.</p>
<p>Whole-genome sequencing, an advanced genetic test that allows us to examine the entire human DNA, now costs under $1,000, and market leader Illumina is targeting a $100 genome in the near future.</p>

<p>As expected, Bill.com is buying Divvy, the Utah-based corporate spend management startup that competes with Brex, Ramp and Airbase. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company’s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set during its $165 million, January 2021 funding round.</p>
<p>Per Bill.com, the transaction includes $625 million in cash, with the rest of the consideration coming in the form of stock in Divvy’s new parent company.</p>
<p>Bill.com also reported its quarterly results: Its Q1 included revenues of $59.7 million, above expectations of $54.63 million. The company’s adjusted loss per share of $0.02 also exceeded expectations, with the street expecting a sharper $0.07 per share deficit.</p>
<p>The better-than-anticipated results and the acquisition news combined to boost the value of Bill.com by more than 13% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Bill.com released a deck that provides a number of financial metrics relating to its purchase of Divvy. This will not only allow us to better understand the value of the unicorn at exit, but also its competitors, against which we now have a set of metrics to bring to bear.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack the deal to gain a better understanding of the huge exit and the value of Divvy’s richly funded competitors.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) has certainly been getting a lot of attention in the last year, with startups, acquisitions and IPOs all coming together in a flurry of market activity. It all seemed to culminate with UiPath’s IPO last month. The company that appeared to come out of nowhere in 2017 eventually had a final private valuation of $35 billion. It then had the audacity to match that at its IPO. A few weeks later, it still has a market cap of over $38 billion in spite of the stock price fluctuating at points.</p>
<p>Was this some kind of peak for the technology or a flash in the pan? Probably not. While it all seemed to come together in the last year with a big increase in attention to automation in general during the pandemic, it’s a market category that has been around for some time.</p>
<p>RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human. Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a Slack message to Accounts Payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We’re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.</p>

<p>Built for Mars CEO Peter Ramsey tears down Twitch’s UX, asking how Twitch rakes in cash and the psychology used within its app to encourage users to keep spending.</p>
<p>Ramsey describes Twitch’s protocol of asking users if they want to subscribe to a streamer before seeing their stream “unnecessarily boolean,” which would be a great band name.</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there. Ramsey notes: “Often it’s at the point of clicking, not the final stage of a process, meaning the user decides to buy the item when they click ‘check out now,’ not when they’ve entered their card details and click ‘complete purchase.’<br />
Ramsey argues Twitch shouldn’t make users choose between doing nothing and subscribing: “Instead, if they changed the text to, say, “learn more,” the user could click it without having to internalize the decision.”</p>

<p>In non-aerobatic fixed-wing aviation, spins are an emergency. If you don’t have spin recovery training, you can easily make things worse, dramatically increasing your chances of crashing. Despite the life-and-death consequences, licensed amateur pilots in the United States are not required to train for this. Uncontrolled spins don’t happen often enough to warrant the training.</p>
<p>Startups can enter the equivalent of a spin as well. My startup, Kolide, entered a dangerous spin in early 2018, only a year after our Series A fundraise. We had little traction and we were quickly burning through our sizable cash reserves. We were spinning out of control, certain to hit the ground in no time.</p>
<p>All spins start with a stall — a reduction in lift when either the aircraft is flying too slowly or the nose is pointed too high. In Kolide’s case, we were doing both.</p>
<p>Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan.</p>

<p>Shares of Square are up more than 6% after the American fintech company reported a staggering $5.06 billion in revenue in its Q1 2021 earnings report, far ahead of an expected tally of $3.36 billion.</p>
<p>By posting the huge revenue beat, Square grew 266% compared to its year-ago Q1. Because that’s the sort of growth that we generally expect to see from early-stage startups instead of maturing public companies, some exploration is in order. In short, bitcoin revenues from Square, and how they fit into its accounting, are responsible for much of its outsized growth.</p>
<p>And that’s something we need to talk about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long-running German audio company Sennheiser<a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768"> today announced</a> that it has found a buyer for its consumer brand. Swiss holding company Sonova &#8212; a giant in the hearing aid business &#8212; will be acquiring the brand in a deal expected to close by end of year.</p>
<p>The deal will bring headphones and sound bars to Sonova’s existing portfolio, which is largely centered around healthcare products. Among other things, however, the deal could have interesting implications for the so-called hearables category, which can walk the line between headphones and healthcare products. Sennheiser, meanwhile, will shift the entirety of its focus to its pro products.</p>
<p>The company has been fairly open about its intentions. In February, <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sennheiser-to-reposition-its-business-units-independently-of-each-other-s5jh2n">it publicly announced</a> that it was seeking a buyer for the division. “To be best able to exploit the potential in each of these markets, we are concentrating our own resources on the three business areas in the Professional division and are looking for a strong partner to invest in our Consumer business,&#8221; Co-CEO Daniel Sennheiser noted at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sennheiser describes the deal as a “permanent cooperation” between the two, including licensing the company’s name. The existing consumer wing, including many of its employees, will transfer to Sonovo. A press release announcing the news says there are currently 600 people employed by the brand, but no word on how many are expected the make that move.</p>
<p>“The combination of our strengths provides a very good starting point for future growth,” the company’s other co-CEO says in the release. “We are convinced that Sonova will strengthen the Sennheiser Consumer Business in the long term and capture the major growth opportunities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sensor data from smartphones and wearables can meaningfully predict an individual&#8217;s &#8216;biological age&#8217; and resilience to stress, according to <a href="https://gero.ai">Gero AI</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8216;longevity&#8217; startup &#8212; which condenses its mission to the pithy goal of &#8220;hacking complex diseases and aging with Gero AI&#8221; &#8212; has developed an AI model to predict morbidity risk using &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; that are based on identifying patterns in step-counter sensor data which tracks mobile users&#8217; physical activity.</p>
<p>A simple measure of &#8216;steps&#8217; isn&#8217;t nuanced enough on its own to predict individual health, is the contention. Gero&#8217;s AI has been trained on large amounts of biological data to spots patterns that can be linked to morbidity risk. It also measures how quickly a personal recovers from a biological stress &#8212; another biomarker that&#8217;s been linked to lifespan; i.e. the faster the body recovers from stress, the better the individual&#8217;s overall health prognosis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/202816/text">research paper</a> Gero has had published in the peer-reviewed biomedical journal <em>Aging</em> explains how it trained deep neural networks to predict morbidity risk from mobile device sensor data &#8212; and was able to demonstrate that its biological age acceleration model was comparable to models based on blood test results.</p>
<p>Another paper, due to be published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> later this month, will go into detail on its device-derived measurement of biological resilience.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based startup, which has research roots in Russia &#8212; founded back in 2015 by a Russian scientist with a background in theoretical physics &#8212; has raised a total of $5 million in seed funding to date (in two tranches).</p>
<p>Backers come from both the biotech and the AI fields, per co-founder Peter Fedichev. Its investors include Belarus-based AI-focused early stage fund, Bulba Ventures (Yury Melnichek). On the pharma side, it has backing from some (unnamed) private individuals with links to Russian drug development firm, Valenta. (The pharma company itself is not an investor).</p>
<p>Fedichev is a theoretical physicist by training who, after his PhD and some ten years in academia, moved into biotech to work on molecular modelling and machine learning for drug discovery &#8212; where he got interested in the problem of ageing and decided to start the company.</p>
<p>As well as conducting its own biological<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> research into longevity (studying mice and nematodes), it&#8217;s focused on developing an AI model for predicting the biological age and resilience to stress of humans &#8212; via sensor data captured by mobile devices.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Health of course is much more than one number,&#8221; emphasizes Fedichev. &#8220;We should not have illusions about that. But if you are going to condense human health to one number then, for a lot of people, the biological age is the best number. It tells you &#8212; essentially &#8212; how toxic is your lifestyle&#8230; The more biological age you have relative to your chronological age years &#8212; that&#8217;s called biological acceleration &#8212; the more are your chances to get chronic disease, to get seasonal infectious diseases or also develop complications from those seasonal diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero has recently launched a (paid, for now) API, called <a href="https://gerosense.ai">GeroSense</a>, that&#8217;s aimed at health and fitness apps so they can tap up its AI modelling to offer their users an individual assessment of biological age and resilience (aka recovery rate from stress back to that individual&#8217;s baseline).</p>
<p>Early partners are other longevity-focused companies, AgelessRx and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">Humanity Inc</a>. But the idea is to get the model widely embedded into fitness apps where it will be able to send a steady stream of longitudinal activity data back to Gero, to further feed its AI&#8217;s predictive capabilities and support the wider research mission &#8212; where it hopes to progress anti-ageing drug discovery, working in partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>The carrot for the fitness providers to embed the API is to offer their users a fun and potentially valuable feature: A personalized health measurement so they can track positive (or negative) biological changes &#8212; helping them quantify the value of whatever fitness service they&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every health and wellness provider &#8212; maybe even a gym &#8212; can put into their app for example&#8230; and this thing can rank all their classes in the gym, all their systems in the gym, for their value for different kinds of users,&#8221; explains Fedichev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed these capabilities because we need to understand how ageing works in humans, not in mice. Once we developed it we&#8217;re using it in our sophisticated genetic research in order to find genes &#8212; we are testing them in the laboratory &#8212; but, this technology, the measurement of ageing from continuous signals like wearable devices, is a good trick on its own. So that&#8217;s why we announced this GeroSense project,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ageing is this gradual decline of your functional abilities which is bad but you can go to the gym and potentially improve them. But the problem is you&#8217;re losing this resilience. Which means that when you&#8217;re [biologically] stressed you cannot get back to the norm as quickly as possible. So we report this resilience. So when people start losing this resilience it means that they&#8217;re not robust anymore and the same level of stress as in their 20s would get them [knocked off] the rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this loss of resilience is one of the key ageing phenotypes because it tells you that you&#8217;re vulnerable for future diseases even before those diseases set in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In-house everything is ageing. We are totally committed to ageing: Measurement and intervention,&#8221; adds Fedichev. &#8220;We want to building something like an operating system for longevity and wellness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero is also generating some revenue from two pilots with &#8220;top range&#8221; insurance companies &#8212; which Fedichev says it&#8217;s essentially running as a proof of business model at this stage. He also mentions an early pilot with Pepsi Co.</p>
<p>He sketches a link between how it hopes to work with insurance companies in the area of health outcomes with how Elon Musk is offering insurance products to owners of its sensor-laden Teslas, based on what it knows about how they drive &#8212; because both are putting sensor data in the driving seat, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. (&#8220;Essentially we are trying to do to humans what Elon Musk is trying to do to cars,&#8221; is how he puts it.)</p>
<p>But the nearer term plan is to raise more funding &#8212; and potentially switch to offering the API for free to really scale up the data capture potential.</p>
<p>Zooming out for a little context, i<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">t&#8217;s been almost a decade since Google-backed </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/wtf-is-calico-and-why-does-google-think-its-mysterious-new-company-can-defy-aging/">Calico</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> launched with the moonshot mission of &#8216;fixing death&#8217;. Since then a small but growing field of &#8216;longevity&#8217; startups has sprung up, conducting research into </span>extending <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(in the first instance) </span> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human lifespan. (Ending death is, clearly, the moonshot atop the moonshot.) </span></p>
<p>Death is still with us, of course, but the business of identifying possible drugs and therapeutics to stave off the grim reaper&#8217;s knock continues picking up pace &#8212; attracting a growing volume of investor dollars.</p>
<p>The trend is being fuelled by health and biological data becoming ever more plentiful and accessible, thanks to open research data initiatives and the proliferation of digital devices and services for tracking health, set alongside promising developments in the fast-evolving field of machine learning in areas like predictive healthcare and drug discovery.</p>
<p>Longevity has also seen a bit of an upsurge in interest in recent times as the coronavirus pandemic has concentrated minds on health and wellness, generally &#8212; and, well, mortality specifically.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it remains a complex, multi-disciplinary business. Some of these biotech moonshots are focused on bioengineering and gene-editing &#8212; pushing for disease diagnosis and/or drug discovery.</p>
<p>Plenty are also &#8212; like Gero &#8212;  trying to use AI and big data analysis to better understand and counteract biological ageing, bringing together experts in physics, maths and biological science to hunt for biomarkers to further research aimed at combating age-related disease and deterioration.</p>
<p>Another recent example is AI startup Deep Longevity, which came out of stealth <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/289bd9a1aef046b8adc4934d499c817d">last summer</a> &#8212; as a spinout from AI drug discovery startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/insilico-medicine-longevity/">Insilico Medicine</a> &#8212; touting an AI &#8216;longevity as a service&#8217; system which it claims can predict an individual’s biological age &#8220;significantly more accurately than conventional methods&#8221; (and which it also hopes will help scientists to unpick which &#8220;biological culprits drive aging-related diseases&#8221;, as it put it).</p>
<p>Gero AI is taking a different tack toward the same overarching goal &#8212; by honing in on data generated by activity sensors embedded into the everyday mobile devices people carry with them (or wear) as a proxy signal for studying their biology.</p>
<p>The advantage being that it doesn&#8217;t require a person to undergo regular (invasive) blood tests to get an ongoing measure of their own health. Instead our personal device can generate proxy signals for biological study <em>passively</em> &#8212; at vast scale and low cost. So the promise of Gero&#8217;s &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; is they could democratize access to individual health prediction.</p>
<p>And while billionaires like Peter Thiel can afford to shell out for bespoke medical monitoring and interventions to try to stay one step ahead of death, such high end services simply won&#8217;t scale to the rest of us.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If its digital biomarkers live up to Gero&#8217;s claims, its approach could, at the least, help steer millions towards healthier lifestyles, while also generating rich data for longevity R&amp;D &#8212; and to support the development of drugs that could extend human lifespan (albeit what such life-extending pills might cost is a whole other matter).</span></p>
<p>The insurance industry is naturally interested &#8212; with the potential for such tools to be used to nudge individuals towards healthier lifestyles and thereby reduce payout costs.</p>
<p>For individuals who are motivated to improve their health themselves, Fedichev says the issue now is it&#8217;s extremely hard for people to know exactly which lifestyle changes or interventions are best suited to their particular biology.</p>
<p>For example fasting has been shown in some studies to help combat biological ageing. But he notes that the approach may not be effective for everyone. The same may be true of other activities that are accepted to be generally beneficial for health (like exercise or eating or avoiding certain foods).</p>
<p>Again those rules of thumb may have a lot of nuance, depending on an individual&#8217;s particular biology. And scientific research is, inevitably, limited by access to funding. (Research can thus tend to focus on certain groups to the exclusion of others &#8212; e.g. men rather than women; or the young rather than middle aged.)</p>
<p>This is why Fedichev believes there&#8217;s a lot of value in creating a measure than can address health-related knowledge gaps at essentially no individual cost.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gero has u</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">sed longitudinal data from the UK&#8217;s biobank, one of its research partners, to verify its model&#8217;s measurements of biological age and resilience. But of course it hopes to go further &#8212; as it ingests more data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Technically it&#8217;s not properly different what we are doing &#8212; it just happens that we can do it now because there are such efforts like UK biobank. Government money and also some industry sponsors money, maybe for the first time in the history of humanity, we have this situation where we have electronic medical records, genetics, wearable devices from hundreds of thousands of people, so it just became possible. It&#8217;s the convergence of several developments &#8212; technological but also what I would call &#8216;social technologies&#8217; [like the UK biobank],&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine that for every diet, for every training routine, meditation&#8230; in order to make sure that we can actually optimize lifestyles &#8212; understand which things work, which do not [for each person] or maybe some experimental drugs which are already proved [to] extend lifespan in animals are working, maybe we can do something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we will have 1M tracks [half a year&#8217;s worth of data on 1M individuals] we will combine that with genetics and solve ageing,&#8221; he adds, with entrepreneurial flourish. &#8220;The ambitious version of this plan is we&#8217;ll get this million tracks by the end of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fitness and health apps are an obvious target partner for data-loving longevity researchers &#8212; but you can imagine it&#8217;ll be a mutual attraction. One side can bring the users, the other a halo of credibility comprised of deep tech and hard science.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect that these [apps] will get lots of people and we will be able to analyze those people for them as a fun feature first, for their users. But in the background we will build the best model of human ageing,&#8221; Fedichev continues, predicting that scoring the effect of different fitness and wellness treatments will be &#8220;the next frontier&#8221; for wellness and health (Or, more pithily: &#8220;Wellness and health has to become digital and quantitive.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we are bringing physicists into the analysis of human data. Since recently we have lots of biobanks, we have lots of signals &#8212; including from available devices which produce something like a few years&#8217; long windows on the human ageing process. So it&#8217;s a dynamical system &#8212; like weather prediction or financial market predictions,&#8221; he also tells us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot own the treatments because we cannot patent them but maybe we can own the personalization &#8212; the AI that personalized those treatments for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a startup perspective, one thing looks crystal clear: Personalization is here for the long haul.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long before the multimillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds pushed autonomous vehicles to the top of the hype cycle, <strong>Karl Iagnemma</strong> and <strong>Chris Urmson</strong> were researching and, later, developing the foundations of the technology.</p>
<p>These pioneers — Iagnemma coming from MIT, Urmson from Carnegie Mellon University — would eventually go on to launch their own autonomous vehicle startups in an aim to finally bring years of R&amp;D to the public.</p>
<p>That task isn&#8217;t over quite yet. Urmson, who is co-founder and CEO of Aurora, and Iagnemma, who is president and CEO of Motional, are still working on unlocking the technical and business problems that stand in the way of commercialization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch is excited to announce that Urmson and Iagnemma will be joining us on the virtual stage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=karlpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=karlpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. The one-day event, scheduled for June 9, is bringing together engineers and founders, investors and CEOs who are working on all the present and future ways people and packages will get from Point A to Point B. Iagnemma and Urmson will come to discuss the past, the present challenges and what both aim to do in the future. We&#8217;ll tackle questions about the technical problems that remain to be solved, the war over talent, the best business models and applications of autonomous vehicles and maybe even hear a few stories from the early days of testing and launching a startup.</p>
<p>Both guests have a long list of accolades and accomplishments — and too many to cover them all here.</p>
<p>Urmson has been working on AVs for more than 15 years. He earned his BSc in computer engineering from the University of Manitoba in 1998 and his PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005. He was a faculty member of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked with house-sized trucks, drove robots in the desert and was the technical director of the DARPA Urban and Grand Challenge teams. Urmson has authored more than 60 patents and 50 publications.</p>
<p>He left CMU and was one of the founding members of Google&#8217;s self-driving program, serving as its CTO. In 2017, Urmson co-founded Aurora with Sterling Anderson and Drew Bagnell.</p>
<p>Iagnemma is also considered an authority on robotics and driverless vehicles. He was the director of the Robotic Mobility Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where his research resulted in more than 150 technical publications, 50 issued or filed patents and numerous edited volumes, including books on the DARPA Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge autonomous vehicle competitions. He holds a BS from the University of Michigan, where he graduated first in his class, and MS and PhD degrees from MIT, where he was a National Science Foundation fellow.</p>
<p>In 2013, Iagnemma co-founded autonomous vehicle startup nuTonomy, one of the first to launch ride-hailing pilots. The company was acquired by Aptiv <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in late 2017. Aptiv and Hyundai formed the joint venture, which he now heads, in 2020. </span></p>
<p>Iagnemma and Urmson are two of the many best and brightest minds in transportation who will be joining us on our virtual stage in June. Among the growing list of speakers are GM&#8217;s VP of Global Innovation <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, Scale AI CEO <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman </strong>(whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital, Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla, Zoox co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-owned Flipkart is exempting storage and cancellation fees for sellers on its marketplace and also providing them with insurance coverage as the top e-commerce platform in India looks to maintain cordial relationships with more than 300,000 sellers who are facing severe disruption amid an unprecedented rise in the spread of coronavirus infections in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm said Friday evening that it is exempting storage fees to sellers who use the company’s fulfilment centres, and also waiving off the cancellation fees until the end of the month. (Several Indian states, as they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">did during the first wave of the virus</a>, have imposed restrictions on sale and delivery of non-essential items.)</p>
<p>Flipkart will bear 100% premium of COVID insurance to all sellers that transact on the platform, covering any hospitalization and consultation fees between 50,000 Indian rupees ($685) to 300,000 Indian rupees ($4095).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news today comes a week after Amazon, Flipkart’s chief rival in India, announced it was waiving 50% of the referral fee sellers are required to pay the e-commerce firm for this month, though not all sellers are qualified to avail this benefit. (The company said earlier this week that it was also postponing Prime Day in India and Canada due to the growing cases of the infection.)</p>

<p>Flipkart said it is also making it easier for sellers to access working capital from the firm without any incremental cost, though it did not specify the steps it had made.</p>
<p>It is also extending the window for the Seller Protection Fund to 30 days (from 14) to make claims on returned products. Flipkart said it will also ease its policies and performance metrics to ensure that they are not impacted by state-led lockdowns.</p>
<p>Flipkart, which as of last year was working to go public this year, said it has partnered with Vriddhi, Walmart’s Supplier Development Program in India, to organize webinars for small businesses to share best practices to ensure safety of workforce and provide insights to stay afloat amid the crisis.</p>
<p>“Through these testing times it is our constant effort to support our seller partners who face immense operational challenges as a result of the pandemic. As a democratic marketplace, we want to ensure that our lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of seller partners are able to continue operations and keep the economic engine running,” said Jagjeet Harode, senior director and head of Marketplace at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“With them and their family’s financial and health safety in mind, we have rolled out these initiatives that will bring them the much-needed respite to keep their businesses active.”</p>
<p>India has been reporting over 400,00 daily infections this week, more than any other nation, as the world&#8217;s second-most populated nation struggles to contain the second wave of the virus. Scores of firms, startups, investors and people alike are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">uniting to help the nation fight the virus</a>, which has severely impacted the healthcare facilities.</p>
