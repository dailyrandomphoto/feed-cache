<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve been having a tough time filling vacant engineering and other positions at our company and are planning to make a more concerted effort to recruit internationally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have suggestions for attracting workers from abroad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Proactive in Pacifica</strong></p>
<p>Dear Proactive,</p>
<p>Yes, I have many suggestions on what you can do to support international talent interested in moving to the United States. Immigration is a great benefit for attracting the best and the brightest team members from around the globe. And providing immigration security through visa practices and green card programs supports retaining these valued individuals. Consider sponsoring international students and other qualified candidates in the upcoming H-1B lottery in March.</p>
<p>As it now stands, the H-1B lottery will be random this year, not pay-to-play. We anticipate the electronic lottery process will follow these dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 9 at 9 a.m. PST: H-1B registration process opens.</li>
<li>March 25 at 9 a.m. PDT: H-1B registration process closes.</li>
<li>March 31: You’ll know if your H-1B beneficiaries were selected electronically in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>April 1: First date to file H-1Bs selected in the lottery to request a 10/1/2021 or later start date.</li>
<li>June 30: Last anticipated day to complete filing of selected H-1B petitions in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>After June 30: Possibility of a second lottery for registrations submitted in March.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the H-1B and other proactive immigration-support measures you can take, your international team members will enjoy a greater sense of immigration security. This allows them to focus on their job rather than worrying about their immigration status. Here are my recommendations for drawing international talent from abroad and fostering productivity and loyalty.</p>
<h2>Establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy</h2>
<p>I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney who can help your company develop an immigration policy based on your company’s core values, recruiting and immigration budget, and growth plan. Think of immigration as a benefit and a way to differentiate your company from others when recruiting top talent. Providing immigration benefits and immigration security goes a long way toward building team member loyalty and longevity.</p>
<p>For some companies, the best policy may be to have no policy, but it’s important to be deliberate about it and how that will affect your ability to make decisions and budget. For other companies, they implement a limited immigration policy to, for example, hire 40 engineers as soon as possible. Even with a decentralized workforce, a new recruit may be happy to move from Ukraine to Idaho even if your company is not based there.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most difficult tasks in the increasingly high-fidelity world of gaming is making realistic-looking people — especially faces. Epic today <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-sneak-peek-at-metahuman-creator-high-fidelity-digital-humans-made-easy">showed off a new character creation tool</a> in Unreal Engine that lets you make a near-infinite variety of near-photorealistic digital people with far less effort than it might have taken before.</p>
<p>MetaHuman Creator is an application for designing characters that lets people mix and match presets then dive into the tiniest details. It&#8217;s a cloud-hosted service, since the amount of computing power and storage needed to render these characters at this resolution and level of lighting and so on is more than most people will have on hand.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s used a high-quality character creator will recognize the pieces — a few dozen hairstyles, ear types, beards and lip shapes, which can be added, subtracted and adjusted like a digital Mr. Potato Head. Bet you didn&#8217;t see <em>that</em> reference coming!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111706" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111706" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2111706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg" alt="Close-up of CG faces showing details of skin reflectivity and wrinkles." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metahuman-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2111706" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Epic</p></div></p>
<p>The difference between MetaHuman and, say, a state of the art consumer-level creator like Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s is fidelity and flexibility. As you can see in the videos, the quality of the hair, skin, eyes, teeth and so on is extremely high — the older fellow on the left has quite realistic wrinkles that shadow and deform properly when he moves his face, and the way the light interacts with the center lady&#8217;s light skin is very different from that of the dark-skinned man on the right.</p>
<p>The &#8220;center lady&#8221; also started as a middle-aged man and was sculpted piece by piece to her current look rather than just switching to a &#8220;feminine&#8221; preset, demonstrating that the faces don&#8217;t &#8220;break&#8221; if you manipulate them too much — a risk in other creators for sure. You can see the process in fast-forward in the video below:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3F1vZYpH8c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Naturally it also integrates with the usual creator tools, allowing for animation by various means, fiddling with meshes and exporting for use in other tools.</p>
<p>This level of detail isn&#8217;t exactly unprecedented, but the amount of work that goes into rendering a main character good enough for extreme close-ups and microexpressions is huge. Epic&#8217;s approach is not just to increase the potential quality of the assets and lighting and so on but to make it easy and efficient to implement. If only AAA studios can muster the resources to make characters like this, it&#8217;s not healthy for gaming as a whole.</p>
<p>Epic was humble enough to give credit right off the bat to companies like 3Lateral and Cubic Motion, both specialists in the field it has acquired. The Unreal Engine is presented as a sort of monolithic advance in computer graphics and design, but really it&#8217;s a very cleverly assembled amalgamation of dozens of improvements and advances made by individual (now acquired) companies and divisions over the years — more like an operating system with a bunch of integrated applications at this point.</p>
<p>MetaHuman Creator isn&#8217;t quite ready for use by just anyone, but Epic is running an early-access program you can sign up for, and they&#8217;ve provided a pair of models for you to play with in your existing Unreal Engine environment in the meantime (check the &#8220;Learn&#8221; tab).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile analytics and market data company App Annie <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/product-announcements/app-annie-pulse/">launched a new app today</a> that CEO Ted Krantz said is built not for the analyst who&#8217;s &#8220;immersed in the data,&#8221; but rather the executive who needs &#8220;a much more elevated, top-down view.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest new piece of the company&#8217;s Pulse app is something called the App Annie Performance Score, which Krantz compares to <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/what-exactly-is-a-fico-score">a FICO score</a> for mobile apps. The idea is to take an app&#8217;s user acquisition, engagement, monetization and sentiment and boil them down into a single score that benchmarks how the app is performing relative to the competition.</p>
<p>Krantz said that eventually, the performance store could become more customizable for each customer, so that  &#8220;you can tailor it to the metrics that matter to you.&#8221; The app also highlights any shifts in key app metrics and identifies potential causes, and it includes a newsfeed showing what&#8217;s happening to the apps and markets that a user follows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?w=680" alt="App Annie Pulse" width="680" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Performance_Score_v3_TightCropped_withText_gap-1024x945-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>The goal, Krantz added, is to provide executives with a quick overview of the data they need without requiring them to dig through it or wait for a report — especially as &#8220;mobile is becoming such an imperative.&#8221; It&#8217;s the team&#8217;s &#8220;aspiration&#8221; to create an app that executives check every day, though he&#8217;s not necessarily expecting that to happen initially.</p>
<p>The Pulse app is based on App Annie&#8217;s market-level data, so Krantz said it shouldn&#8217;t be affected by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes</a>. At the same time, he acknowledged that the company&#8217;s broader goals of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/app-annie-ascend/">bringing together first-party and third-party data</a> are starting too look &#8220;a little tricky.&#8221;</p>
<p>App Annie Pulse is currently available on iOS, with the company planning to launch an Android version in the second quarter of this year. And while Pulse is only available to paying App Annie customers, Krantz said there are also plans for &#8220;revamping the free side of the equation and make that a little more meaty.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA will provide 1,000 of its employees, including 150 astronauts, with Fitbit devices in a<a href="https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/NASA-Makes-Fitbit-Ready-for-Work-Solution-Available-to-Support-Health-and-Safety-of-Astronauts-and-Other-Mission-Critical-Employees-During-COVID-19-Pandemic/default.aspx"> pilot program</a> designed to see if they can help supplement efforts to keep these mission-critical personnel healthy ahead of key space missions. The program will see NASA employees outfitted with a wearable and provided access to a daily check-in app they can use to log potential symptoms, as well as their body temperature and other key health metrics, which could potentially help spot developing cases.</p>
<p>NASA has already been taking measures to isolate astronauts and to limit or prevent the spread of COVID-19 across its facilities, which are located across the U.S. It has of course followed local guidelines and requirements regarding COVID-19 protections, but it also introduced its own level-based system last year and implemented remote work protocols for many employees wherever possible. On the astronaut side, it has also beefed up existing isolation and sequestration procedures that are already quite strict in order to guarantee that its spacefarers don&#8217;t get sick before they&#8217;re set to make a trip to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>The new Fitbit program is designed to supplement those existing measures, providing tracked health metrics including resting heart rate and heart rate variability, as well as respiratory rate, changes in all of which have been linked to COVID-19. Those stats, along with the self-reported metrics logged by users themselves, including any reports of potential symptoms, will be used by the app to provide individuals in the program with guidance about whether they should go into work, or stay home and take additional measures to find out if they have COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitbit is already engaged in studies to determine whether its wearable devices and the metrics they log can be useful in providing early COVID-19 detection. Regardless of those results, self-reporting as well as the baseline health metrics that the app logs from its devices are already likely to be handy in providing a supplement to existing self-assessment measures regarding the level of risk you pose to others if you&#8217;re feeling off, which is the primary purpose of this program with NASA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the second impeachment trial of his presidency unfolds, there&#8217;s another bit of bad news for the former president. In a new interview on CNBC&#8217;s Squawk Box, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal gave the decisive word on how the company would handle Trump&#8217;s Twitter account long term.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about what would happen if Trump ran again and was elected to office, Segal didn&#8217;t mince words.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way our policies work, when you&#8217;re removed from the platform, you&#8217;re removed from the platform — whether you&#8217;re a commentator, you&#8217;re a CFO, or you are a former or current public official,&#8221; Segal said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Remember, our policies are designed to make sure that people are not inciting violence, and if anybody does that, we have to remove them from the service and our policies don&#8217;t allow people to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter banned Trump from its platform one month ago citing concerns about the &#8220;risk of further incitement of violence.&#8221; Trump&#8217;s role in instigating the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol ultimately sealed his fate on his platform of choice, where he&#8217;d spent four years rallying his followers, amplifying conspiracies and lambasting his critics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor has recommended that a ban on targeted advertising based on tracking Internet users&#8217; digital activity be included in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">major reform of digital services rules</a> which aims to increase operators&#8217; accountability, among other key goals.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), Wojciech Wiewiorówski, made the call for a ban on surveillance-based targeted ads in reference to the Commission&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; following a request for consultation from EU lawmakers.</p>
<p>The DSA legislative proposal was introduced in December, alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) &#8212; kicking off the EU&#8217;s (often lengthy) co-legislative process which involves debate and negotiations in the European Parliament and Council on amendments before any final text can be agreed for approval. This means <a href="https://www.eppgroup.eu/newsroom/publications/epp-group-position-on-the-digital-services-act-dsa">battle lines</a> are being drawn to try to influence the final shape of the biggest overhaul to pan-EU digital rules for decades &#8212; with everything to play for.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PgbEW0t2VE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/embed/#?secret=PgbEW0t2VE" data-secret="PgbEW0t2VE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The intervention by Europe&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor calling for a ban on targeted ads is a powerful pre-emptive push against attempts to water down legislative protections for consumer interests.</p>
<p>The Commission had not gone so far in its proposal &#8212; but big tech lobbyists are certainly pushing in the opposite direction so the EDPS taking a strong line here looks important.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/21-02-10-opinion_on_digital_services_act_en.pdf">opinion</a> on the DSA the EDPS writes that &#8220;additional safeguards&#8221; are needed to supplement risk mitigation measures proposed by the Commission &#8212; arguing that &#8220;certain activities in the context of online platforms present increasing risks not only for the rights of individuals, but for society as a whole&#8221;.</p>
<p>Online advertising, recommender systems and content moderation are the areas the EDPS is particularly concerned about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the multitude of risks associated with online targeted advertising, the EDPS urges the co-legislators to consider additional rules going beyond transparency,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Such measures should include a phase-out leading to a prohibition of targeted advertising on the basis of pervasive tracking, as well as restrictions in relation to the categories of data that can be processed for targeting purposes and the categories of data that may be disclosed to advertisers or third parties to enable or facilitate targeted advertising.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest regional salvo aimed at mass-surveillance-based targeted ads after the European Parliament called for tighter rules back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">October</a> &#8212; when it suggested EU lawmakers should consider a phased in ban.</p>
<p>Again, though, the EDPS is going a bit further here in actually calling for one. (Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">Nick Clegg will be clutching his pearls</a>.)</p>
<p>More recently, the CEO of European publishing giant Axel Springer, a long time co-conspirator of adtech interests, went public with a (rather protectionist-flavored) rant about US-based data-mining tech platforms turning citizens into &#8220;the marionettes of capitalist monopolies&#8221; &#8212; calling for EU lawmakers to extend regional privacy rules by prohibiting platforms from storing personal data and using it for commercial gain <em>at all</em>.</p>

Sensitive and personal data does not belong in the hands of platforms that rule the market (so-called gatekeepers) or in the hands of states.&#8221;</span></div>
</div>
<p>Apple CEO, Tim Cook, also took to the virtual stage of a (usually) Brussels based conference <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">last month</a> to urge Europe to double down on enforcement of its flagship General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In the speech Cook warned that the adtech &#8216;data complex&#8217; is fuelling a social catastrophe by driving the spread of disinformation as it works to profit off of mass manipulation. He went on to urge lawmakers on both sides of the pond to &#8220;send a universal, humanistic response to those who claim a right to users’ private information about what should not and will not be tolerated&#8221;. So it&#8217;s not just European companies (and institutions) calling for pro-privacy reform of adtech.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker is preparing to introduce stricter limits on tracking on its smartphones by making apps ask users for permission to track, instead of just grabbing their data &#8212; a move that&#8217;s naturally raised the hackles of the adtech sector, which relies on mass surveillance to power &#8216;relevant&#8217; ads.</p>
<p>Hence the adtech industry has resorted to crying &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">antitrust</a>&#8216; as a tactic to push competition regulators to block platform-level moves against its consentless surveillance. And on that front it&#8217;s notable than the EDPS&#8217; <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/21-02-10-opinion_on_digital_markets_act_en.pdf">opinion</a> on the DMA, which proposes extra rules for intermediating platforms with the most market power, reiterates the vital links between competition, consumer protection and data protection law &#8212; saying these three are &#8220;inextricably linked policy areas in the context of the online platform economy&#8221;; and that there &#8220;should be a relationship of complementarity, not a relationship where one area replaces or enters into friction with another&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wiewiorówski also takes aim at recommender systems in his DSA opinion &#8212; saying these should not be based on profiling by default to ensure compliance with regional data protection rules (where privacy by design and default is supposed to be the legal default).</p>
<p>Here too be calls for additional measures to beef up the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal &#8212; with the aim of &#8220;further promot[ing] transparency and user control&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is necessary because such system have &#8220;significant impact&#8221;, the EDPS argues.</p>
<p>The role of content recommendation engines in driving Internet users towards hateful and extremist points of view has long been a subject of public scrutiny. Back in 2017, for example, UK parliamentarians grilled a number of tech companies on the topic &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/youtube-more-ai-can-fix-ai-generated-bubbles-of-hate/">raising concerns</a> that AI-driven tools, engineered to maximize platform profit by increasing user engagement, risked automating radicalization, causing damage not just to the individuals who become hooked on hateful views the algorithms feeds them but cascading knock-on harms for all of us as societal cohesion is eaten away in the name of keeping the eyeballs busy.</p>
<p>Yet years on little information is available on how such algorithmic recommender systems work because the private companies that operate and profit off these AIs shield the workings as proprietary business secrets.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/embed/#?secret=OTwP293o8T" data-secret="OTwP293o8T" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s DSA proposal takes aim at this sort of secrecy as a bar to accountability &#8212; with its push for transparency obligations. The proposed obligations (in the initial draft) include requirements for platforms to provide “meaningful” criteria used to target ads; and explain the “main parameters” of their recommender algorithms; as well as requirements to foreground user controls (including at least one “nonprofiling” option).</p>
<p>However the EDPS wants regional lawmakers to go further in the service of protecting individuals from exploitation (and society as a whole from the toxic byproducts that flow from an industry based on harvesting personal data to manipulate people).</p>
<p>On content moderation, Wiewiorówski&#8217;s opinion stresses that this should &#8220;take place in accordance with the rule of law&#8221;. Though the Commission draft has favored leaving it with platforms to interpret the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the already endemic monitoring of individuals’ behaviour, particularly in the context of online platforms, the DSA should delineate when efforts to combat &#8216;illegal content&#8217; legitimise the use of automated means to detect, identify and address illegal content,&#8221; he writes, in what looks like a tacit recognition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/europes-top-court-sets-new-line-on-policing-illegal-speech-online/">recent CJEU jurisprudence</a> in this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profiling for purposes of content moderation should be prohibited unless the provider can demonstrate that such measures are strictly necessary to address the systemic risks explicitly identified by the DSA,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The EDPS has also suggested minimum interoperability requirements for very large platforms, and for those designated as &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; (under the DMA), and urges lawmakers to work to promote the development of technical standards to help with this at the European level.</p>
<p>On the DMA, he also urges amendments to ensure the proposal &#8220;complements the GDPR effectively&#8221;, as he puts it, calling for &#8220;increasing protection for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the persons concerned, and avoiding frictions with current data protection rules&#8221;.</p>
<p>Among the EDPS&#8217; specific recommendations are: That the DMA makes it clear that gatekeeper platforms must provide users with easier and more accessible consent management; clarification to the scope of data portability envisaged in the draft; and rewording of a provision that requires gatekeepers to provide other businesses with access to aggregated user data &#8212; again with an eye on ensuring &#8220;full consistency with the GDPR&#8221;.</p>
<p>The opinion also raises the issue of the need for &#8220;effective anonymisation&#8221; &#8212; with the EDPS calling for &#8220;re-identification tests when sharing query, click and view data in relation to free and paid search generated by end users on online search engines of the gatekeeper&#8221;.</p>
<h2>ePrivacy reform emerges from stasis</h2>
<p>Wiewiorówski&#8217;s contributions to shaping incoming platform regulations come on the same day that the European Council has finally reached agreement on its negotiating position for a long-delayed EU reform effort around existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy</a> rules.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/10/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules/">press release</a> announcing the development, the Commission writes that Member States agreed on a negotiating mandate for revised rules on the protection of privacy and confidentiality in the use of electronic communications services.</p>
<p>&#8220;These updated ‘ePrivacy’ rules will define cases in which service providers are allowed to process electronic communications data or have access to data stored on end-users’ devices,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;Today’s agreement allows the Portuguese presidency to start talks with the European Parliament on the final text.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reform of the ePrivacy directive has been stalled for years as conflicting interests locked horns &#8212; putting paid to the (prior) Commission&#8217;s hopes that the whole effort could be done and dusted in 2018. (The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-eprivacy-regulation">original ePrivacy reform proposal</a> came out in January 2017; four years later the Council has finally settled on its arguing mandate.)</p>
<p>The fact that the GDPR was passed first appears to have upped the stakes for data-hungry ePrivacy lobbyists &#8212; in both the adtech and telco space (the latter having a keen interest in removing existing regulatory barriers on comms data in order that it can exploit the vast troves of user data which Internet giants running rival messaging and VoIP services have long been able to).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a concerted effort to try to use ePrivacy to undo consumer protections baked into GDPR &#8212; including attempts to water down protections provided for sensitive personal data. So the stage is set for an ugly rights battle as negotiations kick off with the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Metadata and cookie consent rules are also bound up with ePrivacy so there&#8217;s all sorts of messy and contested issues on the table here.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update of the ePrivacy rules are very much necessary to protect confidentiality of our communications: in 2002, it still took 5 years until the first iPhone, and there was hardly any instant messaging, video calls, and no inescapable commercial tracking practices</p>
<p>&mdash; Sophie in &#39;t Veld (@SophieintVeld) <a href="https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1359489227608719363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Digital rights advocacy group <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/after-four-years-of-talks-eu-states-reach-underwhelming-agreement-on-eprivacy-reform/">Access Now</a> summed up the ePrivacy development by slamming the Council for &#8220;hugely&#8221; missing the mark.</p>
<p>“The reform is supposed to strengthen privacy rights in the EU [but] States poked so many holes into the proposal that it now looks like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/16/swiss-win-the-gruyere-cheese-war">French Gruyère</a>,&#8221; said Estelle Massé, senior policy analyst at Access Now, in a statement. “The text adopted today is below par when compared to the Parliament’s text and previous versions of government positions. We lost forward-looking provisions for the protection of privacy while several surveillance measures have been added.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group said it will be pushing to restore requirements for service providers to protect online users’ privacy by default and for the establishment of clear rules against online tracking beyond cookies, among other policy preferences.</p>
<p>The Council, meanwhile, appears to be advocating for a highly dilute (and so probably useless) flavor of &#8216;do not track&#8217; &#8212; by suggesting users should be able to give consent to the use of &#8220;certain types of cookies by whitelisting one or several providers in their browser settings&#8221;, per the Commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Software providers will be encouraged to make it easy for users to set up and amend whitelists on their browsers and withdraw consent at any moment,&#8221; it adds in its <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/10/confidentiality-of-electronic-communications-council-agrees-its-position-on-eprivacy-rules/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly the devil will be in the detail of the Council&#8217;s position there. (The European Parliament has, by contrast, previously clearly endorsed a &#8220;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2017-0324_EN.pdf?redirect">legally binding and enforceable</a>&#8221; Do Not Track mechanism for ePrivacy so, again, the stage is set for clashes.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BZ1BnDlvRG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/">Tech-publisher coalition backs new push for browser-level privacy controls</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech-publisher coalition backs new push for browser-level privacy controls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/embed/#?secret=BZ1BnDlvRG" data-secret="BZ1BnDlvRG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Encryption is another likely bone of ePrivacy contention.</p>
<p>As security and privacy researcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, <a href="https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/proposed-amendments-to-eprivacy-regulation-are-great/">noted</a> back in mid 2017, the parliament strongly backed end-to-end encryption as a means of protecting the confidentiality of comms data &#8212; saying then that Member States should not impose any obligations on service providers to weaken strong encryption.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s notable that the Council does not have much to say about e2e encryption &#8212; at least in the PR version of its public position. (A line in this that runs: &#8220;As a main rule, electronic communications data will be confidential. Any interference, including listening to, monitoring and processing of data by anyone other than the end-user will be prohibited, except when permitted by the ePrivacy regulation&#8221; is hardly reassuring, either.)</p>
<p>It certainly looks like a worrying omission given recent efforts at the Council level to advocate for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/eu-council-wants-secure-encryption-and-lawful-data-access/">&#8216;lawful&#8217; access to encrypted data</a>. Digital and humans rights groups will be buckling up for a fight.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What we learn today will hopefully bear on other insurtech startups that want liquidity during the current cycle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last night, MetroMile and SPAC INSU Acquisition Corp. II <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/09/2172551/0/en/METROMILE-COMPLETES-BUSINESS-COMBINATION-WILL-BEGIN-TRADING-ON-NASDAQ-AS-MILE.html">completed</a> their combination, putting the <a href="https://www.metromile.com/">per-mile auto insurance startup</a> up for regular trading today for the first time.</p>
<p>In the wake of last year&#8217;s debuts by neoinsurance companies Lemonade and Root, it&#8217;s not surprising to see others test the public markets. For example, Oscar Health recently announced its intention to go public via a traditional IPO.</p>
<p>How the new entrants will fare, however, is not clear.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There is something of a tale of two companies in Lemonade and Root, with the pair valued at divergent multiples and sporting very different post-IPO trajectories, at least concerning their value.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />While Lemonade has appreciated greatly from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/understanding-hippos-valuation-in-a-post-lemonade-ipo-world/">its IPO price</a> ($29) to its current value ($155.33), Root&#8217;s share price dropped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing">from its debut</a> ($27) to today ($21.75).</p>
<p>This morning, as MetroMile starts its life as a public company, Oscar Health preps its own run at an IPO and other neoinsurance players <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201124005400/en/Hippo-Secures-350-Million-Capital-Investment">like Hippo wait in the wings</a>, let&#8217;s quickly check the difference between how Root and Lemonade have fared, and then ask what we can learn from their different valuation multiples and what they might mean for the next startup insurance players hoping to go public while the IPO window is wide open.</p>
<h2>Root, Lemonade</h2>
<p>Lemonade&#8217;s path to the public markets was one that started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/lemonade-targets-down-round-pricing-in-impending-ipo/">modestly with its first IPO pricing</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/insurtech-unicorn-lemonade-raises-ipo-range-ahead-of-debut/">improved</a>, and then, after technically going public at a down-round valuation, took off like a rocket. Root&#8217;s IPO pricing run involved what we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/">thought of as a strong IPO range</a> and then an above-target pricing.</p>
<p>But since then, Lemonade shares have rallied to several times their original price, while Root has dropped around 20%. Lemonade, for reference, sells rental insurance with an eye on going up-market in time to other forms of home-focused insurance. Root is in the auto insurance market, where MetroMile also works.</p>
<p>Both Lemonade and Root have yet to announce Q4 2020 results, so we&#8217;ll look at their Q3 details instead. We want to get a handle for how divergently their insurance incomes are being treated. This should give us a better understanding of how Wall Street values each, then we&#8217;ll apply what we learn to our two new companies. What we learn today will hopefully bear on other insurtech startups that want liquidity during the current cycle.</p>
<p>Results via <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/2bbfd172-5dd2-470a-a3c9-654bffc10e14">the company</a>, comparisons are Q3 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root Q3 2020 revenue: $50.5 million (impaired from $75.8 million).</li>
<li>Root Q3 2020 gross profit: $0.7 million (improved from -$36 million).</li>
<li>Root Q3 2020 net loss: $85.2 million (improved from -$100.1 million).</li>
<li>Premiums in force: $600.1 million.</li>
<li>Valuation: $5.45 billion (Google Finance).</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives us Root revenue run rate multiple of around 27x, and a premium in force multiple of just over 9x. Now let&#8217;s observe Lemonade&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Results via <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2020/11/Q3-2020-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">the company</a>, comparisons are Q3 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 revenue: $10.5 million (impaired from $17.8 million).</li>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 gross profit: $7.3 million (improved from $4 million).</li>
<li>Lemonade Q3 2020 net loss: $30.9 million (improved from $31.1 million).</li>
<li>Premiums in force: $188.9 million.</li>
<li>Valuation: $9.33 billion (Google Finance).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the same two metrics, Lemonade has a run rate multiple of 222x, and a premium in force multiple of more than 49x.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexavontobel/">Alexa von Tobel</a> has a unique vantage point on the world of startups. She debuted in the tech space with the launch of LearnVest in 2009. The company raised nearly $70 million and sold to Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an <a href="https://www.inc.com/video/how-alexa-von-tobel-took-learnvest-from-startup-to-a-375-million-exit.html?cid=sf01001">estimated $375 million</a>, according to reports.</p>
<p>Since, von Tobel has founded her own venture firm called Inspired Capital. Portfolio companies include Finix, Chief, Orum, Habi and more.</p>
<p>But before she was an entrepreneur, <em>or</em> the chief digital officer of a major financial services company (and then chief innovation officer, overseeing the Northwestern Mutual&#8217;s venture arm), <em>or</em> the founding partner of a venture capital firm, she was a certified financial planner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage in April, von Tobel will lead a breakout on financial planning targeted specifically at early-stage startups.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<h2><strong>Finance for Founders </strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>As a founder, you not only have to master your company&#8217;s finances, you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions. Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a certified financial planner, Alexa will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Early Stage is back in 2021 and better than ever. The event is centered around all the startup core competencies that founders will need in their tool chest to build successful businesses, from marketing to operations to fundraising.</p>

<p>Von Tobel joins an all-star lineup, which includes experts in the fields of sales, seed and Series A fundraising, recruiting and much much more. These experts will give presentations across a variety of topics, and then answer questions live from the audience.</p>
<p>The event is split across two days: On April 1 we&#8217;ll be hearing from experts in fundraising and operations, and on July 8 we&#8217;ll learn more from experts in fundraising and marketing. At both events, the TechCrunch pitch-off will be center stage, giving early-stage companies the chance to pitch to and get feedback from seasoned investors. Early Stage is entirely virtual, so folks from anywhere in the world can pick up a ticket and show up from the comfort of their couch.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope you&#8217;ll join us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer genomics company Ancestry has confirmed it fought two U.S. law enforcement requests to access its DNA database in the past six months, but that neither request resulted in turning over customer or DNA data.</p>
<p>The Utah-based company disclosed the two requests in <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency?=cddc0d8327858468ebef3980bb17b283">its latest transparency report</a> covering the latter half of 2020. The report said Ancestry &#8220;challenged both of these requests, which were withdrawn,&#8221; and that the company &#8220;provided no data&#8221; at the time of the report, published Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ancestry did not say which agencies or police departments requested the DNA data or for what reason the company challenged the request. Ancestry spokesperson Gina Spatafore confirmed the search warrants were to obtain DNA data but declined to comment beyond what was in the report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also said in its most recent report that it &#8220;refused numerous inquiries&#8221; from U.S. law enforcement for failing to obtain the proper legal process. The report also said the company received four valid law enforcement requests, but that it did not provide any data in response.</p>
<p>Ancestry has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/facebook-executive-deborah-liu-named-ceo-of-ancestry-com">more than 3.6 million subscribers</a> and has more than 18 million customer DNA profiles in its database, making it the largest in the world.</p>
<p>DNA profiling companies like Ancestry are increasingly popular with customers wanting to learn more about their family heritage, their genetic markers and to understand their cultural and ethnic backgrounds. But as these DNA databases become larger, they are also attracting attention from law enforcement who want access to help solve crimes.</p>
<p>On its website, Ancestry says: &#8220;We believe that the nature of our members&#8217; DNA data is particularly sensitive, so we insist on a court order or search warrant as the minimum level of due process before we will review our ability to comply with the request. We also seek to put our members&#8217; privacy first, so we also will try to minimize the scope or even invalidate the warrant before complying.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Ancestry has pushed back against a legal demand. Last year the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/ancestry-warrant-dna-records/">said it rejected</a> an out-of-state search warrant, ordered by a court in Pennsylvania, to &#8220;seek access&#8221; to its DNA database on the grounds that the warrant was &#8220;improperly served.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ancestry has only complied <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/transparency-2015">with one search warrant</a> for DNA data from a database it acquired and later made public, not realizing that police would <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/familial-dna-evidence-turns-innocent-people-into-crime-suspects/">use the database</a> to search for leads.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for companies with large amounts of customer data to frequently receive law enforcement demands for user data — or for companies to publish periodic transparency reports that detail the number of legal demands they receive.</p>
<p>To its credit, Ancestry is one of only two DNA profiling sites that publishes a transparency report. 23andMe <a href="https://www.23andme.com/transparency-report/">also publishes</a> the number of data demands it receives each quarter, but to date has not released any customer data to law enforcement. FamilyDNA said <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/legal/law-enforcement-guide">over a year ago</a> that it was &#8220;working on publishing&#8221; a transparency report.</p>
<p>The move by Ancestry and 23andMe came shortly after police used DNA profiling site GEDmatch to identify the DNA of a suspected serial killer, a breakthrough that later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/hlavka-murder-gedmatch-dna/">led to the arrest</a> of the so-called Golden State Killer in 2018. GEDmatch said it was &#8220;not approached by law enforcement&#8221; prior to the search. GEDmatch soon after allowed its users to opt-in for their DNA to be included in police searches.</p>
<p>Last year, GEDmatch confirmed it was hit by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/gedmatch-investigating-dna-profile-law-enforcement/">two data breaches</a> that made user profiles visible to other users, including law enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Maps is inching into more Waze-like territory with an update that will give drivers the ability to report road hazards, accidents or even speed traps. The new features are live in the iOS 14.5 beta, which is now open to public beta testers as well as developers, but won&#8217;t roll out to the general public until later this spring, Apple says.</p>
<p>To use the new features, drivers will be able to report road issues and incidents by using Siri on their iPhone or through Apple&#8217;s CarPlay. For example, during navigation, they&#8217;ll be able to tell Siri things like &#8220;there&#8217;s a crash up head,&#8221; &#8220;there&#8217;s something on the road,&#8221; or &#8220;there&#8217;s a speed trap here.&#8221; They&#8217;ll also be able to correct stale accident or hazard alert information by saying things like &#8220;the hazard is gone&#8221; or the &#8220;incident is no longer here.&#8221;</p>
<p>While using Siri makes the reporting experience safer, the updated app will also allow users to swipe up on the map to tap a report button to alert others to accidents, hazards or speed traps, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The update could present a challenge to Google-owned navigation app Waze, which has long been a popular tool for staying alerted to road conditions, hazards, accidents and police presence. In Waze, users can interact by touching the screen or issuing commands <a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/9332876?hl=en">through Google Assistant</a>, but voice support for iOS users, naturally, is more limited. Today, Waze supports the use of Siri Shortcuts, which have to be manually configured and added to Siri, for example.</p>
<p>The new Apple Maps features could also make Apple&#8217;s app more appealing to users who feel their user data is safer within Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, thanks to the work Apple has done to position itself as the company that cares more about consumer privacy.</p>
<p>Notable, too, is the addition of speed traps, which represents a shift in direction for Apple Maps. Historically, Apple has been opposed to including police warnings in its product. But that lack of support has contributed to Google&#8217;s ability to dominate the navigation and mapping market on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s decision here also follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/google-maps-adds-more-waze-like-features-including-driving-incident-reports/">an expansion of Waze-like features</a> to Google Maps, blurring the distinctions between Google&#8217;s two navigation products even further. And as Google continued to roll out the ability to report accidents, traffic, speed traps and more to Google Maps users on iOS, it made it even harder for anyone who would have otherwise considered switching to Apple Maps to make the jump.</p>
<p>Apple, belatedly, has seemed to realize this as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://inaccord.com/">Accord</a>, an early stage startup focused on bringing order to B2B sales, are not your typical engineer founders. Instead, the two brothers, Ross and Ryan Rich, worked as sales reps seeing the problems unique to this kind of sale first-hand.</p>
<p>In November 2019, they decided to leave the comfort of their high-paying jobs at Google and Stripe to launch Accord and build what they believe is a missing platform for B2B sales, one that takes into account the needs of both the sales person and the buyer.</p>
<p>Today the company is launching with a $6 million seed round from former employer Stripe and Y Combinator. It should be noted that the founders applied to YC after leaving their jobs, and impressed the incubator with their insight and industry experience, even though they didn&#8217;t really have a product yet. In fact, they literally drew their original idea on a piece of paper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111480" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111480" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Original prototype of Accord sketched on a piece of paper." width="680" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg 1106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=768,572 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-10-at-9.21.15-AM.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111480" class="wp-caption-text">The original prototype was just a drawing of their idea. Image Credits: Accord</p></div></p>
<p>Recognizing they had the sales skills, but lacked programming chops, they quickly brought in a third partner, Wayne Pan to bring their idea to life. Today, they have an actual working program with paying customers. They&#8217;ve created a kind of online hub for B2B sales people and buyers to interact.</p>
<p>As co-founder Ross Rich points out these kinds of sales are very different from the consumer variety, often involving as many as 14 people on average on the buyer side. With so many people involved in the decision-making process, it can become unwieldy pretty quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide within the application shared next steps and milestones to align on and that the buyer can track asynchronously, a resource hub to avoid sorting through those hundreds of emails and threads for a single document or presentation and stakeholder management to make sure the right people are looped in at the right time,&#8221; Rich explained.</p>
<p>Accord also integrates with the company CRM like Salesforce to make sure all of that juicy data is being tracked properly in the sales database. At the same time, Rich says the startup wants this platform to be a place for human interaction. Instead of an automated email or text, this provides a place where humans can actually interact with one another, and he believes that human element is important to help reduce the complexity inherent in these kinds of deals.</p>
<p>With $6 million in runway and a stint at Y Combinator under their belts, the founders are ready to make more concerted go-to-market push. They are currently at 9 people, mostly engineers aside from the two sales-focused founders. He figures to be bringing in some new employees this year, but doesn&#8217;t really have a sense of how many they will bring on just yet, saying that is something that they will figure out in the coming months.</p>
<p>As they do that, they are already thinking about being inclusive with several women on the engineering team, recognizing if they don&#8217;t start diversity early, it will be more difficult later on. &#8220;[Hiring a diverse group early] only compounds when you get to nine or 10 people and then when you&#8217;re talking to someone and they are wondering &#8216;do I trust this team and is that a culture where I want to work?&#8217; He says if you want to build a diverse and inclusive workplace, you have to start making that investment early.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for this team, but they are building a product to help B2B sales teams work more closely and effectively with customers, and with their background and understanding of the space, they seem well positioned to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai, which has developed a no-code platform for businesses, closed on a $2 million seed funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s SaaS platform aims to allow business users to structure any free-text data with custom categories built through a drag &amp; drop interface, based on AI-extracted concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Village Global led the financing, which included participation from new and existing backers including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceleprise, Oceans Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, 2.12 Angels, GTMFund and Lorimer Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spain-born Jorge Penalva founded Lang.ai in 2018 with the goal of giving any business user the ability “to build enterprise-ready natural language processing models in just minutes.” It was built to give non-engineers a way to automate repetitive tasks in use cases such as customer service and claims processing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can be installed in our cloud or theirs,” Penalva said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai saw its revenue double from the last quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021 and the seed funding was motivated mainly to continue that momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re getting demand in the form of projects with our larger customers, so we needed the funding to be able to support that demand,” Penalva told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his previous role of CEO of Séntisis, Penalva realized that processes driven by free-text data remained a blind spot for many companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Today, millions of dollars and hours are invested by companies to manually read and process textual information captured from disparate areas of their business,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mission with Lang.ai is to “empower businesses to put AI to work for them, without the technical complexities of building and training custom algorithms.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Penalva said that Lang.ai’s product analyzes a customer’s historical data “in minutes” and suggests AI-extracted concepts to build </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom categories through a drag &amp; drop interface. The custom categories are applied in real time to automate “tedious” tasks such as the manual tagging and routing of support tickets, the processing of insurance claims and the dispatching of field engineers to incoming work order requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Lang.ai’s goal is to remove the technical burden of implementing AI for a business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lang.ai’s community of users (called “Citizen NLP Builders”) consists of mostly non-technical business roles, ranging from customer service operations to marketers, business analysts and UX designers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers include Freshly, Userzoom, Playvox, Spain’s CaixaBank, Yalo Chat and Bancolombia, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Segal, director of infrastructural efficiency at Freshly, described the platform as “so nimble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Out of the box, it took us two days to make automated tagging 15% more reliable than a previous platform that we had had in production for two years, with the added benefit that now all of our teams can tap into and exploit our support data,” Segal said. “The marketing team has built workflows to understand key customer moments. Our data and analytics team is super excited about having all these new tags in Snowflake, and it’s crazy how easy it is to use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penalva is proud of the fact that Lang.ai’s engineering team is primarily based in Spain and that he has been able to grow the 10-person company outside of his native country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With very few resources, it took us a little over two years to build an enterprise-grade product and find the right set of early customers and investors who are aligned with our vision,” he said. “I moved to the U.S. from Spain to build a global company and this is just the beginning&#8230;Lang has always been powered by immigrant hustle, and it has been core to our values since day 1.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei spoke rather diplomatically about the company’s hopes of holding talks with the new U.S. administration. The hardware giant is also taking a less conciliatory route, challenging its FCC designation as a national security threat.</p>
<p>The company this week filed a suit with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, calling the FCC ruling, “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion and not supported by substantial evidence.”</p>
<p>Questions have swirled for years around the smartphone maker’s ties to the Chinese government, but the U.S. greatly ramped up actions against Huawei during the Trump years. The federal government has taken a number of routes to essentially kneecap the company, including, notably, its addition to the Department of Commerce’s “entity list,” which effectively barred it from working with U.S. companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Huawei likely sees a change in U.S. governance as an opportunity to be reevaluated by the powers that be. The company has long denied spying and other security charges. &#8220;I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success.” Ren earlier this week told the media that he was eager to speak with Biden. “The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”</p>
<p>In a statement offered to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-files-u-s-lawsuit-disputing-it-is-a-security-threat-11612880705"> The Wall Street Journal</a>, however, an FCC spokesperson stayed firm to the 2020 decision, stating, “Last year the FCC issued a final designation identifying Huawei as a national security threat based on a substantial body of evidence developed by the FCC and numerous U.S. national security agencies. We will continue to defend that decision.”</p>

<p>Thus far, the Biden administration hasn’t indicated any plans to soften restrictions on Huawei. Facing opposition from Republican lawmakers, Commerce Secretary nominee Gina Raimondo noted, “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration does appear to be reviewing other actions against Chinese companies taken during the Trump administration. Notably, a planned forced sale of TikTok’s U.S. wing has been put on hold while the White House reassesses security concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of social audio 1.0 is in full swing, and while podcasts and Clubhouse have led the way, there are many other audio startups joining the fold. <a href="https://www.beta.wearequilt.com/">Quilt</a>, an audio social network that focuses on wellness and community, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/">Mayfield Fund</a>, with partner Rishi Garg joining the board, to do just that.</p>
<p>Quilt started as a community platform founded by Ashley Sumner, which let local folks meet up with one another in their own homes. Sumner was on the founding team at NeueHouse and has spent her career building community through physical space. Thousands of Quilt conversations were happening out of peoples&#8217; homes until the pandemic struck in March, resulting in an existential crisis for the startup.</p>
<p>Sumner quickly moved Quilt over to Zoom but soon realized that video chat didn&#8217;t quite capture the magic that was happening in person, nor did it prove the right medium to foster the type of conversations that had made Quilt so special.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She worked to develop an audio app that would become the new Quilt 2.0, which went live in the App Store at the end of January.</p>
<p>Quilt allows anyone to start a room for a conversation, dropping a line or two of text to describe what they want to talk about. The app is focused on wellness, breaking rooms into three different categories: spiritual and personal development (with conversations around meditation, astrology, human design, etc.), career and purpose (&#8220;it was very important to link purpose to it,&#8221; said Sumner, &#8220;these aren&#8217;t networking events&#8221;), and relationships, sex and family.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?w=680" alt="Quilt" width="680" height="368" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png 2960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=768,415 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=680,368 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=1536,830 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=2048,1107 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PR3.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Quilt</p></div></p>
<p>The platform has put specific focus on balancing the engagement levels of content creators and consumers. According to Quilt, 98% of hosts attend other hosts&#8217; conversations and more than 50% of Quilters talk during any given conversation.</p>
<p>Garg, who has spent nearly two decades in the emerging media space, talked about how the engagement ratio among creators, consumers and &#8220;bystanders&#8221; is different for each social platform based on the medium and product choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;With YouTube, the famous number was 1% create, 9% engage and 90% sit back,&#8221; said Garg. &#8220;At Twitter, interestingly, it was 10%, 30%, 60%. If you look at something like Clubhouse, you&#8217;re seeing that parallel already happen. It&#8217;s like celebrity central. Part of what got us excited about Quilt was that anyone could just start a room. We really focused in on the pathway between being a consumer to being a creator. Starting or hosting a room is shorter than on any other social media platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that the norms within the Quilt community are a big part of what makes that possible, saying there is a hurdle associated with platforms that are more celebrity-driven or top-heavy. Consumers look at the bar that is set by the community and feel they&#8217;re not famous enough, or don&#8217;t have a big enough community to contribute, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the magic of Quilt is that everyone can feel like they have something to offer,&#8221; Garg explained. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a lot more scalable and a lot less fragile than an ecosystem built entirely on celebrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Retention also seems to be strong in Quilt&#8217;s early days, with 80% of sign-ups coming back for conversations every week. The company also said that around 60% of conversations are started spontaneously, rather than being a planned and promoted &#8220;event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sumner says that Quilt will never generate revenue through advertising, but rather employ a freemium model.</p>
<p>Existing investors such as Freestyle VC&#8217;s Jenny Lefcourt and Upside Partnership&#8217;s Kent Goldman and Christina Hunt also participated in this latest round, alongside new investors, including Houseparty CEO Sima Sistani, The Mini Fund&#8217;s Eros Resmini, former Discord CMO Allison Stoloff and others.</p>
<p>The Quilt team is currently made up of eight people, 50% of whom are female and 25% of whom are non-Black people of color. Twenty percent are LGBT and 10% are non-binary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The insane saga of a potential forced sale of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations is reportedly ending — another victim of the transition to methodical and rational policymaking that appears to be the boring new normal under the presidency of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Last fall, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation/">took a stab at &#8220;gangster capitalism&#8221;</a> by trying to force the sale of TikTok to a group of buyers including Oracle and Walmart.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gangster capitalism and the American theft of Chinese innovation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/20/gangster-capitalism-and-the-american-theft-of-chinese-innovation/embed/#?secret=D4YX7R8mBF" data-secret="D4YX7R8mBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the effort was doomed from the start, with TikTok&#8217;s parent company ByteDance winning most of the legal challenges to the government effort, a Rubicon had effectively been crossed where the U.S. government appeared willing to spend political capital to stymie the growth of a successful foreign business on its shores for the flimsiest of security reasons.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">The Wall Street Journal</a> is reporting that the efforts by the U.S. government to push the deal forward &#8220;have been shelved indefinitely,&#8221; citing sources familiar with the process.</p>
<p>However, discussions between TikTok and U.S. national security officials are continuing because there are valid concerns around TikTok&#8217;s data collection and the potential for manipulation and censorship of content on the app.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the U.S. is taking a look at all of the potential threats to data privacy and security from intrusions by foreign governments or using tech developed overseas, according to Emily Horne, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council.</p>
<div class="paywall">

<div class="media-object-rich-text">
<p>“We plan to develop a comprehensive approach to securing U.S. data that addresses the full range of threats we face,” Horne told the WSJ. “This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the U.S. In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks we face.”</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">then-President Trump ordered a ban on TikTok</a>, intending to force the sale of the Chinese-owned, short-form video distribution service to a U.S.-owned investment group.</p>

<p>As part of that process, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. ordered ByteDance to divest of its U.S. operations. TikTok appealed that order in court in Washington last November as the U.S. was roiled by the presidential election and its aftermath.</p>
<p>That case is still pending, but separate federal court rulings have blocked the U.S. government from shutting down TikTok.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you want to make your website accessible right now but lack the resources for the kind of serious revamp it would take, an &#8220;accessibility overlay&#8221; may take the pressure off while the work gets done. Though critics argue that these tools aren&#8217;t a permanent solution, accessiBe has raised $28 million to show that its approach is an important part of making the entire web available to everyone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a problem often faced by small businesses: their website may not have been built to modern <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">accessibility standards</a>, and not only needs a deep dive by professionals to fix, but ongoing work to keep up to date and fix errors. This sort of work can be very expensive, and SMBs may not have the cash to lay out. This is not only a bummer for anyone with a disability who visits the site, but it exposes the business to legal action.</p>
<p>At the enterprise level, accessibility is increasingly becoming part of the development process, and startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/fable-aims-to-make-disability-inclusive-design-as-simple-as-a-service/">Fable</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/evinced-raises-17m-to-speed-up-accessibility-testing-for-the-web/">Evinced</a> are looking to push things forward there. For those whose development budgets compete with rent and food money, however, other approaches may be desired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fable aims to make disability-inclusive design as simple as a service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/fable-aims-to-make-disability-inclusive-design-as-simple-as-a-service/embed/#?secret=GXKxAfGo0C" data-secret="GXKxAfGo0C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AccessiBe is one of a few new services called accessibility overlays that claim to provide total ADA compliance and other features just by installing a line of JavaScript. If it sounds too good to be true&#8230; well, it is and it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What the overlay code does is scrub the whole website&#8217;s user-facing code for issues like unlabeled buttons, fields that aren&#8217;t addressable by keyboard navigation, images without alt text and other common accessibility issues. AccessiBe&#8217;s system does so with the addition of machine learning to match features of the target site to those in its training database, so even if something is really poorly coded, it can still be recognized by its context or clear intention.</p>
<p>You can try it out yourself at a handful of websites by appending #showacsb: it&#8217;s live on <a href="https://www.everlast.com/#showacsb">Everlast</a>, <a href="https://www.tupperware.com/#showacsb">Tupperware</a> and <a href="https://www.playmobil.us/#showacsb">Playmobil</a> (among many others).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2111009 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png" alt="Screenshot of the Everlast website with accessiBe's overlay on the right with options to adjust text and visuals." width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png 1807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=1536,982 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/accessibe-interface.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>The result is a website that works in many ways as if it was designed with accessibility in mind, fixing a lot of the basic problems that prevent visitors with disabilities from using a site, and providing plenty of additional quality-of-life features like improving contrast, stopping animations, changing the font, etc. The overlay can be automatically activated or manually by users prompted by screen reader text that tells them how to do so.</p>
<p>AccessiBe&#8217;s agent scans the site regularly and updates what users will see, and the website owner pays monthly (<a href="https://accessibe.com/pricing">from $40 to a couple hundred a month</a> depending on the size of the site) to have the tool available. This demo video does a pretty good job of showing the problems the tool fixes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPucaklb1v4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>You may wonder how this could be considered anything but good for accessibility, but there&#8217;s serious debate over the role of overlays in considerations for how the web should be made more accessible. The implication of such a tool is that all that&#8217;s needed to make any website accessible is a single line of code. This leads to a couple of problems.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s questionable whether automated processes like accessiBe&#8217;s (and others aimed at developers, like Evinced and AudioEye) can actually catch and fix every accessibility problem. There are many that slip past even the best analysis and others that resist automated fixes. (The company offers a <a href="https://ace.accessibe.com/">free assessment tool</a> in case you&#8217;re curious what it would and wouldn&#8217;t catch at your website.)</p>
<p>AccessiBe CEO Shir Ekerling said that this concern has been ameliorated by recent improvements to the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;AccessiBe scans and analyzes every website every day. We know, automatically, exactly what are the interactive elements of the site, where people click, put their mouse, or stay the longest,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Combining this with probability algorithms we run (matching every site element to every site element of over 100,000 websites including an insane amount of artificial data), we are able to know exactly what each and every element of the site is and adjust it so it is accessible adhering to WCAG 2.1 level AA.<span class="im">&#8221; (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">The WCAG guidelines can be perused here</a>.)<br />
</span></p>
<p>Likewise, regarding considerations that overlays can interfere with existing accessibility tools, for example if a user has a browser or add-on that automatically captions images or reads out text a certain way, Ekerling said accessiBe defers to user-side tools on these things. And it also works on mobile browsers, which many previous overlays didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the more philosophical question of whether, by having accessibility essentially something you can turn on and off, a site owner is maintaining a sort of &#8220;separate but equal access&#8221; to their content. That&#8217;s a big no-no in this field, like a restaurant having a separate dining room for people with wheelchairs rather than adding a ramp to the front door. Of course, since accessiBe doesn&#8217;t make a separate site or permanently modify the source code, it clearly isn&#8217;t that. But it&#8217;s equally clear that the base site isn&#8217;t built to be accessible — it just has a layer of accessibility spread over the top.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s position is that their overlay provides everything needed for ADA compliance and WCAG best practices, and as such constitutes a complete solution for making a website accessible. Others contend that this is not the case and at any rate that developers should not be incentivized to ignore accessibility while building because they think a third-party service can provide it with one line of code.</p>

<p>AccessiBe is also working on a user-side version that isn&#8217;t reliant on a website including the widget, something that could potentially be very helpful to a lot of people but does little to make the web more accessible in its fundamentals. That takes dedication by many independent actors and businesses. The recently hired Michael Hingson, &#8220;chief visionary officer,&#8221;<a href="https://accessibe.com/blog/news/michael-hingson-joins-accessibe"> acknowledges this</a>, while also asserting the usefulness of well-done overlays.</p>
<p>The company has raised $28 million in the last year, all from K1 Investment Management. K1 initially invested $12 million last may, but more than doubled that commitment after 2020 saw accessiBe triple their ARR. Much of the cash will be used for further R&amp;D and to consult and hire more people with disabilities for testing, feedback and development.</p>
<p>Every website should be accessible, that much everyone can agree on. But it&#8217;s a long, complicated and expensive road to get there. Tools like accessiBe may not be a permanent solution, but they can make a website more accessible tomorrow — and potentially less vulnerable to lawsuits alleging noncompliance with ADA rules — where deeper changes may take months or years to achieve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.levelgoals.com/">Level</a>, a Seattle-based startup that offers credit to gig-economy workers, announced that it has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed round. Level intends to provide various services to gig-economy workers, starting with a financing product.</p>
<p>The goal of Level today is to furnish access to credit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the advance; akin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/lighter-capital-secures-100m-to-grow-its-equity-free-financing-business/">revenue-based financing</a> for startups, workers can borrow a set amount, and pay back a portion of their future earnings until the debt is settled.</p>
<p>Level has larger plans, including offering other services like insurance products to gig workers in the future.</p>
<p>The startup is not big on the &#8220;gig economy&#8221; moniker, instead preferring to say that it&#8217;s helping the smallest companies grow atop various labor marketplaces, summarizing comments that Level CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidxedelstein/">David Edelstein</a> made to TechCrunch during an interview concerning the round.</p>
<p>His company has something of a point. Level is not offering advances to Uber drivers, but instead is plugged-in with freelance groups like <a href="https://dolly.com/">Dolly</a> (on-demand moving), <a href="https://porch.com/">Porch</a> (home improvement) and <a href="https://www.smarthop.co/">SmartHop</a> (on-demand trucking) &#8212; services whose users may depend on non-standard equipment, like trucks and tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NJkiQe7vCY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/">YC-backed Heru raises $1.7M to build software services for Latin American gig workers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Heru raises $1.7M to build software services for Latin American gig workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/embed/#?secret=NJkiQe7vCY" data-secret="NJkiQe7vCY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So if you are doing, say, moving jobs, and want to invest in a new truck, Level may be willing to front you a chunk of capital toward that buy. Edelstein told TechCrunch lots of folks manage to earn more after putting borrowed funds to work in their small business.</p>
<p>Users of Level&#8217;s service can access up to $10,000, though the CEO said that around $2,000 was the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for his company&#8217;s service, as that was an amount of money hard to put on consumer credit cards, but still meaningful to its customer base.</p>
<p>This brings us to repayment. As you&#8217;d expect, if a person did borrow money from Level and managed to generate more revenue afterwards, they might want to retire their debt more quickly than originally anticipated. What&#8217;s notable about the startup&#8217;s model is that if a user repays their advance in less than six weeks, Level will refund half the fee that was originally agreed upon.</p>
<p>Normally repayment of capital takes four months, with the percentage of earnings consumed running between 5% and 15%. So, why would Level be willing to drop half its fee for rapid repayment? Trust, its CEO said. As Level wants to offer more services in the future, it&#8217;s pushing down capital costs for users, hoping that they will help themselves to more services from the company later on.</p>
<p>To that end, Edelstein said, the company&#8217;s usual fee for capital has fallen from 10% to 7%, a rate that his company may push lower over time, perhaps to the break-even point or beyond. Credit, the CEO said, could become a funnel for his company&#8217;s broader product suite.</p>
<p>Certainly with its new capital, raised in late December of 2020 from co-lead investors <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView</a> and <a href="http://untapped.vc/">Untapped</a>, the Seattle-based Level has more time now to maneuver when it comes to product. And with insurance products coming in Q2 to some degree, and more broadly in Q3, we&#8217;re not far from seeing what&#8217;s next for the startup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techstars.com/">Techstars</a>, <a href="https://acumen.org/about/">Acumen</a> and <a href="https://www.ascend.vc/">Ascend.vc</a> also participated in the round. Per the startup, <a href="http://employmenttechnologyfund.com/about/">the Employment Technology Fund</a> is &#8220;supporting&#8221; the startup&#8217;s credit facility. (Credit facilities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">can get quite large</a>, business depending. If Level scales as it hopes to, expect it to announce more on this front in time.)</p>
<p>Level is a bit like an American <a href="https://somosheru.com/#/home">Heru</a> in that, akin to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/yc-backed-heru-raises-1-7m-to-build-software-services-for-latin-american-gig-workers/">its Latin American fellow-traveler</a>, it wants to offer more and better services, including insurance, to those active at work but not in traditional, full-time roles. If they succeed, expect similar companies to crop up around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>After publication I corresponded with the company about my use of the phrase &#8220;loan,&#8221; versus their preferred &#8220;advance.&#8221; Its argument that it is &#8220;purchasing future receivables&#8221; instead of offering a loan felt like a sufficient difference for me to update the post. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://solofunds.com/">SoLo Funds</a> wants to replace payday lenders with a community-based, market-driven model for individual lending, and now has $10 million to expand its business in the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Payday lenders offer high-interest, short-term loans to borrowers who are at their most vulnerable, and the terms of their loans often trap borrowers in a cycle of debt from which there&#8217;s no escape.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Around 80% of Americans don&#8217;t have adequate savings to cover unforeseen expenses, and it&#8217;s that statistic that has made payday lending a lucrative business in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past decade websites like GoFundMe and others have cropped up to offer a space where people can donate money to individuals or causes that in some cases serve to supplement the incomes of people most in need. SoLo Funds operates as an alternative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s a marketplace where borrowers can set the terms of their loan repayment and lenders can earn extra income while supporting folks who need the help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is financing tens of thousands of loans per month, according to chief executive officer and co-founder Travis Holoway, and loan volumes are growing at about 40% monthly, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Holoway would not disclose the book value of the loans transacted on the platform, he did say the company&#8217;s default and delinquency rates were lower than that of its competitors. &#8220;Our default rate is about three times better than the industry average &#8212; which is the payday lending industry that we&#8217;re looking to disrupt,&#8221; Holoway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also offers a sort of default insurance product that lenders can purchase to backstop any losses they experience, Holoway said. That service, rolled out in April of last year, helped account for some of the explosive 2,000% growth that the company saw over the course of 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SoLo has seen the most activity in Texas, Illinois, California and New York, states with large populations and cities with the highest cost of living.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our borrowers are school teachers&#8230; are social workers. When you live in those larger cities with higher costs of living they can&#8217;t afford the financial shocks that they could if they lived in Dayton, Ohio,&#8221; said Holoway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the company&#8217;s borrowers represent one cross section of America, the lenders tend to also not be hailing from the demographic that a casual observer might expect, Holoway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">About half of loans on the platform are made by folks that Holoway called power lenders, while the rest are coming from less frequent users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;A majority of [power lenders] are college educated and the majority of them tend to be white men. It&#8217;s individuals who you might not think are going to be power lenders&#8230; They may make $100,000 to $125,000 per year,&#8221; said Holoway. &#8220;They&#8217;re looking to diversify their capital and deploy it to make returns. And they&#8217;re able to help individuals out who otherwise would not be able to pay for groceries, paying rent or taking care of their transportation expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the company&#8217;s growth, it&#8217;s no wonder investors like <a href="https://www.acme.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.acme.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcamJ4xVbIQd-3uPpJQMEfg7B42A">ACME Capital</a>, with support from <a href="https://www.impactamericafund.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.impactamericafund.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiSnrCy6An5yt3WicP8TgT8m9iTA">Impact America Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.techstars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.techstars.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZkfNviqBdwMYiGzWvXNR_Pm-N6A">Techstars</a>, <a href="https://endeavor.org/approach/catalyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://endeavor.org/approach/catalyst/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxADpl_6Y3bB-r3y3oy95aCxQyaw">Endeavor Catalyst</a>, <a href="https://www.ceasinvestments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ceasinvestments.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf6DP7yyFKufHZU21xJL-1e5KWOA">CEAS Investments</a> and more joined the new round. previous investors like <a href="https://west.ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://west.ventures/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHvoevOwz4OM7xmTXWBNr3P5V_G7Q">West Ventures</a>, Taavet Hinrikus of <a href="https://transferwise.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transferwise.com/us&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBji1pj5z47mHm3W_9kElseQyQEg">TransferWise</a>, Jewel Burks Solomon of <a href="https://startup.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://startup.google.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXpcuRtnxufFS7HRLQr503I2yTQQ">Google Startups</a>, Zachary Bookman of <a href="https://opengov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opengov.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612996678045000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEWuDRLCxJZG2QnBQe6DYwxlC39Ag">OpenGov,</a> Richelieu Dennis of Essence Ventures and tech innovation accelerators also participated in financing the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For too long, there have been limited options for individuals in need of immediate <span class="il">funds</span> due to unforeseen circumstances, like a shift in hourly schedules, unplanned car troubles or other cases,” said Holoway. “<span class="il">SoLo</span> was created to offer safe, affordable options for borrowers that need cash quickly, while also creating a marketplace for lenders to grow capital and help community members in need. We believe that at the end of the day, people are innately honest and tend towards generosity, and our platform’s growth is further proof that people want to do good in the world and make an impact.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SLAs, SLOs, SLIs. If there&#8217;s one thing everybody in the business of managing software development loves, it&#8217;s acronyms. And while everyone probably knows what a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is, Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) may not be quite as well known. The idea, though, is <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli">straightforward</a>, with SLOs being the overall goals a team must hit to meet the promises of its SLA agreements, and SLIs being the actual measurements that back up those other two numbers. With the advent of DevOps, these ideas, which are typically part of a company&#8217;s overall Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) efforts, are becoming more mainstream, but putting them into practice isn&#8217;t always straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="https://nobl9.com/">Nobl9</a> aims to provide enterprises with the tools they need to build SLO-centric operations and the right feedback loops inside an organization to help it hit its SLOs without making too many trade-offs between the cost of engineering, feature development and reliability.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $21 million Series B round led by its Series A investors <a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.battery.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612979686769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYcCpuI14cL90BznsareP3AwF8lQ">Battery Ventures</a> and <a href="https://crv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://crv.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1612979686769000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHgKq6-ljMcFXvbPqOzFYfbZTQo1A">CRV</a>. In addition, Series A investors Bonfire Ventures and Resolute Ventures also participated, together with new investors Harmony Partners and Sorenson Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before starting Nobl9, co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkurc/">Marcin Kurc</a> (CEO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briantsinger/">Brian Singer</a> (CPO) spent time together at Orbitera, where Singer was the co-founder and COO and Kurc the CEO, and then at Google Cloud, after it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/google-buys-orbitera-a-platform-for-building-marketplaces-cloud-software/">Orbitera in 2016</a>. In the process, the team got to work with and appreciate Google&#8217;s site reliability engineering frameworks.</p>
<p>As they started looking into what to do next, that experience led them to look into productizing these ideas. &#8220;We came to this conclusion that if you&#8217;re going into Kubernetes, into service-based applications and modern architectures, there&#8217;s really no better way to run that than SRE,&#8221; Kurc told me. &#8220;And when we started looking at this, naturally SRE is a complete framework, there are processes. We started looking at elements of SRE and we agreed that SLO &#8212; service level objectives &#8212; is really the foundational part. You can&#8217;t do SRE without SLOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Singer noted, in order to adopt SLOs, businesses have to know how to turn the data they have about the reliability of their services, which could be measured in uptime or latency, for example, into the right objectives. That&#8217;s complicated by the fact that this data could live in a variety of databases and logs, but the real question is how to define the right SLOs for any given organization based on this data.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you go into the conversation with an organization about what their goals are with respect to reliability and how they start to think about understanding if there&#8217;s risks to that, they very quickly get bogged down in how are we going to get this data or that data and instrument this or instrument that,&#8221; Singer said. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a platform that essentially takes that as the problem that we&#8217;re solving. So no matter where the data lives and in what format it lives, we want to be able to reduce it to very simply an error budget and an objective that can be tracked and measured and reported on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform launched into general availability last week, after a beta that started last year. Early customers include Brex and Adobe.</p>
<p>As Kurc told me, the team actually thinks of this new funding round as a Series A round, but because its $7.5 million Series A was pretty sizable, they decided to call it a Series A instead of a seed round. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to define it. If you define it based on a revenue milestone, we&#8217;re pre-revenue, we just launched the GA product,&#8221; Singer told me. &#8220;But I think just in terms of the maturity of the product and the company, I would put us at the [Series] B.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team told me that it closed the round at the end of last November, and while it considered pitching new VCs, its existing investors were already interested in putting more money into the company and since its previous round had been oversubscribed, they decided to add to this new round some of the investors that didn&#8217;t make the cut for the Series A.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to advance its roadmap and expand its team, especially across sales, marketing and customer success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of optimizing its products for engagement, no matter the costs, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">announced</a> today it will &#8220;test&#8221; changes to its News Feed focused on reducing the distribution of political content. The company qualified that these tests will be temporary, impact a small percentage of people and will only run in select markets, including the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The point of the experiments, Facebook says, is to explore a variety of ways it can rank political content in the News Feed using different signals, in order to decide on what approach it may take in the future.</p>
<p>It also notes that COVID-19 information from authoritative health organizations like the CDC and WHO, as well as national and regional health agencies and services, will be exempt from being downranked in the News Feed during these tests. Similarly, content from official government agencies will not be impacted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The tests may also include a survey component, where Facebook asks impacted users about their experience.</p>

<p>Facebook&#8217;s announcement of the tests is meant to sound underwhelming because any large-scale changes would be an admission of guilt, of sorts. Facebook has the capacity to make far greater changes &#8212; when it wanted to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/28/how-publishers-will-survive-facebooks-newsfeed-change/">downrank publisher content</a>, it did so, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43225987">decimating</a> a number of media businesses along the way. In previous years, it also took harder action against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/facebook-fights-foot-fungus-ads/">low-quality sites</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/facebook-demotes-scrapers/">scrapers</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/facebook-anti-clickbait/">clickbait</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/30/facebook-spammers/">spam</a> and more.</p>
<p>The news of Facebook&#8217;s tests comes at a time when people are questioning social media&#8217;s influence and direction. A growing number of social media users now believe tech platforms have been playing a role in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/isolation-and-social-media-combine-to-radicalize-violent-offenders-11565041473">radicalizing</a> <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/social-media-has-been-radicalizing-people-for-years/">people</a>, as their algorithms promote unbalanced views of the world, isolate people into social media bubbles and allow dangerous speech and misinformation to go viral.</p>
<p>In a poll this week, <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-radicalizes-people-poll-02fcaaf0-28ee-4242-bd5b-d6a591203e21.html">reported by Axios</a>, a majority of Americans said they now believe social media radicalizes, with 74% also saying misinformation is an an extremely or very serious problem. Another 76% believe social media was at least partially responsible for the Capitol riot, which 7 in 10 think is the result of unchecked extreme behavior online, the report noted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a third of Americans<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/study-finds-around-one-third-of-americans-regularly-get-their-news-from-facebook/"> regularly get their news from Facebook</a>, according to a study from Pew Research Center, which means they&#8217;re often now reading more extreme viewpoints from fringe publishers,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/"> a related Pew study had found</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Study: US adults who mostly rely on social media for news are less informed, exposed to more conspiracies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/study-u-s-adults-who-mostly-rely-on-social-media-for-news-are-less-informed-exposed-to-more-conspiracies/embed/#?secret=giJMnWW8SI" data-secret="giJMnWW8SI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, Facebook has been accused of exacerbating political unrest, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/indonesia-restricts-whatsapp-and-instagram/">deadly riots in Indonesia</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html">genocide</a> in Myanmar, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-brazil/facebook-puts-global-block-on-brazils-bolsonaro-supporters-idUKKBN24X3XO?edition-redirect=uk">spread of misinformation</a> in Brazil during elections and more.</p>
<p>Facebook, however, today argues that political content is a small amount of the News Feed (e.g. 6% of what people in the U.S. see) &#8212; an attempt to deflect any blame for the state of the world, while positioning the downranking change as just something user feedback demands that Facebook explore.</p>
