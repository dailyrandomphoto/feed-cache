										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Innovaccer has raised a new financing round and more than doubled its valuation to $3.2 billion from $1.3 billion in February this year as a growing number of healthcare organizations move to use the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/innovaccer-wants-to-be-the-service-that-unifies-all-healthcare-data/">San Francisco-headquartered firm&#8217;s platform</a> to put their troves of data to better use.</p>
<p>Mubadala Capital led the $150 million Series E round, pushing the startup’s all-time raise to over $375 million. Whalerock Capital, Avidity Partners, and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors as well as existing investors including Tiger Global, B Capital Group, Microsoft’s M12 fund, and Steadview Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, most industries have adopted technology to bring efficiencies to their businesses and accelerate their growth. Healthcare industry, in comparison, has been the last frontier to adopt technology in many ways, said Abhinav Shashank, co-founder and chief executive of Innovaccer, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We haven’t been able to drive that kind of transformation. Moreover, most systems that have been built for this space are non-cloud,” he said, adding that this has resulted in troves of data sitting in siloed systems.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://innovaccer.com">Innovaccer</a> comes into the play.</p>
<p>The startup, which began its journey in India, has developed a cloud software layer that works on top of the existing systems employed by healthcare facilities and enables patients’ data to be fetched and perform analysis on.</p>
<p>Healthcare facilities “don’t need to replace their existing systems. Our cloud layer connects with a number of their existing electronic health record systems,” said Shashank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Getting better access enables patients to supply and make use of even more data &#8212; such as insurance or medical data generated by fitness trackers &#8212; they have on themselves. “This creates a 360-degree view of the patient.” Moreover, this allows doctors to get deeper and real-time visibility into the patient’s health status.</p>
<p>The business-to-business focused startup has amassed over 50 customers including Banner Health, Roche, and MercyOn in the U.S. and some in Europe. Some of its recently signed customers include One Medical, Roche, CommonSpirit, Franciscan Health, Dayton Children’s Health Partners, St. Luke’s Health System, Sentara, Adventist Health, Premier Health, Children’s Health Alliance, Premier Health, Atlantic Health System, Providence St. Joseph, Cityblock, Florence Health, and Zus Health.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247870" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247870" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2247870 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Innovaccer-co-founders.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247870" class="wp-caption-text">Innovaccer founders Kanav Hasija (left), Abhinav Shashank, and Sandeep Gupta.

<p>As things stand today, when a hospital or any other health facility works with Innovaccer, its patients’ data remains with that facility. Other healthcare providers don’t get access to that data. This is one of the challenges that many entrepreneurs are hoping to solve.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, for instance, is hoping that his blockchain network will become a universal standard to a point that any patient anywhere in the world will be able to quickly grant permission to a doctor to view his or her records in an event of an emergency. But we are not there yet. Shashank suggested that in the coming years, as healthcare providers begin to open up, they may agree to a universal protocol and such an interoperable system would then work.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why he is optimistic is the growing interest of big tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple in the healthtech space. “They want us to succeed and we are building systems that run on top of their clouds. So there&#8217;s massive synergies in how we are all approaching the market,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which signed its first customer in 2016, has grown rapidly in recent years, he said. “Our focus has been the U.S. market. At some point, we will expand internationally as well. But given the size of the problem we have on our hands in the U.S. itself, we will remain largely focused here for the near term.”</p>
<p>The growth of Innovaccer is one of the biggest Indian SaaS success stories. Shashank, pointing to the success of many SaaS startups that began their journey in India, Australia or Southeast Asia, said for SaaS entrepreneurs, the “world has never been flatter as the delivery model is on the cloud. I don’t think it has ever been easier for entrepreneurs to build a global software company of significant size and scale,” he said.</p>
<p>Innovaccer will deploy the fresh funds to supercharge its research and development work and also hire more talent across product, engineering and customer experience roles.</p>
<p>“We have been investors in Innovaccer since 2019, and believe that the company has all the necessary pillars to define the new gold standard of how the Health Cloud should be implemented by providers, payers, and life science companies,” said Alaa Halawa, Partner and Head of the US Ventures business at Mubadala Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of tech companies have tried to create a common data framework to connect the healthcare industry, but they all fell short due to extreme industry complexities or technology challenges. But in five short years, Innovaccer has built the most successful data activation platform in the healthcare industry as proven by record rates of industry adoption. Innovaccer is likely the first and only company since the invention of the electronic health record (EHR) that has the opportunity to unify the healthcare ecosystem.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Israeli SaaS security startup Atmosec raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm Glilot Capital Partners and American fund Battery Ventures.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli SaaS security startup <a href="https://www.atmosec.com/">Atmosec</a> today announced having raised a $6 million seed round led by Israeli VC firm <a href="https://glilotcapital.com/">Glilot Capital Partners</a> and American fund <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>. Its team had previously participated in <a href="https://nocamels.com/2021/04/intel-ignite-4th-cohort-10-israeli-startups/">Intel Ignite&#8217;s fourth Tel Aviv startup acceleration cohort</a>.</p>
<p>Now out of stealth mode, Atmosec wants to make it more secure for companies to use a flurry of cloud SaaS solutions, from Slack to ServiceNow. Its solution focuses on anomaly detection based on automatic monitoring to notify clients of potential issues and prevent attacks.</p>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1233538/average-number-saas-apps-yearly/">data from Statista</a>, Atmosec points out that the number of SaaS apps used by organizations is on the rise, with an average of 110 in 2021. This makes sense, but also poses security challenges, as many of them &#8220;have inadequate systems to manage third-party risk,&#8221; said Adi Dangot Zukovsky, of Battery Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is where Atmosec comes in, Dangot Zukovsky explained, &#8220;with new technology that provides cloud-native enterprises with greater visibility into their existing systems and helps them lower the risk of outsiders exploiting their third-party business applications and app-to-app connectivity paths.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Atmosec&#8217;s seed round counted with participation from other Israeli entrepreneurs in the security space, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/wiz-unveils-new-security-tool-to-protect-code-in-development-pipeline/">Wiz</a>&#8216;s CEO Assaf Rappaport, Talon Cyber&#8217;s CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, and Armis&#8217; co-founders Yevgeny Dibrov and Nadir Izrael. Co-founders Aner Gelman, Misha Seltzer, and Shaked Gitelman are themselves former executives at Armis, which recently raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/29/armis-expands-past-iot-with-300m-for-comprehensive-asset-security/">$300 million to expand beyond IoT</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s additional connection between the two startups, Gelman said: &#8220;We’re leveraging some of the technologies and concepts that we helped build out at Armis, and without giving away too many trade secrets, we&#8217;re utilizing continuous machine learning with baseline analysis that identifies anomalies in connections based on actual and potential behavior, not just configurations.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Gelman and his two co-founders all being army intelligence veterans, it is not too surprising that there&#8217;s a bit of secrecy involved. The TL;DR is that understanding the behavior helps Atmosec detect anomalies its clients need to address. But now that the company is out of stealth, it is likely that it will start sharing a bit more with its potential users on how it differentiates from competitors.</p>
<p>Having recently learned that fellow Israeli SaaS security startups Grip Security and Adaptive Shield had respectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/grip-security-raises-25m-series-a-for-its-saas-security-platform/">$19 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/adaptive-shield-lands-30m-series-a-to-build-out-its-saas-security-platform/">$30 million</a> Series A rounds, this is definitely a hot space we are keen to learn more about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying bills is hardly a fun thing. So I think it’s safe to say that any technology that can make the process easier is welcome by all.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://papayapay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Los Angeles-based startup with a mission to do just that. It has developed technology to give people a way to pay bills outside of traditional methods, such as through the mail, over the phone or via a Web portal. The company’s mobile application lets users take a photo of any bill and then its artificial intelligence-powered “bill-understanding technology” makes sure it gets paid (after a user has provided payment details, of course).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prove the point, CEO and co-founder Patrick Kann demonstrated for me via Zoom how even after tearing up a bill into a few pieces, Papaya’s app was able to scan the pertinent parts of the invoice to make sure it was paid.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as a biller has an electronic payment method, anyone can submit payments through our app,” Kann said. “It’s a true universal payment method.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann was inspired to start Papaya after growing up in Brazil, where a similar payment technology already exists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People back home were surprised to find out we didn’t have the same capabilities here,” Kann said. “In this respect, the U.S. has been an anomaly, with only 3% of bills being paid by a mobile device. We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw a huge business opportunity with mobile bill payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann teamed up with computer vision scientist Jason Meltzer, who led development for the computer vision technology behind the Roomba at iRobot, to build Papaya.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the company is simple: minimize Americans’ bill pay stress by making it easy to pay any bill with their mobile device. It also claims to help businesses of all sizes in all industries as well as governments and municipalities get paid faster and more often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Papaya is announcing it has raised $50 million in a Series B round of funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Acrew Capital, 01 Advisors, Mucker Capital, Fika Ventures, F-Prime and Sound Ventures. The financing brings the previously under-the-radar company’s total raised to $65 million since its 2016 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya currently facilitates payments for “hundreds of thousands” of businesses and organizations and millions of users in the U.S. Beyond the mobile app, the company integrates with partners’ billing processes through embedded widget technologies and paper statements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hoping to build on its existing technology with an extensive product roadmap.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247672" style="width: 233px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247672" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2247672 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?w=139" alt="" width="223" height="481" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ios-onboarding.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247672" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Papaya</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papaya has already come a long way. In its early days, Kann promoted the app by putting stickers with Papaya&#8217;s QR code on people&#8217;s windshields after they got a parking ticket in Las Vegas. Over time, the city added it to their paper notices. Then, the company began working with doctor&#8217;s offices to offer the option to their patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kann prides himself on an 80-person staff that is made up 60% of underrepresented minorities, and a product engineering team that is 45% female. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, its growth has been “completely organic,” with no marketing team, according to the CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our cost of customer acquisition is very low relative to a lot of fintechs,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, part of its capital will go toward building awareness and growing its headcount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Kann declined to reveal revenue specifics, he did say Papaya “is on track to acquiring 1 million new active users per year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of revenue, the company’s model is interesting. The app is free for users, and Papaya doesn’t ask for anything “extra” from merchants. Rather, it earns a percentage of revenue from interchange fees that merchants have to pay when they process credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bessemer Venture Partners’ Charles Birnbaum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says his firm has been following the Papaya team since it first used its “magical” bill pay app for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s incredibly rare to come across a business that is not only positively impacting millions of consumers by making something painful more seamless but also solving a critical pain point for businesses within several different verticals spanning from healthcare to utilities,” he said. “We have no doubt that the Papaya bill pay experience will become table stakes throughout the consumer financial services landscape in the years to come.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grindr, a hook-up app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, has been fined around $7.1 million (65M NOK) by Norway&#8217;s data protection authority for passing user data to advertisers without consent &#8212; including highly sensitive information related to users&#8217; sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/regulations-and-tools/regulations/avgjorelser-fra-datatilsynet/2021/gebyr-til-grindr/">DPA found</a> that Grindr breached Articles 6(1) and 9(1) of Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>The complaint adds to the behavioral advertising industry&#8217;s legal woes &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">continue to pile up in the region</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The final size of the penalty Grindr has been hit with is a little reduced vs the 100M NOK/$12.1M that the gay dating app was facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/grindr-on-the-hook-for-e10m-over-gdpr-consent-violations/">back in January</a> &#8212; when the Datatilsynet issued a preliminary decision on the case.</p>
<p>The authority told TechCrunch the smaller sanction takes account of the company having lower turnover in reality than the &#8220;rough estimate&#8221; it had relied upon in January when issuing the preliminary fine,</p>
<p>It also said the reduction takes account of measures Grindr implemented since the complaint was filed with the aim of bringing its processing of personal data in line with GDPR&#8217;s requirements.</p>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s decision notes that the final fine is approximately 32% of the maximum amount possible. And since GDPR allows for fines of up to €20M or up to 4% of an entity&#8217;s total global turnover in the preceding year, whichever is higher, it suggests the US-based app&#8217;s annual revenue does not exceed €20M/$22.5M.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The DPA describes the size of the fine as &#8220;proportionate both to the severity of the infringement and to Grindr’s financial situation&#8221;, asserting that it &#8220;does not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the GDPR in the present case&#8221;.</p>
<p>The complaint has taken almost a year to arrive at a final decision owing &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to Grindr requesting extensions to deadlines on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this investigation was limited to the process Grindr used to obtain consent at the time of the complaint &#8212; in 2019 and up to April 2020 (when it switched to a different method).</p>
<p>So the lawfulness of Grindr&#8217;s current method for obtaining consent has not been investigated.</p>
<p>While the decision does not include any requirements that Grindr (or its ad partners) delete unlawfully obtained user data the DPA told us that that could change in future.</p>
<p>It also confirmed that its investigation against Grindr&#8217;s ad partners (who it sent user data to) is ongoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span lang="EN-US">Our decision does not include any erasure requirements at this time but we have also made it clear that further decisions may come at a later date if we deem it necessary,&#8221; said Tobias Judin, director for international issues at Datatilsynet. &#8220;In other words: We are not ruling out any possibilities for further enforcement at this stage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Now that we have a final decision in the Grindr case, this decision will also inform those investigations,&#8221; he further confirmed of the ad partner probes. </span></p>
<p>The penalty for Grindr tracking users without consent comes at a time when some<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/"> EU lawmakers continue pressing for a ban on surveillance-based advertising</a> &#8212; although a committee vote in the European Parliament this week did not back amending the Digital Services Act to include an outright ban on surveillance-based advertising, as some MEPs have been pressing for.</p>
<p>The committee did back a prohibition on dark patterns to manipulate consent, though. So legal requirements look set to continue to tighten around how adtech can operate in the EU &#8212; and reform of manipulative defaults is being enforced.</p>
<p>See also: The UK&#8217;s data watchdog&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/ico-adtech-reform-opinion/">warned to the industry that the end of tracking is nigh</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement welcoming Norway&#8217;s GDPR slap-down of Grindr, the deputy DG of the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC, Ursula Pachl, said: “Grindr illegally exploited and shared its users’ information for targeted advertising, including sensitive information about their sexual orientation. It is high time the behavioural advertising industry stops tracking and profiling consumers 24/7. It is a business model which clearly breaches the EU’s data protection rules and harms consumers. Let’s now hope this is the first domino to fall and that authorities start imposing fines on other companies as the infringements identified in this decision are standard surveillance ad-tech industry practices.”</p>

<h2>Consent breaches</h2>
<p>Datatilsynet opened the investigation into Grindr after receiving complaints from Norway&#8217;s Consumer Council (NCC) and the European privacy campaign group, noyb, acting on behalf an individual complainant.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/dating-and-fertility-apps-among-those-snitching-to-out-of-control-adtech-report-finds/">Last year</a> the NCC published an analysis of data flows from a number of popular apps (including Grindr but also a number of others) showing how they share data with &#8220;unexpected third parties&#8221;, including entities in the behavioral ad industry to highlight the extent of adtech&#8217;s lawfulness problem.</p>
<p>In its response to the data protection watchdog&#8217;s investigation, Grindr had claimed it had users&#8217; consent to share their data with its advertising partners &#8212; which included Twitter-owned MoPub, Xandr (previously AppNexus), OpenX, AdColony and Smaato.</p>
<p>However the app did not offer users a free choice over whether to agree to its terms or not. If a Grindr user declined to accept its privacy policy during onboarding they were unable to proceed to use the app.</p>
<p>And while Grindr went on to change how it gathers consent &#8212; implementing a consent management platform provided by the third party OneTrust in April 2020 &#8212; as noted above this complaint focuses on how the app was obtaining consent prior to that switch.</p>
<p>The GDPR states that for consent to be a valid legal basis to process personal data it must be informed, specific and <em>freely given </em>(emphasis ours). So the lack of a choice offered to users looks like a very flagrant breach of the rules.</p>
<p>In seeking to avoid a sanction, Grindr also sought to argue that it did not pass information on individual users&#8217; sexuality to advertisers &#8212; claiming it only sent generic keywords (such as &#8220;gay&#8221;, &#8220;bi&#8221; and &#8220;bi-curious&#8221;).</p>
<p>This is important because GDPR has specific rules for so-called &#8220;special category data&#8221; &#8212; requiring an even higher bar of explicit consent from a user if that&#8217;s the legal basis you&#8217;re claiming for processing information such as a person&#8217;s sexual orientation.</p>
<p>In reaching its final decision on the complaint, the Datatilsynet concluded that protections contained in Article 9 of the GDPR (which concerns &#8220;special category data&#8221;) should not be so narrowly interpreted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a Grindr user strongly indicates, and appears in most cases to accurately reflect, that the data subject belongs to a sexual minority. Furthermore, the fact that a data subject belongs to a sexual minority may lead to prejudice and discrimination even without revealing their specific sexual orientation,&#8221; it writes, adding: &#8220;The wording of Article 9 does not require a revealing of a particular &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217;, and the purpose behind Article 9 discourages a narrow interpretation.</p>
<p>&#8220;For these reasons, we find that information that a data subject is a Grindr user is data &#8216;concerning&#8217; the data subject’s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grindr had also sought to suggest that advertisers were unlikely to use categories of special category data for profiling and ad targeting &#8212; telling the DPA it would be surprised if that were the case.</p>
<p>Which is &#8212; to put it mildly &#8212; a surprising argument to try to make, given ample evidence from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">other GDPR complaints of the highly invasive profiling being carried out by the behavioral ad industry</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that a flagship industry framework that&#8217;s widely used to claim consent to process people&#8217;s data for ad targeting is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">facing a GDPR breach finding itself</a>. As is the online advertising body that controls it.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Qk2SsAIQ1y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=Qk2SsAIQ1y" data-secret="Qk2SsAIQ1y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In any case, Datatilsynet rejected Grindr&#8217;s dodge &#8212; pointing out that it&#8217;s irrelevant how such sensitive data might be further processed, since &#8212; under GDPR &#8212; &#8220;the sharing of personal data concerning a natural person’s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217; to advertising partners is sufficient to trigger Article 9&#8221;. (Its decision also makes it explicit that it does &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">not agree with the claim that a data subject&#8217;s &#8216;sexual orientation&#8217; is not a category of data that could potentially be used by advertisers to target ads&#8221;.)</span></p>
<p>In another attempt to wiggle out of a GDPR slap-down, Grindr had also sought to argue that even if its advertisers &#8212; theoretically &#8212; received any sensitive personal data they must &#8220;blind&#8221; themselves to, per commitments in its contracts with advertisers.</p>
<p>Moreover it claimed many adtech companies operating in the EU have spent the last decade or so devising so-called &#8220;blinding methods&#8221; which it said obfuscate which app an ad call is coming from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grindr holds that participants in the ad tech ecosystem would likely only receive a &#8216;blinded&#8217; app-ID and not the corresponding app name,&#8221; the DPA explains in the decision. &#8220;According to Grindr, it is a common practice in the EU for ad networks to nullify the app name and use a random App ID in the ad call so that downstream bidders are &#8216;blind&#8217; to the actual name of the app where the ad is to be served.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, once again, the DPA points out this is irrelevant &#8212; given sensitive data being passed is enough to trigger Article 9 provisions.</p>
<p>The Datatilsynet&#8217;s decision also cites a technical report, by Mnemonic, which showed Grindr&#8217;s app name being shared with MoPub &#8212; &#8220;who further shared this within their mediation network&#8221;. And further notes that Mnemonic&#8217;s report also showed the app name was shared from Grindr to &#8220;multiple other advertising partners&#8221;.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, Datatilsynet further points out that Grindr&#8217;s own privacy policy &#8220;explicitly states that &#8216;[o]ur advertising partners are aware that such data is being transmitted from Grindr&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, er,&#8230;. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f974.png" alt="🥴" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(NB: In a further demolition of the self-serving notion of &#8216;blinded&#8217; app-IDs, the DPA goes on to make the point that even if this were happening as claimed by the adtech industry it still wouldn&#8217;t comply with other requirements in the GDPR, noting: &#8220;Even if some advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem would &#8216;blind&#8217; themselves or only receive an obfuscated app ID, this is not line with the principle of accountability in Article 5(2) GDPR. Grindr would have to rely on the action of advertising partners or other participants in the ad tech ecosystem to halt its sharing of the data in question.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The DPA&#8217;s analysis goes further in unpicking adtech&#8217;s obfuscating claims vs what&#8217;s really being done with people&#8217;s data vs what EU law <em>actually</em> requires. (So it&#8217;s well worth <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-12/Administrative%20fine%20-%20Grindr%20LLC_Public%20version.pdf">reading in full if you&#8217;re interested in devilish detail</a>.)</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that Datatilsynet found Grindr <em>did</em> process users&#8217; sexual orientation data, as set out in <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Article 9(1) &#8212; by &#8220;sharing personal data on a specific user alongside app name or app ID to advertising partners&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>And while the GDPR can allow for consent-based processing of special category data a higher bar of &#8220;explicit&#8221; consent is required for that type of processing to be lawful, again, the DPA found that Grindr had not obtained the required legal standard of permission from users.</p>
<p>Its decision further concludes that Grindr users had not &#8220;manifestly made public&#8221; information about their sexual orientation simply by merit of using the app, as the app had sought to argue (noting, for example, that it allows for an anonymous approach, letting users select a nickname and choose whether or not to upload a selfie).</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, it goes beyond the reasonable expectations of the data subject that Grindr would disclose information concerning their sexual orientation to advertising partners. Though information about someone merely being a Grindr user must be considered a special category of personal data under Article 9(1), becoming a Grindr user is not an affirmative act by the data subject to make the information public,&#8221; Datatilsynet adds.</p>
<p>Grindr has been contacted for comment on the sanction.</p>
<p>It has three weeks to lodge an appeal against the decision &#8212; if it wishes to do so.</p>
<p>Datatilsynet&#8217;s order is careful to specify that there may be additional issues related to Grindr&#8217;s prior or current consent mechanism since this investigation was limited to the scope of the complaints which were focused on the lawfulness of its previous consent management platform in the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that potential issues have fallen outside the scope of our investigation does not preclude those issues from being investigated in the future,&#8221; its decision notes.</p>
<p>In a statement commenting on the decision, Ala Krinickytė, a data protection lawyer at noyb, described it as &#8220;astonishing that the DPA has to convince Grindr that its users are LGBT+ and that this fact is not a commodity to be bartered&#8221;.</p>
<p>Krinickytė further summarized the Datatilsynet order thusly: &#8220;You cannot share personal data with a potentially unlimited number of partners without being able to control what happens to that data.”</p>
<p>And that is really the crux of the problem for surveillance-based advertising which relies upon pervasive tracking of Internet users to individually target marketing.</p>
<p>Even setting aside the existential problem of a lack of consent for tracking, the adtech industry does not have processes in place to control what happens to data once it&#8217;s grabbed and &#8216;shared&#8217; with scores of faceless adtech entities involved in the high velocity programmatic auction process known as real-time bidding (RTB).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">GPDR complaints targeting RTB&#8217;s failure</a> to adequately protect people&#8217;s data have been sitting, unenforced, on EU regulators&#8217; desks for years &#8212; but there are signs that the enforcement blockage is starting to shift, not least as a result of smart, smaller-scale actions such as Norway going after Grindr.</p>
<p>The web of adtech data flows is such a tangled one that even a relative bit player can draw in and implicate scores of others.</p>
<p>The adtech industry&#8217;s workaround for people&#8217;s general distaste at being stalked and creeped on through their devices and digital activity, meanwhile, has been to not <em>actually</em> ask for permission to track and profile them in the first place.</p>
<p>But &#8212; in Europe at least &#8212; that mocking &#8216;consent&#8217; pantomime is finally headed for its end-game.</p>
<p>Whether the alternative targeting processes the industry devises will be just as cynical, manipulative and exploitative as what they&#8217;ve been doing for the past decade+ will largely depend upon regulators and lawmakers driving proper oversight of a sector that&#8217;s been allowed to flourish in the dark, rife with dark patterns and defined by its dark arts.</p>
<p>One negative signal is how the <a href="https://twitter.com/IABEurope/status/1470756093454430216">IAB Europe</a> continues to try to confuse the issue by conflating ad targeting with invasive tracking &#8212; in a bid to lobby MEPs not to outlaw surveillance-based adtech.</p>
<p>In reality, privacy-safe <em>targeting</em> alternatives already exist (such as contextual ads) and have been profitable for years for companies like DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>The behavioral advertising industry&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">lawfulness problem</a> is in fact directly chainlinked to its mass surveillance of Internet users.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Datatilsynet&#8217;s decision against Grindr in a statement, Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy in the NCC, warned: “This sends a strong signal to all companies involved in commercial surveillance. There are serious repercussions to sharing personal data without a legal basis. We call for the digital advertising industry to make fundamental changes to respect consumers’ rights.”</p>
<p><em>NB: While Norway is not an EU Member it is part of the European Economic Area and it transposed the GDPR into national law in 2018. Additionally, Grindr being a US company without a defined legal entity in the EU opens its business to regulatory oversight by DPAs in any part of the bloc which have concerns (and where it offers a service), rather than oversight being funnelled via gatekeepers like Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, as has happened with complaints against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">Google&#8217;s adtech</a> for example</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of creating a marketplace for underutilized assets that can turn into a meaningful business for hosts is not a new one. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there is no higher profile of how successful that model can be than Airbnb. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that one of Airbnb’s most prominent investors, GGV Capital, is now backing another startup with a similar model. But rather than putting properties on a marketplace, <a href="http://swimply.com">Swimply</a> came up with the idea of pairing homeowners with pools with people who want private access to them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so far, business is going swimmingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep things flowing (couldn’t resist), the startup has just raised $40 million in a funding round led by Mayfield – just seven months after announcing a $10 million financing. Besides Mayfield and GGV, other backers include Colin Shang at Ensemble Ventures and a high-profile list of validating angel investors including Airbnb co-founder Nate Blecharczyk; Casey Winters, formely of Pinterest and Grubhub; Lime co-founder Brad Bao; Rob Chestnut, former chief ethics officer at Airbnb and eBay; Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Shef&#8217;s Alvin Salehi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way it works is pretty straightforward. Swimply connects homeowners that have underutilized backyard spaces and pools with people seeking a way to gather, cool off or exercise, for example. People or families can rent pools by the hour at an average price of $45 of $65 per hour depending on the amenities. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, co-founder Bunim Laskin had told TechCrunch that Swimply was seeing “seven digits a month in revenue” and 15,000 to 20,000 reservations a month.  Over the past six months alone, Swimply has seen 3x growth. In the last year, its site facilitated 250,000 bookings, up from 40,000 all of last year &#8212; up more than 6 times. In 2021, it put 1 million people in 15,000 pools across 103 cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while the company declined to reveal its revenues, if it gets a cut of each of those bookings, well, that’s not insignificant. (It charges a 10% guest service fee that it says helps cover insurance support as well as a 15% commission fee from the owner).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surge in demand surprised even co-founders Laskin (who came up with the idea for the company when he was just 20) and Asher Weinberger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, we booked a lot of smaller groups. But this year, with people getting vaccinated [against COVID], we saw more birthday parties being celebrated, swimming lessons coming back and people getting together again for the first time in a while,” Laskin told TechCrunch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the company is looking to expand beyond pools to outdoor spaces in general. In 2022, it plans to match people up with other “passion” spaces such as underutilized hot tubs, tennis courts, large backyard spaces, rooftops and even one day…indoor gyms. This leads to an indirect sustainability component in that actually using underutilized spaces instead of building new ones that comes with discouraging new construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swimply is also proud of the fact that it is spawning entrepreneurs. Like Airbnb, Swimply’s hosts have the potential to make big bucks, according to Laskin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the highest-earning host earned a little over $20,000. This year, there were hosts that earned over six figures. In fact, the top 20% of hosts earned around $5,000 per month, Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is turning a lot of people into solopreneurs,” Laskin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part of the reason Swimply is using some of its new capital to build new tools for its hosts to help them better manage their businesses. As proof of that, some hosts are taking things a step further and doing things like installing vending machines on their properties or offering chef’s services to their guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to scale up support, insurance and as mentioned previously launch new verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some fun stats about the business we found interesting: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty percent of Swimply’s revenue comes from the Los Angeles market. Next up of popular markets are: Austin, Texas; Portland, Oregon; New York City and Maryland. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty percent of the bookings are made by families. The average reservation is two hours long.  Repeat reservations make up about 72% of bookings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayfield Managing Director Navin Chaddha notes that his team are “big believers in the sharing economy,” as evidenced not only by its leading this round, but by the firm’s investments another sharing economy startups such as Lyft and Poshmark. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pool market, in particular, is appealing because swimming is one of the top activities for families but very few people have access to pools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimply’s mission is to democratize ownership of recreational spaces and to allow hosts to share underutilized assets for their local communities, starting with swimming pools,” he said. “I&#8217;m very, very excited about partnering with Swimply and helping the world get equalized, and not only the rich having access to these amenities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of the market opportunity with mission-oriented founders was a big draw for Chaddha.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimply has seen exploding growth, and we believe the market is much bigger than swimming pools, which in and of itself is a $52 billion market,” he told TechCrunch. “They have the potential to do with Airbnb, Lyft and Poshmark for this constituency. It was a no-brainer to lead a $40 million round for this company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GGV Managing Partner Hans Tung and Principal Robin Li were drawn to Swimply for many of the same reasons that Mayfield was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Li, the prospect of giving people easier and more private access to outdoor spaces is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the country club reinvented and even revolutionizing what the YMCA will be like in the future,” she said. “At most of these places, there are so many restrictions on what you can wear, and what you can do. There are so many hurdles to book a place, even in your local neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Swimply has so many repeat users is evidence of how easy the experience is, in her view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tung sees a number of parallels between Airbnb and Swimply’s models. But one big difference, he points out, is the frequency at which people travel compared to going swimming or merely spending time outdoors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swimming is more everyday use and a higher frequency of usage, which makes the platform extremely interesting,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hosts too, this can be more lucrative, since you are able to rent the same space more than once a day, multiple times a week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frequency usage is a lot higher than any travel site,” he said. “So like TikTok and Poshmark, Swimply is allowing more everyday people to monetize, and empowering more merchants.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal AI</a>, an artificial intelligence startup that trawls the vast sea of internet and other publicly available data to provide organizations with sentiment insights and other information to make better business decisions, has raised $50 million. It plans to use the funds to continue building out its AI platform to bring in more diversified data sources, in order to extract insights across an ever-wider range of business questions that a person might ask.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Organizations still don’t have an effective radar to get ahead of threats and opportunities, and turning challenges into opportunities,&#8221; said David Benigson, the startup&#8217;s CEO, in an interview. The aggregate hundreds of sources of data &#8212; from social and news media through to 25,000 podcasts, regulatory filings and other public records &#8212; into a single platform.</p>
<p class="p7">It then applies machine learning and other AI techniques to extract insights from it all based on natural language questions posed by Signal AI customers. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been diversifying the data that we inject in the platform,&#8221; he added. Signal AI currently works across some 100 languages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of a Series D, and it is being led by Highland Europe, with new backer abrdn plus previous backers Redline (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/signal-ai-taps-25m-for-public-data-based-market-intelligence-that-spots-trends-and-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led Signal AI&#8217;s Series C in 2019</a>), MMC, and strategic backers Hearst and Guardian Media Group Ventures also participating. London-based Signal AI has now raised $100 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Benigson &#8212; who co-founded the company with Miguel Martinez, the company&#8217;s chief data scientist &#8212; said it grew 100% over the last round.</p>
<p><a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/103080-70/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PItchBook estimates</a> that valuation was around $100 million at that point (in 2019), which would put it at $200 million now, if that figure is accurate. In any case, Signal AI itself has definitely grown. Benigson said that the startup now works with 40% of the Fortune 500, with its customer base including Deloitte, Bank of America and Google.</p>
<p>The challenge that Signal has identified and is building to fix is one that we all encounter every day, but feels particularly acute when it involves businesses navigating tricky issues with potentially billions of dollars of investment at stake if they take the wrong turn.</p>
<p>The internet has equipped us with a vast trove of information, but not always the best keys and maps for unlocking and getting around it, especially when the answers we are looking for are not straightforward, as they are in the case of more fluffy questions around sentiment analysis, or &#8220;answers&#8221; that are actually a collation of information from a number of sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a number of companies that have also identified this gap and are building to solve it, including Dataminr (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a huge round this year at $4.1 billion valuation</a>), Meltwater (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MWTR.OL?p=MWTR.OL&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly traded</a> and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/meltwater-has-acquired-datasift-to-double-down-on-social-media-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring businesses</a> to build out its technology muscle), and Cision (now privately held and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/brandwatch-is-acquired-by-cision-for-450m-creating-a-pr-marketing-and-social-listening-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making big acquisitions to grow</a>).</p>
<p>Much of the emphasis and impetus for these companies started and still sits squarely in the area of media monitoring &#8212; a huge business tapped not just by other media sources but by companies themselves. Indeed, Signal AI itself used to be called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/ai-fueled-market-intelligence-firm-signal-media-takes-16m-to-tackle-more-targets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Signal Media</a> and focused mainly on this area as well.</p>
<p>That in itself is still a big market that is worth disrupting &#8212; the old school way of approaching this was to collate media clippings, provided to clients; the new approach is not just to collate mentions but to deliver more summarized information and insights gleaned from those clips. The more the internet grows, the more clips there will be, and so in fact simply getting a pile of them becomes untenable for even the most enthusiastic teams of communications specialists.</p>
<p>Even so, that model set up for more intelligent media monitoring also paves the way for applying the same format and algorithms to a much wider set of use cases, which is the premise Signal AI has been building upon.</p>
<p>A large part of its work, thus, still remains focused on providing insights to people working around communications strategy, but it&#8217;s deepening the types of information it can provide to them by way of its AIQ platform (as Signal calls it).</p>
<p>Benigson notes that this now includes, for example, more information and &#8220;insights&#8221; for a company on potential business partners; getting up to speed on an aspect of diversity and inclusion and how it&#8217;s being approached by others; a pending decision on environmental strategy; and data to inform a company&#8217;s strategy on regulatory compliance in areas like taxes or data protection.</p>
<p>While comparisons to companies like Dataminr are fair, Benigson said, Signal AI differs from these as it provides more context both in the kinds of queries that can be asked by users, and in the responses that are given. Alongside its business growth, that richer experience is another reason why investors are interested in seeing how the startup will grow.</p>
<p>“Signal AI is a stand out category defining business” said Tony Zappalà, a partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “We are excited to be involved with the next chapter of the company’s innovative growth. David and the leadership team have a clear vision for the decision augmentation category they are helping to define and as Gartner’s research has shown, the opportunity is huge.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-80-million-after-getting-federal-banking-charter/">raising</a> an $80 million Series C round, <a href="https://www.anchorage.com">Anchorage</a> is announcing that it has raised a $350 million Series D round. With today’s funding round, the company has reached a valuation of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>Anchorage offers a custody solution for big institutions, such as publicly traded companies or funds. On top of that, Anchorage lets you trade crypto assets, stake assets to earn returns and participate in protocol governance if you own a lot of tokens for a specific protocol.</p>
<p>For instance, one transaction has been particularly commented. Back in August, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/visa-enters-nfts-cryptopunk-7610-acquisition-interview">Visa acquired a CryptoPunk</a> for 49.5 ETH. At the time, it represented around $150,000. Behind the scenes, Anchorage handled the transaction for Visa.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247434" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>KKR is leading the round, with many, many different investors also participating. So take a deep breath and try to read this sentence out loud in one try: Goldman Sachs, Alameda Research, Andreessen Horowitz, Apollo credit funds, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Blockchain Capital, Delta Blockchain Fund, Elad Gil, GIC, GoldenTree Asset Management, Innovius Capital, Kraken, Lux Capital, PayPal Ventures, Senator Investment Group, Standard Investments, Thoma Bravo and Wellington Management</p>
<p>You may wonder why such a big group of investors want to put some money in Anchorage. That’s because Anchorage received a federal banking charter, turning it into a digital asset bank. It differentiates Anchorage from many custodian products out there.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to improve its product, especially for global financial firms and other fintech companies. Customers can also expect more features with more integrations with DeFi products.</p>
<p>“As a pioneer in enabling institutional investors to access digital assets, Anchorage has built a best in class, institutional grade digital asset platform that combines the best practices of both modern security and usability. We are thrilled to lead this Series D round and work with Diogo, Nathan and their talented team as they continue to support the institutional adoption of digital assets through their differentiated, regulated and integrated suite of solutions,” KKR’s Technology Growth Equity senior leader Ben Pederson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past year, Anchorage has increased its number of clients by 96%. The company’s headcount has also increased by quite a lot with a 175% jump compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>With its federal banking charter, Anchorage has a good barrier to entry in case other companies want to compete in the same space. As companies realize that crypto assets are more than a fad, they’ll increasingly look for trustworthy partners to interact with the crypto ecosystem. And some of them will certainly end up working with Anchorage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you think of <a href="https://pabio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pabio</a> as &#8220;Stitchfix for furniture, in Europe,&#8221; you&#8217;re probably pretty close to the mark. The company started in Switzerland a couple of years ago with a mission to stop people from buying disposable Ikea stuff for a two-year stint in an apartment, replacing it with well-styled, well-thought-out interior design suggestions and robust, reusable and recyclable furniture. Today it announced it expanded into Germany and raised a drawer-full of cash to expand its marketing and to reach into additional European countries.</p>
<p>With Pabio, customers can request a personalized interior design proposal with photorealistic renders of what their fully furnished apartment will look like. They upload a floor plan and take some photos, and Pabio generates a 3D model of their apartment, furniture and all. If the customer likes it, they can subscribe to their furniture, delivered, installed and insured, for a monthly subscription fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most people would not pay for an Airbnb if it looks like the apartment they live in. We figured maybe there&#8217;s something there. We got into the interior design and furniture space,&#8221; explains Carlo Badini, co-founder and CEO of Pabio. &#8220;We came up with the idea of marrying interior design with furniture subscription to make nice living affordable to those who rent only for a couple of years.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Ikea &#8212; just like the furniture industry in general &#8212; it tries to portray itself as sustainable, but most furniture is never recycled. The business model for &#8216;fast furniture&#8217; is &#8216;how much can we sell and how frequently&#8217;. In our case, it&#8217;s the exact opposite. Because we offer a subscription, we&#8217;re motivated to keep your stuff in your apartment as long as possible, which means we offer high-quality stuff that can last for decades,&#8221; says Anand Chowdhary, CTO at Pabio. &#8220;Furniture used to be high quality. If you go to your grandparents&#8217; house, you see that the dining table is 20 years old. That was the point of furniture before fast furniture became a trend. We are a new take on that same idea &#8212; that furniture should be long-lasting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get to the end of your subscription, and you move away, we would take all the furniture back. We will refurbish it and put it in a new apartment. That means we&#8217;re optimizing that whole process of how quickly can we put the furniture into a new apartment at a discounted price,&#8221; says Badini. &#8220;Three or four cycles later, when that furniture is actually fully worn down, we would recycle it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pricing for the service is aimed to be reasonably competitive compared to buying your own furniture &#8212; a one-bedroom apartment, fully furnished, lands in the sub-€200 (US$225) range per month, often significantly below that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our target is that we want to be at a maximum of 15% of the rent you are paying,&#8221; comments Chowdhary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s a great time to build a rent-to-own company. It’s very hard for millenials to pay tens of thousands of dollars up front to get furniture for their apartment. Pabio makes this easy and affordable without compromising on quality,&#8221; said Tim Brady, partner at Y Combinator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, offline test preparation centers in Nigeria have provided after-school guidance and tutoring to students who seek to pass entrance examinations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edtech platforms such as <a href="https://edukoya.com/">Edukoya</a> have sprung up with the intent to take these models online and maintain affordability for students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Lagos- and London-based startup, which builds online education content and offers online tutoring for students and their parents, raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding led by European VC firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/target-global-early-stage-fund-ii/">Target Global</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers a range of features such as a 24/7 exam preparation and homework help, a question bank with step-by-step workings and personalized performance tracking systems.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya was founded by CEO <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/honeyogundeyi">Honey Ogundeyi</a> in May. She told TechCrunch that the platform, launched this month in beta, plans to go live fully in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s education system is a stark representation of what exists in most countries in Africa: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">poorly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equipped classrooms, few high-quality teachers, terrible infrastructure, irrelevant curriculum, and ridiculous student-to-teacher ratios (it’s been as <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS?locations=NG">high as 46:1</a> in Nigeria for the primary level).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s a result of these challenges, the average parent seeks after-school classes for their kids</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ogundeyi experienced this during her schooling days in Nigeria, and she said she started Edukoya after contrasting K-12 experiences in the West African country and the U.K.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes, even the most brilliant students can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be let </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">down by the system,” she said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If my parents hadn’t made the sacrifice for me to go abroad, all the successes that I’ve had in my career would have been completely different</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, I have two kids, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeing that same problem of going to school and struggling with some subjects made me look into getting after-school teachers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struck me that this thing hasn’t changed pretty much for the last 50 years. If we look at all the innovation across different industries, Africa’s education system </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has remained </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">untouched for 50 years; it’s been stagnant.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2247712 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="529" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg 8362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=768,597 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=680,529 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=1536,1194 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=2048,1592 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-Product_005.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of every K-12 education, the goal of most students is to get into a university. Like</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., where the SAT is the standardized test for college admissions, the Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) and West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) are the equivalents for university admissions in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> practice for these exams with materials containing previous test questions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Edukoya bundled these practice tests for both entrance exams (about 20,000) into its mobile application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya said it provides step-by-step solutions to “solve tough problems on past examination papers,” a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">students can connect to experienced tutors to help them out whenever they are stuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform then provides insights with scores, time spent per question and other stats to help students identify their strengths and areas for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the few months that the platform has been in beta with a handful of users, Edukoya claims that </span>96% of students using its platform received higher marks during recent tests than when they didn’t use Edukoya.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya isn’t the first edtech startup to have launched an online learning or test preparation application in Nigeria. So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many similar platforms cropped up in the last five years that it seemed it was the only brand of edtech that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of them have closed or achieved little or no scale. Edukoya has yet to do either. But after raising the largest pre-seed round in Nigeria and on the continent, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve a grander scale than its predecessors, which only secured paltry sums of VC money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Ogundeyi believes Edukoya’s approach to learning makes it stand out from its competition and previous platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This model is unique in that we are reaching parents and learners 100% online and supporting them not only across exams but also the day-to-day learning, homework, support, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Edukoya goes beyond exam prep. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an educational partner to parents and learners in primary and secondary school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen people tackle smaller pockets in different ways, but not in a holistic way that we’re thinking about it,” she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2247713" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247713" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2247713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="509" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=768,575 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=680,509 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=1536,1151 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=2048,1534 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Edukoya-002.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2247713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Edukoya</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most edtechs that play in this space tend to launch their platforms for grades 1-12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Edukoya is looking at it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform is only available to students in grades 10-12, the segment taking exams into tertiary institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi said that once the company tests with this very tight segment and five core subjects, it will open up to cover more subjects and other grade levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explaining why the company adopted this strategy, the CEO said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s from my core focus &#8212; one of the things I got from Google, which is to make a core group of people love you first. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working with the last three grades, which are very important in Nigeria because that’s where people take those exams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is a good sort of test bucket to work with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> core group of people who need an intervention in that space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once we have proven that it works here, it’s easier for us to expand it across other curriculum years and grades.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edukoya is free now, but Ogundeyi said the company would explore a freemium model where premium products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upsell students or parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi noted that Edukoya would need to keep sourcing experienced teachers to provide tutoring services for this to happen. For new-age edtechs, including YC-backed Kenyan startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/">Kidato</a>, Tencent and Owl Ventures portfolio company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/african-edtech-startup-ulesson-raises-15m-backed-by-nielsen-ventures-and-tencent/">uLesson</a>, targeting these three communities (students, teachers and parents) is paramount from day one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the CEO’s first spell at running a startup. In 2014, she founded Fashpa, a Nigerian fashion e-commerce store. Her professional career spans consulting and managerial roles at McKinsey &amp; Company, Ericsson, Google and UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was also the founding CMO of Kuda, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Nigerian neobank</a> founded Babs Ogundeyi. He is one of the angel investors in this round; others include his co-founder Musty Mustapha, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, Stash founders Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson, and Aux Money CEO Raffael Johnen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linachong/">Lina Chong</a>, the investment director at Target Global, confirmed her firm’s investment, saying, “Edukoya’s mission to provide better quality to millions of African students, combined with the team’s ability to execute on this ambition, left an immediate impression on myself and the whole team at Target Global. Their business has the potential to unlock learner potential and improve lives across generations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ogundeyi mentioned that a bulk of the pre-seed funding would expand its team and learner base and build out the technology for its learning platform, including support for its pan-African and European developer hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO was one of the earliest female founders in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years after her first startup, she has now raised the largest round at this stage in this “minority group.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though she’s impressed by the quality of female founders springing forth and the check sizes they are commanding, she said it’s still early days for her clique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been in this space for a long time and I’m particularly passionate about female founders and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding the scope of what we can do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make that segmentation so much. Given the right opportunity and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the right experience, female founders can build big valuable businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> day one for us as part of that journey.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://www.4dxventures.com/">4DX Ventures</a> has completed the final close of its second fund at $60 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The second fund, launched in the first quarter of this year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to close at $50 million, but investor and limited partner (LP) interest saw the fund oversubscribed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The LPs involved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unnamed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include U.S.-based asset managers, a university endowment, global family offices, tech founders, hedge fund portfolio managers and investors from private equity and venture capital, the firm said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort by the New York, Accra and Cairo-based firm, an early investor in African unicorns Flutterwave and Andela, follows large fund closes by the likes of Partech, Novastar, Algebra and TLcom Capital that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sporadically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happened on the continent.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With large funds, most of these firms tend to find their sweet spots in growth-stage deals, particularly in Series A and B. But recently, they are beginning to get involved in earlier rounds to gain stakes to help them compete for the late-stage investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, TLcom Capital, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">$71 million pan-African fund</a> that initially made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments only in the growth stage, led pre-seed rounds in Nigeria&#8217;s Okra and Autochek last year (it co-led the latter with 4DX Ventures).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-seed to Series B are the stages on which 4DX Ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founding partners Walter Baddoo and Peter Orth told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The quality of founders and team is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our North Star. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And our goal is to partner with the very best teams going after transformative opportunities across the continent,&#8221; Orth said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;And you know, Walter and I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have experienced investing in companies from the idea stage to public markets and, generally speaking, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that from the pre-seed to Series B stage, it&#8217;s still early enough to deliver the type of returns that we&#8217;re looking for as an early-stage fund.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founding partners have known each other for more than 20 years. Between them, they have years of operational and financial experience working at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Bridgewater Associates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started 4DX Ventures </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017 after three years of investing personal funds in African startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Global talent marketplace Andela and payments company Flutterwave were part of the firm&#8217;s early success, generating significant secondary returns due to their unicorn status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures&#8217; first fund was a bit over $20 million and it invested in startups such as Ghanaian health tech startup mPharma and Kenyan B2B e-commerce platform Sokowatch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has welcomed the likes of Autochek, Breadfast, MaxAB, Taager, Trella and Yoco from this second fund of $60 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African VC firms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predominantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> write their checks to the Big Four markets: Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt and Kenya because that&#8217;s where most of the continent&#8217;s opportunities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reside</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> different, as most of its portfolio companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in these four countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Orth is quick to add that the firm has begun looking into other countries, especially in the Francophone region; case in point, the investment it co-led into Ivorian fintech CinetPay this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for industries, 4DX Ventures says it is a &#8220;generalist,&#8221; but most of its investments have taken place </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in fintech, B2B e-commerce, healthcare and logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to invest in companies that are building products that solve foundational problems on the continent and also in the largest markets because the size of the market matters quite a bit for the potential outcome of companies,&#8221; Baddoo said about the markets and industries that pique 4DX&#8217;s interests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And so we love when folks are building products in markets that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> large, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give the companies that opportunity to have a pretty dramatic growth path throughout their lifecycle.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baddoo also highlighted that asides from the market and industries, 4DX Ventures also seeks &#8220;strong founders with a growth mindset who have a lot of grit&#8221; and can &#8220;marry a very clear vision of what they&#8217;re trying to build with a thoughtful approach to strategy and execution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pan-African firm writes checks of about &#8220;a few $100,000 to a few million&#8221; across all stages (pre-seed to Series B), according to Orth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching its first fund, 4DX Ventures has invested in more than 40 companies across Africa (its primary market), the Middle East and the U.S., with a handful of companies. One of its portfolio companies, U.S.-based Swarm Technologies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/spacex-to-acquire-satellite-connectivity-startup-swarm-technologies/#:~:text=SpaceX%20to%20acquire%20satellite%20connectivity%20startup%20Swarm%20Technologies,-Aria%20Alamalhodaei%40breadfrom&amp;text=SpaceX%20will%20be%20acquiring%20satellite,as%20a%20ground%20station%20network.">got acquired by SpaceX</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4DX Ventures says its portfolio companies have raised more than $1.2 billion in funding, one of the largest follow-on investments known for an African-focused fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close of this second fund also brought </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience to the firm&#8217;s management team in two general partners, Dan Marlo and Raaid Ahmad. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their appointment, the pair served as senior advisors to the firm since 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both bring years of experience operating, investing and advising companies in various sectors such as fintech, telco, software, sports, social and health, the firm said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Both Dan Marlo and Raaid have been senior advisors to 4DX since the beginning of the fund. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">prior to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them joining as senior advisors, we&#8217;ve known each other for a decade. They are both experienced operators who have a scarce combination of skill sets. And going into our next Fund and the future of the company, we couldn&#8217;t think of two better people to join to help us, you know, carry the firm into our next chapter here,&#8221; said Orth on the appointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA Hall of Famer and Congolese-American former professional basketball player Dikembe Mutombo, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his humanitarian and entrepreneurial work, especially for Africans and African Americans, will now serve in the firm&#8217;s senior advisory role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He joins a current senior advisor roster that includes Karen Karniol-Tambour of Bridgewater Associates, Jay Zaveri of Social Capital and Sakya Duvvuru of Nellore Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baddoo, who is Ghanaian by birth, is bullish on his firm&#8217;s work and hinted that his association with the continent is part of what drives the deals 4DX Ventures makes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Growing up in Accra, Ghana, a lot of these companies are solving problems that I </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> firsthand.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And so the fact that we can dedicate our time to back some of the greatest founders of this generation that are building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> special and important companies on a continent, to me, is a dream. And the ability to do that where I come from is quite important. So my hope and belief is that 4DX will continue to play a very pivotal role in the ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uni, an Indian startup that offers users pay-later cards, has raised $70 million in a financing round as it looks to broaden its product offerings in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>General Catalyst led the one-year-old startup’s Series A funding. Eight Roads Ventures, Elevation Capital, Arbor Ventures as well as existing investors Lightspeed and Accel participated in the round.</p>
<p>The new round, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/india-uni-credit-card-startup-raises-18-5-million/">follows last year’s $18.5 million seed funding</a>, values Uni at about $350 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. TechCrunch reported earlier that Uni <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/indian-fintech-cred-seeks-funds-at-5-5-billion-valuation/">was in talks</a> to raise a round at over $300 million valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247799" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bangalore-based <a href="http://uni.cards">Uni</a> is among a handful of startups in India that is attempting to bring the benefits of credit cards to the masses. Even as nearly a billion Indians have a bank account, only a sliver of this population is covered by the country’s young credit rating system.</p>
<p>Fewer than 30 million Indians have a credit card today, which has created a huge whitespace for startups like Uni and Tiger Global-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">Slice</a> to innovate on tech and reach more consumers. Uni offers its customers a pay-later card that automatically splits the bill in three parts spread across three months. If customers pay within the three months, they are not charged any interest fee. If they settle the bill in one month, they get a 1% cashback reward.</p>
<p>The startup, which uses its own underwriting tech to determine applicants&#8217; credit worthiness, launched the card in June this year and says it is already disbursing $23 million to its customers each month. The startup did not disclose how many users it has amassed, but said its customers are spread across 50 Indian cities.</p>

<p>Nitin Gupta, who co-founded PayU India and then ran ride-hailing firm Ola&#8217;s financial services business, co-founded Uni last year. Lightspeed and Accel backed the startup at a time when it had yet to launch a product.</p>
<p>“The Indian credit market is ripe for explosion and there is vast room for innovation. We found a strong product-market fit with our very first product, the Pay 1/3rd card &#8211; a first of its kind card in the market and haven’t looked back from there,&#8221; said Gupta. &#8220;BNPL [buy now, pay later] is growing at a breakneck speed in India and within BNPL we are seeing that the biggest potential lies in the Pay1/3rd category and we are leading this space with our innovative product and customer experience. We are delighted to have some of the best investors in the world partnering with us as we gear up for our next phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Gupta said the startup is working on developing a number of new products and aims to expand its monthly disbursement to $197 million in the next nine months.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to be partnering with Nitin, Prateek, Laxmikant and the rest of the Uni team as they build category defining financial services products for Indian consumers,&#8221; said Alex Tran, Managing Director at General Catalyst, in a statement. &#8220;There are few countries in the world where the opportunity for credit expansion is as massive as in India, and we believe some iconic companies will be built to capture this opportunity in the next decade. We are excited to back a team that is world-class on credit, risk, and payments while also being hyper focused on product and customer delight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pay later fintech players today finance loans worth $500 million each year, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent note to clients. They expect the figure to balloon to $26 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was only earlier this week that we learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/studyfree-an-international-student-scholarships-and-grants-platform-raises-3m-seed/">StudyFree</a> — which connects students with international educational opportunities — had raised a $3 million seed round. But there’s more to this than being accepted on a traditional course. The pandemic has turned education into a remote industry, and tech startups have responded.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.educate-online.io/">Educate Online</a> is a platform allowing international students to study at UK, US, and Canadian schools, but there’s a twist. All the study is done online, remotely, full-time or part-time, without having to move to another country and bear the related costs.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $4 million in Seed funding from Xploration Capital, TMT Investments, Flyer One Ventures, Softline, and Angelsdeck.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the past 12 months, the startup says it’s garnered 2,500 students from 18 countries, covering K-12 study, ESOL, career exploration, university preparation, and internship &amp; mentorship programs.</p>
<p>The platform also offers options for students to participate in on-campus summer or semester programs. It now plans to scale in LATAM, Asia, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Competitors include agencies that are still focused on offline education such as <a href="https://www.transitionsabroad.com/publications/magazine/0507/schooling_children_abroad.shtml">Transitions Abroad</a>, <a href="https://smapse.com/how-to-choose-a-school-abroad-for-a-child/">Smapse</a> and <a href="https://academicfamilies.com/agents-international-student-recruitment/">Academic Families</a>.</p>
<p>Alexander Zheltov, co-founder and CEO of Educate Online, said: “Educate Online was founded in 2018 and since then has placed more than 4,000+ children between the ages of 4-19 in top schools. After COVID-19 hit, we made a hard pivot to online education as we were seeing a surge of interest towards online education – in 2020 we grew 5.5 times and we expect to continue growing 3-5x year-over-year”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eugene Timko, Managing Partner at Xploration Capital said: “Schools have historically been very local operations. Few have branched out to other countries, primarily through building foreign campuses and local partnerships. This has significantly limited the potential reach for international school education. Educate Online may become the dominant online layer on top of the existing schools’ infrastructure, vastly expanding the current market for cross-border education&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch Battlefield (NYC 2014) finalists <a href="https://www.mimi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimi Hearing Technologies</a> just closed its $25 million Series B funding to continue whispering its mission of hearing well-being from the rooftops. The company recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/mimi-partnerships/">announced a series of high-profile partnerships with Skullcandy, Cleer and Beyerdynamic</a>, and is now plowing onwards with its fresh infusion of cash from <a href="https://www.mig-fonds.de/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIG Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/athos-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ATHOS</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scope for software-based solutions that can deal with things beyond hearing difficulties,&#8221; Nick Clark, one of the founders of Mimi, who heads up the company&#8217;s R&amp;D, told me a while back. &#8220;You can start doing subtle things that benefit a broader and broader audience depending on their differences in hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mimi has one of the most popular at-home hearing testing apps, where around 50,000 people per month test their hearing. The company has made the same technology available to headphone manufacturers as an SDK. The apps can then use these hearing profiles to create customized audio outputs specifically tailored to your hearing. That means that it&#8217;s possible to hear better without turning the volume up to make up for the areas of your hearing where you may have hearing loss. The theory is that this prevents further hearing loss.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You can buy Skullcandy headphones, download the application and you create your profile there,&#8221; explains Mimi&#8217;s CEO and founder Philipp Skribanowitz. &#8220;But this profile is also compatible with other partners, and you can use it everywhere. We also have developed tests on a TV for Philips, so you just sit on your couch and do the test on your TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money is earmarked for further investment in the company&#8217;s technology, especially in terms of expanding its offerings across headphone and TV integrations. The company will also be ramping up the expansion of sales and marketing operations across the U.S. and Asia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leading investors of our Series B consortium &#8212; MIG, Athos and Salvia &#8212; garnered international attention last year as the founding investors in BioNTech, the Nasdaq-listed German biotech company that, together with Pfizer, developed the first COVID-19 vaccine and is now valued at approximately $70 billion,&#8221; noted Mimi CFO Moritz Bratzke. &#8220;Their investment in Mimi is another testament not only to the depth and breadth of the German venture capital climate, but also to the importance and tremendous commercial potential of Mimi’s vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenyan startup <a href="https://www.wowzi.co">Wowzi</a> has secured new funding to expand the reach of its platform, which turns social media users into brand influencers, to West and Southern Africa &#8212; as it taps the increasing usage of social sites across the continent driven by the proliferation of smartphones and a deepening <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">internet penetration</a>.</p>
<p>Wowzi, which connects social media users with advertisers and provides consumer insights, has secured a total of $3.2 million from investors over the last few months, part of which includes a recently concluded $2 million seed round that was led by the Africa-focused venture capital firm 4DX Ventures. This was preceded by a $1.2 million pre-seed round.</p>
<p>Other investors in the seed round were To.org, Golden Palm Investments, LoftyInc Capital, Afropreneur Angels, and Future Africa. Andela co-founder Christina Sass, and former Andela executives Jessica Chervin, Justin Ziegler, as well as Johnny Falla, who currently serves as chief development and growth officer at Wowzi, took part in the round too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247457" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Wowzi plans to use the new investment to set up operations in Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, seeking growth opportunities beyond Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, where it currently has a physical presence. It plans to use these new hubs to enter more countries across the continent.</p>
<p>“We are primarily focused on expanding across Africa in 2022 and in other emerging markets globally,” Wowzi co-founder and CEO, Brian Mogeni, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“We are also adding new product capabilities and features, as we continue to develop our technology and provide additional value to our communities,” he said.</p>
<p>Wowzi makes it possible for brands to partner with social media users for marketing campaigns. This a new form of digital marketing that pivots from the norm of using celebrities for marketing campaigns. Wowzi said by using normal internet users, it is tapping “more authentic engagements or product endorsements&#8221; from people who interact with these brands on a daily basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup also relieves brands from the stress of managing influencers as the platform operates in an automated fashion. To post a campaign, brands filter out their preferred influencer demographic groups based on characteristics like gender, location, profession or income levels. Wowzi then matches them with with the right type of influencers for their needs. The brands then refine their search (based on the content shared or level of activity) and then reach out to the influencers they desire.</p>
<p>“Managing influencers is difficult; from establishing contact, negotiations, contracting, ensuring that content is delivered and is posted on time to following up on payment. It is a lot of work. We manage the entire process with the brand to make sure that it&#8217;s successful,” said Falla</p>
<p>Wowzi influencers are categorized as nano, micro, mega, meta and super (celebrities), and they carry out marketing campaigns for brands via their social media accounts on sites like Tik Tok, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. However, Wowzi’s focus is mainly on nano and micro influencers (social media users with less than 10,000 followers).</p>
<p>Anyone with at least 250 (nano influencers) connections on a social site fits the profile of a Wowzi influencer, but interested candidates must go through several verification levels before they start getting gigs.</p>
<p>“Brands want to have more authentic engagements or endorsements for products, from people who use and love them, and can talk about real practical applications. Our campaigns show that nano influencers deliver better sales leads because of the higher trust with their following,” Falla told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Brands also access a community of their most likely customers, and so this makes the campaigns hyper targeted for them as well,” said Falla.</p>

<p>Wowzi works with creative agencies or directly with brands to help them scale their campaigns. It has so far worked with Coca Cola, Netflix, Safaricom, Diageo, P&amp;G and Absa Bank.</p>
<p>The processes are automated, which means that brands get data they can use to evaluate the reach of the marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>“We offer a really comprehensive reporting dashboard online. So, brands can check in to see exactly what happened, what posts were made by the influencers, which ones performed the best and analytics of the demographics for people who were actually reached,” said Falla.</p>
<p>Wowzi is the brainchild of Mogeni, Hassan Bashir and Mike Otieno, who co-founded the company mid-2019 but the platform went live a day before Kenya’s president imposed the first lockdown last year. As it later turned out, a window of opportunity opened as more brands realized that they had to adopt other ways of marketing as travel and human interaction remained limited.</p>
<p>The startup has so far worked with 200 brands, carried out over 15,000 campaigns and delivered over 200,000 paid gigs to date. Wowzi has grown 20-fold over the last one year.</p>
<p>More recently, brands are able to post market research jobs including the engagement of influencers in polls or surveys. This is part of Wowzi’s plan to grow beyond an influencer marketing platform to a jobs aggregator.</p>
<p>“We recently rolled out a market intelligence service which enables the same brands, SMEs or development agencies to pull information in a faster, targeted and richer format from their focal segments,” said Mogeni.</p>
<p>Wowzi is now eyeing over 1 million job opportunities in the short term as it establishes a strong pan-African presence. This goal is achievable for the startup, which has successfully conducted campaigns across multiple markets in Africa including Mauritius, Mozambique, Zambia and Cameroon.</p>
<p>“We actually had our first engagement in Cameroon recently after Netflix asked us to work with them in an additional eight countries. And so, what we have seen is that we can scale easily, even without the need for a physical presence,” said Falla.</p>
<p>Across sub-Saharan Africa 303 million people, about 28% of the population, are connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA Mobile Economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. This is expected to grow to about 40% of the population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Wowzi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve visited Brinc’s headquarters the last few times I’ve been to Hong Kong, and been impressed with the range of different startups the accelerator works with. I knew the organization primary through its consumer hardware companies &#8212; a primary focus when it was founded, back in 2014.</p>
<p>Brinc has expanded its scope a fair bit in the intervening years, with big focuses on things like food, health and deep tech. Seems it’s set to continue expanding its reach, going forward with eyes on categories like web3 and NFTs. Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands appears to be playing a big role in the move. Last year, the pair launched the blockchain/NFT accelerator Launchpad Luna.</p>
<p>Animoca is also leading a $30 million Series B round for Brinc that finds the accelerator looking to expand its offering of programming, adding locations and hiring additional headcount. In a call with TechCrunch, Brinc co-founder Bay McLaughlin pointed at a number of markets in Asia as targets for potential expansion, including Japan, Korea, Singapore and India, as well as added presence in China.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In November, the company is also opening an office in Brazil &#8212; its first in Latin America. In all, Brinc currently sports seven offices, with people operating out of a total of 12 locations.</p>
<p>In addition to the Series B participation, Animoca will also be investing $100 million directly into startups through Brinc, in a manner similar to a VC fund.</p>
<p>“Brinc is the leading name in startup acceleration for emerging markets and technologies, and its sights are set firmly on the future and on sustainability,” Animoca chairman and founder Yat Siu said in a release tied to the news. “We share a common vision of an open future with blockchain adoption in traditional and growth sectors, and we look forward to the innovations that will emerge from its acceleration programs.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.nvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norwest Venture Partners</a>, the now 60-year-old venture and growth equity firm backed entirely by the banking giant Wells Fargo, today rolled out its sixteenth fund, a $3 billion vehicle and its biggest to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to shrug off the development, but this new pool brings the assets Norwest has raised altogether across the decades to $12.5 billion. Put another way, despite that gigantic fund announcements have become routine, this one is kind of a big deal and another indicator that this market is a very different one from even five years ago.</p>
<p>Certainly, one can see why, in a go-go environment, Wells might agree to such a commitment. For one thing, on the growth equity side, it&#8217;s not possible to compete anymore unless you have a ginormous money cannon. Consider that Tiger Global Management alone held a <em>first close</em> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/tiger-global-raises-8-8-billion-in-first-close-of-biggest-fund?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8.8 billion</a> on its biggest fund ever back in October, according to Bloomberg. (As a reminder, it closed its previous fund with $6.7 billion just six months ago.) To win deals, you need to be able to elbow out at least some of the other multibillion-dollar funds that are also writing checks right now.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247538" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="JEQ6kYxJCi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/">Tiger Global just closed one of the biggest venture funds ever, with $6.7 billion</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tiger Global just closed one of the biggest venture funds ever, with $6.7 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/tiger-global-just-closed-one-of-the-biggest-venture-funds-ever-with-6-7-billion/embed/#?secret=JEQ6kYxJCi" data-secret="JEQ6kYxJCi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Norwest&#8217;s team also has a lot of hits about which to boast. While it was busy deploying its last fund, a $2 billion pool that it closed in 2019 and used to fund about 60 companies &#8212; almost 30 of Norwest&#8217;s earlier bets have &#8220;exited&#8221; in some fashion over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>The security outfit Shape Security, for example, sold to the application delivery company F5 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/f5-acquires-shape-security-for-1b/">$1 billion</a> in late 2019 after raising <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shape-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$183 million</a> in funding, per Crunchbase data. Aporeto, a machine identity-based micro-segmentation company, sold to Palo Alto Networks for <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/palo-alto-networks-acquires-aporeto-for-cloud-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million</a> in cash in 2019 after raising around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aporeto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$35 million</a> from investors, according to Crunchbase. A third portfolio company, a Canadian developer of risk and compliance software called Galvanize, meanwhile sold to corporate governance software maker Diligent for a reported <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/24/insight-partners-diligent-acquire-galvanize-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion</a>. Galvanize had raised around $50 million in funding led by Norwest.</p>
<p>A number of Norwest&#8217;s consumer-facing investments also hit the public market. Two of these went out via SPAC: the real estate company Opendoor, and the digital mental health company Talkspace. A third portfolio company, Udemy, began trading publicly in October after staging a traditional IPO. (Its shares are trading down by roughly one-third of their offering price as of this writing.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4Uj3YgRIJp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/udemy-targets-valuation-of-4b-in-major-edtech-ipo/">Udemy targets valuation of $4B in major edtech IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Udemy targets valuation of $4B in major edtech IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/udemy-targets-valuation-of-4b-in-major-edtech-ipo/embed/#?secret=4Uj3YgRIJp" data-secret="4Uj3YgRIJp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Norwest currently operates in the Bay Area but it also has offices in Tel Aviv, Israel, and in India, so it has extensive geographic reach.</p>
<p>The outfit also invests in a wide range of companies. Some of these are life sciences outfits. Some are direct-to-consumer retail plays. Others are fintech startups like Plaid, whose Series C round Norwest joined in 2018, and the consumer finance startup Dave, which expects to close a merger with a blank-check company shortly and to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/consumer-finance-startup-dave-eyes-acquisitions-crypto-after-spac-deal-11639391403" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin trading publicly </a>in January.</p>
<p>Of this last sector, longtime partner Lisa Wu, who led the Plaid deal, notes that Norwest&#8217;s interest ties exclusively to the upside it sees in such companies. Norwest, she makes clear, is not a strategic investor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wells gives us a competitive advantage, but our relationship with Wells is really an arm&#8217;s length relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We have complete investment authority and autonomy over our investment processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>One area where Norwest notably hasn&#8217;t yet made a deal is in world of crypto. Asked about this, Wu suggests that it&#8217;s just a matter of time. &#8220;We talk about it every day,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We believe in the momentum . . . it&#8217;s coming [now] in Fund XVI.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the many conversations around “the metaverse” sparked by the Facebook corporate name transition to Meta, much has focused on the visual elements. What’s hardly mentioned is audio. Yet voice really matters when making a virtual environment come to life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>Just ask Spike Jonze. The movie director discarded the original voice actor in the title role of his <a href="https://uproxx.com/hitfix/her-qa-spike-jonze-on-why-he-replaced-samantha-morton-with-scarlett-johansson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 film “Her”</a> and substituted Scarlett Johansson’s sultry timbres. Although Samantha, a computer operating system, never appeared in the flesh, Jonze felt the original actress hadn’t nailed the emotion required to create a three-dimensional persona.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Voice was critical to creating a fleshed-out character that could absorb the viewer into the story’s premise and make it fully believable.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/29/facebook-meta-rebrand-metaverse-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a> noted, many keystones of the Meta vision of the metaverse already exist in video gaming — only in disconnected gaming worlds. And in the gaming universe, voice is playing an increasingly important role. Meta promises a unified, interoperable experience, but without a rich panoply of highly textured, lifelike digital voices, the metaverse will be incomplete rather than inclusive and immersive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/mcGurk-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McGurk Effect research</a> of the mid-1970s observed the cognitive dissonance resulting from mismatched audio and visual perceptions; voices that don’t fully mesh with an avatar can rip the participant from the virtual environment.</p>
<h2>Expressing the real you</h2>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the metaverse as currently promoted is a social environment where participants create unique personas in both home and workplace settings. Avatars will allow players to express themselves the way they want to be seen — as human, alien, animal, vegetable, cartoon or myriad other options. Players can try on new “looks” temporarily, the way they try new outfits. Gender and species are fluid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Changing identity is hamstrung, however, if people are not able to change how they sound along with their visual presence. Having your voice match the persona presented to other people is a core element of a personalized player identity. It is a situation many people are already accustomed to from video games.</p>
<p>If you encounter a gritty, bearded, hulking knight in a game you are playing, you would expect that character to have a deep, gruff voice, accompanied by the clank of armor. Game companies make sure to deliver this, with non-player characters (NPCs) being carefully crafted by voice actors and audio specialists to provide an immersive experience.</p>
<p>Yet in online gaming environments or in the future metaverse, where the knight is the representation of an actual person, you will have a vastly different experience. You may be startled to hear a high-pitched teenager with bad microphone quality instead of the anticipated gravelly, mature voice. The drastic incongruence between sound and vision shreds the immersive quality of the experience. Metaverse avatars can only be fully immersive if they allow people to create full digital experiences.</p>
<h2>Providing cover</h2>
<p>In addition to enabling immersion, sonic identity technology can also allow players to slip into “true” pseudonymity. They can fully become the person (or being) they want others to see — which for many people is powerful protection from a sometimes hostile online environment. It can disguise a geographical accent so the participant can more smoothly integrate a player community (a capability an offshore customer support call center might benefit from). For people with vocal tics, it can cloak a physical impairment they’d rather not reveal.</p>
<p>Voice changing technology can also help to mitigate online discrimination and harassment. A research study published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-018-9962-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</a> in 2019 notes that female gamers frequently avoid verbal communication with other players to reduce unpleasant interactions. Voice changing technology can allow them to participate in fully pseudonymous conversations, free of a specified gender, in which they might feel more comfortable in expressing themselves.</p>
<p>Regardless of the “why,” researchers in the scholarly journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07370024.2014.987346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human-Computer Interaction</a> concluded in 2014 that “voice radically transforms the experience of online gaming, making virtual spaces more intensely social.”</p>
<p>From my own internal company data, it’s clear that players who communicate with voice alter egos feel more engrossed in the game, engage it for longer periods of time and spend more money within the game as a result.</p>
<h2>What’s missing in the metaverse</h2>
<p>A truly complete immersive experience requires a combination of 3D visuals and real-time audio to enable people to express themselves in the way they want to be heard. Participants want a sonic representation of themselves that is just as original and unique as their visual avatar — and they want the tools to customize their voice as meticulously as their appearance. There must be a harmonious marriage of both augmented audio and 3D video to keep the player immersed and engaged.</p>
<p>Real-time audio defines how people can bring the ultimate individuality to their content, making audio the great equalizer of the metaverse. Unfortunately, the current voice experience is challenged to offer the type of immersive qualities that will live up to the promise of an all-encompassing metaverse.</p>
<p>Real-time audio personas are still restrictive at best, despite experimentation by dogged early adopters. The tools to shape a person&#8217;s voice to match their digital self are limited and sound quality does not yet match visual quality.</p>
<p>Yet recent advancements in available audio technology are making it far easier for players to create a unique sonic identity. New solutions available to platform and game developers enable writers, producers and audio engineers to incorporate voice modification technology within their games to produce natural-sounding and fantasy voices on demand, in real time.</p>
<p>It offers the potential to generate new avenues for monetization by delivering an inclusive and immersive auditory experience that lures players and keeps them fully focused and engaged in the experience rather than dropping away.</p>
<p>Companies are investing in powerful tools that enable people to shape the visual representation of themselves in a digital space. They must not overlook the customized sonic identity for a matching social audio experience that makes the digital representation seamless.</p>
<p>The metaverse won’t be complete without it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Oversight Board, a group Facebook created to review its policy decisions, <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/927673894608838-oversight-board-upholds-meta-s-original-decision-case-2021-014-fb-ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weighed in</a> on a case of misinformation in war-torn Ethiopia Tuesday, warning the company about the risks of allowing hate speech and unverified information to spread freely in conflict zones.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board reviewed a post in Amharic from an Ethiopia-based Facebook user that claimed the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was responsible for murder, rape and looting in Raya Kobo and other population centers in the country&#8217;s Amhara region, aided by Tigrayan civilians.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the user claims his sources are previous unnamed reports and people on-the-ground, he does not even provide circumstantial evidence to support his allegations,&#8221; the Oversight Board wrote in its evaluation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Rumors alleging that an ethnic group is complicit in mass atrocities, as found in this post, are dangerous and significantly increase the risk of imminent violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post was initially detected by Facebook&#8217;s automated content moderation tools and removed when the platform&#8217;s Amharic language content review team determined it violated the platform&#8217;s rules against hate speech. Facebook reversed its own decision and reinstated the content after the case was escalated to the Oversight Board.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board overturned Facebook&#8217;s decision to reinstate the post, citing a violation of Facebook&#8217;s rules against violence and incitement rather than the hate speech rules the platform had cited previously. In its decision, the group expressed concern that the spread of unverifiable rumors in violence-stricken areas like Ethiopia could &#8220;lead to grave atrocities, as was the case in Myanmar.&#8221;</p>
<p>The month, a group of Rohingya refugees in the U.S. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/rohingya-lawsuit-against-facebook-wake-up-call-social-media-2021-12-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a $150 billion class-action suit against Meta</a>, alleging that Facebook&#8217;s entrance into the country served as a &#8220;key inflection point&#8221; in the genocide of the Rohingya people. Misinformation stoking ethnic violence in Myanmar spread broadly on Facebook, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often sown by military personnel</a>, and is widely believed to have escalated ethnic violence that targeted and displaced the country&#8217;s Muslim minority.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/facebook-oversight-board-frances-haugen/">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> has cited algorithmically amplified ethnic violence in countries like Myanmar and Ethiopia — and Meta&#8217;s failure to adequately address it — as one of the platform&#8217;s biggest dangers. &#8220;What we saw in Myanmar and are now seeing in Ethiopia are only the opening chapters of a story so terrifying, no one wants to read the end of it,” Haugen told Congress in October.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board also instructed Meta to order an independent human rights assessment on Facebook and Instagram&#8217;s role in exacerbating the risk of ethnic violence in Ethiopia and to evaluate how well it can moderate content in the country&#8217;s languages.</p>
<p>Last month, Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-ethiopia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defended</a> the safety precautions it had taken in the country, highlighting expanded applications of some of its rules against misinformation and hate speech. The company also noted that it had improved its enforcement abilities there in the past two years and now has the capability to review content in Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya, the four most common languages.</p>

Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/what-to-expect-today-day-one-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/">Space event is underway and kicking maximum Q thus far</a>, I am happy to report. In other TechCrunch news, I just hit my two-year mark being back at the blog. Time flies! Thanks to everyone for reading my rambling so that I can stay aboard the good ship TechCrunch. Now, the news! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/apple-launches-its-siri-only-apple-music-voice-plan-with-ios-15-2/">Apple’s Siri-only music plan launches:</a></strong> I had forgotten all about Apple’s cheaper, more limited music plan announced earlier this year. But it’s not only real, it’s here. So, if you are big into Apple speaker tech and want to save a few bucks, here’s a music streaming option for you. Notably, part of the innovation is a lower price, which, frankly, given streaming economics, is not the direction I want to see music services go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/metaverse-startup-with-1m-in-2021-revenues-going-public-via-spac/"><strong>This may be peak SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>To cap 2021’s more silly stories off with a cherry, a metaverse-themed company with around $1 million in revenue is going public via a SPAC. Naturally, it has big expectations for future revenue growth. The company is betting that public-market investors are sufficiently smitten with all things metaverse to bid up its equity. Let’s see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/big-cartel-staff-are-voluntarily-recognized-as-the-latest-tech-workers-union/"><strong>Big Cartel unionizes:</strong></a> In the wake of news <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/12/amazon-worker-texted-girlfriend-he-wasnt-allowed-to-leave-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Amazon workers died in their facility after a tornado hit it</a>, you might be curious about the progress of unionization among workers for tech companies. Slowly, is the answer to that. But startups are taking the lead again, with Big Cartel choosing to voluntarily recognize its employee union. Confused? Yes, leadership has been scarce in this area from the corporate perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off today, here’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/gift-guide-5-gifts-for-all-of-us-who-need-less-screen-time/">guide from our own Sarah Perez concerning what gifts to buy</a> if you are looking to cut your, or your loved one’s, screen time. I need this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/garner-health-raises-45m-series-b-for-totally-objective-doctor-review-service/">How many stars does your doctor have?</a> </strong>Garner Health is betting that you want to look up doctor reviews before picking your provider. The company’s work landed a $45 million Series B, TechCrunch reports. Given just how big the healthcare market is, the company’s TAM is effectively infinite.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/in-the-age-of-remote-work-opal-offers-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-webcams/"><strong>The new webcam status symbol:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Everyone’s <a href="https://twitter.com/sp990/status/1470857694823079936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talking about Opal</a>, at least on my Twitter feed. The company built a $300 webcam that looks nifty, and, we presume, will actually be in stock. This deep into the pandemic, lots of folks still have spotty internet, poor lighting and more. Perhaps the startup didn’t miss its window.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/andreessen-horowitz-backs-nft-investor-group-behind-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-purchase/"><strong>a16z backs PleasrDAO:</strong></a> The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) PleasrDAO has collected backing from a16z, which TechCrunch notes is not the first time that the investing group has backed a DAO. Pleasr’s claims to fame appear to be that it bought a doge NFT for $4 million and spent millions more on a Wu-Tang Clan album.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/pair-eyewear-focuses-in-on-adult-glasses-as-it-takes-in-60m/"><strong>Pair raises $60M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While we’re sufficiently far past the Warby Parker founding story now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly/">that the company is public</a>, startups aren’t letting the eyeglasses game rest. Pair, which builds eyewear that allows for inexpensive modification, just closed its second round of the year. Previously, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/pair-eyewear-raises-12m-to-bring-more-personality-to-your-glasses/">raised $12 million in April</a>. A quick perusal of its service while writing this newsletter for you left me wanting a pair, for whatever my limited fashion sense is worth. It’s worth noting that Warby Parker remains above its $40 per-share IPO price. More on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">the Warby DTC IPO from earlier this year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/in-person-event-sound-streaming-service-mixhalo-raises-24m/"><strong>Mixhalo raises Series B for live audio mixing:</strong></a> The live events business may have been little more than moribund during the last few years, but Mixhalo is far from dead, it turns out. The company, focused on live audio for, well, live events just closed a Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/carto-raises-61-million-to-help-you-visualize-data-on-maps/"><strong>Mapping data is big business:</strong></a> If you go back into the depths of startup time, there was once this big moment for “mashups.” The idea was to take two data sets and smush them together. This led to sites like Mashable — get it? — being formed. The mashup movement wound up subsumed into other tech work. Or was it? Carto just raised a $61 million Series C for what TechCrunch describes as helping companies display “data on interactive maps so that you can more easily compare, optimize, balance and make decisions.” Maps plus data? Sounds like a mashup.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/mesh-payments-racks-up-50m-to-help-corporate-users-manage-spend-and-payments/">Today’s Tiger round is Mesh Payments:</a> </strong>Helping companies manage their spend is a simply huge startup category. Ramp, Brex, Airbase and others are working on the issue in the United States, for example. International competitors abound as well. Today TechCrunch noted that Mesh Payments, another player in the space, just raised a $50 million round led by the ever-present Tiger.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/weather-focused-ibisa-raises-seed-round-to-back-its-microinsurance-solutions-for-low-income-small-farmers/"><strong>Luxembourg-based IBISA raises microround for microinsurance:</strong></a> I dig this one. Focused on providing coverage for “small farmers whose livelihoods might be affected by adverse climate events,” IBISA just raised about $1.7 million in a new capital round. The company, despite its European roots, focuses on developing markets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/fresha-a-business-platform-for-salons-spas-and-beauty-and-wellness-pros-extends-series-c-by-52-5m-at-a-640m-valuation/"><strong>Vertical SaaS remains an investable category:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In the wake of Squire raising successive rounds for its barbershop vertical SaaS play, we should not be shocked that Fresha has raised a $52.5 million round of capital today. The company sells software for the beauty and wellness industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, as we segue into today’s TechCrunch+ feature story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/"><strong>our own Ron Miller is not as convinced as some about the web3 hype</strong></a>. Others are more excited:</p>
<h2>7 investors discuss web3’s present and peer into its future</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re years away from web3 capturing major market share, and there are valid concerns that its complexity will daunt consumers and regulators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, our research indicated that the investment landscape is growing increasingly competitive as venture capitalists become more educated and less skeptical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a clearer sense of where the market is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/7-investors-discuss-web3s-present-and-peer-into-its-future/">we reached out to several active investors</a> to find out where web3 stands and what the future holds:</span></p>

We’d normally make some jokes here about the tech required to view images on computers, but we don’t want to get into a Twitter war with Bored Ape fans.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/snap-paid-250-million-to-creators-on-its-tiktok-clone-this-year/"><strong>Snap paid out a quarter billion this year to support its TikTok clone:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Snap’s Snapchat service is an interesting social product to watch. It has never given up on its slight angle on the social world, and its parent company has not been shy in using its capital resources — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/06/snap-looks-to-raise-1-billion-in-private-debt-offering/">the company raised debt some years ago</a> — to keep the platform well stocked. Today the company announced that it has paid creators $250 million to make content for Spotlight, which is similar to TikTok.</li>

Recall that Cash App is no longer owned by Square, it’s owned by <em>Block</em>, its newly rebranded parent company.</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/struggling-to-win-subscribers-netflix-cuts-prices-in-india/"><strong>Netflix cuts prices in India:</strong></a><strong> </strong>We’ve noted in this missive that Netflix is getting into the games business. Why? Because there are only so many people with enough money and internet access out there for Netflix to sell streaming services to. Evidence of the company starting to bump up against its natural market size is that the American streaming service is cutting prices in India. As our own Manish Singh notes, this is not the first time that the company has tinkered with its pricing in the country.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All good things come to those who wait, and Porsche has reserved the most powerful version of its all-electric Taycan for last: the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and the wagon-style Taycan GTS Sport Turismo.</p>
<p>For those who want power, refined and sporty driving, and the ability to forgo gasoline for an all-electric powertrain, the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo both offer a solid blend of high-tech and powerful performance, which TechCrunch had a chance to test recently. GTS now comes in every model line Porsche offers, and the 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo round out a total of 10 different Porsche Taycan offerings.</p>
<p>The upshot: The Sport Turismo GTS and its sedan sibling should be the benchmark for any luxury automaker trying to attract customers who want to make the transition from internal combustion to all-electric as smooth, seamless and reliable as possible. The drawback of course is that being a luxury vehicle puts the Taycan — and its many variants — out of reach for most people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246933" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before Porsche purists sharpen their knives about how the Taycan and its variants aren&#8217;t &#8220;true Porsches,&#8221; they might consider how the EV has resonated with consumers. The electric vehicle, first announced in 2019, has been a tremendous sales success for the company. Porsche <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increase-deliveries-quarter-3-2021-26063.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold 28,640 Taycan vehicles</a> in the January-to-September period of 2021, outselling its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/porsches-all-electric-taycan-outsells-its-flagship-911-sports-car/">flagship 911 sports car</a> as well as the Panamera, 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman vehicles. (Porsche&#8217;s two most popular vehicles, the Cayenne and Macan, still outpaced the Taycan in sales.)</p>
<p>While the Taycan doesn&#8217;t come close to the number of Tesla Model 3 and Y sales reported this year, it has, so far, outstripped Tesla&#8217;s Model S and X sales. Tesla reports show that the company has delivered 13,214 Model S and Xs <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update.pdf%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through the end of the third quarter</a>.</p>
<p>The sales numbers suggest that Porsche&#8217;s $1 billion investment in the development of the Taycan have paid off. My time in these two latest and last variants verify that those development dollars were well spent. The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo are a sports sedan and wagon to be reckoned with.</p>
<h2>On the road with the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</h2>
<p>Porsche unveiled the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo GTS</a> at an event prior to the LA Auto show a few weeks ago, and we got seat time in both vehicles just after the unveiling in and around the Los Angeles area.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Taycan GTS and GTS Sport Turismo sit below the line-topping 670-horsepower Turbo variant. Porsche says that Taycan GTS can accelerate from 0-60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds thanks to its 590-horsepower and 626 pound-ft of torque coming from a pair of permanent magnet synchronous motors at the front and rear of the car. That means that both variants of the GTS are all-wheel drive, though during normal driving, the balance of power is pushed down through the rear wheels.</p>
<p>That rear motor comes from the Porsche Taycan Turbo, and Porsche says that this makes the GTS more agile and responsive on the road.</p>
<p>The motors are powered by a 93.4 kWh battery pack on 800-volt architecture, in both vehicles. That allows the vehicle to fast charge from 5% battery power up to 80% in just 22 minutes, which we got to try out at a DC fast charger in a local Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>I drove a bright red Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from downtown Los Angeles to Willow Springs (a one-way trip of around 90 miles) and back across the winding Angeles Crest Highway and Lake Hughes Road and back to downtown.</p>
<p>The heavier wagon-style GTS Sport Turismo never belied that it had that big ol&#8217; backside hanging out. Agile, responsive, and comfortable in the variety of modes that ranged from the electron-sipping Range setting to Normal, Sport, Sport + and Individual, the GTS Sport Turismo is a luxurious and mighty powerful electric wagon.</p>

<p>Whether making a pass on a two-lane highway near Willow Springs or winding it over the sun-beaten concrete on the Crest, the GTS Sport Turismo lives up to its Porsche-touted moniker as the &#8220;sweet spot,&#8221; between the lower 4S and the top-of-the-line Turbo &#8212; and it&#8217;s specifically geared for those who want a sports car feel in an all-electric people hauler.</p>
<p>Porsche recalibrated the Porsche Active Suspension Management System, retuned the chassis, added an optional rear-steering system and adaptive anti-roll bars in the car we drove. In addition to this, the Taycan GTS and its wagon-y cousin get a new, optional, trick sunroof that goes from opaque to various stages of staggered panels, to clear, with the touch of a button. The roof is actually made of two panes of glass with liquid crystal nestled between, which creates a UV-blocking grey panel when fully activated or closed.</p>
<h2>At the track with the Porsche Taycan GTS</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2247005" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2247005" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2247005 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg" alt="porsche taycan gts electric vehicle willow springs" width="1600" height="812" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=1536,780 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/porsche-taycan-gts-abigail.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2247005" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Bassett</p></div></p>
<p>More than likely, most Taycan GTS buyers won&#8217;t ever track their sedan, but, for that very small handful of people who do, there&#8217;s plenty to be impressed with. The Taycan GTS sedan still offers ample room for four passengers and all the bells and whistles of the Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, without the hatchback styling. Instead of hauling a wagon around the track at Big Willow, which honestly, sounds like a blast, I climbed into a Taycan GTS sedan for a 30-minute lead-follow stint.</p>
<p>The Taycan GTS comes with Porsche&#8217;s Track Precision app, which integrates with the new PCM 6.0 system in the car. Connect the app on your phone to the car and you can get detailed, real-time data on speeds, braking force, accelerator and brake input, and other information about just how you&#8217;re driving on the track. Mount your phone on your windshield and you&#8217;ll get the added bonus of a first-person POV video of the track that the app maps to everything from throttle input to steering angle and brake pressure.</p>
<p>Willow Springs is a notoriously gnarly track both because of its age and its sans-landmark, off-camber turns. On the track, the Taycan GTS remained firmly planted as I rocketed up to 120 mph on the front straight. Larger front brakes on the Taycan GTS (the same on the Sport Turismo) helped quickly haul the electric sedan down to more manageable speeds for the series of turns that run up the hill to a blind but sweeping left-hand turn and the vehicle felt connected and precise.</p>
<p>To say that the Taycan GTS is quick is an understatement. I drove Big Willow for the first time in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/lamborghini-huracan-sto-a-final-celebration-before-electrification/">Lamborghini Huracán STO</a> back in September. I don&#8217;t proclaim to be a race car driver, but, for context, my Porsche app-recorded lap time in the Taycan GTS sedan was only four seconds off of my best time in the STO &#8212; and that vehicle is specifically made for the race track. Suffice it to say, the Taycan GTS hauls on a closed course.</p>
<h2>Charging the Porsche Taycan GTS Sport Turismo</h2>

<p>Once our track time was over, I climbed back into the GTS Sport Turismo for the slog back to downtown Los Angeles. When I set out from the hotel that foggy Saturday morning, I started out with a fully charged battery and a range of 235 miles.</p>
<p>By the time we got to Willow Springs, after some spirited highway and canyon driving, the vehicle had around 130 miles of range left. The route was around 90 miles in total (one way) and I spent most of the drive toggling the wheel on the Race-Tex wrapped steering wheel, between Range, Sport + and Individual settings. These settings adjust the suspension, power and steering feel, and even the synthetic &#8220;engine sound&#8221; you hear on the Taycan GTS. The Individual setting, where I could separately set the steering feel and the ride to my liking, was my favorite.</p>
<p>Los Angeles traffic is perpetual, which can pose a challenge for some electric vehicles and their range. I stopped at a Porsche-appointed stopover to charge the Taycan GTS at one of the public Electrify America chargers in Burbank with around 70 miles of range left.</p>
<p>On a Saturday night, the place was absolutely packed with shoppers and EV chargers alike. There was only one DC fast charger, and according to the Porsche rep manning the charger to help journalists plug in, it had been out of service almost all day. When I arrived a Ford Mustang Mach-E was charging at the spot, so I pulled into one of the others that were vacant. To no EV owner&#8217;s surprise, the charger wouldn&#8217;t initiate for my GTS Sport Turismo. I tried three other chargers in the row, before finally returning to the DC fast charger, which, miraculously, connected and quickly charged my Taycan GTS Sport Turismo from 25% to 80% in just 20 minutes.</p>
<p>While this was a problem specific to the Electrify America charger, not Porsche, it is indirectly a problem for any automaker counting on this network of DC fast chargers to help it compete with Tesla and its proprietary Supercharger network. The Electrify America chargers at that location continually failed to recognize the vehicle I was driving. When other journalists showed up to charge, they too, had a similar issue and we all got to play charger leapfrog with a handful of electric motorcycles and cars to find a charger that would work.</p>
<h2>User experience</h2>
<p>While the charging infrastructure still needs a lot of work, the good news is that Porsche has made locating those chargers in its navigation system far easier than other electric automakers (with the exception of Tesla).</p>
<p>There are three different ways to find available chargers in the system. You can use the capable voice recognition to ask for local chargers, which will then pop up on the navigation system for you choose. You can also use the touchscreen to set search parameters (including the brand of EV charger and speed of charge) to search for chargers nearby.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the Porsche app or the navigation in the infotainment system to set a route and the system will automatically find chargers along the route based on how much charge you want to have left when you arrive at your destination. The vehicles I drove were European-spec so I wasn&#8217;t able to try this setup myself, but one of the sedans at the track had some limited U.S-features available and a Porsche spokesperson walked me through the process.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to access these features via the center screen, Porsche&#8217;s new infotainment screen stretches across to the passenger side of the car and allows passengers to search for chargers, change stereo inputs and stations, and navigate (amongst other things) while the vehicle is under way. Most automakers lock out access to these features in their vehicles both from the driver and passenger seats when they&#8217;re moving, a &#8220;feature,&#8221; that&#8217;s absolutely infuriating when actively trying to navigate or find locations while moving. It&#8217;s not so in the Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, since both the driver and passenger can still interact with numerous features on the infotainment system while the vehicle is rolling.</p>
<p>The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS and Taycan GTS Sport Turismo will be delivered to customers willing to shell out for the $110,000+ price tag by Q2 of 2022. Pricing starts at $131,400 (plus $1,350 for delivery) for the sedan and $133,300 for the Sport Turismo. And in true Porsche style, nearly everything can be customized to your liking. Both offer plenty of performance and style for the proverbial buck in sleek, sleeper packaging that offers a solid balance of technology and refinement for the enthusiast and their passengers.</p>
<p>The 2022 Porsche Taycan GTS, in any form, is truly an electric vehicle to be reckoned with.</p>
