</div><p id="speakable-summary">The rush of founders and investors from the West Coast to states like Texas and Florida are the precursor for something bigger, a movement decades in the making.</p>
<p>The future of startups is a decentralized, global ecosystem. Where wealth and knowledge isn’t concentrated, but shared and open. Where there aren’t capitals, but networks.</p>
<p>Miami has had a head start.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let’s set the scene. Miami already <a href="https://startupgenome.com/ecosystems/miami">ranks</a> among the world’s most prominent (nontraditional) startup hubs, and 2020 saw <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-miami-is-the-next-hot-tech-hub/">more big names in tech</a> migrate to Florida. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has been spurring on the influx with an extremely popular Twitter campaign.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Miami already ranks among the world’s most prominent (nontraditional) startup hubs, and 2020 saw more big names in tech migrate to Florida.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These are signs of what globally minded business savvies already know is true. The world is ready for Miami as the pioneer of future tech hubs. Because the city isn’t just a launching pad for U.S. startups with interests in Latin America. It’s a strategic landing pad for global startups who want a presence in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Across the globe, international opportunities for founders are growing: There is greater connectivity and greater potential for emerging market entrepreneurs to produce life-changing products.</p>
<p>Where will those entrepreneurs want to have a presence? At the heart of global investor and entrepreneur networks, in true melting pots, and at crossroads between mature and emerging markets.</p>
<p>That’s why Miami is in focus right now, but it’s only the first of many cities that will soon be a part of this global trend.</p>
<p>Here’s why Miami is spearheading this new global grid of startup ecosystems.</p>
<h2>1. Global tech is no longer concentrated — it’s fragmented across the world</h2>
<p>Two-thirds of the world&#8217;s top startup ecosystems are <a href="https://startupgenome.com/article/state-of-the-global-startup-economy">outside of North America</a>. Not only that, but <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/silicon-valley-exodus-the-majority-of-professionals-said-theyd-follow-tech-leaders-to-emerging-tech-hubs/">70% of professionals</a> believe that technology power is dispersing away from Silicon Valley. The Bloomberg Innovation Index <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/20/texas-silicon-valley-austin-tech-workers">bumped</a> the United States down from top spot in 2013, to No. 9 in 2020. Tech knowledge and power is growing in Europe and Asia, flourishing in cities like Shanghai and Berlin.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/12/28/nine-predictions-of-whats-coming-in-startupland.html">microbusinesses</a> will increase (we’re already seeing a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3cbb0bcd-d7dc-47bb-97d8-e31fe80398fb">surge in new businesses</a> being created around the world), and less of them will have zip codes.</p>
<p>So, when big businesses or VC firms leave/explore outside Silicon Valley, or the United States entirely, they’re not building more of the same, they’re showing us that Silicon Valley is no longer the only M.O. The emerging M.O. is borderless and connected: an inclusive network. It gives investors greater access to more distant business opportunities. It allows entrepreneurs to choose the most convenient place to build a company — and save huge amounts of overhead — while also sharing more expertise.</p>

<h2>2. You can build global companies from emerging hubs</h2>
<p>Startups in emerging markets have always received a mere fraction of the funding available to U.S. startups. Which means that when money dries up across the board, they are under even more pressure to come up with the most innovative solutions just to survive.</p>
<p>Empowering these local entrepreneurs is the fact that today’s problems need local solutions — from health to logistics, these verticals all require inherent knowledge of domestic infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>The potential here is huge. Emerging markets house the greatest world populations — China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria… — and language and connectivity barriers are slowly melting away, with mobile internet use <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/02/05/digital-connectivity-growing-rapidly-in-emerging-economies/">surging</a>.</p>
<p>Investors are <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8bc4a5a0-d5dd-437e-8cea-b737746d57f6">already perking up</a> to the enormous value of emerging markets, from Asia to Latin America, especially as the strength of the U.S. dollar drops. Just in Q4 2020, VC investment in Latin America saw a 93% growth over Q4 2019, according to Pitchbook.</p>
<p>What does this mean for emerging tech hubs? First, there will be more of them, more distributed and with more funding. Second, we’re going to see a stronger flow of emerging market startups serving customers in the United States to offer services with proven traction, rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>The disruptive products these companies develop and test on millions of users back home find fertile markets not only in the United States, but in other emerging markets with similar needs. Many such companies will want to use the United States as a strategic operating base while keeping the engineering teams in their HQs.</p>
<p>That’s because our founders, accelerators, investors and support organizations have historic experience in internationalization, as well as connections across the globe. So where will these foreign companies land — will they be interested in Denver or Austin, or rather a well-connected city that has made a name for itself as an international hub?</p>
<p>Miami is a landing pad where foreign startups can access both the United States and emerging markets with comparable trends. The <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article248220415.html">city has made strides</a> to position itself at the intersection between mature and emerging markets, creating an ecosystem that is inclusive (half of the population is foreign-born), prioritizes collaboration over individualism and encourages the arrival of newcomers. As such, it will be a (working) model for diverse startup cities.</p>
<h2>3. The money will follow</h2>
<p>Amid talks of a Silicon Valley &#8220;exodus,&#8221; some have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/opinion/silicon-valley-exodus.html">quick to point out</a> that the hub has always held strong because of a key feature: access to capital.</p>
<p>But investors will follow the best opportunities. Which means that tech investment will only become more global. Put simply, the concentration of wealth in Silicon Valley is incompatible with the growing demand for tech across the globe. Silicon Valley isn’t going to die, but the pie is getting bigger. And more of that capital is already going to emerging tech hubs.</p>
<p>The symptoms include U.S. VC giants branching into emerging regions — like Sequoia opening its first <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/11/17/vc-firm-sequoia-puts-down-roots-in-europe-startup-scene/?sh=71148aeb5eac">European office</a>, and SoftBank funneling <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190307005336/en/SoftBank-Group-Corp.-Announces-Launch-New-5">billions</a> into Latin America.</p>
<p>This means U.S. investors will favor regions where they can easily connect with global opportunities, like Miami. Last year, VC investment in the Miami region rose to over <a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/the-year-in-vc-part-2-top-vc-deals-in-2020-for-south-florida-and-more/">$2.2 billion</a>, despite the pandemic (compared to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/hot-or-not-where-european-vc-funding-went-in-2020">$1.4 billion</a> in all of Spain). But not only that — there is a lot of funding coming from investors in emerging markets.</p>
<p>In Latin America, local funders play a huge role in supporting promising companies. In 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/report-vc-funding-in-latin-america-more-than-doubles-to-4-6b-in-2019/">almost 40%</a> of the record-breaking $4.6 billion VC dollars invested in Latin America involved a co-investment with at least one Latin American investor. And from what we&#8217;re seeing, regional investors are increasingly funding U.S.-based organizations.</p>
<p>They — and others like them — will want to find ecosystems where they can connect with local and foreign founders with whom they can foster partnerships across markets.</p>
<p>Places like Miami need to house these kinds of networks. South Florida already has globally minded accelerators and startup programs like <a href="https://www.miami.500.co/">500 Startups</a>, Plug &amp; Play and TheVentureCity; and VC firms with international networks, such as Ocean Azul, Endeavor Catalyst, Starlight Ventures, Level VC and now <a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/boom-softbank-launching-100m-fund-to-invest-in-miami-startups/">SoftBank</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Miami is better positioned for the future needs of startups</h2>
<p>I’m going to end by underscoring the case for Miami as the U.S. pioneer of international connector startup hubs.</p>
<p>Startups build more with less every five years, and going international from day one, allows them to test their products in more markets straight away. This is feasible given worldwide level of connectivity, and helps to be in an environment that is constantly looking outward, beyond our borders.</p>
<p>It also helps to be in a time zone that is shared by much of South America and is only five hours behind London (San Francisco is only in the same time zone as the rest of the United States and Vancouver).</p>
<p>People who uproot their entire lives to seek success elsewhere want to be welcomed. They appreciate that the mayor of the city is happy to meet them for a “cafecito,” and that other founders are genuinely enthusiastic at their arrival. They don’t want to land in an expensive city where making it big tends to require connections, money and background.</p>
<p>Miami is reflective of the future of global startup hubs. It won’t be the next Silicon Valley, because we don’t need another one. As the entrepreneurial world flourishes in every corner of the globe, emerging market companies will be conquering markets across the United States and Europe, and fortress cities will make way for international networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Events &#8212; when they haven&#8217;t been cancelled altogether in the last 12 months due to the global health pandemic &#8212; have gone virtual and online, and a wave of startups that are helping people create and participate in those experiences are seeing a surge of attention, and funding.</p>
<p>In the latest development, New York video startup <a href="http://touchcast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TouchCast</a> &#8212; which has developed a platform aimed at companies to produce lifelike, virtual conferences and other events without much technical heavy-lifting &#8212; has picked up funding of $55 million, money that co-founder and CEO Edo Segal said the startup will use to build out its services and teams after being &#8220;overrun by demand&#8221; in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by a strategic investor, Accenture Ventures &#8212; the investment arm of the systems integrator and consultancy behemoth &#8212; with Alexander Capital Ventures, Saatchi Invest, Ronald Lauder and other unnamed investors also participating. The startup up to now has been largely self-funded, and while Segal isn&#8217;t disclosing the valuation he said it was definitely in the 9-figures (that is, somewhere in the large region of hundreds of millions of dollars).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Accenture has been using TouchCast&#8217;s technology for its own events, but that is likely just one part of its interest: Accenture also has a lot of corporate customers that tap it to build and implement interactive services, so potentially this could lead to more customers into TouchCast&#8217;s pipeline.</p>
<p>(Case in point: my interview with Segal, over Zoom, found me speaking to him in the middle of a vast aircraft hangar, with a 747 from one of the big airlines of the world &#8212; I won&#8217;t say which &#8212; parked behind him. He said he&#8217;d just come from a business pitch with the airline in question.)</p>
<p>A lot of what we have seen in virtual events, and in particular conferences, has to date has been, effectively, a managed version of a group call on one of the established videoconferencing platforms like Zoom, Google&#8217;s Hangout, Microsoft&#8217;s Teams, Webex, and so on.</p>
<p>You get a screen with participants&#8217; individual video streams presented to you in a grid more reminiscent of the opening credits of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzODEdkypdg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brady Bunch</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW0DNGn3FNY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Squares</a> than an actual stage or venue.</p>
<p>There are some, of course, who are taking a much different route. Witness Apple&#8217;s online events in the last year, productions that have elevated what a virtual event can mean, with more detail and information, and less awkwardness, than an actual live event.</p>
<p>The problem is that not every company is Apple, able to afford much less execute Hollywood-level presentations.</p>
<p>The essence of what TouchCast has built, as Segal describes it, is a platform the combines computer vision, video streaming technology and natural language processing to let other organizations create experiences that are closer to that of the iPhone giant&#8217;s than they are to a game show.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a platform so that all companies can create events like Apple&#8217;s,&#8221; Segal said. &#8220;We&#8217;re taking them on a journey beyond people sitting in their home offices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet home office remains the operative phrase: people (the organizers and the on-stage participants) still use basic videoconferencing solutions like Zoom and Teams &#8212; in their homes, even &#8212; but at the back end, TouchCast is taking those videos, using computer vision to trim out the people and place them into virtual &#8220;venues&#8221; so that they appear as if they are on stage in an actual conference.</p>
<p>These venues come from a selection of templates, or the organiser can arrange for a specific venue to be shot and used. In addition to the actual event, TouchCast then also provides tools for audience members to participate with questions and to chat to each other. As the event is progressing, TouchCast also produces transcriptions and summaries of the key points for those who want them.</p>
<p>And while Segal said that TouchCast is not planning to make this a consumer-focused product, not even on the B2B2C side, it&#8217;s preparing a service so that when business conference organisers <em>do</em> want to hold a music segment with a special guest, those can be incorporated, too.</p>
<p>TouchCast&#8217;s growth into a startup serving an audience of hungry event planners has been an interesting pivot that is a reminder to founders (and investors) that the right opportunities might not be the ones you think they are.</p>
<p>You might recall that the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/co-founded-by-former-tc-editor-erick-schonfeld-touchcast-aims-to-reinvent-online-video-using-interactive-apps/?_ga=2.84357137.907098425.1612175151-209244718.1579131500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first came out of stealth back in 2013</a>, with former TechCrunch editor Erick Schonfeld one of the co-founders.</p>
<p>Back then, the company&#8217;s concept was to supercharge online video, by making it easier for creators to build in interactive elements and other media into their work, to essentially make videos closer to the kind of interactivity and media mix that we find on webpages themselves.</p>
<p>All that might have been too clever by half. Or, it was simply not the right time for that technology. The service never made many waves at all, and one of my colleagues even assumed it had deadpooled at some point.</p>
<p>Not at all, it turns out. Segal (a serial entrepreneur who also used to work at AOL as VP of emerging platforms &#8212; AOL being the company that acquired TechCrunch and eventually became a part of Verizon) notes that the technology that TouchCast is using for its conferencing solution is essentially the same as what it built for its original video product.</p>
<p>After launching an earlier, less feature-rich version of what it has on the market today, it took the company about six months to retool it, adding in more mixed reality customization via the use of Unreal Engine, to make it what it is today, and to meet the demand it started to see from customers, who approached the startup after attending events held by others using TouchCast.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took us eight years to get to our overnight success story,&#8221; Segal joked.</p>
<p>Figures from Grand View Research cited by TouchCast estimate that virtual events will be a $400 billion business by 2027, and that has made for a pretty large array of companies building out experiences that will make those events worth attending, and putting on.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hopin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bizzabo</a> &#8212; both of which have recently also raised big rounds &#8212; but also more enhanced services from the big, established players in videoconferencing like Zoom, Google, Microsoft, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cisco-acquires-slido-to-improve-qa-polls-and-engagement-in-webex-videoconferencing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco</a> and more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise to see Accenture throwing its hat into that ring as a backer of what it&#8217;s decided is one of the more interesting technology players in that mix. The reason is because many understand and now accept that &#8212; similar to working in general &#8212; it&#8217;s very likely that even when we do return to &#8220;live&#8221; events, the virtual component, and the expectation that it will work well and be compelling enough to watch, is here to stay.</p>
<p>“Digital disruption, distributed workforces, and customer experience are the driving forces behind the need for companies to transform how they do business and move toward the future of work,&#8221; said Tom Lounibos, managing director, Accenture Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;For organizations to harness the power of virtual experiences to deliver business impact, the pandemic has shown that quality interactions and insights are needed. Our investment in Touchcast demonstrates our commitment to identifying the latest technologies that help address our clients’ critical business needs.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re at all interested in wine, chances are you&#8217;ve turned to <a href="https://www.vivino.com/">Vivino</a> at least a few times for recommendations. The app and the company behind it have been helping people enjoy better wine since 2010, and now the startup has raised $155 million with its Series D round – a sum over twice as large as all of its previous funding to date. Spurred by rapid growth that has seen its user base grow from 29 million in 2018, to 50 million currently, Vivino wants to use the large cash injection to significantly boost its core tech and personalized recommendation engine, while also expanding its presence in key growth markets globally.</p>
<p>Vivino is an interesting company for many reasons, but chief among them might be just how similar its vision today is to the one it started out with. Founder and CEO Heini Zachariassen told me in an interview that the app has been remarkably immune to the pivot – something as natural as breathing in the fast-flowing startup world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can look at my slide, from when I pitched this 10 years ago,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;It says, &#8216;Hey, you scan a bottle of wine, then you can buy it.&#8217; That just makes a lot of sense to anybody, so it really hasn&#8217;t changed much.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very, very difficult to build much – much harder to build than building that slide,&#8221; he joked. But it&#8217;s always been the same – we always knew that was going to be the model.&#8221;</p>
<p>That core value proposition is what leads to a lot of Vivino&#8217;s initial downloads and subsequent usage. The scenario is likely familiar: You&#8217;re sitting in a restaurant and browsing the wine menu, or staring at a crowded shelf in a wine store. For myself, I think I likely searched for something like &#8216;wine recommendation app&#8217; and found Vivino via the App Store, installed it and was snapping photos of labels or menus within minutes. The recommendations provided somewhere to start, and since then the app has grown more personalized as I&#8217;ve provided input about my tastes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107739" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2107739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="783" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg 2720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=768,587 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=680,520 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=1536,1175 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=2048,1566 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-vivino-press-kit-product-shots-trio.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vivino</p></div></p>
<p>Vivino&#8217;s marketplace component means you can often buy the wines you find and enjoy directly from the app, via partnerships the company fosters and maintains with merchants large and small around the world. Zachariassen explained that they strive to maintain high standards when it comes to these partners, since the experience a user has with them is largely a reflection on Vivino itself because the app provides the means for the purchase.</p>
<p>Building more relationships with more merchants in more geographies is one part of their expansion goal for addressing their primary growth markets, but the company is also going to put a lot more capital behind improving and extending its recommendation engine. A lot of the building blocks are in place to make big improvements there, not least of which is the wine database that Vivino spent a decade building essentially from zero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stage one of the hurdles we faced, even before we got commercial, was really building the data,&#8221; Zachariassen told me. &#8220;There is no aggregated data anywhere. So we&#8217;ve basically built this data totally from scratch. So it means taking a picture of bottle of wine, then having people just entering info every single day to fill it. We have 1.5 billion pictures of wine labels right now, so building that mass of data in a good and structured way really is 10 years of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that wine is a particularly long-tail marketplace, with highly individual tastes and very little indication in the company&#8217;s history that that&#8217;s likely to change in any significant way. Vivino&#8217;s marketplace approach, which is highly local on both the supply and the demand side, is particularly well-suited to addressing the sector&#8217;s needs, and Zachariassen believes Vivino has only really begun to scratch the surface on that thus far. I asked him why now was the right time to take on this sizeable round, given they&#8217;ve been very modest with prior funding amounts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we we&#8217;ve reached sort of a critical mass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We saw last year massive growth, and actually reaching [&#8230;] like a quarter of a billion dollars in sales, and we&#8217;ve really seen that the unit economics are healthy for us. At the same time, unlike other marketplaces – you know, the order of things when you have a marketplace might be if you&#8217;re like Uber, is that you go into market, you spend money, do marketing, a lot of money to build up the demand, and then you build the supply on top. We&#8217;re a little bit different in the way that demand is already there, because we have 50 million users around the world. So we just follow our demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the hardest thing about that is that we&#8217;re now a 200 person company that sells wine in 17 countries,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Which means we&#8217;re relatively thin in all these markets. So so one of the big things here, is actually to go much deeper in each market and say, okay, we now know it works here, let&#8217;s put more resources in every single market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zachariassen also added that the company spends very little on marketing to date, so it&#8217;s going to begin spending more on that to extend its organic growth. Finally, it wants to really build out product engineering, since he says that while users love the existing app, they really &#8220;want to do so much more with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vivino has worked to modernize a product category that has long relied on local expertise and individual storehouses of highly-specific information, with an approach that provides all the benefits of a connected and global marketplace, while retaining regional and particular appeal at the granola level of the individual user. Now, the company is read to tap the rest of the massive submerged demand it has identified, and this fresh fundings would help it do just that.</p>
<p>The $155 million series D round was led by Sweden&#8217;s Kinnevik, and also includes participation by Sprints Capital, GP BullHound, and existing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/vivino-raises-1m-from-creandum-for-mobile-wine-cellar/">investor Creandum which led its Series A</a>. This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $221 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grocery delivery startup <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/">Good Eggs</a> is announcing that it has raised $100 million in new funding, and that it&#8217;s planning to launch in Southern California in either the summer or fall of this year.</p>
<p>Parts of this story might sound familiar to readers familiar with Good Eggs — when the startup raised its most recent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/15/good-eggs-funding/">$50 million funding round</a> in 2018, CEO Bentley Hall also mentioned plans for geographic expansion.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that the company has found plenty of opportunity for growth while remaining focused on the San Francisco Bay Area. Good Eggs says that in the past year, revenue has grown to the nine figures (more than $100 million), hired more than 400 employees and nearly doubled its customer base.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hall also noted that the company opened a new, larger warehouse in Oakland just a few days before shelter-in-place orders took effect last March. So the team was busy enough trying to operate a new warehouse, meet increased demand for grocery delivery and keep workers safe in the process.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107602" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107602" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2107602" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?w=490" alt="Good Eggs box" width="490" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=108,150 108w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=216,300 216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=768,1067 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=490,680 490w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Good_Eggs_Box.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Good Eggs</p></div></p>
<p>And while the grocery delivery market has become increasingly competitive, Hall argued that Good Eggs stands out thanks to the quality and breadth of its products — 70% of its products are locally sourced, and it often delivers them within 48 hours of harvesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s lots of people offering groceries, meal kits, prepared meals, alcohol — we do all of that, with a certain sourcing criteria,&#8221; Hall said. As a result, Good Eggs has become the &#8220;primary source&#8221; for many of its consumers, representing 65% to 85% of their home food purchases.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that this represents a bit of a turnaround for the company, after the it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/05/good-eggs-layoffs/">shut down operations</a> in Los Angeles, New York City and New Orleans in 2015, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/01/good-eggs-has-a-new-ceo/">Hall coming on as CEO</a> shortly afterwards. And it sounds like he isn&#8217;t in a rush to launch in a bunch of new markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of [Southern California] not as one big region, but as several small sub-regions,&#8221; Hall said. &#8220;There&#8217;s the LA region, northern San Diego, Orange County — those areas collectively are the size of two or three Bay Areas. That&#8217;s a meaningful increase in our addressable market.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107605" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107605" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?w=544" alt="Good Eggs CEO Bentley Hall" width="544" height="680" class="size-large wp-image-2107605" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bentley_Hall_1.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107605" class="wp-caption-text">Good Eggs CEO Bentley Hall</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding was led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, with participation from GV, Tao Invest, Finistere Ventures and Rich’s, as well as previous investors Benchmark Partners, Index Ventures, S2G, DNS Capital and Obvious Ventures. Glade Brook&#8217;s J.P. Van Arsdale is joining the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The grocery market is undergoing fundamental change and the shift to e-commerce and higher quality products and services is accelerating,&#8221; Van Arsdale said in a statement. &#8220;Good Eggs is experiencing rapid growth with strong unit economics and is well-positioned to become a category-defining leader. We are excited to partner with their team to help drive future growth and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to geographic expansion, Hall said the money will allow Good Eggs to continue adding new products and to find ways to improve the e-commerce experience.</p>
<p>In addition to the funding, Good Eggs is also announcing that it has hired Vineet Mehra as its chief growth and customer experience officer. Mehra was previously chief marketing officer and chief customer officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, and before that as executive vice president and global chief marketing and revenue officer at Ancestry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding, and retaining, frontline workers has likely never been as critical as it is in these pandemic days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.workstep.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a four-year-old startup that was founded with the mission of helping large supply chain employers do just that. The fully distributed company announced this morning that it has closed on a $10.5 million Series A round, building on top of a previously unannounced $6.7 million seed funding that included equity and a convertible note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstMark Capital led the Series A financing, which included participation from returning backer and strategic partner Prologist Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Johnston, co-founder and CEO of WorkStep, said the Employee Lifecycle Management (ELM) software platform was designed to not only help large supply chain employers source new frontline employers, but to also onboard, train, and keep them happier with the goal of them staying on board longer. Johnston experienced some of the challenges firsthand  when he managed a warehouse in Portland, Oregon, more than a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the importance of the work frontline employees do – from serving food to delivering packages. But with the increasing dependence on supply chain labor came record turnover, points out Johnston – leaving many companies understaffed and remaining workers stretched thin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep claims to provide human resources, recruiting and operations leaders “full transparency” across the employee lifecycle to help companies minimize that churn. The company had previously built out its cloud-based Hire<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> offering and then last fall, launched its Retain<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The pandemic has forced companies of all sizes to prioritize the health, safety and satisfaction of frontline teams,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers include hundreds of industrial, logistics, transportation and warehousing employers across North America –– including regional 3PLs (third-party logistics companies) and distribution centers, as well as 16 of the Fortune 500. Customers include grocery chain Kroger, Alpine Food Distributing and TransPak, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep says it has “reached” 500,000 supply chain workers over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep claims that its Retain offering reduced turnover by up to 29 percent for a Fortune 100 food &amp; beverage company with whom it conducted a <a href="https://www.workstep.com/case-study-fortune-100-fb-company">case study</a>. This saves companies money in replacement and retraining expenses, which can add up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of launching Retain last fall, according to Johnston, WorkStep saw its business more than double in the second half of 2020. This led the company to end the year as “bottom line profitable,&#8221; meaning that its revenue exceeded expenses in the last two months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while WorkStep did not necessarily need to take on new capital, the company saw an opportunity to double down so it could continue to scale, Johnston said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was an opportunistic round,” he told TechCrunch. “The turnover in this segment has become a core focus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep plans to use its new funding to more than double the size of its existing team of 14 employees across engineering, product, sales and customer success departments this year and triple it by the end of fiscal year 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FirstMark Capital’s </span><a href="https://firstmarkcap.com/team/adam-nelson/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Nelson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was in the room with the company during its first whiteboard sessions and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes WorkStep is addressing a &#8220;massive&#8221; opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think the real differentiator between WorkStep and the existing solutions in the space is that WorkStep doesn’t see temporary staffing/gig liquidity as a solution,” Nelson told TechCrunch. “They see it as a symptom of a multi-hundred billion dollar deadweight loss that’s created when employers aren’t able to find, train and retain the right people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WorkStep, he added, is addressing the full employee lifecycle and leveraging the data  “to give a voice to frontline workers while also making employers smarter and more proactive.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has issued a notice to Twitter, warning the American social firm to comply with New Delhi’s order to block accounts and content related to a protest by farmers and not “assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance.” Failure to comply with the order may prompt penal action against Twitter, the notice warns.</p>
<p>The warning comes days after Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">blocked dozens of high-profile accounts in India</a> in compliance with New Delhi’s request, but later lifted the restriction.</p>
<p>Twitter “cannot assume the role of a court and justify non-compliance. Twitter being an intermediary is obliged to obey the directions as per satisfaction of authorities as to which inflammatory content will arouse passion and impact public order. Twitter cannot sit as an appellate authority over the satisfaction of the authorities about its potential impact on derailing public order,” said the notice, a copy of its summary was reviewed by TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India’s IT ministry has also expressed concerns over what it deemed derogatory and factually incorrect tweets and hashtags that have been circulating in India this week that it said were designed to spread hate. &#8220;It is thus clear that, the offending tweets/ hashtag remained in public domain and must have been tweeted and re-tweeted several times at the risk and cost of public order and at the risk of incitement to the commission of offences,&#8221; the notice said.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment.</p>
<p>For more than three months, tens of thousands of farmers (if not more) in India and elsewhere have been protesting against three laws passed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s government last year that they say allow greater private sector competition.</p>
<p>Twitter, which reaches more than 75 million users through its apps in India, has emerged as the single-most important online forum for people seeking to voice their opinion on this matter. Singer Rihanna, who has more followers on Twitter than any Indian actor or politician, tweeted a CNN news story on Tuesday about the protests in India and asked &#8220;why are&#8217;t we talking about this!?</p>

<p>&#8220;You can choose to disagree, correct, ridicule, or engage with such fears, outcry. Seeking to ban &amp; precensor such discussions is a travesty of India&#8217;s Constitution + international human rights law. This is not what 21st Century India should permit, nor what our founders envisaged. The Ministry of Electronics and IT should release its actual orders and all documentation behind the Govt&#8217;s decisions to &#8211; (1) issue these orders and (2) press the matter with Twitter and other social media platforms. Don&#8217;t hide; explain &amp; justify how this is not unconstitutional.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Embedded finance &#8212; the idea of offering financial products where customers are already congregating via white label solutions and APIs &#8211; isn&#8217;t an entirely new concept. In fact, in one form or another, such as point of sale credit, the concept has existed for years and long before Silicon Valley venture capital firm and media company (ha!) Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/21/every-company-will-be-a-fintech-company/">made it a thing</a>. However, fuelled by cloud technology and a plethora of new fintech and Banking-as-a-Service startups, there is no doubt the embedded finance trend is accelerating.</p>
<p>The latest company to declare its hand is Berlin-based <a href="https://www.banxware.com/">Banxware</a>, which offers embedded finance in the form of loans for SMEs, in partnership with marketplaces, payments providers, and others. It launched in December and today is disclosing that it has raised €4 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is Force over Mass, and VR Ventures. They are joined by HTGF, and private investors in banking, payment and e-commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Banxware says it will use the investment to develop and grow its embedded white label financial services offering, and expand its team. In addition to lending, the startup will also soon offer card-based products and other financial services.</p>
<p>Banxware’s tech and infrastructure enables any company to offer loans and other banking services to SME customers. The idea is to act as the link between banks (lenders), digital platforms, and merchants. Banks get access to hard to reach SME customers. Platforms, such as online marketplaces, can up-sell financial products beyond their core offering. And merchants benefit from speedy access to working capital.</p>
<p>“SMEs have a hard time to access capital when needed, especially when they are less than three years old or do not have the most pristine credit history,” explains co-founder and CEO Jens Röhrborn. “On top of this, loan applications, i.e. loan decisions and loan payout, still take several weeks in most cases.</p>
<p>“More and more sellers and merchants are using digital platforms through which they sell their products or process their digital payments. By using the recent historic data on these merchants provided by the platforms, we can lend against their future revenues”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Oo47FW5pzb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/liberis-the-embedded-finance-provider-for-smes-raises-additional-70m-in-equity-and-debt/">Liberis, the embedded finance provider for SMEs, raises additional £70M in debt</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liberis, the embedded finance provider for SMEs, raises additional £70M in debt&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/liberis-the-embedded-finance-provider-for-smes-raises-additional-70m-in-equity-and-debt/embed/#?secret=Oo47FW5pzb" data-secret="Oo47FW5pzb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This has seen Banxware build an instant lending tool that includes AML and KYC compliance, and a scoring engine that analyzes historic platform data and data from third party providers, such as account information providers and external scoring services. The promise is an instant loan decision and loan payout, “all in less than 15 minutes”.</p>
<p>“On the lending side, we work with both balance sheet lenders and lending vehicles with whom we pre-agree on lending terms and loan decision criteria and on whose behalf we execute the loan decision,” says Röhrborn. “Merchants repay their loan in such a way that platforms subtract a certain percentage of the future merchant payouts”.</p>
<p>Röhrborn says the company&#8217;s instant lending tool is &#8220;only the beginning&#8221; and that Banxware will develop additional embedded financial services and expand internationally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the German fintech currently generates revenue by charging a one time fee for each loan that is processed through its platform and via a one off customization fee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing arm of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, became profitable for the first time in the December quarter, the company announced in its <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s cloud unit achieved positive adjusted EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) during the quarter, after being in business since 2009. The milestone is in part a result of the &#8220;realization of economies of scale,&#8221; Alibaba said.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud, which incorporates everything from database, storage, big data analytics, security, machine learning to IoT services, has dominated China&#8217;s cloud infrastructure market for the past few years and its market share worldwide continues to grow. As of 2019, the cloud behemoth was the third-largest public cloud company (providing infrastructure-as-a-service) in the world with a 9% market, trailing behind Amazon and Microsoft, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-admin/post-new.php">Gartner</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>COVID-19 has been a boon to cloud and digital adoption around the world as the virus forces offline activities online. For instance, Alibaba notes in its earnings that demand for digitalization in the restaurant and service industry remains strong in the post-COVID period in China, a trend that benefits its food delivery and on-demand services app, Ele.me. The firm&#8217;s cloud revenue grew to $2.47 billion in the December quarter, primarily driven by &#8220;robust growth in revenue from customers in the internet and retail industries and the public sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commerce remained Alibaba&#8217;s largest revenue driver in the quarter accounting for nearly 70% of revenue, while cloud contributed 7%.</p>
<p>Tencent&#8217;s cloud segment is Alibaba Cloud&#8217;s closest rival. As of 2019, it had a 2.8% market globally, according to Gartner. The industry in China still has ample room for growth, as Alibaba executive vice-chairman Joe Tsai pointed out in an analyst call from <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/alibaba-group-holding-ltd-baba-q1-2021-earnings-ca/">last August</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on the third-party studies that we&#8217;ve seen, the China cloud market is going to be somewhere in the $15 billion to $20 billion total size range, and the U.S. market is about eight times that. So the China market is still at a very early stage,&#8221; said Tsai.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel very good, very comfortable to be in the China market and just being an environment of faster digitization and faster growth of usage of cloud from enterprises because we&#8217;re growing from such a smaller base, about one-eighth the base of that of the U.S. market.&#8221;</p>
<p>A key strategy to grow Alibaba Cloud is the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/14/apple-remove-podcasts-in-china-alibaba-new-cloud-strategy/"> integration of cloud into Alibaba&#8217;s enterprise chat app Dingtalk</a>, which the company hopes can drive industries across the board onto cloud services. It’s a relationship that echoes that between Microsoft 365 and Azure, as president of Alibaba Cloud, Zhang Jianfeng, previously suggested in an <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/61159778">interview</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to just provide cloud in terms of infrastructure services,&#8221; said Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang in the August earnings call. &#8220;If we just do it as an infrastructure service, as SaaS services, then price competition is inevitable, and then all the cloud service is more like a commodity business. Today, Alibaba&#8217;s cloud is cloud plus intelligence services, and it&#8217;s about cloud plus the power of the data usage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eyelash extensions have taken off in recent years &#8212; particularly in Asia &#8212;  but the audience is only so broad. Getting extensions &#8212; semi-permanent fibers that are attached to one&#8217;s natural eyelashes &#8212; can require hundreds of dollars and hours in the seat of a lash stylist. There&#8217;s always the risk, too, of irritation or worse. Little wonder that, even accounting for low-budget lashes that can be applied at home, the market stands at around $2 billion, which is too small a market to capture the attention of most venture capitalists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.luumlash.com/">Luum</a>, a four-year-old, 15-person, Berkeley, Ca.-based robotics company, thinks it can change the math &#8212; and attract investment &#8212;  by &#8220;exponentially&#8221; expanding the market, says its CEO, Philippe Sanchez, who has overseen large chain businesses, including as a managing director for Starbucks in France.</p>
<p>The way forward, he says, is through robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, which Luum says it&#8217;s using to ultimately create a robot that that can apply lashes in 20 minutes and, if all goes as planned, will be widely available in beauty shops. More, because lash extensions need to be replaced every two to four weeks as the lashes fall, customers will come back again and again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Right now, there&#8217;s a bit of magical thinking involved, admits Sanchez. The tech currently relies on Epson industrial robots to which a variety of arms and sensors are attached, making it look a little like something you might see in the dentist&#8217;s office. The procedure of applying lashes has been tried out 100 times on 25 brave souls alone. The process currently takes as long as it would to apply lashes by hand, too, meaning a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Still, Luum, which has raised $10 million to date from Foundation Capital and others and is about to begin talking with investors about a Series A round, is convinced it has the right team to chase and grow what it sees as a big and underserved opportunity in the beauty space.</p>
<p>We talked with Sanchez yesterday afternoon about the company and its next steps. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you are targeting this popular treatment in what seems like a very fragmented industry.</strong></p>
<p>PS: It&#8217;s very popular and yet a little bit undiscovered and yes, it&#8217;s very fragmented. There are 34,000 lash extension services being offered right now in the U.S. alone, where you&#8217;ve got an artist coming over to you and selecting one lash extension at a time, dipping it in an adhesive, and gluing it to an existing lash, then waiting a few seconds to get the next one and the next one, and two hours later, you have amazing lashes that look extremely natural.</p>
<p>But these are individual lash artists. And we see this as a great opportunity to reinvent the category and take a service that&#8217;s already popular and make it even more popular with high-level execution and a new world-class brand.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So the idea is that you create a brand and develop a chain of walk-in centers around the country and world where these eyelashes will be robotically attached?</strong></p>
<p>PS: Correct. We want to leverage our technology to build our brand and launch a chain of studios, as well as to license the technology to people who already sell beauty services and products and and offer them a chance to either be much better at what they do if they are lash artists or, if you know, they have a hair salon or a large cosmetic retailer, they can [add lashes as an ancillary business]. They love the idea of returning customers having to come back every month for services, and lash extensions bring them back into their stores.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This obviously requires the same or better precision than human fingers, along with high safety requirements given this hardware is so near to someone&#8217;s eyes. How does the robot work right now?</strong></p>
<p>PS: The machine is pretty large and pretty soft and very advanced. There is a bed just like you would have in a first-class business flight. And the machine nearby that is about the size of a human, and so you lay in the bed and the machine work overs your face &#8212; you have a mask, just like if you were to do a manual extension &#8212; and it has a little robotic arm that does the job of a person but is much faster and more precise than any manual application. And it&#8217;s very safe. It&#8217;s got little prongs in the plastic at the end of these arms that are very light held by very light magnets because you need only a few grams of force to manipulate the lash.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So if there was any type of external event &#8212; an earthquake or something . . .</strong></p>
<p>PS:  . . . the arms literally fall because they&#8217;re held by these little very light magnets. If you you shake the machine or somebody sneezes, the arms will fall. It creates an environment that simply cannot hurt you, which is critical to the service itself.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you licensing anyone else&#8217;s tech or building everything in-house eventually?</strong></p>
<p>PS: It&#8217;s all built in house. We&#8217;re leveraging advanced robots from Epson that are very good at doing precise manipulation and that are fast. But [as for] IP in the beauty space, there was essentially no prior art, so we have secured a patent already in the U.S and Korea and Australia and [have] 25 patent cases around the world that are very broad and provide us with a moat and protection for the company at large.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much will these robots cost?</strong></p>
<p>PS: They will cost about $125,000 or so, but this one-time capital expense can boost productivity of labor by four or six times, so you&#8217;ve essentially increased the throughput of one bed, one lash artist, by six. And the machine lasts four to five years.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Plus other costs.</strong></p>
<p>PS: You will have maintenance costs, but it&#8217;s essentially pure margin. For most of those consumer service business, most of the cost goes goes into the labor. That was for my experience at Starbucks.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How far away are you from realizing this vision?</strong></p>
<p>PS: COVID [slowed us down], though we can conduct consumer tests again right now [as California reopens slightly], so we&#8217;re testing the machine, which is already able to deliver a simple style at about the speed of a human. And as we continue to develop and work over the next few months and get closer to opening our first studio,  the performance of the machines will increase to twice the speed and three times the speed and four times the speed of a human application.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You need more capital toward that end. How much are you looking to raise?</strong></p>
<p>PS: A $15 million Series A. That will allow us to open our first studio and validate the unit economic model, as well as to build our third-generation machine. The capital will also be deployed to start to build the foundation of a world class beauty brand.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who should investors know is on your team?</strong></p>
<p>PS: The company was founded by Nathan Harding, who also founded the [robotic exoskeleton pioneer] Ekso Bionics, and Kurt Amundson [who worked with Harding at Ekso Bionics for a decade]. They&#8217;ve got tremendous experience and expertise already in the world of advanced robotics, and also computer vision on the computer vision side.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s to keep a company like Dyson from jumping into this market if you&#8217;re able to prove there is one?</strong></p>
<p>PS: Some folks will realize that this is an attractive space and it&#8217;s worth looking at, but we&#8217;ve got a couple of years on them already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Time is critical for healthcare providers, especially in the middle of the pandemic. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.botmd.com/en/">Bot MD </a>helps save time with an AI-based chatbot that lets doctors look up important information from their smartphones, instead of needing to call a hospital operator or access its intranet. The startup announced today it has raised a $5 million Series A led by Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>Other backers include SeaX, XA Network and SG Innovate, and angel investors Yoh-Chie Lu, Jean-Luc Butel and Steve Blank. Bot MD was also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s summer 2018 batch.</p>

<p>The funding will be used to expand in the Asia-Pacific region, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, and to add new features in response to demand from hospitals and healthcare organizations during COVID-19. Bot MD’s AI assistant currently supports English, with plans to release Bahasa Indonesian and Spanish later this year. It is currently used by about 13,000 doctors at organizations including Changi General Hospital, National University Health System, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Parkway Radiology and the National Kidney Transplant Institute.</p>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Dorothea Koh told TechCrunch that Bot MD integrates hospital information usually stored in multiple systems and makes it easier to access.<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bot-MD_Radiology_Phone_1-e1612251270188.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2107101" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bot-MD_Radiology_Phone_1-e1612251270188.png?w=680" alt="A smartphone with Bot MDs medical AI assistant for doctors displayed on it" width="680" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>Image Credits: Bot MDWithout Bot MD, doctors may need to dial a hospital operator to find which staffers are on call and get their contact information. If they want drug information, that means another call to the pharmacy. If they need to see updated guidelines and clinical protocols, that often entails finding a computer that is connected to the hospital’s intranet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of what Bot MD does is to integrate the content that they need into a single interface that is searchable 24/7,&#8221; said Koh.</p>
<p>For example, during COVID-19, Bot MD introduced a new feature that takes healthcare providers to a form pre-filled with their information when they type &#8220;record temperature&#8221; into the chatbot. Many were accessing their organization&#8217;s intranet twice a day to log their temperature and Koh said being able to use the form through Bot MD has significantly improved compliance.</p>
<p>The time it takes to onboard Bot MD varies depending on the information systems and amount of content it needs to integrate, but Koh said its proprietary natural language processing chat engine makes training its AI relatively quick. For example, Changi General Hospital, a recent client, was onboarded in less than 10 days.</p>
<p>Bot MD plans to add new clinical apps to its platform, including ones for electronic medical records (EMR), billing and scheduling integrations, clinical alerts and chronic disease monitoring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you want to buy a refrigerator or a television, you can walk to the nearby electronics store or visit an e-commerce website like Amazon. But where do you go when you’re looking for parts of a crane, a door or chassis of different machines?</p>
<p>For several businesses globally, the answer to that question is increasingly <a href="https://www.zetwerk.com/">Zetwerk</a>, a Bangalore-based startup.</p>
<p>The three-year-old startup runs a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/zetwerk-b2b-manufacturing-items-india-seriesb/">business-to-business marketplace for manufacturing items</a> that connects OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and EPC (engineering procurement construction) customers with manufacturing small-businesses and enterprises.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All the products it sells today are custom-made. &#8220;Nobody has a stock of such inventories. You get the order, you find manufacturers and workshops that make them,&#8221; explained Amrit Acharya, co-founder and chief executive of Zetwerk, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Its customers &#8212; there are over 250 of them, up from 100 a year ago &#8212; operate across two-dozen industries (including process plants, oil &amp; gas, steel, aerospace, medical devices, apparel and luxury goods) in the infrastructure space, and approach Zetwerk with digital designs they wish to be translated into physical products.</p>
<p>Customers aren’t alone in seeing value in Zetwerk. On Wednesday, the Indian startup said it has raised $120 million in a Series D financing round led by existing investors Greenoaks Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Existing investors Sequoia Capital and Kae Capital also participated in the Series D round.</p>
<p>The new round, which brings Zetwerk’s to-date raise to $193 million, gives the firm a post-money valuation of somewhere between $600 million to $700 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. (A quick side note: Zetwerk announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/zetwerk-an-indian-b2b-marketplace-for-manufacturing-items-raises-21-million/">$21 million Series C round last year</a>, but ended up raising $31 million in that round.)</p>
<p>Zetwerk was co-founded by Acharya, Srinath Ramakkrushnan, Rahul Sharma and Vishal Chaudhary. Long before Acharya and Ramakkrushnan joined forces to tackle this space, they had been contemplating this idea.</p>
<p>Both of them studied at IIT Madras, went to the same exchange program in Singapore, and were colleagues at Kolkata-headquartered conglomerate ITC. While working there, they realized that part of a product manager’s job at the firm was dealing with gazillions of suppliers and the manufacturing items they offered.</p>
<p>The process was archaic: There were no databases, and people couldn’t track shipments.</p>
<p>The early version of Zetwerk, which was a database of suppliers, was a direct response to this. But after listening to requests from customers, the startup saw a bigger opportunity and transformed itself into a full-fledged marketplace with integrations with third-party vendors. Once a firm has placed an order, Zetwerk allows them to keep tabs on the progress of manufacturing and then the shipping. There are also quality checks in place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107640" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107640" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2107640 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="670" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=680,445 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/zetwerk-website.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107640" class="wp-caption-text">Zetwerk website</p></div></p>
<p>Zetwerk operates in such a unique space today &#8212; Shailesh Lakhani, managing director at Sequoia India, says the startup has defined a new category of marketplace &#8212; that by and large it’s not competing with any other firm in India &#8212; or South Asia. (The startup competes with domain project consultants in the offline world.)</p>
<p>The opportunity in India itself is gigantic. According to industry reports, manufacturing today accounts for 14% of India’s GDP. Vaibhav Agarwal, a partner at Lightspeed, estimates that the market is as large as $40 billion to $60 billion in India and global trade-tailwinds that creates opportunity to serve international demand.</p>
<p>As more and more companies expand or shift their manufacturing to India &#8212; in part due to import duties imposed by India and geo-political tension with China, the global hub for manufacturing &#8212; this opportunity has only grown bigger in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has a lot of depth in manufacturing, but much of it has not been tapped well,&#8221; said Acharya.</p>
<p>Zetwerk &#8212; which grew 3X last year and reported revenue of $43.9 million in the financial year that ended in March, a 20X growth from the year prior &#8212; plans to deploy the new capital to expand to more areas of categories, and broaden its technology stack. Consumer goods (which covers items such as mixer grinders and TVs) is an area Zetwerk expanded to last year, and said it accounts for 15% of the revenue it generated in the last six months.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Currently 25 of its customers are in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other international markets. Acharya said the startup plans to open offices overseas this year as it scouts for more international customers. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Zetwerk on the next leg of their journey, as they expand their value proposition globally. Zetwerk&#8217;s operating system for manufacturing has digitized multiple supply chains end-to-end, ensuring on-time delivery and high quality standards. This has led to rapid growth in India and internationally, with the potential to quickly become one of the most important manufacturing platforms globally,&#8221; said Neil Shah, partner at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement.</p>

<p>The amount was undisclosed, but sources say it brings BukuWarung’s total funding so far to $20 million. The company’s last round, announced in September 2020, was between $10 million to $15 million. Launched in 2019, BukuWarung was founded by Chinmay Chauhan and Abhinay Peddisetty and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/meet-bukuwarung-the-bookkeeping-app-built-for-indonesias-60-million-micro-merchants/">took part in Y Combinator last year</a>.</p>

<p>Rocketship.vc is also an investor in Indian startup Khatabook, which reached a valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/indias-khatabook-raises-60-million-to-help-merchants-digitize-bookkeeping-and-accept-payments-online/">between $275 million to $300 million</a> in its last funding round. Like Khatabook, BukuWarung helps small businesses, like neighborhood stores called warung, that previously relied on paper ledgers, transition to digital bookkeeping and online payments. BukuWarung recently launched Tokoko, a Shopify-like tool that lets merchants create online stores through an app, and says Tokoko has been used by 500,000 merchants so far.</p>
<p>Chauhan, BukuWarung’s president, said it has started making revenue through its payments solution. In total, BukuWarung now claims more than 3.5 million registered merchants in 750 Indonesian towns and cities, and says it is recording over $15 billion worth of transactions across its platform and processing over $500 million in terms of volume.</p>
<p>SMEs <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">contribute about 60% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product</a> and employ 97% of its domestic workforce, but many <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-fintech-can-help-indonesias-small-and-medium-enterprises-survive-the-covid-19-pandemic-148528">have difficulty accessing financial services</a> that can help them grow. By digitizing their financial records, companies like BukuWarung can make it easier for them to access lines of credit, working capital loans and other services. Other companies serving SMEs in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, include BukuKas and CrediBook.</p>
<p>BukuWarung will use its new funding to grow its tech and product teams in Indonesia, India and Singapore. It plans to launch more monetization products, including credit and grow its payments solution this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Bezos era is ending, Uber acquires Drizly and Tesla recalls 135,000 vehicles. This is your Daily Crunch for February 2, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Jeff Bezos will step down as Amazon CEO</strong></p>

Andy Jassy, currently the CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as chief executive for the entire company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an email to employees, Bezos said that this will allow him to devote more time to &#8220;Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and [his] other passions.&#8221; Jassy, meanwhile, had previously been identified as a likely successor.</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockbuster news struck late this afternoon when Amazon announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">that Jeff Bezos would be stepping back</a> as CEO of Amazon, the company he built from a business in his garage to worldwide behemoth. As he takes on the role of executive chairman, his replacement will be none other than AWS CEO Andy Jassy.</p>
<p>With Jassy moving into his new role at the company, the immediate question is who replaces him to run AWS. Let the games begin. Among the names being tossed about in the rumor mill are Peter DeSantis, vice president of global infrastructure at AWS and Matt Garman, who is vice president of sales and marketing. Both are members of Bezos&#8217; elite executive team <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-expands-bezos-elite-s-team-adding-6-execs-emerging-branches-company/">known as the S-team</a> and either would make sense as Jassy&#8217;s successor. Nobody knows for sure though, and it could be any number of people inside the organization, or even someone from outside. Amazon was not ready to comment on a successor yet with the hand-off still months away.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, a senior analyst at Constellation Research, says that Jassy is being rewarded for doing a stellar job raising AWS from a tiny side business to one on a $50 billion run rate. &#8220;On the finance side it makes sense to appoint an executive who intimately knows Amazon&#8217;s most profitable business, that operates in more competitive markets. [Appointing Jassy] ensures that the new Amazon CEO does not break the &#8216;golden goose&#8217;,&#8221; Mueller told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OQ2pRaZyvt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">Jeff Bezos will no longer be CEO of Amazon as of later this year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeff Bezos will no longer be CEO of Amazon as of later this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/embed/#?secret=OQ2pRaZyvt" data-secret="OQ2pRaZyvt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Alex Smith, VP of channels, who covers the cloud infrastructure market at analyst firm Canalys, says the writing has been on the wall that a transition was in the works. &#8220;This move has been coming for some time. Jassy is the second most public-facing figure at Amazon and has lead one of its most successful business units. Bezos can go out on a high and focus on his many other ventures,&#8221; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith adds that this move should enhance AWS&#8217;s place in the organization. &#8220;I think this is more of an AWS gain, in terms of its increasing strategic importance to Amazon going forward, rather than loss in terms of losing Andy as direct lead. I expect he’ll remain close to that organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ed Anderson, a Gartner analyst also sees Jassy as the obvious choice to take over for Bezos. &#8220;Amazon is a company driven by technology innovation, something Andy has been doing at AWS for many years now. Also, it’s worth noting that Andy Jassy has an impressive track record of building and running a very large business. Under Andy’s leadership, AWS has grown to be one of the biggest technology companies in the world and one of the most impactful in defining what the future of computing will be,&#8221; Anderson said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS is sick of waiting for your company to move to the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/aws-is-sick-of-waiting-for-your-company-to-move-to-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=CWRRLJktxD" data-secret="CWRRLJktxD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the company earnings report released today, AWS came in at $12.74 billion for the quarter up 28% YoY from $9.6 billion a year ago. That puts the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">on an elite $50 billion run rate</a>. No other cloud infrastructure vendor, even the mighty Microsoft, is even close in this category. Microsoft stands at around 20% marketshare compared to AWS&#8217;s approximately 33% market share.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what impact the executive shuffle will have on the company at large or AWS in particular. In some ways it feels like when Larry Ellison<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/09/18/349637734/larry-ellison-steps-down-as-oracles-ceo"> stepped down as CEO of Oracle in 2014</a> to take on the exact same executive chairman role. While Safra Catz and Mark Hurd took over at co-CEOs in that situation, Ellison has remained intimately involved with the company he helped found. It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that Bezos will do the same.</p>
<p>With Jassy, the company is getting a man who has risen through the ranks since joining the company in 1997 after getting an undergraduate degree and an MBA from Harvard. In 2002 he became VP/technical assistant, working directly under Bezos. It was in this role that he began to see the need for a set of common web services for Amazon developers to use. This <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">idea grew into AWS</a> and Jassy became a VP at the fledgling division working his way up until he was appointed CEO in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google continues to bet heavily on Google Cloud, and, while it is seeing accelerated revenue growth, its losses are also increasing. For the first time today, Google <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2020Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=9e991fd">disclosed</a> operating income/loss for its Google Cloud business unit in its quarterly earnings today. Google Cloud lost $5.6 billion in Google&#8217;s fiscal year 2020, which ended December 31. That&#8217;s on $13 billion of revenue.</p>
<p>While this may look a bit dire at first glance (cloud computing should be pretty profitable, after all), there are different ways of looking at this. On the one hand, losses are mounting, up from $4.3 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, but revenue is also seeing strong growth, up from $5.8 billion in 2018 and $8.9 billion in 2019. What we&#8217;re seeing here, more than anything else, is Google investing heavily in its cloud business.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Cloud unit, led by its CEO Thomas Kurian, includes all of its cloud infrastructure and platform services, as well as Google Workspace (which you probably still refer to as G Suite). And that&#8217;s exactly where Google is making a lot of investments right now. Data centers, after all, don&#8217;t come cheap, and Google Cloud launched <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-cloud-announces-new-regions">four new regions in 2020</a> and started work on others. That&#8217;s on top of its investment in its core services and a number of acquisitions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;On cloud, we see how early customers are in this shift,&#8221; Google/Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in today&#8217;s earnings call. &#8220;We see a large time ahead &#8212; and definitely the market dynamics and our momentum in the context of the market is the framework in which we are thinking about the scale of investments &#8212; and the pace of investments. Obviously, it&#8217;s an area in which the longer you are in, the [unintelligible] and contributes more &#8212; and economies of scale start working as well.

<p>“Our strong fourth quarter performance, with revenues of $56.9 billion, was driven by Search and YouTube, as consumer and business activity recovered from earlier in the year,&#8221; Ruth Porat, CFO of Google and Alphabet, said. &#8220;Google Cloud revenues were $13.1 billion for 2020, with significant ongoing momentum, and we remain focused on delivering value across the growth opportunities we see.”</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s earnings call, Porat noted that Workspace is seeing strong growth among large enterprises, &#8220;which are signing meaningful, long-term commitment agreements.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, though, Google&#8217;s core business, which saw a strong rebound in its advertising business in the last quarter, is subsidizing its cloud expansion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over in Seattle, AWS today reported revenue of $12.74 billion <em>in the last quarter alone</em> and operating income of $3.56 billion. For 2020, AWS&#8217;s operating income was $13.5 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon founder and current CEO Jeff Bezos will be transitioning to executive chair of the company sometime in Q3 of this year, with current AWS CEO Andy Jassy taking over the top executive role at the commerce company. Amazon <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202006100/en/Amazon.com-Announces-Financial-Results-and-CEO-Transition">announced the news</a> alongside its earnings results on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Amazon initially rose after-hours as the market digested both the company’s earnings and its CEO news. The company beat on both earnings per share and revenues. That makes it hard to untangle the market’s response to its busy set of announcements. <em>Update: Amazon shares have now dipped into negative territory as investors had more time to parse the company&#8217;s total collection of announcements.</em></p>
<p>Amazon<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3657437-amazon-eps-beats-6_96-beats-on-revenue"> crushed</a> earnings-per-share and revenue expectations in Q4 2020. So, any investor worried about the exit of Bezos from the CEO chair were given some measure of of performance-based amelioration. Amazon’s quarter <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/amazon-amzn-earnings-q4-2020.html">was its first</a> to break the $100 billion mark, bringing in $125.6 billion in revenue against an anticipated $119.7 billion. And, the company’s $14.09 per share in earnings was nearly double an expected $7.23.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Jassy has been identified previously as the likely successor to Bezos, after leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) to the success it currently enjoys</a> as a leader in the cloud computing space. AWS grew its revenues by 28% in the quarter, lower than its year-ago growth rate of 34%. AWS’s net revenues expanded from $9.95 in the year-ago Q4 to $12.74 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating income at AWS scaled as well, from $2.6 billion in Q4 2019 to $3.56 billion in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>Notably Microsoft’s Azure business <a class="c-link" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q2/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q2/press-release-webcast" data-sk="tooltip_parent">grew 50%</a> in its most recent earnings period.</p>
<p>Bezos sent an email to Amazon employees, which the company also <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/email-from-jeff-bezos-to-employees">released publicly on its blog</a> on Tuesday following the announcement. In the missive, he says that while he continues to &#8220;find [his] work meaningful and fun,&#8221; he wants to be able to devote proper time and attention to his &#8220;Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and [his] other passions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue Origin, Bezos’ space company, has achieved a lot to date, and regularly flies suborbital missions with its New Shepard launch vehicle. This coming year will be a busy one for the space company, since it should likely begin flying people on New Shepard for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to its own human spaceflight goals, Blue Origin is currently developing a human lunar landing system for NASA, in partnership with other space industry leaders. It’s also working on another launch vehicle, New Glenn, which will be a heavy-lift class rocket capable of delivering payloads to orbit. So there’s a lot going on, there, too. Bezos has previously referred to Blue Origin as the &#8220;most important work that he&#8217;s doing&#8221; because of the scale of its potential impact on the future of humanity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has once again flown its Starship spacecraft, a still-in-development space launch vehicle it&#8217;s building in south Florida. This test was a flight of SN9, the ninth in its current series of prototype rockets. The test involved flying SN9 to an altitude of around 10 km (just over six miles, or nearly 33,000 feet). After reaching that apogee, the SN9 spacecraft altered its attitude to angle for re-entry (simulated, since it didn&#8217;t actually leave Earth&#8217;s atmosphere) and then descended for a controlled landing.</p>
<p>This is the second test along these lines, with the first happening in December using its SN8 prototype, the one before this in the current series. Today&#8217;s test saw SN9 reach its target altitude as intended, and saw a successful &#8220;belly flop&#8221; maneuver, as well as the required propellant hand-off. This was also a successful test of the flaps on Starship, which control its angle as it moves through the air, and which alter their angle via on-board motors to do so. The landing portion didn&#8217;t go as smoothly &#8212; the spacecraft attempted to re-orient itself to go vertical for landing, but didn&#8217;t make it quite straight up-and-down, and also had too much speed going into the touchdown, so it exploded rather spectacularly when it hit the ground.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2107473" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2107473" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2107473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SN9-landing.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="556" /><p id="caption-attachment-2107473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX had a very similar test the first time around, with things going mostly smoothly up until the landing portion of the mission. During SN8&#8217;s flight, the Starship prototype appeared to be better-oriented for landing before touching down too hard, but it&#8217;s difficult to say too much about which was more or less successful without access to the data and the testing parameters.</p>
<p>Starship is designed to perform this crucial maneuver as part of its approach to reusability &#8212; the spacecraft is intended to be fully reusable, and will accomplish this with a powered landing that includes, obviously, not the exploding component. As the company noted, however, the rest of this test looks pretty much like what they wanted to happen.</p>
<p>This kind of early testing isn&#8217;t expected to go exactly to plan, and the point is primarily to collect data that will help improve further attempts and spacecraft development. Of course, you&#8217;d hope to get things exactly right upon your first attempts, but it never actually works that way in rocketry. What is unusual is how public SpaceX is with its development program at this stage of testing.</p>
<p>The company will be back at it with another try soon. It already has its SN10 prototype set up on its launch site at its Texas facility, which is the other spaceship you see in the early part of the animation above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://springbig.com">Springbig</a> today announced that it acquired Canada-based <a href="https://trybudtender.com">BudTender</a>, a customer experience platform for cannabis retailers. The acquisition adds 200 clients to springbig, which brings the total amount of retailers in its purview to 1,900.</p>
<p>This move comes as cannabis retailers are seeking novel approaches to expand their client base. In most regions, cannabis companies are unable to utilize modern advertising on social media. With BudTender, springbig adds another tool to its marketing and loyalty platform. Springbig says that BudTender will soon be integrated into springbig&#8217;s platform, allowing users to access BudTender&#8217;s reports and surveys.</p>
<p>&#8220;BudTender has been a dominant force in the Canadian [cannabis tech] space; the company&#8217;s vision and platform effortlessly complements springbig&#8217;s ongoing commitment to enhancing the cannabis retail and loyalty experience,&#8221; said Jeffrey Harris, founder and CEO of springbig in a released statement. &#8220;As the legal industry becomes increasingly sophisticated, brands and retailers will need to deploy more comprehensive customer retention and satisfaction solutions in order to stay competitive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Jake Crow in 2017, BudTender had a fantastic 2020. According to springbig, BudTender saw 800% year-over-year growth and 1200% year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This acquisition will not only be a boon to cannabis retailers across North America but also enrich millions of consumer experiences,&#8221; said Crow. &#8220;This will undoubtedly create a more modern cannabis industry, and we are thrilled to officially join forces with springbig.&#8221;</p>
<p>The terms of the deal are undisclosed.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The wave of venture capital interest in geographies other than Silicon Valley has been building momentum over the past 5+ years. If you measure capital flow by Twitter chatter alone, you may assume the tidal wave is about to break and checks are being doled out via T-shirt launchers repurposed from hockey games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, VCs will approach founders saying, “We are now looking into markets beyond Silicon Valley.”</p>
<p>When Mucker launched back in 2011, our founding partners, who had left Silicon Valley for LA, set out to prove that high-growth companies can be built anywhere. Our portfolio from this past decade is a testament to this very narrative. With offices in LA, Austin and Nashville — and investments all over North America, we are seeing a marked increase in receptivity to an idea we had over a decade ago to invest across the U.S. and into Canada.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of late, I’m receiving more and more outreach from VCs based in San Francisco, New York and beyond interested in deal flow here in Nashville and the Southeast.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When we think about the opportunity beyond Silicon Valley, we are really speaking of America.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In reality, there will be some lag time before the checks being written by these same VCs are consistent with both the outward hype and existing market opportunity. The broadened geographic focus of VCs for marketing purposes and FOMO is not adequately capturing the real narrative.</p>
<p>In short: When we think about the opportunity beyond Silicon Valley, we are really speaking of America.</p>
<h2>America is the opportunity and we are worthy of investment, aren’t we?</h2>
<p>“We” is a loaded declaration. I write this as a venture capitalist and also as the biracial daughter of a first-generation immigrant, with both of my parents growing up poor by most people’s standards. One branch of my family immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, the other harkens back to rural Oklahoma. The founders I meet day in and day out in the Southeast oftentimes tell a similar story.</p>
<p>My story is that of the average American, and yet feels light years apart from what people perceive as the “innovation economy.” Many of the people I’ve met in venture capital this past decade come from prestigious lineages with parents and grandparents who may have never associated with mine. And yet, here we are. This is America.</p>
<p>While Silicon Valley’s origins and climb to international stardom center around a collection of innovators, attracting more innovators and capital as the decades passed, one critical element arguably fell by the wayside &#8212; America as an expansive and diverse collection of states and people. Annual reporting on where venture capital dollars flow supports this discrepancy, with the majority of funds being funneled into companies based in and around Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>We find ourselves at the threshold of a decade where America will be rightfully recast as the land of opportunity for VC dollars to flow into the products and services fueling America’s future. And, at the helm of such innovations needs to be the people closest to these market opportunities, in full alignment with their customers and the nuances to best serve them.</p>
<p>In a post-COVID world, customers have never demanded more transparency into supply chains, workplace culture and equity ownership. Customers are more informed than ever before, with a 24/7 info line on brands and a growing scrutiny on where to place their hard-earned dollars. In short, they demand to be seen, and the founders who recognize this are the ones thriving in this new climate.</p>
<h2>Follow the money</h2>
<p>Where do the customers live? I’ll give you a hint: They are largely not in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://medium.com/buildinse/introducing-moderncapital-f0fa3e23cfac">wrote about</a> the unfair advantage of Nashville back in 2018 when I announced the launch of <a href="https://www.buildinse.com/">Build In SE</a>, a community I co-founded to support founders choosing to build their companies in the Southeast. Nashville is at the center of over half of the United States population within a radius of 650 miles, and within a two-hour flight of 75% of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Customers come in all shapes and sizes, and founders with boots on the ground in these markets, wearing the same brand of proverbial boots as these customers, carry an unfair advantage. These same founders historically bootstrapped their companies out of need, as access to early-stage, high-risk capital can be scarce and vary widely city by city, state by state, industry by industry.</p>
<p>These same founders still built household name companies in the tech and innovation economy, including the likes of Mailchimp, Calendly, Lynda.com, and GoFundMe (their Series A valued them at $600 million pre-money). All of these companies have another thing in common &#8212; they were founded “beyond Silicon Valley.”</p>
<h2>Talent as the stronger magnet</h2>
<p>Another macrotrend at play is that of the increasing distribution of talent beyond traditional metropolitan strongholds like San Francisco and New York. Entrepreneurs, technologists and operational talent are lifestyle-seeking at a time in history when life feels all the more precious. Moving to cities like Nashville, Austin, Atlanta, Denver, Durham, Miami, et. al. means proximity to aging family members, affordable childcare and outdoor activities.</p>
<p>These simple pleasures were the tradeoffs people made when &#8220;pursuing their dreams&#8221; in coastal cities, picking up to move in pursuit of money (sometimes better weather). Seemingly overnight, capital abounds in the private markets just as talent becomes increasingly scarce and therefore valuable. The pendulum swung, and capital became the weaker of the two magnets; Wall Street began moving up Manhattan island toward coffee shops and dog parks when talent began to pose the question, “How long do I want my commute to be?” and “How much time do I want to reclaim for my family, and myself?”</p>
<p>2020 was the match to ignite this dry hillside. People trapped inside of cramped quarters with resources left to invest in a new life (or in other cases, left with nothing to lose) packed their bags for a new, up-and-coming metro.</p>
<p>For some, this comes with a newfound sense of community and belonging, as I experienced in 2017 when I moved from my lifelong home of Los Angeles to Nashville. In LA, my local neighborhood hardly knew one another due to the transient nature of the town. In Nashville, I became part of something greater than myself.</p>
<h2>Opportunities abound everywhere</h2>
<p>One of the big frustrations expressed by founders I know in markets like Nashville, Atlanta, the Research Triangle, Cincinnati and Toronto, is, “I keep hearing there is more capital available, but I’m not seeing it.” They will meet with investors, then be told they are too early, raising too little money, or too much, or not going after a “big enough market.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, one or more of these may be true. However, there are instances where these investor responses may be thinly veiled criticism of the perceived ability of the founders who might not sound, look or behave like Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Closing this gap of understanding between pattern-matching VCs of varying skill and startup CEOs across the country will require hard work in the coming decade. A big piece of this will require breaking bread as neighbors, with kids in the same schools, a shared affinity for the local greasy spoon and a mutual trust. This will be step one. Though really, it will require much more alignment and rigor around the very definition of America.</p>
<p>It is up to investors to capture this opportunity in the next decade. In fact, it is our job.</p>
