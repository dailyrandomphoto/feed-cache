										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook’s controversial policy-setting supergroup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now/">issued its verdict on Trump&#8217;s fate Wednesday</a>, and it wasn&#8217;t quite what most of us were expecting.</p>
<p>We’ll dig into the decision to tease out what it really means, not just for Trump, but also for Facebook’s broader experiment in outsourcing difficult content moderation decisions and for just how independent the board really is.</p>
<h3>What did the Facebook Oversight Board decide?</h3>
<p>The Oversight Board backed Facebook’s determination that Trump violated its policies on “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations,” which prohibits anything that praises or otherwise supports violence. The the full decision and accompanying policy recommendations <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/226612455899839-oversight-board-upholds-former-president-trump-s-suspension-finds-facebook-failed-to-impose-proper-penalty/">are online for anyone to read</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Specifically, the Oversight Board ruled that two Trump posts, one telling Capitol rioters “We love you. You’re very special” and another calling them “great patriots” and telling them to “remember this day forever” broke Facebook’s rules. In fact, the board went as far as saying the pair of posts “severely” violated the rules in question, making it clear that the risk of real-world harm in Trump’s words was was crystal clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Board found that, in maintaining an unfounded narrative of electoral fraud and persistent calls to action, Mr. Trump created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible.<strong> At the time of Mr. Trump’s posts, there was a clear, immediate risk of harm and his words of support for those involved in the riots legitimized their violent actions.</strong> As president, Mr. Trump had a high level of influence. The reach of his posts was large, with 35 million followers on Facebook and 24 million on Instagram.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Oversight Board praised Facebook’s decision to suspend Trump, it disagreed with the way the platform implemented the suspension. The group argued that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook&#8217;s decision to issue an “indefinite” suspension</a> was an arbitrary punishment that wasn’t really supported by the company’s stated policies:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>It is not permissible for Facebook to keep a user off the platform for an undefined period, with no criteria for when or whether the account will be restored.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In applying this penalty, Facebook did not follow a clear, published procedure.</strong> ‘Indefinite’ suspensions are not described in the company’s content policies. Facebook’s normal penalties include removing the violating content, imposing a time-bound period of suspension, or permanently disabling the page and account.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Oversight Board didn’t mince words on this point, going on to say that by putting a “vague, standardless” punishment in place and then kicking the ultimate decision to the Oversight Board, “Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities.” Turning things around, the board asserted that it’s actually Facebook’s responsibility to come up with an appropriate penalty for Trump that fits its set of content moderation rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Is this a surprise outcome?</h3>
<p>If you’d asked me yesterday, I would have said that the Oversight Board was more likely to overturn Facebook’s Trump decision. I also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/">called Wednesday’s big decision a win-win for Facebook</a>, because whatever the outcome, it wouldn’t ultimately be criticized a second time for either letting Trump back onto the platform or kicking him off for good. So much for that!</p>
<p>A lot of us didn’t see the “straight up toss the ball back into Facebook’s court” option as a possible outcome. It’s ironic and surprising that the Oversight Board’s decision to give Facebook the final say actually makes the board look more independent, not less.</p>
<p>Facebook likely saw a more clear-cut decision on the Trump situation in the cards. This is a challenging outcome for a company that’s probably ready to move on from its (many, many) missteps during the Trump era. But there’s definitely an argument that if the board declared that Facebook made the wrong call and reinstated Trump that would have been a much bigger headache.</p>
<h3>What does it mean that the Oversight Board sent the decision back to Facebook?</h3>
<p>Ultimately the Oversight Board is asking Facebook to either a) give Trump’s suspension and end date or b) delete his account. In a less severe case, the normal course of action would be for Facebook to remove whatever broke the rules, but given the ramifications here and the fact that Trump is a repeat Facebook rule-breaker, this is obviously all well past that option.</p>
<h3>What will Facebook do?</h3>
<p>We’re in for a wait. The board called for Facebook to evaluate the Trump situation and reach a final decision within six months, calling for a “proportionate” response that is justified by its platform rules. Since Facebook and other social media companies are re-writing their rules all the time and making big calls on the fly, that gives the company a bit of time to build out policies that align with the actions it plans to take. See you again on November 5.</p>
<p>In the months following the violence at the U.S. Capitol, Facebook repeatedly defended its Trump call as “necessary and right.” It’s hard to imagine the company deciding that Trump will get reinstated six months from now, but in theory Facebook could decide that length of time was an appropriate punishment and write that into its rules. The fact that Twitter permanently banned Trump means that Facebook could comfortably follow suit at this point.</p>
<p>If Trump had won reelection, this whole thing probably would have gone down very differently. As much as Facebook likes to say its decisions are aligned with lofty ideals — absolute free speech, connecting people — the company is ultimately very attuned to its regulatory and political environment. Trump’s actions were on January 6 were dangerous and flagrant, but Biden’s looming inauguration two weeks later probably influenced the company’s decision just as much.</p>
<p>In direct response to the decision, Facebook’s Nick Clegg wrote only: “We will now consider the board’s decision and determine an action that is clear and proportionate.” Clegg says Trump will stay suspended until then but didn’t offer further hints at what comes next.</p>

<p><strong>Did the board actually change anything?</strong></p>
<p>Potentially. In its decision, the Oversight Board said that Facebook asked for “observations or recommendations from the Board about suspensions when the user is a political leader.” The board’s policy recommendations aren’t binding like its decisions are, but since Facebook asked, it’s likely to listen.</p>
<p>If it does, the Oversight Board&#8217;s recommendations could reshape how Facebook handles high profile accounts in the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Board stated that <strong>it is not always useful to draw a firm distinction between political leaders and other influential users, recognizing that other users with large audiences can also contribute to serious risks of harm</strong>.</p>
<p>While the same rules should apply to all users, context matters when assessing the probability and imminence of harm. When posts by influential users pose a high probability of imminent harm, Facebook should act quickly to enforce its rules. Although Facebook explained that it did not apply its ‘newsworthiness’ allowance in this case, the Board called on Facebook to address widespread confusion about how decisions relating to influential users are made. <strong>The Board stressed that considerations of newsworthiness should not take priority when urgent action is needed to prevent significant harm</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook and other social networks have hidden behind newsworthiness exemptions for years instead of making difficult policy calls that would upset half their users. Here, the board not only says that political leaders don’t really deserve special consideration while enforcing the rules, but that it’s much more important to take down content that could cause harm than it is to keep it online because it’s newsworthy.</p>
<h3>So… we&#8217;re back to square one?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. Trump’s suspension may still be up in the air, but the Oversight Board is modeled after a legal body and its real power is in setting precedents. The board kicked this case back to Facebook because the company picked a punishment for Trump<em> that wasn’t even on the menu</em>, not because it thought anything about his behavior fell in a gray area.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board clearly believed that Trump’s words of praise for rioters at the Capitol created a high stakes, dangerous threat on the platform. It’s easy to imagine the board reaching the same conclusion on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/facebook-employees-stage-virtual-walkout-in-protest-of-companys-stance-on-trump-posts/"> Trump’s infamous “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”</a> statement during the George Floyd protests, even though Facebook did nothing at the time. Still, the board stops short of saying that behavior like Trump&#8217;s merits a perma-ban — that much is up to Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM CEO Mary Barra sees the automaker selling personal autonomous vehicles by the end of the decade by leveraging technology from its self-driving subsidiary Cruise, according to comments made during the company&#8217;s Wednesday earnings call.</p>
<p>Barra wasn&#8217;t providing any specifics just yet, but instead laid out a vision for the automaker&#8217;s future and how its stake in Cruise and its own internal effort to further develop its advanced driver assistance system Super Cruise might evolve over the next nine years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always said we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full Level 4, Level 5 autonomy,&#8221; she said, referring to automation levels designated by the SAE International.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; end of Barra&#8217;s vision is Cruise, the self-driving startup in which GM holds a controlling interest. Cruise is working on shared, electric, autonomous vehicles that will operate in dense urban areas and shuttle people and likely packages. The company, which is testing its technology on public roads in San Francisco, has yet to deploy a commercial-scale robotaxi or last-mile delivery business. Cruise also struck a deal earlier this month to <a href="https://twitter.com/HamdanMohammed/status/1381541345941151744">launch a robotaxi service in Dubai</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>While Cruise continues to test, validate and presumably launch its self-driving technology as a commercial product, GM continues to improve its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and integrate into more of its vehicle brands. Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=Y5wKCcxaBs" data-secret="Y5wKCcxaBs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>GM has historically taken a slower approach to Super Cruise compared to Tesla&#8217;s method of rolling out software updates that gives early access to some owners to test the improved features. Although now, it appears GM is keen to ramp up Super Cruise — in terms of capability and vehicle integration. Barra said Wednesday that GM plans to roll out Super Cruise to 22 models by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>When GM launched Super Cruise in 2017, it was only available in one Cadillac model &#8212; the full-size CT6 sedan &#8212; and restricted to divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand where Super Cruise would be available. The company has also been ratcheting up the capabilities of Super Cruise. The company&#8217;s new digital vehicle intelligence platform known as VIP provides more electrical bandwidth and data processing power, which has allowed engineers to add to features such as automated lane changes. It is also working on making Super Cruise available on city streets, not just on highways.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Cruise is really focused on that full autonomy, but on Super Cruise we continue to add more and more features,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;Our ultimate vision is that this (Super Cruise) system enables hands-free transportation in 95% of driving scenarios.&#8221; Barra added that the company&#8217;s &#8220;vehicle intelligence platform (VIP), which connects every vehicle system into one advanced high-speed and very secure network&#8221; is what makes the further development of Super Cruise possible.</p>
<p>VIP has 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour, a five-fold increase from GM&#8217;s previous architecture, according to Barra. That&#8217;s enough capacity to manage all of the data loads of its driver assistance systems, electric propulsion, over-the-air updates of every vehicle module plus capacity to manage feature applications, Barra said, adding that it also will allow the company to offer software as a service, including new apps that it can market to customers. By the end of 2023, VIP will be on 7 million vehicles and 38 global models, she said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though Barra wants to take Cruise&#8217;s self-driving technology, designed over robotaxis and last-mile delivery, and get it into personal autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to still unfold, but I believe we&#8217;ll have personal autonomous vehicles and then that will leverage the capability we have at Cruise with the capability that we have at the car company to really be well positioned to delight the customers from that perspective,&#8221; Barra said. &#8220;So both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today I think makes them safer and delights the customers and is going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue, and then the ultimate work that we&#8217;re doing at Cruise, that is full autonomous, really opens up, you know, more possibilities then I think we can outline today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Integrating into a passenger vehicle a self-driving system used in a robotaxi is a complex process. It would require GM to start now designing, testing and validating how to safely adapt this technology to vehicles consumers can buy. It&#8217;s unclear if that is already happening.</p>
<p>GM <a href="https://investor.gm.com/static-files/534a9147-eefe-4c7a-9c35-dbac648b321a">reported revenue</a> of $32.47 billion in the first quarter, a skosh below the $32.7 billion in the same period last year and less than analysts expected. However, GM far surpassed expectations on earnings, pushing shares up 4% to close at $57.58. The automaker reported net income of $3 billion in the first quarter, up from $294 million in the same period last year. On an <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EBIT-adjusted earnings basis, which excludes nonrecurring items, it reported income of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $2.25. Analysts had expected an adjusted EPS of $1.04.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are also reaffirming our guidance for the full year, and based on what we know today, we see results coming in at the higher end of the $10 billion to $11 billion EBIT-adjusted range we shared earlier this year, Barra said <a href="https://investor.gm.com/static-files/429b1605-d0e0-4a42-956e-b152caaeb356">in a letter to shareholders</a>, adding to the positive results. Those expectations take into account the potential impact of the ongoing chip shortage, GM said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://metacoregames.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwhMmEBhBwEiwAXwFoEUYZQYL3mtiJpHY3s7voYTdYNGnBS-xvpyfJA1ZiNy5__2B9RlnpHRoCvhMQAvD_BwE">Metacore</a>, a Finnish mobile games company, seems to have an amazing &#8220;relationship&#8221; with Supercell, another (quite successful) Finnish mobile games company.</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, Metacore <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/17/metacore-raises-17-7-million-from-supercell-as-it-launches-merge-mansion-mobile-game/">raised</a> $17.7 million in equity from Supercell and another $11.8 million line of credit, sometimes also called a debt round. That amazing relationship appears to be ongoing. Because Metacore has now raised yet another debt round from Supercell, but this time for €150 million ($180 million). These guys <em>really</em> like each other.</p>
<p>The simple reason for this is two words: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.everywear.game5&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Merge Mansion</a>. This game has been so spectacularly successful that Supercell clearly wants a stake in that success, and it has the cash reserves to make that bet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The puzzle discovery game has 800,000 daily players, and an annual revenue run rate of more than €45 million, so it’s really on a growth curve.</p>
<p>Why so successful? Well, players have really loved the idea that they can literally merge two items they pick up in the game to make a brand new thing. So for instance, you can merge two rakes and you get another kind of tool that you can then can use somewhere else. This is a very unique mechanic in mobile games.</p>
<p>Supercell is also enamored of Metacore’s games development strategy: It creates games with two- to three-person teams and only adds resources when a game takes off. This innovative approach to game development is at least part of the reason Supercell is doubling down on its investment, not just Merge Mansion itself. It’s a sort of &#8220;fail-fast&#8221; approach to game-making that is clearly paying dividends.</p>
<p>So why this approach to the latest financing?</p>
<p>I spoke to CEO and co-founder Mika Tammenkoski, who told me: “Yes, it is a credit line. We are more about scaling up the company as we are scaling up revenue. We already have meaningful revenue, we can invest the money, and we can expect a certain kind of return on investment. So this is the cheapest investment that we can get. Equity investment would dilute us. So this makes sense from that point of view. With Supercell, we have a really great partner backing us. They know exactly what is ahead of us. They know exactly the kind of challenges that we have, and that makes us aligned in that sense… We both think long term, we both want to scale the game as big as possible. And with Supercell we get the best terms overall.”</p>
<p>So there you have it. Metacore and Supercell are locked in an embrace which any other outside investor is going to have to invest in big to get a look in on the action.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The number of SPACs in the deep tech sector was skyrocketing, but a combination of increased SEC scrutiny and market forces over the past few weeks has slowed the pace of new SPAC transactions. The correction is an inevitable step on the path to mainstreaming SPACs as an alternative to IPOs, but it won’t cause them to go away. Instead, blank-check vehicles will evolve and will occupy a small and specialized — but important — part of the startup financing landscape.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I believe that SPAC financings can solve a major problem for all capital-intensive technology startups: the need for faster — and potentially cheaper — access to large amounts of capital to fund product development over multiple years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The tsunami of SPAC financings sparked commentary from all corners of the capital markets community, from equity analysts and securities lawyers to VCs and fund managers — and even central bankers. That&#8217;s understandable, as more than $60 billion of SPAC deals have been announced since the beginning of 2020, plus $55 billion in PIPE capital, according to investment bank PJT Partners.</p>
<p>The views debated by finance experts often relate to the reasonableness of SPAC pricing and transaction structures, the alignment of incentives for stakeholders, and post-merger financial and stock price performance. But I’m not going to add another voice to the debate on the risk-reward calculus.</p>
<p>As the co-founder of a quantum computing software startup who worked in financial markets for two decades, I’d like to offer my perspective on two issues that I think my peers care more about: Can SPACs still solve the funding problem for capital-intensive, deep tech startups? And will they become a permanent financing option?</p>
<h2>Keeping the lights on at deep tech startups</h2>
<p>I believe that SPAC financings can solve a major problem for all capital-intensive technology startups: the need for faster — and potentially cheaper — access to large amounts of capital to fund product development over multiple years.</p>
<p>SPACs have created a limitless well of capital that deep tech startups are diving into. That’s because they are proving to be more attractive than other sources of financing, such as taking investments from later-stage VC funds or growth equity funds with finite fund sizes and specific investment themes.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://spacinsider.com/stats/">supply of growth capital</a> from these vehicles has been astounding. In 2020, SPACs alone raised more than $83 billion via 248 IPOs, which is equal to a third of the total $300 billion raised by the entire global VC community. If the present rate of financings had continued, the annual amount of SPAC financings would have been on par with the <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44307.pdf">total R&amp;D expenditure of the U.S. government</a> —  roughly $130 billion to $150 billion.</p>
<p>This new supply of capital can let startups keep the lights on, helping them address a practical need while they develop products that may take a decade to field. Before SPACs, any startup that wanted to remain independent had to lurch from one round of VC financing to the next. That, as well as the intense IPO process, is a major time sink for management teams and distracts them from focusing on product development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM might be best known for the millions of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC-branded vehicles it designs, produces, finances and sells each year. But it also has a burgeoning incubator, where a team of 600 employees are working to develop 20 new businesses with a total addressable market of about $1.3 trillion.</p>
<p>A few of the first startup fruits have already come to bear, including OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance, GM Defense and most recently, BrightDrop — the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">commercial electric vehicle delivery business</a> that launched in January. <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, a veteran at GM and vice president of the company&#8217;s Global Innovation team, is at the center of this effort and helped shepherd BrightDrop from idea to startup graduate. And she&#8217;s not done.</p>
<p>An engineer by training, Fletcher has been given a lofty directive to turn high-potential innovative ideas into scalable business ventures that drive growth and transform the GM business model beyond traditional automotive. She&#8217;s coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=pamelafletcherpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=pamfletcherpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>, a virtual event scheduled for June 9, to talk about their strategy and what&#8217;s coming next.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fletcher’s experience is broad and global. She has held a variety of leadership positions, guiding the development of GM’s electric vehicle and self-driving portfolio and technologies. Prior to joining the innovation incubator, she was vice president of global electric vehicles at GM. The teams she directed were responsible for the development of two generations of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt and the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV. Her team also led the development of Super Cruise, the automaker&#8217;s hands-free highway driver assist system as well as three generations of Cruise AVs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">She also serves as a corporate director of Coherent Inc., a NASDAQ-listed company based in Silicon Valley, and is also a board member of GM Defense LLC. </span>Fletcher was named to Motor Trend’s 2018 and 2019 Power List of auto industry leaders and was one of Fast Company’s “Most Creative People” of 2017. She serves on the board of advisers for the College of Engineering at the University of North Carolina Charlotte.</p>

<p>While the CEO and board might fully appreciate the counsel of the legal team, the ability of the legal team to earn the support of the business &#8212; from product and development to marketing and HR &#8212; is critical to a smooth, efficient closing and post-close integration process.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Your in-house legal team should be held accountable for catching things specific to your business that outside attorneys will miss.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Having been on the inside of M&amp;A transactions, here are a few insights that I recommend any executive team considering a major strategic transaction keep in mind when working with, and setting expectations for, the in-house legal function as the deal moves from business agreement to closing and through integration.</p>
<h2>Is this the right transaction to move the business forward?</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re thinking of M&amp;A (or any other type of strategic transaction, for that matter), it is critical to understand why you’re pursuing a deal and what the potential implications (both good <em>and</em> bad) may be for the business at large.</p>
<p>As the executive or founding team, have you agreed that doing the deal is the best way to further the overall strategic business objectives? Is the proposed deal allowing the company to scale more rapidly or efficiently? Does the transaction provide for a more diversified, complementary product offering?</p>
<p>After settling that the deal is the best way to achieve the overall business objective, the next focus is on execution. How will the resulting leadership bring together the two organizations? Do you have a plan on how to go from closing the transaction to successfully moving forward with the strategic purposes for doing the transaction in the first place? Is there agreement on product direction, go-to-market strategies, staffing, company culture, etc.?</p>
<p>These high-level discussions are important to have while evaluating a potential deal, and bringing in your internal legal leadership is critical in these early phases. You may identify during these early discussions aspects that are critical for the deal to be a success, and being sure your legal team is aware of these aspects allows the team to anticipate post-closing issues and resolve them proactively with the structure of the deal or by explicitly calling out critical obligations of each party.</p>
<p>Your in-house legal team should be held accountable for catching things specific to your business that outside attorneys will miss. Outside attorneys are experts in M&amp;A or IPOs or venture financings or whatever else, but your in-house lawyers are experts in your company — that’s the true value of having an in-house team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is launching a new section of its app designed to connect neighbors and curate neighborhood-level news. The new feature, predictably called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/connecting-local-communities-on-facebook/">Neighborhoods</a>, is available now in Canada and will be rolling out soon for U.S. users to test.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, Neighborhoods has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/facebook-is-working-on-neighborhoods-a-nextdoor-clone-based-on-local-groups/">technically been around since at least October of last year</a>, but that limited test only recruited residents of Calgary, Canada.</p>
<p>On Neighborhoods, Facebook users can create a separate subprofile and can populate it with interests and a custom bio. You can join your own lower-case neighborhood and nearby neighborhoods and complain about porch pirates, kids these days, or whatever you&#8217;d otherwise be doing on Nextdoor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aware of the intense moderation headaches on Nextdoor, Facebook says that it will have a set of moderators dedicated to Neighborhoods to review comments and posts to keep matters &#8220;relevant and kind.&#8221; Within Neighborhoods neighborhoods, deputized users can steer and strike up conversations and do some light moderation, it sounds like. The new corner of Facebook will also come with blocking features.</p>
<p>As far as privacy goes, well, it&#8217;s Facebook. Neighborhoods isn&#8217;t its own standalone app and will naturally be sharing your neighborly behavior to serve you targeted ads elsewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-harmful-replies-prompt-harassment-test-feature/">Twitter began testing a feature</a> that would prompt users to pause and reconsider before they replied to a tweet using &#8220;harmful&#8221; language &#8212; meaning language that was abusive, trolling or otherwise offensive in nature. Today, the company says it&#8217;s rolling improved versions of these prompts to English-language users on iOS and soon, Android, after adjusting its systems that determine when to send the reminders to better understand when the language being used in the reply is actually harmful.</p>
<p>The idea behind these forced slowdowns, or nudges, are about leveraging <a href="https://effectiviology.com/nudge/">psychological tricks</a> in order to help people make better decisions about what they post. Studies have <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2487788.2488038">indicated</a> that introducing a nudge like this can lead people to edit and cancel posts they would have otherwise regretted.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s own tests found that to be true, too. It said that 34% of people revised their initial reply after seeing the prompt, or chose not to send the reply at all. After being prompted once, people then composed 11% fewer offensive replies in the future, on average. That indicates that the prompt, for some small group at least, had a lasting impact on user behavior. (Twitter also found that users who were prompted were less likely to receive harmful replies back, but didn&#8217;t further quantify this metric.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2147956" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147956" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147956" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pasted-image-0-4.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147956" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>However, Twitter&#8217;s early tests ran into some problems. It found its systems and algorithms sometimes struggled to understand the nuance that occurs in many conversations. For example, it couldn&#8217;t always differentiate between offensive replies and sarcasm or, sometimes, even friendly banter. It also struggled to account for those situations in which language is being reclaimed by underrepresented communities, and then used in nonharmful ways.</p>
<p>The improvements rolling out starting today aim to address these problems. Twitter says it&#8217;s made adjustments to the technology across these areas, and others. Now, it will take the relationship between the author and replier into consideration. That is, if both follow and reply to each other often, it&#8217;s more likely they have a better understanding of the preferred tone of communication than someone else who doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Twitter says it has also improved the technology to more accurately detect strong language, including profanity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also made it easier for those who see the prompts to let Twitter know if the prompt was helpful or relevant &#8212; data that can help to improve the systems further.</p>
<p>How well this all works remains to be seen, of course.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147955" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147955" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/jiminy4.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>While any feature that can help dial down some of the toxicity on Twitter may be useful, this only addresses one aspect of the larger problem &#8212; people who get into heated exchanges that they could later regret. There are other issues across Twitter regarding abusive and toxic content that this solution alone can&#8217;t address.</p>
<p>These &#8220;reply prompts&#8221; aren&#8217;t the only time Twitter has used the concept of nudges to impact user behavior. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">reminds users to read an article</a> before you retweet and amplify it in an effort to promote more informed discussions on its platform.</p>
<p>Twitter says the improved prompts are rolling out to all English-language users on iOS starting today and will reach Android over the next few days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each of the big cloud platforms has its own methodology for passing on security information to logging and security platforms, leaving it to the vendors to find proprietary ways to translate that into a format that works for their tool. The Cloud Security Notification Framework (CSNF), a new working group that includes Microsoft, Google and IBM is trying to create a new open and standard way of delivering this information.</p>
<p>Nick Lippis, who is co-founder and co-chairman of ONUG, an open enterprise cloud community, which is the primary driver of CSNF, says that what they&#8217;ve created is part standard and part open source. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve been really focusing on is how do we automate governance on the cloud. And so security was the place that was ripe for that where we can actually provide some value right away for the community,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;ve pulled in some of the big cloud vendors, they&#8217;ve also got large companies who consume cloud services like FedEx, Pfizer and Goldman Sachs. Conspicuously missing from the group is AWS, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">the biggest player in the cloud infrastructure market</a> by far. But Lippis says that he hopes, as the project matures, other companies including AWS will join.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots of security programs and industry programs that get out there and that people are asking them to join, and so some companies want to wait to see how well this pans out [before making a commitment to it],&#8221; Lippis said. His hope is, that over time, Amazon will come around and join the group, but in the meantime they are working to get to the point where everyone in the community will feel good about what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>The idea is to start with security alerts and find a way to build a common format to give companies the same kind of system they have in the data center to track security alerts in the cloud. The way they hope to do that is with this open dialogue between the cloud vendors and the companies involved with the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the structure of that is that there&#8217;s a steering committee that is chaired by CISOs from these large cloud consumer brands, and also the cloud providers, and they provide voting and direction. And then there&#8217;s the working group where all the work is done. The beauty of what we do is that we have now consumers and also providers working together and collaborating,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Don Duet, a member of ONUG, who is CEO and co-founder of Concourse Labs, has been involved in the formation of the CSNF. He says to keep the project focused they are looking at this as a data management problem and they are establishing a common vocabulary for everyone to work within the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you build a consensus on what are the types of terms that everybody can agree on and then you build the underlying basis so that the experts in your resource providers in this case, Cloud Service Providers, can bless how their data [connects] to those common standards,&#8221; Duet explained.</p>
<p>He says that particular problem is more of an organizational problem than a technical one, getting the various stakeholders together and just building consensus around this. At this point, they have that process in place and the next step is proving it by having the various companies involved in this test it out in the coming months.</p>
<p>After they get past the testing phase, in October they plan to actually demonstrate what this looks like in a before and after scenario, with the new framework and without it. As the group works toward these goals, the hope is that eventually the framework will become more established and other companies and vendors will come on board and make this a more standard way of sharing security alerts. If all goes well, they hope to build in other security information into this framework over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There’s no excuse for the slow pace of improvement toward greater equity in the venture capital/startup game. And we’re tired of writing dispiriting posts about it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People have been discussing the importance of expanding opportunities for women in venture capital and startup entrepreneurship for decades. And for some time it appeared that progress was being made in building a more diverse and equitable environment.</p>
<p>The prospect of more women writing checks was viewed as a positive for female founders, a cohort that has struggled to attract more than a fraction of the funds that their male peers manage. All-female teams have an especially tough time raising capital compared to all-male teams, underscoring the disparity.</p>
<p>Then COVID-19 arrived and scrambled the venture and startup scene, creating a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/venture-capital-isnt-escaping-the-downward-spiral-of-the-global-economy/">risk-off environment</a> during the end of Q1 and the start of Q2 2020. Following that, the venture world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/as-e-commerce-accelerates-fintech-startups-raised-record-100m-rounds-in-q2/">went into overdrive</a> as software sales became a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense-part-ii/">safe harbor in the business</a> world during uncertain economic times. And when it became clear that the vaunted digital transformation of businesses large and small was accelerating, more capital appeared.</p>
<p>But data indicate that the torrent of new capital has not been distributed equally — indeed, some of the progress that female founders made in recent years may have eroded.</p>

<hr />
<p>During a time of plenty, many female founders are still going without. The Exchange reached out to a number of American and European investors and founders to get their perspective on how today’s venture market treats female founders.</p>
<p>Recurring among the responses was a general view that more women venture capitalists would help lessen the gender gap in investments, and that VCs became more conservative due to COVID-19 and its constituent economic disruption, reverting to offering capital to repeat founders and their existing networks, both groups that are less diverse than the pool of new founders.</p>

<p>But before we get into the core issues that prevent improvements in gender equity in venture funding, let’s check in on the data from last year and contrast it to its antecedents.</p>
<h2>What the data show</h2>
<p>While there have already been reports on gender disparities in funding, Nokia-backed VC firm <a href="https://www.ngpcap.com/">NGP Capital</a> made a great contribution to research on the topic with its <a href="https://www.ngpcap.com/uploads/The-outsized-role-of-gender-in-EU-venture-funding-NGPCapital.pdf">2021 dossier</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://blaze.today/">Text Blaze</a>, which was a part of the recent Winter 2021 Y Combinator accelerator batch, announced that it has closed a $3.3 million seed round. The company&#8217;s investment was led by <a href="https://twosigmaventures.com/">Two Sigma Ventures&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/villi">Villi Iltchev</a> and <a href="https://susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolovets">Leo Polovets</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s product hybridizes two trends that TechCrunch has been tracking in recent years, namely automation and the written word. On the automation front, we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/zapier-buys-no-code-focused-makerpad-in-its-first-acquisition/">Zapier grow into a behemoth</a>, while no-code products and RPA have made the concept of letting software boost worker output <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">increasingly mainstream</a>. And on the writing-assistance side of things, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/grammarly-raises-90m-at-over-1b-valuation-for-its-ai-based-grammar-and-writing-tools/">from Grammarly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">to Copy.ai</a>, it&#8217;s clear that people are willing to pay for tools to help them writer better and more quickly.</p>
<p>So what does Text Blaze do? Two main things. First, its <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/text-blaze/idgadaccgipmpannjkmfddolnnhmeklj">Chrome extension</a> allows users to save &#8220;snippets&#8221; of text that they can add to emails, and other notes in rapid-fire fashion. I might save &#8220;Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch&#8217;s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines&#8221; to &#8220;/intro in Text Blaze, saving myself lots of time whenever I kick off a new podcast script.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But saving snippets and quickly inserting them into various text boxes in a user&#8217;s browser are just part of what makes Text Blaze neat. The product can also save template snippets with various boxes left open for users to fill in. So, a user could have a user-feedback snippet saved, that reserved spots for them to add in names, and other unique information quickly, while reusing the bulk of the text itself.</p>
<p>Text Blaze also has integrations with external services to ensure that its service can save users time. For example, the service can pull in CRM data from Hubspot into a text snippet used in Gmail. The idea is to link different services and data sources automatically, helping users shave minutes from their days, and hours from their weeks.</p>
<p>So far Text Blaze has run lean, according to its co-founder Dan Barak, who told TechCrunch that its staff of four will grow to around 10 this year, thanks to its new capital. Like nearly every startup that we&#8217;ve spoken to in recent months, Barak said that Text Blaze is a remote-first startup with a wide hiring lens.</p>
<p>Text Blaze&#8217;s model is freemium, with a consumer paid offering that costs $2.99 monthly. The key limitation in its free product, Barak, is a hard cap of 20 snippets. Past that you&#8217;ll need to pay. TechCrunch was modestly confused at the low price point, and relatively robust free feature set that the startup is offering. The co-founder explained that the company&#8217;s long-term plan is to sell into enterprises, making the pro version of Text Blaze more of a tool to generate awareness in what its service can do more than its final monetization scheme.</p>
<p>Some 70% of the company&#8217;s users so far have signed up using their corporate email, which could provide a wide avenue into later enterprise sales. According to the Text Blaze website, business users will pay a little more than double what its prosumer users will.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s strategy appears to be working. Not only is it attracting users &#8212; its Chrome extension notes more than 70,000 users &#8212; and early revenue, but it also managed to convert Iltchev and Polovets into believers in its product. &#8220;When I first saw Text Blaze, it reminded me of the early days of Zapier which helped professionals to automate repetitive tasks, except Text Blaze provides a more approachable and easier to adopt entry point though written communications,&#8221; the Two Sigma investor told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Susa&#8217;s Polovets said that he &#8220;fell in love with the [startup&#8217;s] product,&#8221; adding that he &#8220;wanted to invest as soon as I tried the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Text Blaze&#8217;s round closed a few weeks ago. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale with the new funds under its belt.</p>

		Daniel Incandela is the chief marketing officer of <a href="https://terminus.com/">Terminus</a>, an ABM platform that powers high-performing go-to-market teams.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s no shortage of commentary around the chief marketing officer title these days, and certainly no lack of opinions about the role’s responsibilities and meaning within a company. There’s a reason for that. <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/about-us/press/age-and-tenure-in-the-c-suite">CMO is the shortest tenured C-suite role</a> — the average tenure of a CMO is the lowest of all C-suite titles at 3.5 years.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			CMOs either produce the numbers or we find another job.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That’s because the chief marketing officer’s role is increasingly complex. Qualifications require broad, strategic thinking while also maintaining tactical acumen across several functions. There’s a big disparity in what companies expect from CMOs. Some want a strategist with an eye for go-to-market planning, while others want a focus on close alignment with sales in addition to brand awareness, content strategy and lead generation.</p>
<p>Still other companies want their CMO to emphasize product marketing and management. Ask 10 CMOs how they define their role and you’ll get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>So, I’m sharing my honest, straight from the mouth of a tenured CMO take on what the role actually means, plus the key attributes of today’s modern CMO.</p>
<h2>We must be the Master Builder</h2>
<p>Hat tip to &#8220;The Lego Movie&#8221; for this analogy. Today’s marketing executives must bring functions and teams together. From sales and marketing alignment to product and everything in between, chief marketers are the connective tissue between every function. Driving alignment between these functions is table stakes.</p>
<p>Same goes for people teams and culture — I’ve experienced an increase in CMOs serving as the linchpin of a company’s culture. My CEO lives by the famous phrase &#8220;culture eats strategy for breakfast&#8221; and driving culture alignment now sits squarely on marketing’s shoulders.</p>
<h2>Consistently drives new opportunities</h2>
<p>Ah, demand generation. Driving new opportunity creation will continue to be a top priority for CMOs, of course. I’m not sharing anything new here, but the stakes are higher. CMOs either produce the numbers or we find another job. Doesn’t get any more straightforward than that. But, simply generating leads to check a box doesn’t cut it in board rooms anymore.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/match-group-revenue-beats-estimates-delivers-positive-outlook?sref=gni836kR">strong first-quarter earnings</a>, dating app giant Match announced its plan to introduce a new live event experience to its flagship app, Tinder. Dubbed &#8220;Vibes,&#8221; the new feature combines aspects from earlier Tinder events, <a href="https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022797811-Swipe-Surge">Swipe Surge</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/20/tinders-interactive-series-swipe-night-could-bring-a-needed-boost-to-user-engagement/">Swipe Night</a>, to create a new kind of in-app experience that&#8217;s both time sensitive and focused on finding new ways for users to break the ice.</p>
<p>Swipe Surge, for context, is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/tinder-tests-swipe-surge-in-us-to-connect-users-during-peak-times/">longtime Tinder feature</a> that lets users know when Tinder usage in the area is busier than usual. During a Surge, activity may be up to 15x higher, which increases users&#8217; potential to get matched by 250%, the company has said. Users are alerted to &#8220;Surges&#8221; via push notifications or when they open the app.</p>
<p>Swipe Night, meanwhile, was an in-app interactive series which presented a narrative where users made choices, in a sort of &#8220;choose-your-own-adventure&#8221; format. Those choices were then displayed on user profiles for a time, which gave new matches something to talk about during those first and sometimes awkward conversations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vibes pulls in elements from both earlier events.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148030" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148030" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2148030" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png 634w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.11.29-PM.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148030" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>Like Swipe Surge, users will be alerted to the Vibes events via push notifications when it&#8217;s time to engage, or they&#8217;ll see it when they open the app if notifications are turned off. And like Swipe Night, the larger goal of Vibes is to help users begin a conversation with something other than just &#8220;hey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The experience of Vibes itself is not some produced video series, however. Instead, Vibes presents users with a series of questions ranging from personality traits to pop culture. Again like Swipe Night, their responses will be displayed on their profile &#8212; in this case, for 72 hours. And when matches who participated in Vibes begin to chat, they&#8217;ll be able to see one another&#8217;s responses directly within the chat window, Tinder says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148033" style="width: 336px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148033" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2148033" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png?w=326" alt="" width="326" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png 412w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png?resize=72,150 72w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png?resize=144,300 144w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png?resize=326,680 326w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-26-at-1.01.44-PM.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148033" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>Vibes will also help to push users into <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/Tinder-Begins-Testing-Face-to-Face-Video">Tinder&#8217;s video chat</a>, which began testing last year. The company says that Vibes users will have the option to continue their conversations on video.</p>
<p>Each Vibes event will only last 48 hours, which will compress the potential user engagement into a predetermined time frame. Assuming Tinder users take to Vibes, the feature could give Tinder a dial it could turn any time it needed to drive more engagement for its app.</p>
<p>The announcement follows another <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/match-tops-earnings-expectations-as-pandemic-restrictions-ease-11620159533">big quarter</a> for Match, which surprisingly weathered the pandemic despite stay-at-home measures that dampened the potential for in-person dating. Instead, Tinder continued to grow, as users stuck at home feeling socially isolated looked for ways to connect online. However, that growth slowed at times as COVID cases spiked and more lockdowns went into effect.</p>

<p>Tinder engagement was also above pre-COVID levels in the past quarter, the company noted, with daily swipe activity up 15%, messages up 19% and conversations that are 32% longer compared with the baseline period before COVID.</p>
<p>The company says Vibes will roll out later in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re looking for motivated early-stage founders who want to take advantage of every possible opportunity to launch their startups to new levels of success. Historically, one of the most effective ways to do that is to exhibit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=superearlybird&amp;display=">Startup Alley</a>, at TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=suaintropost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23) we’re shaking up history and adding a new layer of opportunity exclusively for founders who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">apply for a Startup Alley Pass</a>. It’s called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=superearlybird&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a>, and here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Every exhibiting founder is eligible for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=superearlybird&amp;display="> Startup Alley+</a> — an experience designed to set you up with additional education, exposure and success before Disrupt even starts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, the TechCrunch team will select only 50 founders to form the cohort, and they’ll kick things off by attending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> in July — for free. That’s right. You won’t pay anything to participate in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleysuperearlybird&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=superearlybird&amp;display="> Startup Alley+</a> beyond the initial cost of your Startup Alley Pass.</p>
<p>Other perks include three months of free business development support. You’ll attend three masterclasses on topics that every early-stage founder needs to well, master:</p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is offering up one seat on the inaugural flight of its suborbital rocket New Shepard, set to take place July 20 &#8212; but instead of a fixed-price ticket sale, the seat will go to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>It’ll work like this: From May 5-19, bidders will be able to bid any amount on an auction website. From May 19, the bids will be made “unsealed,” or made visible, and bidders must continually exceed the highest bid to remain in the running for the seat. Bidding will conclude June 12 with a live online auction.</p>
<p>From Blue Origin’s website, it looks like the overall flight will be relatively quick, with the craft reaching apogee, or its highest point, four minutes after takeoff. The capsule containing the astronauts (and the lucky bidder) will land 10 minutes after takeoff near its launch site in West Texas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blue Origin said the winning bid will be donated to its charitable foundation, Club for the Future.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Blue Origin has conducted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/blue-origin-launches-and-lands-new-shepard-rocket-in-key-prep-flight-for-human-passengers/">a dress rehearsal of astronaut loading and unloading</a>. This is only the most recent move from the company, which has been testing and flight-certifying its spacecraft for the past few years.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>At a media briefing Wednesday, Blue Origin&#8217;s director of astronaut sales Ariane Cornell provided a few more details about the upcoming flight, but much is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Crew members will head to the West Texas launch site four days before launch for three days of training, she explained. They’ll be flying in a capsule designed to optimize the consumer experience, with the largest windows that have ever flown in space. It’s also pressurized, meaning crew won’t need to wear their own suits during the flight.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, Cornell said an &#8220;escape motor&#8221; is built into the rocket that would fire if any issues are detected to get the capsule (and people) away from the booster. While this mechanism is totally autonomous, there is a fire suppression system and oxygen masks that crew members may need to use manually in the case of a catastrophe.</p>
<p>“This is the type of design that has given us at Origin, our entire team, the confidence to say, ‘It is time to put people on board,’ ” Cornell said.</p>
<p>Cornell declined to share the projected ticket prices for future flights, but she did note that the company will conduct a few more crewed flights before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Cornell also did not provide details of the rest of the New Shepard&#8217;s inaugural crew, so it’s unclear if they will be Blue Origin employees or outside astronauts. In terms of physical requirements for the winning bidder, Cornell directed people to the terms and conditions on Blue Origin’s website. The winner bidder must be able to climb seven flights of stairs in 90 seconds, and they have to be between 5’0” &#8211; 6’4” and between 110-223 lbs, the T&amp;Cs state.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to go,” Cornell said.</p>

<p>Listen up to what other TC Session: Mobility attendees have told us about their experiences:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t think I’d network on a virtual platform but, it turns out, it’s a lot easier to network with more people. Folks just felt more comfortable reaching out. I had conversations with people I probably wouldn&#8217;t have met otherwise, and that was an unexpected benefit. — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>TC Sessions: Mobility isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.” — Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of home-exercise giant Peloton are falling today, off some 13.6% as of the time of writing. This comes after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">announced</a> a recall of its treadmill product, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">TechCrunch reported</a> that the company failed to fix a security issue regarding user data.</p>
<p>The value of Peloton shares soared during the pandemic, as the company&#8217;s product found itself in secular updraft driven by a move to working, and working out, from home in the face of COVID-19&#8217;s spread. Worth around $30 per share at the start of 2020, Peloton&#8217;s stock price shot to more than $150 per share by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Today, after losing more than $13 per share in value, Peloton equity is worth just $83.50 per unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s decision to recall its &#8220;Tread+&#8221; and &#8220;Tread&#8221; treadmills comes with a warning that those who had bought the devices should &#8220;immediately stop using it and contact Peloton for a full refund or other qualified remedy.&#8221; The decision to stop selling the devices, and finance a recall of all units, comes after a child died after an incident involving one of the treadmills. Other injuries have been reported.</p>
<p>The American Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, wrote that it accepted the recall and sale-cessation decision, adding that the agreement came after &#8220;weeks of intense negotiation and effort.&#8221; The CPSC had <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread">warned consumers</a> earlier this month about &#8220;the danger of popular Peloton Tread+ exercise machine after multiple incidents of small children and a pet being injured beneath the machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">fired back</a> at the time saying that it was &#8220;troubled by the [CPSC&#8217;s] unilateral press release about the Peloton Tread+ because it is inaccurate and misleading.&#8221; The company added that there was &#8220;no reason to stop using the Tread+, as long as all warnings and safety instructions are followed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s backtrack is not only incredibly embarrassing from a public perception perspective &#8212; Peloton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/consumer-agency-warns-against-peloton-tread-use-as-company-pushes-back/">got into a scrap</a> with the CPSC about whether or not it was trying to impede its investigation, which was a very bad look &#8212; but perhaps even more destructive to its brand than making the same decision earlier would have proved.</p>
<p>But for Peloton, the day&#8217;s bad news was hardly monotopical. Instead, TechCrunch reported this morning that &#8220;Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found he could make unauthenticated requests to Peloton’s API for user account data without it checking to make sure the person was allowed to request it.&#8221; As we reported, given the known high-profile politicians who are Peloton users, this is more than a mere consumer data-breach matter.</p>
<p>Even worse, Master had told Peloton about the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Masters reported the leaky API to Peloton on January 20 with a 90-day deadline to fix the bug, the standard window time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public.</p>
<p>But that deadline came and went, the bug wasn’t fixed, and Masters hadn’t heard back from the company, aside from an initial email acknowledging receipt of the bug report. Instead, Peloton only restricted access to its API to its members. But that just meant anyone could sign up with a monthly membership and get access to the API again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between the death of a child, a failed attempt to attack critics, a massive recall, the cessation of sales of a product line and a self-induced privacy fiasco, it&#8217;s a bad day for Peloton. Not that I won&#8217;t ride my own Peloton later today, I&#8217;ll just do so while shaking my fist at the corporate overloads who pay the instructors that actually make their entire business function.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.emcap.com/">Emergence</a>, the 18-year-old, San Mateo, California-based venture firm focused on enterprise tech startups, has rounded up nearly a billion dollars in capital commitments across two funds. It closed its sixth early-stage fund with $575 million; the outfit also raised a so-called opportunity fund for the first time, closing it with $375 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a significant shift away from standard operating procedure for Emergence, which has funded a string of highly successful companies at their earliest stages but has, until now, maintained a conservative approach when it comes to fundraising, closing its fifth fund in 2018 with <a href="https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/emergence-capital-announces-fund-v-dedicated-to-changing-the-way-the-world/">$435 million</a> and its fourth fund with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/02/11/emergence-capital-raises-new-335m-fund-for-cloud-enterprise-collaboration-investments/">$335 million</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>Emergence was an early investor in Zoom, Veeva, Bill.com, SuccessFactors and Box, among many other outfits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with co-founder Jason Green <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/">late last year</a> about the firm&#8217;s approach and he said then that it had picked up the pace during the pandemic.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5e8Hem5gYb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/">Enterprise investor Jason Green on SPAC hopefuls versus startups bound for traditional IPOs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise investor Jason Green on SPAC hopefuls versus startups bound for traditional IPOs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/embed/#?secret=5e8Hem5gYb" data-secret="5e8Hem5gYb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As he told TC, Emergence is now &#8220;very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we’re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they’ve started their companies or gotten seed financing.&#8221; He also said that as of late last year, the firm was poised to close more deals than &#8220;maybe [we] have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we’ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom, whose <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/04/1130354/0/en/Zoom-Raises-30M-in-Series-C-Funding-Led-by-Emergence-Capital.html">$30 million Series C</a> round was led by Emergence in 2015, made a considerable difference from a tech perspective. &#8220;Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we’re willing to invest in,&#8221; Green said at the time. &#8220;We’re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked with Green, who is stepping back from the firm, about this new fund yesterday; we&#8217;ll have more from that new conversation tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the new funds will be managed by co-founder and general partner Gordon Ritter and general partners Kevin Spain, Santi Subotovsky, Joe Floyd and Jake Saper, each of whom joined the firm as junior investment professionals. They are joined by principal Carlotta &#8220;Lotti&#8221; Siniscalco, who joined the firm in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://engineears.com/">EngineEars</a> today announced a $1 million raise. The company’s first round of funding features investments from Kendrick Lamar, DJ Mustard, Roddy Rich and <span class="il">Slauson</span> and Co. &#8220;Quality of sound is still important in music,” Lamar said in a quote provided to TechCrunch. “Ali has always been a progressive thinker. Engineers will transcend the culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service was launched in 2018 by Grammy winner Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, who has worked on a slew of high-profile tracks from artists including Lamar, Jay Rock, SZA, Nipsey Hussle and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>The educational courses turned into a touring curriculum, with 15 workshops in four countries, where Ali says he was able to determine what the community most needed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“During that time, we really learned what the problem is,” says Ali. “All of the problems entailed tracking payments, being credited, the antiquated business model of file transfers and essentially just helping an independent audio engineer sustain and create a business for themselves.”</p>
<p><div style="width: 300px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-2147653-1" width="300" height="450" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Derek-Ali-Teaser-4-4x5-1.mp4</a></video></div></p>
<h6><strong>Source:  <a href="https://www.claimastories.com/">Claima Stories </a></strong></h6>
<p>EngineEars has since branched out into something more akin to a marketplace for audio engineers. Independent mixers can offer their services and connect with artists and labels, get credit for the tracks they&#8217;ve worked on and &#8212; perhaps most importantly in the world of freelancing &#8212; get paid.</p>
<p>The platform launched an alpha version in January and since has 120 engineers verified by an existing vetting process. The invite-only service has another 2,000 people on its waiting list, according to Ali.</p>
<p>The service is currently working on a feature roadmap based on the requests of existing users and looking toward potential additions like the ability to buy beats, going forward. Other suggested features include contract negotiations for work-for-hire, but much of this is still very much in early stages.</p>
