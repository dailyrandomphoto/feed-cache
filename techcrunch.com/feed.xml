										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today announced the launch of a new support option for its Premium Support customers that run mission-critical services on its platform. The new service, imaginatively dubbed Mission Critical Services (MCS), brings Google&#8217;s own experience with Site Reliability Engineering to its customers. This is not Google completely taking over the management of these services, though. Instead, the company describes it as a &#8220;consultative offering in which we partner with you on a journey toward readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Google will work with its customers to improve &#8212; or develop &#8212; the architecture of their apps and help them instrument the right monitoring systems and controls, as well as help them set and raise their service-level objectives (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/nobl9-raises-21m-series-b-for-its-slo-management-platform/">key feature</a> in the Site Reliability Engineering philosophy).</p>
<p>Later, Google will also provide ongoing check-ins with its engineers and walk customers through tune-ups architecture reviews. &#8220;Our highest tier of engineers will have deep familiarity with your workloads, allowing us to monitor, prevent, and mitigate impacts quickly, delivering the fastest response in the industry. For example, if you have any issues&#8211;24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week&#8211;we’ll spin up a live war room with our experts within five minutes,&#8221; Google Cloud&#8217;s VP for Customer Experience, John Jester, explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This new offering is another example of how Google Cloud is trying to differentiate itself from the rest of the large cloud providers. Its emphasis today is on providing the high-touch service experiences that were long missing from its platform, with a clear emphasis on the needs of large enterprise customers. That&#8217;s what Thomas Kurian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/thomas-kurian-on-his-first-year-as-google-cloud-ceo/">promised to do</a> when he became the organization&#8217;s CEO and he&#8217;s clearly following through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is expanding its monetization options for video creators. For anyone watching videos posted by those creators, that probably means you&#8217;ll see more ads.</p>
<p>Facebook App Monetization Director Yoav Arnstein wrote in<a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators"> a blog post</a> that creators will now be able to include in-stream ads in videos that are as short as one minute — previously, the minimum was three minutes. Those ads will usually play after 30 seconds of a shorter video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we’re exploring in-stream ad formats that increase engagement through rewards or product interaction — intending to help content creator payouts grow while providing a good viewing experience for people and a way for advertisers to reach relevant audiences,&#8221; Arnstein wrote, adding that the company is &#8220;especially focused on short-form video monetization&#8221; and will be testing a way to include ads that look like stickers to Facebook Stories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/facebook-ad-breaks/">splits the revenue</a> from these ads with the video creators, and it says it&#8217;s also updating the program criteria. To participate, Facebook Pages must  nowhave 600,000 minutes of viewing time across all videos (previously only videos of three minutes or longer had counted) for the last 60 days and five or more active or Live videos.</p>
<p>On the Live side, Arnstein wrote that Facebook is moving its in-stream advertising program out of invite-only mode, allowing creators with 60,000 minutes of Live viewing in the last 60 days to participate. And it will be investing $7 million to encourage the adoption of Stars (a virtual currency that fans can use to support creators) by offering free Stars.</p>
<p>Non-advertising products are also continuing their international rollout. Arnstein wrote that paid online events (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/facebook-paid-online-events/">launched last summer</a>) are available in 20 countries, with plans to expand to 24 more (including Argentina, Hong Kong and Ireland) in the coming weeks, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/facebook-expands-fan-subscriptions/">fan subscriptions</a> are available in more than 25 countries and will be introduced in another 10 (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“It seems quite odd that no one has built the SpaceX equivalent for the ocean,” Anthony DiMare tells TechCrunch. “There’s no big, modern technology company that fits the space yet.”</p>
<p>DiMare cofounded Bedrock Ocean Exploration last year, with Charles Chiau. The latter brought a depth of robotics expertise to the space, while DiMare has experience with the oceans. His previous company, Nautilus Labs, which specialized in ocean fleet logistical planning, raised <a href="https://nautiluslabs.com/pr/nautilus-secures-11m-in-funding-led-by-m12-to-build-artificial-intelligence-for-ocean-shipping/">an $11 million Series A back 2019</a>.</p>
<p>After leave the startup, DiMare says he met up with Chiau at San Francisco diner, where the pair discussed the challenges and opportunities in mapping the ocean floor. Today Bedrock is announcing that it has raised an $8 million seed round led by Eniac Ventures, Primary Venture Partners, Quiet Capital, and R7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company notes that more than 80% of the ocean remains unmapped. And those parts that have been are often at fairly low resolution. As the CEO puts it in a press release tied this morning’s news, “A far greater percentage of the surfaces of the Moon and Mars have been mapped and studied than our own ocean floor has.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmLd1Gn0ZNk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The funding will go toward developing partnerships and building out the company’s robotics and cloud platforms. The team, which currently includes some participants from the recent Shel-sponsored X Prize ocean floor competition should be expanding, as well.</p>
<p>Among the chief uses for the technology is lying undersea cable. “As of now, it’s done in basically a one-off basis,” says DiMare. “I know that if I need to lay a cable between the United States and China, I’m going to guestimate the most efficient route and do a survey over that area and hope that it generally returns information that I need to lay a cable. But if I find something, I need to reroute it.”</p>
<p>Off-shore wind farms are major potential growth category for the company as well. “Right now we’re not working any oil companies,” says DiMare. “We didn’t know if we were going to have to go down that route. Thankfully, offshore wind has just absolutely exploded. There’s just so much work to be done in the offshore wind space that we can literally just focus on that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there were any doubt about a cryptocurrency boom, we need look no further than at the explosion of growth of certain companies in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such company is </span><a href="http://www.blockfi.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi</span></a>, which<span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced it has closed on a massive $350 million Series D funding that values it at $3 billion. While this news in and of itself is certainly attention-getting, it’s even more impressive when you consider the startup just raised a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/blockfi-just-gathered-up-50-million-to-lend-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-holders-who-dont-want-to-cash-out-yet/https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/blockfi-just-gathered-up-50-million-to-lend-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-holders-who-dont-want-to-cash-out-yet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million Series C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last August at a $450 million valuation. The latest financing brings its total equity raised since inception to about $450 million, with the company raising $100 million across its seed and Series C rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zac Prince &#8212; who comes from a background in consumer lending &#8212;  founded BlockFi with Flori Marquez in 2017. The Jersey City, New Jersey-based startup raised $1.6 million in a seed round of funding that closed in 2018 and was led by ConsenSys Ventures and included participation from SoFi.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince describes BlockFi as a financial services company for crypto market investors that offers a retail and institutional-facing suite of products. On the retail side of its platform, people can use its mobile app to earn a yield on their crypto holdings (6% on Bitcoin, 8.6% on stablecoins), buy and sell crypto and get low-cost loans secured by the value of their crypto portfolio “so they can get liquidity without selling,” he said. Specifically, clients can buy and sell digital assets (from Bitcoin, Ethereum and Link to Litecoin, PaxG and multiple stablecoins) directly on BlockFi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is also a lender and provider of trade execution services to institutions participating in digital asset markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a model that seems to be working in a big way. Since the end of 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi has seen its client base grow from 10,000 to more than 225,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BlockFi has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">265,000 funded retail clients and over 200 institutional clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s lent over $10 billion to its retail, corporate and institutional clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, BlockFi has also accomplished the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased the number of assets on its platform to $15 billion, compared to $1 billion last March &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with a 0% loss rate across its lending portfolio since inception.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bumped its monthly revenue to over $50 million, up from $1.5 million a year prior.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosted its headcount to about 530 people, compared to 100 last March.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In less than six months since we completed our Series C, Bitcoin and other digital assets have assumed a central role in many investors’ portfolios and in broader financial markets,” Prince said. “Our conviction that digital assets are the future of finance has been vindicated by our client base, which grew 10 times year over year in 2020 and has more than doubled since the end of 2020.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investor Bain Capital Ventures, partners of DST Global, Pomp Investments and Tiger Global co-led the Series D, which included participation from a slew of other firms including existing backer Valar Ventures, Breyer Capital, S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">usquehanna Government Products, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jump Capital and Paradigm, among many others. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi employees who have been employed for more than one year have the opportunity to receive liquidity on a portion of their equity via a secondary tender offer as part of the financing round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi believes that investor enthusiasm for the Series D round reflects both the company’s strong business growth, as well as “broader conviction in cryptocurrencies as an asset class.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Individual investors, institutional asset managers and corporate treasury departments are all exploring avenues to invest in cryptocurrencies,” the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal for BlockFi has always been for it to facilitate cryptocurrencies going mainstream &#8211; and each day provides more evidence that is exactly what is occurring,” said Marquez, who serves as the company’s SVP of operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bain Capital Ventures Partner Stefan Cohen agrees. He believes there are currently limited banking services available for crypto holders, which puts BlockFi in an opportune position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bitcoin has already eclipsed $1 trillion in market cap and is likely headed higher to fulfill its store of value promise. As wealth accumulates to BTC holders, most will look for ways to earn yield or borrow against their holdings for more traditional asset purchases such as homes, cars and education,” he wrote via email. “BlockFi stands alone as the leader in bringing simple, secure, everyday</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">financial services to cryptocurrency holders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s exponential growth over the past year proves “there was clearly a huge need for BlockFi&#8217;s services,” Cohen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their vision was to build an easy-to-use, trusted platform to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream, and they&#8217;ve truly succeeded,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Cohen said Bain Capital has had a long-term thesis on Bitcoin becoming a store of value and has actively invested in “picks-and-shovels businesses” that enable what is now a $1 trillion-plus market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trusted financial services are a critical pillar of the space, and we view it as a highly strategic component of the market,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup has plans to launch in the second quarter a </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/__;!!CX2e5RWqcItE!9EVtgnLwn71K2TvXxf4vaOipLnFOWx6bLP_OKEBjZqm6YTNEpW52kOSSFQ4yX7bq0Q$"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will give BlockFi clients the ability to earn Bitcoin cash back on every transaction.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlockFi already has a global presence and retail clients in over 100 countries. Last year, it opened institutional client service offices in London and Singapore.  This year, the startup is looking to add regional support in Europe, APAC and LatAm for its retail clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past week, BlockFi was making headlines for other reasons. The company was the victim </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an</span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-lending-platform-blockfi-attacked-092823993.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “unusual assault”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on March 7 when an attacker spammed the platform with fake sign-ups and abusive language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company acknowledges that it became aware that an unauthorized third party began attempting bulk sign-ups on its platform on March 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not know the origin of the email addresses used for these ‘sign-ups’  but they did not come from us and they were </span>not<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the emails of BlockFi clients,” the company told TechCrunch. “In general, we would characterize the event as vulgar spam&#8217; and the total number of valid emails affected was less than 1,000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company maintains that no data from BlockFi was accessed and its data was not compromised.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our clients’ funds and data were safeguarded throughout the incident,” the company added. “Since then, our engineering and security teams have taken steps to prevent events like this from happening in the future. In addition, we reached out directly to all of the valid email recipients to apologize for the incident.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Warehouse automation company Nimble Robotics today announced that it has raised a $50 million Series A. Led by DNS Capital and GSR Ventures and featuring Accel and Reinvent Capital, the round will go toward helping the company essentially double its headcount this year.</p>
<p>Founded by former Stanford PhD student Simon Kalouche, the system utilizes deep imitation learning – a popular concept in robotics research that helps systems map and improve through imitation.</p>
<p>“Instead of letting it sit in a lab for five years and creating this robotic application before it’s finally ready to deploy to the real world, we deployed it today,” says Kalouche. “It’s not fully autonomous – it’s autonomous maybe 90, 95% of the time. The other 5-10% is assisted by remote human operators, but it’s reliable on day one, and it’s reliable on day 10,000.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nimble is one in a long list of robotics companies to get a boast from Covid-19. The pandemic has driven both explosive growth in ecommerce and interest in automation, contributing to a significant excitement around the warehouse fulfillment tech. Nimble has also benefited from the rapid deployment of its systems.</p>
<p>“We’re not the first robotic pick, place and pack company that’s out there. We’ve grown really fast and have a lot of robots deployed in production,” Kalouche tells TechCrunch. “A lot of people have robots in the corner of a warehouse. Right now, we have heaps of robots deployed, and we’re growing really quickly. These are robots that are in production and picking tens of thousands of real orders every single day for each of our customers.”</p>
<p>In addition to the large funding round, the company is also adding two impressive names to its Board of Directors: Sequoia Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, Fei-Fei Li and Kitty Hawk/Udacity’s Sebastian Thrun.</p>
<p>“Nimble addresses both reliability and integration concerns,&#8221; Li, who’s also a seed investor, said in a release tied to the news. &#8220;Their robots have been picking reliably in production, at scale for over a year for some of the world’s largest retailers. They’ve developed an AI-powered product that makes integration fast and frictionless for their retail customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scott Galloway, the New York University professor, author, and tech entrepreneur, is taking the wraps off a $30 million Series A round for his newest company, <a href="https://www.section4.com/">Section4</a>, a platform for business &#8220;upskilling&#8221; that has now raised $37 million altogether.</p>
<p>The company is premised on the belief that millions of workers need help to stay competitive and employable, yet not all have access to, or interest in, costly graduate school programs. In fact, Section4 thinks more affordable &#8220;sprints&#8221; &#8212; or two- to three-long week courses taught by prominent professors from top schools that can also be mind expanding &#8212; is the way to go.</p>
<p>Whether that thesis proves out remains to be seen, but Section4 &#8212; whose new round was led by General Catalyst, with participation from Learn Capital and GSV Ventures &#8212; says early indications are good and that it already has 10,000 alums from dozens of countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We talked with Galloway yesterday about who, specifically, Section4 aims to serve, what percentage of its students is outside the U.S., and how universities feel about their professors participating in a startup that could eat into their own revenue. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why start this company?</strong></p>
<p>SG: Graduate education was transformative in my life, and I enjoy teaching, and we thought there was an opportunity &#8212; because of the pandemic and changing behaviors &#8212; to start an online ed concept that tried to deliver 50% to 70% of the value of an elite MBA elective at 10% of the cost and 1% of the friction.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is this competition then for shorter executive MBA programs?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I would say not even exec MBAs, because part-time MBAs  get a certification that is still incredibly valuable in the marketplace. And we don&#8217;t offer that. It&#8217;s somewhat competitive [instead] with executive education, the bring-50-people-from-Pfizer-in-for-two-days-and-charge-a-bunch-of-money-and- have-them-eat-lunch-together-on-campus-in-Palo Alto-and-throw-some-professors-at-them-for-some learning. I would argue that we&#8217;re competitive with that. It&#8217;s incredibly expensive, both financially but just trying to gather 40 or 50 executives.</p>
<p>Also, quite frankly, it&#8217;s a little bit exclusionary because a company like Verizon can only send 100 people to Wharton&#8217;s exec ed, and we&#8217;re hoping that we can run thousands of people from these companies through our programs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So these are companies that are your customers, not individuals seeking betterment for themselves.</strong></p>
<p>SG: It&#8217;s both. The funnel is: organically people sign up. And the idea is that the course costs $700, $800 versus $7,000, which is what it costs to take an elective at an elite business school right now. So for example, 120 people have organically, individually signed up on their own who work at Google. Then our expectation is that over time, these companies will approach us and say, &#8216;We would like to buy a certain number of seats or a membership that covers 100 or 1,000 of our employees.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: You say Section4 has already taught 10,000 students; when did you start offering your programming?</strong></p>
<p>SG: In March of last year. Our first course had 300 people; the course I just wrapped up had 1,500, so it scales pretty well.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s different about it is our completion rates, which are 70%-plus. The curse of online ed is that completion rates are really low because video doesn&#8217;t capture people or create an intensity, and we try to be a mix of synchronous and asynchronous, so [there is] project work and teams, live streams with the professor, and live one-on-one sessions with a TA. It&#8217;s meant to hold people accountable and engage them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re promising students access to top professors like yourself. How do the schools for which they teach feel about this? They&#8217;re perhaps helping build the brand of the school, but are there also competitive concerns?</strong></p>
<p>SG: For some yes, for some no. Some universities have asked their faculty to take a pause and not engage in any type of relationship like this, but some universities embrace it. Several students who have taken our course have sent us messages saying they are now going to apply to a full-time MBA program because they see the value and they want the certification. So I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s purely complimentary, but it&#8217;s also not purely competitive.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What is your economic relationship with these professors?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I&#8217;m not going to disclose the exact economic agreement. What I will say is that we see attracting these superstars and retaining them as key to our value proposition. And so our aim is that this is the greatest compensation per podium hour that they&#8217;re going to receive. If you have a course with 800 people, and they&#8217;re each paying $800, that&#8217;s $640,000. As you can imagine, there is a lot of gross margin capital that can be deployed or can be paid to the professor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are most of the students gravitating to this platform coming from inside or outside of the tech industry?</strong></p>
<p>SG: Fifty of the Fortune 100 [companies] have people who&#8217;ve taken our class so far, and it&#8217;s all walks. It&#8217;s pharma, it&#8217;s big AG, it&#8217;s big tech, it&#8217;s big oil. I would say we probably overindex in tech because these organizations are generous in terms of giving employees tuition remission, and I think, to a certain extent, my brand is bigger in the tech community and initially, that was kind of the awareness we had.</p>
<p>The other big cohort is middle-market companies, 10- to 500-people companies where a director there either didn&#8217;t have the opportunity or the inclination to go back to business school, but still would like a taste of supply chain from an MIT professor.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of your students are outside the U.S.?</strong></p>
<p>SG: I think it&#8217;s about 30% international. We have every continent covered.</p>
<p>We also try to reserve at least 10% of our class for scholarships. We have a rigorous scholarship process, where you send us an email saying you can&#8217;t afford it, and you get a scholarship. And a lot of our scholarships go to people internationally, because $800 in Rwanda is real money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With prices ranging from $15 to $50, the strawberries grown by the vertical farming startup <a href="https://www.oishii.com/shop">Oishii</a> aren&#8217;t going to be found in just any grocery store.</p>
<p>Instead, the nearly five year-old startup is taking what its co-founder Hiroki Koga called the Tesla approach and targeting the highest end of the market in a New York City &#8212; a place where culinary decadence is <em>de rigueur. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First of all our product. It’s almost a completely different cultivar. It has higher levels of sweetness and aroma &#8212; about two to three more times sweetness in our strawberries. People are paying for that extra experience,&#8221; Koga said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The approach is working, with the company sold out of all of its crop for the foreseeable future, Koga said. Oishii (which means &#8220;delicious&#8221; in Japanese) has also managed to convince investors, raising $50 million in financing so that it can expand its take on the vertical farming business.</p>
<p>The market is already fairly crowded with bigger, better financed startups including Bowery Farms (whose facility is steps away from Oishii&#8217;s growing space in Kearny, NJ) and Plenty, so what brought an investment firm backed by some of Japan&#8217;s biggest businesses (<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota Motor Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) from Oishii&#8217;s farm to the negotiating table?</span></p>
<p>To hear Koga tell it, it was the strawberries.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Strawberries have been said to be the holy grail of vertical farming. It takes five to ten times longer to do a complete R&amp;D cycle for a strawberry. You need to nail every single growing step,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;I’ve been in this industry for a long time since it emerged in Japan. Cracking the code for strawberries has been my personal dream.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So <a href="https://mirai.sparx.co.jp/en/">SPARX&#8217;s Mirai fund</a>, which includes investments from Toyota, Sumitomo and the asset management firm SPARX, joined investors like the <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sony Innovation Fund, PKSHA Technology, Social Starts, and several prominent angel investors to pour $50 million into the company. </span></p>
<p>“<span class="il">Oishii</span> is the farm of the future,” said SPARX Group Co. President and Group CEO Shuhei Abe<b>. </b>“The cultivation and pollination techniques the company has developed set them well apart from the industry, positioning <span class="il">Oishii</span> to quickly revolutionize agriculture as we know it.”</p>

<p>Koga has been thinking about vertical farming for nearly his entire professional career. First exposed to the industry as a young consultant with Deloitte back in the early part of the new millennia, Koga moved to the U.S. to pursue an MBA at Berkeley in 2015. It was just as the vertical farming industry was beginning to take off in the U.S. and Koga found investment firms tapping him to do due diligence on the emerging businesses coming into the market.</p>
<p>From that work, Koga knew the time was ripe to bring a new model to market, so he set about to launch Oishii. A mutual friend introduced him to his co-founder and Oishii&#8217;s chief operating officer, Brendan Sommerville, who was pursuing an MBA at UCLA at the time, and Oishii was born.</p>
<p>The thesis was to bring Japanese quality produce to the U.S. and starting with bespoke strawberries would offer the company a path to profitability on a potentially more accelerated timeframe than its competitors, Koga said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem the industry is facing is the commercial viability of the business model,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;We have to start with a crop that is profitable and when i thought about what could that be, I thought Japanese strawberries are a truly unique product that people will pay a premium for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The two moved East to prove out their thesis because New York represented a branding and culinary capital for the two West Coasters.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We wanted to launch a very strong brand and a very differentiated product we wanted to launch in a place with a very strong culinary culture,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to strawberry literally everything is shipped from California and a little bit from Florida we wanted to prove that we could do this locally and have strong demand in New York.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The city&#8217;s top chefs have been eating up the company&#8217;s &#8220;omakase&#8221; berry since it first cropped up back in 2018.  Dominique Ansel, the Instagram-famous pastry chef who invented the cronut, love them. So do the folks behind the Chef&#8217;s Table at Brooklyn Fare (now in Manhattan) <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2018/1/2/16812710/brooklyn-fare-price-increase-2018">where a full meal with wine will run a couple roughly $1300</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124035" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124035" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2124035" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png 1896w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=1536,1026 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ansel.oishii.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124035" class="wp-caption-text">Celebrity</p></div></p>
<p>With its new $50 million harvest, Oishii&#8217;s going to expand production to reach more domestic and international markets, Koga said. And the company plans to expand into other cultivars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The omakase berries are the &#8216;Roadsters&#8217;, but we actually have the model s and the model three in the pipeline already,&#8221; Koga said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to make this accessible to everybody.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>That means expanding from the company&#8217;s current facility, which is roughly the size of a few tennis courts, to another location (also in Kearny), which Koga said will be roughly the size of a football field.</p>
<p>Vertical farms pose an interesting opportunity for all sorts of investors, and Koga theorized that there could be alternative financing models for Oishii as the company proves out its technology at scale.</p>
<p>Technologically, Oishii centers its vertical farms around the pollinators that strawberries need to fertilize their plants. That means it&#8217;s basically built around a massive beehive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The entire hive lives inside our farm. We’ve optimized the whole environment not just for strawberries but for the bees,&#8221; Koga said. That means the company could potentially expand its indoor cultivation to other pollinated fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, melons, and grapes, etc. [and] most of the vegetables.. If we apply the bee pollination technology to any of these crops, then it’s a matter can we conquer each of those [other cultivation] steps.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Beyond the bees, Oishii is doubling down on automation through the development of proprietary berry picking technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">What we realized quickly is that it’s probably faster if we develop it ourselves,&#8221; Koga said of the company&#8217;s robots. &#8220;We got our prototype of a harvesting robot in a matter of two months. The visual recognition went very quickly [because it was indoors].&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company also operates as a carbon neutral business, according to Koga. The company offsets its energy consumption and plans to be going all renewable at its next growing location. &#8220;It is our intent to keep on growing like that so there&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;re doing [in farming] that&#8217;s worse,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX now has 60 more Starlink satellites in orbit – it launched its latest full complement of the internet broadband spacecraft early this morning from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Just last Thursday, SpaceX launched its last batch of 60, and this past week it also confirmed that it&#8217;s expanding its beta of the Starlink internet service to additional markets around the world, including Germany and New Zealand.</p>
<p>This is the 21st Starlink launch overall, and the sixth this year, with as many as three more launches tentatively planned for later this month, weather and schedule permitting. The simple reason it&#8217;s pursuing such an aggressive launch pace is that the more satellites it adds to its constellation in low-Earth orbit, the more customers it can sign up and serve. Starlink is currently in beta, but it&#8217;s now open to anyone to sign up depending on geography, with SpaceX taking a deposit and offering a rough timeline on projected availability.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hYApKLx0gT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/9-top-space-tech-vcs-on-the-markets-opportunities-and-challenges/">9 top space tech VCs on the market&#8217;s opportunities and challenges</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;9 top space tech VCs on the market&#8217;s opportunities and challenges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/9-top-space-tech-vcs-on-the-markets-opportunities-and-challenges/embed/#?secret=hYApKLx0gT" data-secret="hYApKLx0gT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So far, Starlink service is open to people in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Germany and New Zealand, but the plan is to achieve &#8220;near global coverage of the populated world&#8221; by the end of this year. Adding satellites to the constellation not only helps expand geographic reach, but also improves network performance. SpaceX says that currently, the beta should provide speeds ranging from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s, with latency falling between 20ms to 40ms, but that both of those metrics should improve over the coming months as more spacecraft join the network, and as SpaceX rolls out additional ground stations.</p>
<p>Already, there are anecdotal reports that Starlink&#8217;s service bests the competition in rural and hard-to-reach areas where ground infrastructure for alternative services like cellular internet, or legacy satellite from geosynchronous spacecraft-based networks have been disappointing.</p>

<p>This launch also included a successful controlled landing of the booster used to propel the Falcon 9 rocket that carried the Starlink satellites to orbit. SpaceX landed the first stage, which flew previously on five missions, including SpaceX&#8217;s first human spaceflight mission, back at its autonomous drone landing ship in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primary care startup <a href="https://goforward.com">Forward Health</a> is looking to expand its tech-powered, personalized healthcare model across the U.S., and will use a new $225 million Series D raise to help make it happen. The new capital comes from Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, SoftBank, Mark Benioff – and recording artist The Weeknd – among others. I spoke to Forward Health co-founder and CEO Adrian Aoun about his company&#8217;s plans for this fresh capital, and we also chatted briefly about how The Weeknd got involved.</p>
<p>Forward, which currently operates clinics in select U.S. markets including LA, New York, Chicago, SF and Washington, D.C., has a number of distinguishing features, but most notable are likely its tech-first approach that includes a full biometric assessment upon first visit, and its business model, which eschews insurance providers altogether and instead works based on a single flat membership fee.</p>
<p>Aoun and his co-founders created Forward Health with the idea of building a healthcare business that&#8217;s aligned with its customers in terms of incentives, which is why they sidestepped insurance altogether. That&#8217;s led to a focus on customer service and long-term patient relationships and outcomes, which Aoun says are stronger because they&#8217;re not bound by an individual&#8217;s relationship with their employer, for instance, which is often the case when an employer foots the bill for healthcare via company-provided insurance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The average person in the Bay Area is with their employer for about two and a quarter years,&#8221; Aoun told me. &#8220;So your employer is kind of sitting there thinking, if you get the flu, you&#8217;re missing three days of work – I&#8217;m out some money.&#8221; That means they&#8217;ll do things like institute programs to remind employees constantly to get their annual flu vaccine, and do other things to make that happen like provide on-premise shots. But Aoun says they&#8217;re optimizing for short-term outcomes, not long-term health – because that&#8217;s where their incentives tell them to optimize.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123975" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123975" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123975" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Interior-1-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123975" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>But when long-term healthcare programs, like lifestyle shifts that can lessen the potential of truly dangerous outcomes like heart disease and cancer, come into play, an employer who expects you to stick around for a few years at most is far less incentivized to want to fund that. Forward Health, which aims to attract subscribers and, for lack of a better term, minimize churn, actually is incentivized to make those long-term outcomes positive for everyone who comes through the door.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s part of why one focus with this new funding is to debut new doctor-led programs tailored to treating conditions that individual patients might be predisposed to – like heart health, if heart disease runs in your family, or specific types of cancer, if there&#8217;s a history of that, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got our [in-clinic] body scanners, our blood tests, our gene sequencing – we basically collect on the order of about 500 biometric data points,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;The idea is you and your doctor then figure out which which kind of programs make sense for you based upon those.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, Aoun says he&#8217;s actually at fairly high risk for developing heart disease, so there&#8217;s a Forward program that includes doing a heart risk analysis, blood tests, and regular at-home monitoring of key risk factors like blood pressure and weight. Another program for cancer prevention includes measures designed to help lessen the risk of contracting the top five cancers in terms of prevalence — so Forward created a dermatoscope for that, which is essentially a skin scanner to map out an individual&#8217;s moles and skin features and alert them of any changes.</p>

<p>This builds on work that Forward began at the outset of COVID-19 — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/forward-launchesafarward-at-home-primary-care-service-to-address-covid-19-healthcare-crunch/">&#8216;Forward at Home&#8217;</a> program, which includes sending patients home with specialized sensors for remote care. Another specialized program tailored to COVID-19 actually offers monitoring specific to the disease in order to track a patient&#8217;s progress safely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now launching programs for all the top diseases to help you get ahead of them,&#8221; Aoun said. &#8220;And whatever kind of programs you&#8217;re using, you walk away with plans that are tailored to you, again, to counsel you not only on the potential risks for the things like the cancer and heart disease, but also to be proactive, with guidance from diet, to exercise, to stress, and to sleep, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The programs are supported by Forward&#8217;s 24/7 worldwide care support team, which subscribers can access via their mobile app. It&#8217;s also complemented by the check-ins with your physician via the &#8216;Forward at Home&#8217; in-home virtual visits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123976" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123976" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2123976" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Technology-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2123976" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Forward Health</p></div></p>
<p>While Forward is already rolling these out, it has plans to continue to develop new ones, and it&#8217;s also monitoring results in order to understand how they&#8217;re working for users, and will be sharing that data once it has collected a significant sample. I asked Aoun how Forward can scale this kind of personalized care – especially now that the startup plans to open additional locations in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Basically, Aoun said that Forward approached it as an engineering problem. He argues that most solutions in healthcare see the fundamental issue as a labor problem — but trying to scale that, with the salaries that medical professionals command, and the limited availability of skilled talent, makes no sense. Especially because consumers are naturally looking for improvements in their standard of care over time, in the same way they expect improvements in the products they buy or services they use.</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a chain of increasingly specific medical professionals to address individual health risks and needs, Aoun said Forward identified that there&#8217;s a massive amount of overlap in preventative care courses of action. The Forward team focused on breaking the fundamental elements down into what equate roughly to reusable Lego blocks, which can be recombined with relative speed and repeatability to produce a program that&#8217;s nonetheless tailored to an individual&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Combined with Forward Health&#8217;s longitudinal approach to care, these programs and their recombinant nature should prove a good dataset from which to assess how a direct, client-focused primary care model affects overall health.</p>
<p>And, because I promised, I&#8217;ll leave you with how Aoun says The Weeknd got involved in the Series D.</p>
<p>&#8220;He literally just walked by one of our locations, and walked in and was like, &#8216;This is awesome,&#8217; and then asked a friend, who asked a friend, who asked a friend to get connected,&#8221; he told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three and a half years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/17/google-debuts-tez-a-mobile-wallet-and-payments-app-for-india/">launching Google Pay in India</a>, the Android-maker is paving the way to tap its users’ transaction data for monetization purposes &#8212; though it plans to give them ample warning, and the option to opt-out.</p>
<p>Google said on Thursday that it will roll out an update to Google Pay next week that will ask users to choose whether they wish to share data with the company.</p>
<p>Currently, Google makes limited use of users’ data based on their behaviour on the app, for instance, to prominently display relevant offerings. But the company has so far not used its users’ transactions data for monetary purposes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That changes starting next week. Users can choose to prevent Google from making any usage of their data, even those that are not transactional, the company said. And by default, users are assumed to be opting-out of sharing their data with Google, the company said.</p>
<p>But for those users who do agree to share data with Google, the company will be using it to make personalized offers. The company asserted that it will not show ads to Pay users and reiterated that it will not sell their data to anyone and the transaction history will not be shared with any other Google product for targeting ads.</p>
<p>Ambarish Kenghe, VP of Product Management at Google, told TechCrunch in an interview that Google is offering this option to users &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; so that they have a better understanding of what data they are sharing with Google.</p>
<p>Users can choose to change their mind at a later date, and they can also choose to delete records of certain transactions. Those who do not agree to share data with Google won&#8217;t lose access to any of Pay app&#8217;s features, the company said.</p>
<p>The move is not a reaction to any regulatory notice from New Delhi, said Kenghe. For what it is worth, plenty of apps in the country tap a user’s transaction history to offer them deals &#8212; and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-backed-app-lenders-use-phone-data-to-hassle-borrowers-11574969095">sometimes go</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/google-cracks-down-on-personal-loan-apps-in-india-following-abuse-and-outcry/">extreme lengths</a>. And unlike Google, very few have been transparent.</p>
<p>“We sincerely hope that people will appreciate the ability to easily see and control how their data is used, and enjoy delightful product experiences irrespective of the choices they make on Google Pay,” <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/03/your-privacy-at-heart-of-google-pay.html">wrote</a> Kenghe in a blog post.</p>
<p>“As India embraces digital payments, we remain committed to bringing the industry along to ensure that we keep raising the bar to deploy state-of-the-art data security and privacy measures and put the users in-charge of how their data is used.”</p>
<p>Google, which competes with Walmart-backed PhonePe and SoftBank-backed Paytm in India, has amassed over 70 million users on its payments app in the country.</p>
<p>But despite the scale, Google Pay doesn&#8217;t make any money for peer-to-peer transactions between users because the underlying railroad &#8212; UPI &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">doesn&#8217;t support a business model</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taavet Hinrikus, the first employee of Skype and co-founder of fintech giant Wise (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly TransferWise</a>), is teaming up with Teleport co-founder and current Topia CPO Sten Tamkivi to create a new investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Both are already seasoned investors &#8212; Hinrikus is one of Europe&#8217;s bona fide super angels, with <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/inside-taavet-fund/">over 100 investments to his name</a> &#8212; and have already done a number of tickets together. The new as yet unnamed venture will see the pair’s investment activities formalised as an equal partnership and be supported by a team of six people based in Estonia, including an investment analyst.</p>
<p>Just don’t call it a VC fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I&#8217;m still not setting up a fund, but am partnering to help do more of the same on the investing side,” Hinrikus told me last week in a text message.</p>
<p>For the last few years &#8212; perhaps prompted by swapping the role of CEO of Wise for chairperson &#8212; there’s been speculation within London’s increasingly chatty venture capital scene that he might raise a fund of his own or join an A-list VC firm as a partner. The Wise founder actually spent about a year as a venture partner at Mosaic Ventures, which ended last summer and went unreported.</p>
<p>“When you say fund, this means other people&#8217;s money and a specific mandate (i.e. invest in seed or late, in biotech or fintech, promise to return the money in a certain time, etc.),” Hinrikus said in an email earlier this week. He also explained that the new firm will not be seeking outside LPs and will be “evergreen”, enabling it to make considerably longer-term bets than many VC funds. Instead, Hinrikus and Tamkivi are happy to hold investments for 10-20 years.</p>
<p>“This structure is both liberating and differentiating, because without strict external mandates we can go after the missions we feel passionate about and be really patient about how long we stay involved in our companies,” said Tamkivi in an email.</p>
<p>“[We] will not be the one pushing a founder to sell,” underlines Hinrikus. “Will always stay on the founder&#8217;s side as we&#8217;ve been in that position ourselves”.</p>
<p>The pair’s combined portfolios focus mostly on Europe but also further afield, including the U.S., Japan and Singapore. Mutual investments (or shareholdings) include Wise, Bolt, Veriff, LHV, Xolo, Oyster HR, Pactum, Starship, Curve, Sunrise and Acapela.</p>
<p>Hinrikus and Tamkivi have also jointly contributed to several “mission driven” nonprofit endeavours such as Jõhvi School of Technology, Good Deed Education Fund or Vabamu Museum of Freedom and Occupations, which they, and the new firm’s back office, will continue to support. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/">Hinrikus co-founded Certific</a>, which is building the rails for home health testing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Dyd5T5U4NY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/">Certific, a health tech startup from the founder of TransferWise, aims to be the rails for certified home testing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Certific, a health tech startup from the founder of TransferWise, aims to be the rails for certified home testing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/certific/embed/#?secret=Dyd5T5U4NY" data-secret="Dyd5T5U4NY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Hinrikus and Tamkivi say their new investment firm will back tech companies with a €250,000 to €1 million seed investment, but also has the freedom to follow on right up to an IPO. In most instances, it doesn’t expect to lead rounds but hopes to be seen as more collaborative than competitive.</p>
<p>“In short, we will be doing more of the same: give founder-backing to more upcoming founders,” said Hinrikus. “What excites us most is the future ahead and finding positive missions that improve our future. So far it&#8217;s been lots of future of work, future of finance, but in the future we&#8217;d love to think more about future of health and climate as well”.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a bit more conscious effort to figure out what our theses and strategy will be for completely new areas,&#8221; adds Tamkivi. &#8220;As humans, we both care about longevity, health, education, democracy &#8212; if we find ways how to move these huge problem spaces along with capital, we are very eager to learn&#8221;.</p>
<p>The pair are also willing to take positions in crypto tokens, real assets or any alternative financial instruments.</p>
<p>“On a high level you can think of DeFi as just a natural extension of our broader ‘future of money’ financial freedom thesis,” said Tamkivi. “When it comes to technical execution, we’ve benefited a lot from the freedom to invest not just in equity of established companies, but to also take token positions, use on-chain yield strategies or work with specialized venture funds. Whatever helps our founders”.</p>
<p>To that end, the new investment fund is breaking cover with very little fanfare &#8212; and, as mentioned, it doesn’t even have a name yet. “&#8217;Have you talked to Taavet and Sten yet?&#8217; should work fine for now,” quipped Hinrikus, in his own deadpan style of humour I’ve become accustomed to over the years.</p>
<p>“More seriously, we are just getting started together,” clarified Tamkivi. “[We’re] still figuring out what kind of structure, processes, new talent and other things, such as additional branding, we’ll need as we scale up the activities from our lives as individual angels to date”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional process of buying, insuring and financing cars across emerging markets can be challenging, and it defeats the purpose of building an all-around car shopping experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/">FlexClub</a>, a South African company, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with $5 million to improve drivers&#8217; experience in these markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 by <a href="https://mx.linkedin.com/in/marlongallardo">Marlon Gallardo</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/rudolfvavruch">Rudolf Vavruch</a> and <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/truzane">Tinashe Ruzane</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is an online marketplace that connects customers looking for flexible access to long-term cars with its partners, offering car subscriptions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same year, the company closed a $1.2 million seed round led by CRE Venture Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ruzane, the company&#8217;s CEO, this $5 million (in equity and debt) is a seed extension round, bringing the total investment raised by FlexClub to over $6 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it will use the funding to improve its technology which protects and limit partners&#8217; exposure to risk.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across emerging markets in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia, most ride-hailing drivers don&#8217;t have access to car financing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they rent their cars via social media, classified sites, or connect with a car owner willing to rent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was the model FlexClub launched in South Africa, and after raising $1.2 million, it expanded to Mexico.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnering <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/en/private">with Uber</a> in both countries and helping their community of drivers subscribe for cars, FlexClub claims to have garnered traction but wouldn&#8217;t divulge numbers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These customers, including those who use the cars for deliveries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commercial members by FlexClub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December last year, the company decided to open up its product to another set of customers who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are called</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private members</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we first started, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on phase one of our strategy, which came from our knowledge about ride-hailing drivers because of our careers at Uber,&#8221; Ruzane said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to help a community of ride-hailing drivers that had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been excluded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from accessing cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But right now, we&#8217;ve built the product to work for anyone and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ride-hailing drivers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In FlexClub&#8217;s <a href="https://flexclub.co.za/en/how-it-works">marketplace</a>, cars<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are subscribed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for between a hybrid of short- and long-term lease</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It means customers pay an all monthly inclusive fee, and at any time, they can cancel a subscription, switch cars or buy it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to buy a car from FlexClub, drivers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are encouraged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">safely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comply with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FlexClub&#8217;s recommendations while using the car</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doing that earns them points that accumulate over time, making cars cheaper to buy if they choose to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, alongside the use of banking, credit bureau and identity data, lets FlexClub assess its members&#8217; risk profile and reward them when need be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruzane says last year was challenging for the company because of what it meant for mobility. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic, ride-hailing members had financial difficulties. Still, the company partnered with delivery platforms to allow ride-hailing drivers to use their cars to transport goods and packages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that period, FlexClub was also able to partner with large brands like U.S. car rental company Avis to offer car subscriptions on its marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Avis, Ruzane says the company&#8217;s partners range from small fleet owners to multinational fleet operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic made it possible for FlexClub to think outside the box and enlist these partners on its platform. However, it didn&#8217;t come easy as FlexClub has had to earn trust by building credibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the challenges we have faced was that we had to build a reputation to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be trusted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took us two years to get a brand like Avis to see the value in putting their subscription offers on FlexClub</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with that established, it&#8217;s now a lot easier for us to continue investing in driving this new distribution model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He likens the distribution model of the automotive industry to how the music industry was decades ago. Then, CDs dominated music revenue but has now given way to streaming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you look at what the music industry looked like 10 years ago, over 50% of music revenue was CDs. Now over 80% is streaming. The industry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transitioned from product-led distribution to service-led distribution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s what we can expect in the automotive industry over the next decade,&#8221; Ruzane remarked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can be an ally to the automotive industry in driving that evolution because we&#8217;ve tested our product in a marketplace with the segment of the population that people thought wasn&#8217;t a good profile of customers to serve</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub&#8217;s expansion to Mexico instead of other African countries continues a series of global expansion that has become common for South African companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two factors decided the move for FlexClub, according to the CEO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the founders are from both countries &#8212; Marlon Gallardo is Mexican while Rudolf Vavruch and Tinashe Ruzane are South Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Next, both markets have a lot of similarities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how the automotive industry works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa and Mexico have large manufacturing bases and advanced secondary markets where brands can lease used cars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya and Nigeria, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have a different automotive value chain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there&#8217;s a growing manufacturing industry in both countries, it is still nascent as most vehicles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are imported</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from countries like the U.S. and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Japan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Tinashe says there&#8217;s an opportunity to take FlexClub to not only these regions but most emerging markets around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is in no rush to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FlexClub has been able to attract investors who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its mission of democratizing access to car financing and becoming a global mobility company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://kindredventures.com/">Kindred Ventures</a>, its lead investor, has backed mobility-first companies like Postmates, Uber and Virgin Hyperloop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other VC investors include <a href="https://cre.vc/">CRE Venture Capital</a> and </span><a href="https://endeavor.co.za/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angel investors like Matt Mullenweg, founder of WordPress; Federico Ranero, COO of KAVAK; Tariq Zaid, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Shopify and Getaround; and Ron Pragides, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Twitter and Salesforce, also took part in the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a>, a Ghanaian health tech startup that manages prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, today announced its expansion to Ethiopia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Shoukimas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregory Rockson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and James Finucane in 2013</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It specializes in vendor-managed inventory, retail pharmacy operations and market intelligence serving hospitals, pharmacies and patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, the pharmaceutical market <a href="https://blog.private-sector-and-development.com/app/uploads/2019/02/PRO-Revue28-UK-key-figures.pdf">worth $50 billion</a> faces challenges such as sprawling supply chains, low order volumes, and exorbitant prices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Africans still suffer preventable or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treated diseases because they cannot afford to buy their medications</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a presence in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and Zambia, as well as two unnamed countries, mPharma wants to increase access to these medications at a reduced cost while assuring and preserving quality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to serve over 100,000 patients monthly and has distributed over a million drugs to Africans from 300 partner pharmacies across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Rockson says that when mPharma started eight years ago, he wanted to own a pan-African brand with operations in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria from the get-go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2018, mPharma went live in the West African country. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the health tech acquired Haltons, the second-largest pharmacy chain in Kenya, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entering the market and gaining 85% ownership in the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it seemed like a stretch to the Ghanaian-based company to expand to the East African country as it met several pushbacks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rockson attributes this to the harsh nature of doing business with foreign companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ethiopia is one of the most closed economies on the continent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has made it a bit hard for other startups to launch there </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the government rarely allows foreign investments in the retail sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rockson, most foreign brands operate in the country through franchising, a method mPharma has employed for its expansion into Africa&#8217;s second most populous nation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company signed a franchise agreement with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belayab Pharmaceuticals is a part of the Belayab Group &#8212; a conglomerate that is also an official franchisee of companies like Pizza Hut and Kia Motors in Ethiopia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockson says we should expect the partnership to open two pharmacies in Addis Ababa this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each pharmacy will offer the company&#8217;s consumer loyalty membership program called Mutti, where they&#8217;ll get discounts and financing options to access medication</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This franchising is a part of mPharma&#8217;s growth plans of enabling companies looking to enter the pharmacy retail sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is to provide access to a &#8220;pharmacy-in-a-box&#8221; solution where mPharma handles every infrastructure involved, and the pharmacy is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concerned about the consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;ve done is that we enable these pharmacies with our software, and we have the backend physical infrastructure and warehousing,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;They can rely on mPharma to do all the background work from getting the products into your pharmacy and also providing the software infrastructure to be able to run delivery services while they focus on clinical care</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mPharma is one of the well-funded healthtech startups in Africa and has raised over $50 million. L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ast year when <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/">it secured a Series C round</a> of $17 million, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S., was appointed to its board</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She joined Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and Chairman of Novartis as members who have decades of experience in the pharmaceutical industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sort of backing, both in expertise and investment, has proven vital to how mPharma runs operations. Rockson</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn&#8217;t mince words when saying t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he company wants to dominate African healthcare with Ethiopia, its toughest market to enter, already secured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are issues of fragmentation in pharmacy retailing, poor standards and high prices that haven&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been fixed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The African opportunity is still huge, and we are still at the beginning stages of privatisation of healthcare on the continent,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://snyk.io/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://snyk.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq1JZDZuQaIdS9a8AgRcM93RyCYw">Snyk</a>, a developer of application security technology, is now worth $4.7 billion after a new fundraising and secondary sale that totaled $300 million.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In all, investors have poured $470 million into the company after this new investment, which was led by Accel and Tiger Global, with participation from a host of existing investors including Addition, Boldstart Ventures, Canaan Partners, Coatue, GV, Salesforce Ventures, and funds managed by Blackrock.</p>
<p>New investors joining Accel and Tiger on the cap table included Alkeon, Atlassian Ventures, Franklin Templeton, Geodesic Capital, Sands Capital Ventures and Temasek.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Withe big valuation and very very late stage investors on the cap table, it&#8217;s likely that this will be Snyk&#8217;s last round before a public offering. And the markets for enterprise software companies have been white hot recently, so the reception for Snyk should be positive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk&#8217;s value and sky high valuation comes from its ability to offer an application security platform that the company said is designed to provide security visibility and remediation for every component of modern applications &#8212; including their code, open source libraries, container infrastructure and infrastructure as code.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Investors seem to believe the company&#8217;s claims and so do a clutch of key new hires including Chief Marketing and Customer Experience Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-yoshimura-4055/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-yoshimura-4055/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDx75GcLzuX3-0isJzxLyk1hDBYQ">Jeff Yoshimura</a>, a former executive at Elastic; CIO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericahgeil/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericahgeil/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3AMQAms9KsQog_P6n_VN2Er0Fjw">Erica Geil</a>, who previously worked at Groupon; and Vice President, Asia Pacific Japan (APJ) Sales, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunmclagan/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunmclagan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXCkA9FMp9j-v9w8cDsPHN00gxOw">Shaun McLagan</a>, who previously worked for EMC.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the funding, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-scarpelli-1b289b9/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-scarpelli-1b289b9/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGwcDxhmwduZYsaL74QTnPOEAMCA">Michael Scarpelli</a>, the Chief Financial Officer of the enterprise software darling and last year&#8217;s blockbuster public offering, Snowflake, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/pingli8?challengeId=AQH4Skg5DseKkgAAAXfV2MpFVWtEVbvX1iSxPZyz_VitzojRpiuLYmlbQveU65dLjYh4a_688kLVQb6gnT5DCqBbPJyuuSZ_EQ&amp;submissionId=ad85cf22-cbca-6616-5efe-6ec3ebb61811" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/pingli8?challengeId%3DAQH4Skg5DseKkgAAAXfV2MpFVWtEVbvX1iSxPZyz_VitzojRpiuLYmlbQveU65dLjYh4a_688kLVQb6gnT5DCqBbPJyuuSZ_EQ%26submissionId%3Dad85cf22-cbca-6616-5efe-6ec3ebb61811&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615509971016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxOquWHJZj9NVJXcvFghyaZIjYHw">Ping Li</a>, a longtime enterprise software investor and a Partner at Accel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We first met the Snyk team at the start of their journey, as early investors,” said Li, in a statement. “Throughout our partnership, we’ve witnessed first-hand Snyk’s unshakeable dedication to developer and security teams and their original vision become a reality. We’re looking forward to supporting the successes of Snyk in 2021 and beyond.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Snyk&#8217;s financing comes as application vulnerabilities are becoming an increasingly popular attack vector for hackers. Roughly 43% of data breaches have been linked back to flaws in applications, according to the company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a dearth of developers focused on security means that automation has to do more heavy lifting. Snyk says it provides that through automated remediation and the integration of security features directly into developer workflows. The company also offers real-time answers to coders&#8217; security questions.</p>
<p>So far, that suite of services has meant more than 27 million developers around the world are using Snyk tools and the company also provides a marketplace for security coders to pitch their own tools on the Snyk platform.</p>
<p>“We believe Snyk’s developer-first approach to security is a fantastic tool for developers and organizations today,” said Chris Hecht, Head of Corporate Development, Atlassian. “Snyk has already showcased some amazing integrations with our tools, and we’re now thrilled to extend our partnership with them through an Atlassian Ventures investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Montreal-based <a href="https://www.heyday.ai">Heyday</a> announced today that it has raised $6.5 million Canadian ($5.1 million in US dollars) in additional seed funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Steve Desjarlais told me that the startup&#8217;s goal is to allow retailers to support more automation and more personalization in their online customer interactions, while co-founder and CMO Etienne Merineau described it as an &#8220;all-in-one unified customer messaging platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>So whether a customer is sending a message from Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Google’s Business Messages or just via email, Heyday brings all that communication together in one dashboard. It then uses artificial intelligence to determine whether it&#8217;s a customer service or sales-related interaction, and it automates basic responses when possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Heyday chatbots can provide order updates or even recommend products (it integrates with Salesforce, Shopify, Magento, Lightspeed and PrestaShop), then route the conversation to a human team member when necessary.</p>
<p>There are other platforms that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/gorgias-series-b/">combine customer service and sales</a>, but at the same time, Merineau said it&#8217;s important to treat the two categories as distinct and trust that a good service experience will lead to sales in the feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123908" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123908" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123908" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="Heyday screenshot" width="680" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123908" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Heyday</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that helping is the new selling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Desjarlais added, &#8220;We’re really against the ticket ID system. A customer is not a ticket &#8230;<br />
I truly believe that every single customer is a relationship with a brand that needs to be nurtured over time and that will give more value to the brand over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heyday was founded in 2017 and says that over the past two quarters, it has doubled recurring revenue. Customers include French sporting good company Decathlon, Danish fashion house Bestseller to food and consumer product brand Dannon — Merineau noted that the platform was &#8220;bilingual out of the box&#8221; and has seen strong international growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retailers who believe that [the changes brought about by] COVID-19 are temporary are in the wrong mindset,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The new mantra of future-forward brands is &#8216;adapt or die.&#8217; &#8230; Brands obviously want to delvier great service, but they care about the bottom line. We help them kill two birds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> with one stone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The startup had previously raised $2 million Canadian,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/heyday"> according to Crunchbase</a>. This new round comes from existing investors Innovobot and Desjardins Capital. Merineau said the money will help Heyday &#8220;double down on the U.S. and scale.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month Jeff Bezos announced he would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">step down as CEO of Amazon</a> later this year, moving into the executive chairman role, while passing the baton to AWS CEO Andy Jassy. Could Marc Benioff, co-founder, chairman and CEO at Salesforce be the next big-name executive to make a similar move?</p>
<p>A Reuter&#8217;s story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-ceo/exclusive-salesforces-taylor-emerges-as-ceo-candidate-sources-idUSKBN2B12C0?il=0">published on Monday</a> suggested that could be the case. Citing unnamed sources, the story indicated that Benioff&#8217;s CEO exit could happen this year. Further those same sources suggested that current Salesforce president and COO Bret Taylor is the likely heir apparent.</p>
<p>We wrote a story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">at the end of last year</a> speculating on possible successors to Benioff, were he to step away from the CEO role. There were a number of worthy candidates, several of whom, like Taylor, came to the company via an acquisition. All the same, we thought that Taylor seemed to be the most likely candidate to replace Benioff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We asked Salesforce for a comment on the Reuter&#8217;s story. A company spokesperson told us that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation.</p>
<p>While the entire scenario fits firmly in the rumor and speculation column, it is not entirely unlikely either. What would it mean if Benioff stepped away and what if Taylor was truly the next in line? And how would that swap compare with the Bezos decision were it to happen?</p>
<h2>Similar yet different</h2>
<p>Salesforce and Amazon are both companies founded in the 1990s, each looking to shake up its industry.</p>
<p>For Amazon, it was changing the way goods (starting with books) were bought and sold. And for Benioff the goal was changing the way software was sold. Bezos famously founded his company in his garage. Benioff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">built his in a rented apartment</a>. From these humble beginnings both have built iconic companies and accumulated enormous wealth. You could understand why either could be ready to step away from the daily grind of running a company after all these years.</p>
<p>Bezos announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">veteran executive Andy Jassy,</a> who runs the company&#8217;s cloud arm, would be his replacement when the handoff comes. Jassy knows the organization&#8217;s priority mix as he&#8217;s been working at the company for more than two decades. He&#8217;s locked into the culture and helped take AWS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">from idea</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">$50 billion juggernaut</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wGH44CNl6B"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=wGH44CNl6B" data-secret="wGH44CNl6B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Benioff hasn&#8217;t made any actual firm pronouncement, we have seen Bret Taylor &#8212; who joined the company in 2016 when Salesforce purchased <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">his startup Quip for $750 million</a> &#8212; move quickly up the ladder.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and analyst at SMB Group, who has been following Salesforce since its earliest days, says that if Benioff were to leave, he would obviously leave big shoes to fill. But she agreed that everything seems to point to Taylor as his successor should that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce has been grooming Taylor for awhile. He has some stellar credentials both at Salesforce, his own start-up, Quip, that Salesforce acquired, and at Facebook. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind he can lead Salesforce forward, but he&#8217;ll bring a different more low-key style to the role. And I&#8217;m sure Benioff will stay very involved [&#8230;],&#8221; McCabe said.</p>
<h2>Two different situations</h2>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that while he believes Taylor could be chosen as Benioff&#8217;s successor, and would be qualified to lead the company, he&#8217;s taken a very different path from Jassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Benioff moving on could be different from Bezos in the sense that Jassy has been at Amazon for over 20 years and was there to basically see and be part of most of the story. [&#8230;] But if Taylor were to succeed Benioff there&#8217;s not as much [history] at Salesforce with him not being on board until the Quip acquisition in 2016,&#8221; Leary said.</p>
<p>Leary wonders if this relatively short history with the company could create some political friction in the organization if he were chosen to succeed Benioff. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that this would happen, but choosing one of the many possible heirs that have come via a number of high profile acquisitions could possibly lead to high level turnover from those not picked to succeed Benioff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says that if you look at the range of candidates available, he believes that Taylor would be the best choice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect any issue because there is no one with a similar or even better background, which is when there are problems &#8212; that or when people are in an open competition as it used to be at GE,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know for sure what the final outcome will be, but if Benioff does decide to join Bezos and takes the executive chairman mantle at the company, it makes sense that the person to replace him will be Taylor. But for now, it remains in the realm of speculation, and we&#8217;ll just to wait and see if that&#8217;s what comes to pass.</p>

<p>The new group will be led by Joe Bryan, who was appointed as a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense focused on climate earlier this year.</p>
<p>The move is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-biggest-step-the-biden-administration-took-on-climate-yesterday-wasnt-rejoining-the-paris-agreement/">one of several steps that the Biden administration has taken</a> to push an agenda that looks to address the dangers posed by global climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bryan, who previously served as deputy assistant to the Secretary of the Navy for Energy under the Obama administration, will oversee a group intended to coordinate the Department&#8217;s responses to Biden&#8217;s recent executive order and subsequent climate and energy-related directives and track implementation of climate and energy-related actions and progress, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense controls the purse strings for hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending and is a huge consumer of electricity, oil and gas, and industrial materials. Any steps it takes to improve the efficiency of its supply chain, reduce the emissions profile of its fleet of vehicles, and use renewable energy to power operations could make a huge contribution to the commercialization of renewable and sustainable technologies and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Pentagon is already including security implications of climate change in its risk analyses, strategy development and planning guidance, according to the statement, and is including those risk analyses in its installation planning, modeling, simulation and war gaming, and the National Defense Strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it is increasing platform efficiency to improve freedom of action in contested logistics environments, or deploying new energy solutions to strengthen resilience of key capabilities at installations, our mission objectives are well-aligned with our climate goals,&#8221; wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement. &#8220;The department will leverage that alignment to modernize the force, strengthen our supply chains, identify opportunities to work closely with allies and partners, and compete with China for the energy technologies that are essential to our future success.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A newly launched Mac app called <a href="https://superpowered.me/">Superpowered</a> aims to make it easier to stay on top of all your Zoom calls and Google Meets, without having to scramble to find the meeting link in your inbox or calendar app at the last minute. Instead of relying on calendar reminders, Superpowered offers a notification inbox for the Mac menu bar that alerts you to online meetings just before they start, which you can then join with a click of a button.</p>
<p>To use Superpowered, you first <a href="https://superpowered.me/onboarding">download the app</a> then authorize it to access to your Google Calendar. The app currently works with any Google account, including G Suite, as well as your subscribed calendars.</p>
<p>Once connected, Superpowered pulls all your events into the menu bar, which you can view at any time throughout the day with a click or by using the keyboard shortcut Command+Y.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you have a meeting coming up, Superpowered will display a drop-down notification to alert you, or you can opt for a more subtle halo effect instead to have it get your attention. You can also configure other preferences &#8212; like whether you want a chime to sound, how far in advance you want to be alerted, whether you want a meeting reminder as text to appear in the menu bar ahead of the meeting and so on.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time for the meeting, all you have to do is click the button it displays to join your Zoom call or Google Meet. The solution is simple, but effective. The startup plans to add support for more integrations going forward, including Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx and others.</p>
<p>The idea for the app comes from four computer science and software engineering students from the University of Waterloo, who previously interned at tech companies like Google, Facebook, Asana and Spotify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123817" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123817" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123817" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123817" class="wp-caption-text">Team photo.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Wanting to build a startup of their own, the team applied to the accelerator Y Combinator with an idea to build a lecture platform for professors. But they soon faced issues in keeping up with their own calendar appointments as they began to conduct user research interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were struggling to keep up with each other&#8217;s calendars and balance all these meetings throughout the day,&#8221; explains Superpowered co-founder Jordan Dearsley, who built the service alongside teammates Nikhil Gupta, Ibrahim Irfan and Nick Yang. &#8220;We would be at lunch and be like, &#8216;Oh shoot, we have a meeting now &#8212; I have to run!&#8217; or just completely miss it altogether,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Irfan had the idea to just put a button in the Mac menu bar to make it easier to join Zoom meetings and soon the team pivoted to work on Superpowered instead.</p>
<p>The product itself is very new. Development work began roughly two months ago and Superpowered <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/superpowered-2">opened up to users just last month</a> &#8212; a quick pace that Dearsley says was possible because three of the four team members are engineers, and the other, Yang, is the designer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123820" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?w=603" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png 1689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=768,866 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=603,680 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=1362,1536 1362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123820" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a paid product offered at $10 per month, Superpowered already has hundreds of users who are interacting with the app, on average, 10 times per day. Busier users, like product managers, are clicking on Superpowered as many as 20 to 40 times per day &#8212; an indication that it&#8217;s found a place in users&#8217; workflows. In the month since its launch, the app has connected users with over 10,000 online meetings, the company says.</p>
<p>Superpowered is not the first to add calendar appointments to the Mac&#8217;s menu bar. It competes with a range of products, like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/meetingbar">MeetingBar</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meeter-fast-call-initiation/id1510445899?mt=12">Meeter</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-meeting/id1017470484?mt=12">Next Meeting</a> and others. But users have been responding to Superpowered&#8217;s sleek, clean design.</p>
<p>The company also has a vision for the product&#8217;s future that extends beyond meetings. After solving this particular pain point, Superpowered plans to broaden its scope to fix other annoyances for knowledge workers &#8212; like Slack notifications, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really annoying to be pinged all the time while I&#8217;m coding … and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s worth seeing because Slack doesn&#8217;t really give me those controls or ability to peek,&#8221; explains Dearsley. Meanwhile, Mac&#8217;s built-in Notification Center isn&#8217;t smart enough to show you just those items that you really need to know about.</p>
<p>To address this, the team is now working on a Slack integration that will let you quickly check your messages and reply without having to launch the Slack app. Further down the road, the team wants to integrate support for other platforms &#8212; like Google Docs, JIRA and GitHub &#8212; which would all be pulled into Superpowered&#8217;s universal notification inbox.</p>
<p>For the time being, Superpowered is $10 per month for Mac users or $8 per month for those who sign up with a team. Annual pricing is not yet available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Actor Terry Crews is going in on the blockchain. With the help of social currency startup <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a>, Crews is launching his own social currency, $POWER.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s break down what that means. Anyone can create a social currency, which hundreds of creators have already done via Roll, to change their relationships with fans and users. Roll enables creators to mint and distribute their own social currency under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 standard</a> and then determine the ways in which their communities can earn and spend that social currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own content,&#8221; Roll founder and CEO Bradley Miles told TechCrunch. &#8220;We refer to this as mass personalization of content. Right now, Roll is experiencing the same thing with money itself. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way I think of it is it&#8217;s almost like the process for earning and redeeming credit card points but minus the credit card company and plus the blockchain and creators. I haven&#8217;t run this analogy by Miles, but I&#8217;m going with it. Just how your credit card provider gives you points for using your card and then you can redeem those points for cash, airline tickets, etc., creators give fans social currency for engaging with their work in a variety of ways. Then, fans can redeem that social currency for more art, content or what have you.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 300 creators, including Crews, using Roll. Roll, which has <a href="https://tryroll.com/roll-fundraise-mainstream/">$2.7 million in funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Trevor McFedries and others,</a> recently saw its <a href="https://app.tryroll.com/markets">social currency market cap surpass $1 billion</a>. Bradley Miles gifted me .10 $WHALE (worth about $3) so I could get a better understanding of how creators are already using Roll. $WHALE is backed by tangible and rare nonfungible token assets, which means that I can use my $WHALE to buy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">NFTs</a>. Because Roll enables users to trade their social currency for over 600 other digital assets, that means I could buy the below NFT over on NFT marketplace OpenSea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123747" style="width: 1132px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123747 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png" alt="" width="1122" height="616" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x9e1f3e8db4d1119894624632499eaed1e56d2b1d/268">Screenshot/OpenSea</a></strong></p></div></p>
<p>However, you&#8217;ll see that the Podmork Pix 35 WS cost 28 $WHALE, so I will not be buying this NFT.</p>
<p>In the case of Crews, he envisions folks earning $POWER via blockchain art purchases, NFTs, physical goods and experiences. Initially, Crews is engaging with his $POWER community through Discord. Folks with 50 $POWER, for example, can access a special channel within Discord. To date, Crews had distributed $POWER to about 100 people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give you $POWER, you own a piece of me,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I want to be very careful about who is holding me, no puns intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for $POWER, but Crews says he eventually wants to offer interest-free microloans to artists. The ultimate goal with $POWER is to empower artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our long-term plan,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;To become this thing that this community can live and exist in. You could use it anywhere you are &#8212; at Target, the grocery store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews attributes his interest in this space to something that happened to him about four years ago.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/embed/#?secret=vtyTTRwUpz" data-secret="vtyTTRwUpz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While in Milan, Crews said he was trying to buy designer furniture from an artist he respected at <a href="https://www.salonemilano.it/en/exhibitions/international-furnishing-accessories-exhibition">Salone del Mobile</a>. He realized he needed extra money to complete the purchase, but didn&#8217;t have enough cash in his checking account to cover it. So he got on the phone with American Express, he said, who told him to go to a local bank. American Express, on Crews&#8217; behalf, then tried to explain the situation to the local bank manager so that Crews could get the funds he needed to complete the transaction. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Crews said the local bank manager took one look at him and said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m watching all these white men and women pass me in line, and they&#8217;re looking at me strangely,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;I&#8217;d been standing there for 15 minutes and it slowly dawns on me that because I&#8217;m Black, I was not going to get my money,&#8221; he said. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;That was the moment I knew everything had to change for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Crews ended up going to a check-cashing place, in an area where he said his Uber driver refused to go, and got the funds to pay the fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing it up still makes me angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I love about this new world of finance is that cryptocurrency does not know what race you are, how old you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through $POWER, Crews hopes to put power back in the hands of artists and creators, Crews explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gatekeeper to tell us no,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crews says he&#8217;s also going to start putting out his own content into the $POWER community, where the community will collectively own it together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is bigger than me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a new future.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Miles, he envisions a world in which $POWER is accepted at movie theaters or at Paramount Pictures properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Social currency] is not to replace the dollar,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to complement [money] and do work that probably the dollar is not suited to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Crews if this means he&#8217;s leaving Hollywood and will solely focus on producing his own content for his $POWER community. But Crews said he left Hollywood when he sued William Morris Endeavor in 2017 alleging an executive from the firm groped him. Crews and WME <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/">settled the suit in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were done with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the deal is, is that I had my power. I still had my talent. William Morris threatened to end everything I&#8217;m doing. But everything I&#8217;m doing right now, you can&#8217;t take. So that&#8217;s when I separated from Hollywood. I&#8217;ve never felt like a Hollywood person, even to this day. But every artist out there probably feels the same way. They want their power.&#8221;</p>
