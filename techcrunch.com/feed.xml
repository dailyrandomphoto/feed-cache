										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The director of the National Labor Relation Board’s 10th region has authorized a new union election for workers at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center. An NLRB representative has confirmed the decision with TechCrunch, which would see the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union getting a second chance to unionize workers at the site, following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">defeat back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The victory was a lopsided one for the mega-retailer, though the RWDSU immediately called shenanigans in what was expected to be a major test for unionizing efforts for blue collar tech workers. At the time, the union accused Amazon of “gaslighting” employees through “egregious and blatantly illegal action.”</p>
<p>Amazon naturally denied the accusations, stating, “It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true. Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>RWDSU head Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement today that the new ruling serves as vindication for those earlier claims, “Today’s decision confirms what we were saying all along – that Amazon’s intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair say in whether they wanted a union in their workplace – and as the Regional Director has indicated, that is both unacceptable and illegal. Amazon workers deserve to have a voice at work, which can only come from a union.”</p>
<p>A date for a new election has yet to be determined. It will, however, no doubt become another national flashpoint for unionization efforts that have only grown in momentum during the pandemic and subsequent economic slowdowns.</p>
<p>Amazon expressed displeasure at today&#8217;s ruling. Spokesperson Kelly Nantel noted in a statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It’s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count. As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes—quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle. The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated—these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few. While we’ve made great progress in important areas like pay and safety, we know there are plenty of things that we can keep doing better, both in our fulfillment centers and in our corporate offices, and that&#8217;s our focus—to work directly with our employees to keep getting better every day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen will go before Congress again this week, this time offering her unique perspective on the company&#8217;s moderation and policy failures as they relate to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the key legal shield that protects online platforms from liability for the user-created content they host.</p>
<p>The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology will hold the hearing, titled &#8220;<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-holding-big-tech-accountable-targeted-reforms-to-techs-legal">Holding Big Tech Accountable: Targeted Reforms to Tech&#8217;s Legal Immunity</a>,&#8221; this Wednesday, December 1 at 10:30 AM ET. Color of Change President Rashad Robinson and Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer will also testify on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hearing is the latest Section 230-focused discussion from the House committee. In March, the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter went before lawmakers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">defend the measures</a> they&#8217;ve taken to fight misinformation and disinformation — two major areas of concern that have inspired Democratic lawmakers to reexamine tech&#8217;s longstanding liability shield.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240280" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">October Senate hearing</a>, Haugen advocated for changes to Section 230 that would hold platforms accountable for the content that they promote algorithmically. While Haugen isn&#8217;t an expert on legislative solutions to some of social media&#8217;s current ills, given her time with Facebook&#8217;s since-dismantled civic integrity team, she&#8217;s uniquely positioned to give lawmakers insight into some of the most dangerous societal outcomes of algorithmically amplified content.</p>
<p>&#8220;User-generated content is something companies have less control over. But they have 100% control over their algorithms,&#8221; Haugen said. &#8220;Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth, virality and reactiveness over public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s former News Feed lead and current Head of Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">Adam Mosseri is also set to testify</a> before the Senate for the first time next week, addressing revelations in leaked documents that the company knows its business takes a toll on the mental health of some of its youngest, most vulnerable users.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the House Energy and Commerce committee cited four tech reform bills that Congress is currently mulling: the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-leaders-announce-legislation-to-reform-section-230">Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act of 2021</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/safe-tech-act-section-230-warner/">the SAFE TECH Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3184/text">Civil Rights Modernization Act of 2021</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act</a>. The first bill, proposed by the committee holding Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, would lift Section 230&#8217;s liability protections in cases when a platform &#8220;knowingly or recklessly&#8221; recommends harmful content using algorithms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups are experimenting with what a better social app could look like. For a startup called <a href="https://alms.app/">Alms</a>, the answer is a social network that focuses on users&#8217; well-being through participation in creator-led challenges in areas like personal growth, sustainability, and others with positive impacts. Instead of driving the collection &#8220;likes,&#8221; as on other social apps, Alms aims to encourage real-world engagement through its challenges and the specific steps and actions that must be taken.</p>
<p>The idea, explains Alms founder Alexander Nevedovsky, is to design an app that guides users to a happier and more meaningful life when they use it. That&#8217;s something modern social platforms can&#8217;t really promise to do.</p>
<p>Work on the project began during the early days of the pandemic in 2020, Nevedovsky says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240266" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of us were feeling depressed and sad, at home without much access to friends and family,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;I felt like the world really needed something that&#8217;s a bit more than just meditation, journaling, or mood tracking &#8212; all those apps and techniques are great, but they&#8217;re not designed to improve your life on a day-to-day basis, interacting in the real world.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the original version of Alms released last year was lacking something that would make the app &#8220;sticky.&#8221; Users would sign up because they liked the concept, but at some point would drop out and stop participating in the activities. The startup knew it needed something more to tie users to their journeys, which is why it has now shifted to become more of a social community.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240332" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240332" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png 6600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=2048,1052 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-screenshots.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alms</p></div></p>
<p>When you first launch the newly designed Alms app, you&#8217;re taken through a brief onboarding process where you select your interests from three main topical areas: personal growth, sustainability, and impact. For example, &#8220;personal growth&#8221; interests may include things like mental health, wellness, spirituality, or relationships. &#8220;Sustainability&#8221; focuses on interests related to the environment and nature. And &#8220;impact&#8221; would wrap in things like activism, volunteering, local community, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After setup is complete, you can follow creators who post challenges or choose to join individual challenges, each with their own set of steps that have to be taken in order to fully complete them. For instance, in a challenge focused on improving your work-from-home lifestyle, the steps guide users to take steps to improve their workspace and their work-life balance (by scheduling breaks and hard stops to their day, e.g.), and asks them to add physical activity to their routines, among other concrete actions.</p>
<p>As you participate in a challenge by completing and checking off each step, you&#8217;re prompted to post a story about that step in that challenge&#8217;s feed to inspire others, who may add an encouraging comment. But gathering likes and comments is not Alms&#8217; goal, says Nevedovsky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see tremendous possibility in allowing more and more people with expertise in these topics &#8212; personal growth, sustainability, and impact of various sorts &#8212; to basically try to scale their impact with us,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We allow them to put all their knowledge or their content in a scalable way so that people can actually &#8212; not like it, not comment under it &#8212; but actually try to repeat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At launch, Alms has <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/a08be4e225d47148ef594051b9fd6a4053369e1e?url=https%3A%2F%2Falms.app%2Fcreators&amp;userId=7520610&amp;signature=696a0e4f72d8b42c">around 30 creators</a> sharing their content in the form of challenges on its app, and 15 more are in the pipeline. It hopes to reach a couple of hundred over the next few months. So far, the new version of the app has attracted a couple of thousand users, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240334" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240334" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2240334" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alms-feed-GIF.gif?w=337" alt="" width="337" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240334" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alms</p></div></p>
<p>Many of the challenges on the app have been joined by hundreds of users, so you do feel some sense of participating in a larger event when you click to join. However, I&#8217;d personally prefer that posting a story and sharing it to the feed was optional &#8212; not every step deserves its own post, I feel. (And sometimes, you may not have anything to say about the minor steps you completed and end up feeling like you&#8217;ve cluttered the feed with less-than-helpful posts.)</p>
<p>Alms was co-founded with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/health-and-wellness-apps-maker-palta-raises-100m-series-b-led-by-vnv-global/">startup studio Palta</a>, a <a href="https://palta.com/">home</a> to apps like Flo.Health, Simple Fasting, and Zing Fitness Coach. Palta owns a majority stake in Alms, and the company has no other outside investment. A remotely distributed team of fourteen works on the Alms app, which isn&#8217;t currently monetized.</p>
<p>Nevedovsky says the team is considering adding some sort of token-based economy or perhaps a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">DAO</a> which would convey some sort of real-world rewards. This could include being able to participate in Alms&#8217; governance or joining a creator fund, for example. The tokens, at least in the near term, would not be tradeable. The company may also consider simpler ideas, like in-app tipping. But nothing has yet been determined as Alms is still working on product-market fit at this time, and scaling its userbase.</p>
<p>Overall, Alms seems like it could appeal to those who want to be more mindful and impactful about how they&#8217;re spending their time on social apps, but who are in search of inspiration that comes with more specific direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, a lot of the time, people place hopes on what will happen in the future without actually influencing it. So I think that having an app that helps you with ideas and inspiration from people who know what they share, what they recommend, is super helpful &#8212; especially when it&#8217;s all about support,&#8221; notes Nevedovsky. &#8220;People [on Alms] actually care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The app, we found, is well-built and attractively designed. But it could still face the original issue of having users drop off, despite its new social components, given the competition for screen time on today&#8217;s mobile devices.</p>
<p>Alms is a free download on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1526191805">iOS</a> only for the time being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir, an Algerian startup that provides on-demand services such as ride-hailing and last-mile delivery, has raised a $30 million Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment came from a long list of VCs and angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCs include WndrCo, DN Capital, Kismet Capital, Spike Ventures, Quiet Capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst, FJ Labs, VentureSouq, Nellore Capital and Moving Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The angel investors include Cleo Sham of Uber; Thomas Layton of Upwork, Opentable and Metaweb; Rohan Monga of Gojek; and Hannes Graah of Spotify and Revolut</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said in a statement that most of the investors from its $13.25 million seed round, which was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> undisclosed, participated as well.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After earning a Ph.D. at Stanford and spending most of his professional life in Silicon Valley working at various companies, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noureddine-tayebi/">Noureddine Tayebi</a> returned to Algeria to get involved in the country’s nascent tech scene to start a company and build technical talent in the Maghreb region (Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people in French-speaking Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to a lack of trust in incumbents and inefficient banking solutions. Tayebi felt that providing on-demand services &#8212; which solves essential needs and, more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> builds trust to then provide payment services &#8212; was the catalyst to enable financial inclusion in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He founded Yassir with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahdi-yettou-3075b0137/">Mahdi Yettou</a> in 2017. The company started with ride-hailing services because the cities it targeted had dense populations and inefficient transportation services. Yassir progressed to offer last-mile delivery services, creating a multi-sided marketplace that brings drivers, couriers, merchants, suppliers and wholesalers to individual users on one platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tayebi, the plan is to use the marketplace model to offer payment services to all parties involved and create a super app in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our approach of solving the unbanked population problem is unique in the region by offering more of a &#8216;banking as a platform&#8217; solution where daily services are at the heart of it all via a super-app marketplace,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such services not only build trust for all the sides of the marketplace but also use them as channels to offer these payment services, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the approach that is most suited to the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of our competitors are either on-demand services &#8212; ride-hailing or last-mile delivery only &#8212; or pure payment solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This gives us an edge over them as we build the network, the channels and the trust that are all key ingredients for the adoption of payment services at large scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir has seen exponential growth since launching four years ago. Last year, it was part of <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/yassir">Y Combinator’s winter batch</a> as the first Algerian startup in the accelerator. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traction, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 3 million people and 40,000 partners in all its markets now use the platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tayebi said that Yassir generates revenues by taking a commission on the services it offers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round of funding makes Yassir the most funded startup in Algeria and one of the most funded in the Maghreb and MENA region. Tayebi isn’t coy about saying his company aims for regional dominance in its category. Yassir</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also plans to gain market share outside the region into other markets, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sub-Saharan Africa and other &#8220;strategic geographies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve that as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth in its existing markets by launching new products and improving existing ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yassir also plans to triple the size of its engineering team, a department the company is also particular about building </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are [a] 100% local champion, including tech talent, as we want to empower the tech talent in the region and hire them in each country we operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want a success model that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the region,&#8221; Tayebi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yassir is a natural evolution of companies seen elsewhere in the world,&#8221; WndrCo partner Anthony Saleh said in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment we met the team, we saw the opportunity of entering an enormous market with a service taking the best of models we have seen elsewhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re thrilled to be part of this supercharged journey.”</span></p>

<p>Well, so much for a relaxed post-holiday week on Monday.</p>
<p>News broke this morning that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepping down from the company entirely</a>. The company&#8217;s CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga">Parag Agrawal</a>, will be taking over at the helm. Saleforce exec Bret Taylor will take over as board chairman.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240182" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/asilbwrites">Amanda</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> jumped into onto the mics &#8212; and, ironically, a <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">Twitter space</a> &#8212; to riff on all things Jack and future of Twitter. From the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto and the CTO, what can we read from the tea leaves?</li>
<li>Jack&#8217;s dual role, and its detractors.</li>
<li>The fact that Twitter&#8217;s product work has been <em>great</em> lately, which we don&#8217;t want to stop. When is a good time to leave a company, is it on the up and up or when things are quiet?</li>
<li>And, finally, Jack&#8217;s somewhat biting words regarding founder-led companies, which are, frankly, a bit at odds with his own behavior until now.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show is back on Wednesday, unless some other major CEO resigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-get-started-with-quantum-computing/">launched</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/">Braket</a>, its quantum computing service that makes hardware and software tools from its partners Rigetti, IonQ and D-Wave available in its cloud. Given how quickly quantum computing is moving ahead, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that a lot has changed since then. Among other things, hybrid algorithms that use classical computers to optimize quantum algorithms &#8212; a process similar to training machine learning models &#8212; have become a standard tool for developers. Today, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-braket-hybrid-jobs-set-up-monitor-and-efficiently-run-hybrid-quantum-classical-workloads/">announced</a> improved support for running these hybrid algorithms on Braket.</p>
<p>Previously, to run these algorithms, developers would have to set up and manage the infrastructure to run the optimization algorithms on classical machines and then manage the integration with the quantum computing hardware, in addition to the monitoring and visualization tools for analyzing the results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="439" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=768,329 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=680,292 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/aws-braket-jobs-hybrid-1-1024x439-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240292" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> AWS</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. &#8220;Another big challenge is that [Quantum Processing Units] are shared, inelastic resources, and you compete with others for access,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Danilo Poccia explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;This can slow down the execution of your algorithm. A single large workload from another customer can bring the algorithm to a halt, potentially extending your total runtime for hours. This is not only inconvenient but also impacts the quality of the results because today’s QPUs need periodic re-calibration, which can invalidate the progress of a hybrid algorithm. In the worst case, the algorithm fails, wasting budget and time.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs feature, developers get a fully managed service that handles the hardware and software interactions between the classical and quantum machines &#8212; and developers will get priority access to quantum processing units to provide them with more predictability. Braket will automatically spin up the necessary resources (and shut them down once a job is completed). Developers can set custom metrics for their algorithms and, using Amazon CloudWatch, they can visualize the results in near real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As application developers, Braket Hybrid Jobs gives us the opportunity to explore the potential of hybrid variational algorithms with our customers,&#8221; said Vic Putz, head of engineering at QCWare. &#8220;We are excited to extend our integration with Amazon Braket and the ability to run our own proprietary algorithms libraries in custom containers means we can innovate quickly in a secure environment. The operational maturity of Amazon Braket and the convenience of priority access to different types of quantum hardware means we can build this new capability into our stack with confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Joining us for a panel focused on later stage investing in space tech, we&#8217;ll have Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Ventures, Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Lisa Rich of Xplore all on our stage at the event. We&#8217;ll look at the significant changes in the growth investment industry when it comes to space startups that have taken place this past year, and what it means to have a lot more companies actually shipping product and growing their customer base rather than being focused more on the research and development of groundbreaking tech.</p>
<p>Hatch, who herself has experience at both Boeing and SpaceX in addition to her investment experience, also stays close to the pulse of the industry (in addition to her investment work) by co-teaching a Stanford course on helping researchers commercialize their academic work.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240242" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Maguire&#8217;s focus as partner at Sequoia is on frontier tech, as well as fintech and enterprise (there&#8217;s a lot more crossover than you might expect!). His track record includes leading Sequoia&#8217;s investment in SpaceX, and he also led GV&#8217;s investment in Spinlaunch when he was a partner there prior to joining Sequoia in 2019.</p>
<p>Rich is herself an entrepreneur and founder, and has an extensive history of investing in both early stage and growth stage space companies, including Axiom Space, Made in Space, PlanetIQ and more. Rich&#8217;s own company, Xplore, also offers &#8216;space-as-a-service&#8217; to customers, providing everything needed to host and operate a payload.</p>

		Currently senior principal at <a href="https://6sense.com/">6sense</a>, Kerry Cunningham is a thought leader in B2B marketing and is a former SiriusDecisions and Forrester analyst.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A few years back, my former colleagues and I at SiriusDecisions introduced what we called the Intent Data Framework (IDF). About a year ago, we updated the model to include non-behavioral signals and called it the Buyer Signals Framework (BSF).</p>
<p>Already, it’s clear we left something out of the IDF and even BSF: product-led growth.</p>
<h2>Signal substitution syndrome</h2>
<p>Both versions of the framework were attempts to address a misunderstanding that was, and still is, so rampant in B2B that I have a name for it — signal substitution syndrome. The nature of this syndrome is simple: In B2B, both marketing and sales practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If people are using the product, the need is not prospective or theoretical, it is actual.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The history of B2B could be written in the successive failure of these signals to be what we all hoped for. Whether it was people showing up at trade show booths, people filling out bingo cards from the back of magazines, the people and bots filling out website forms, webinar registrations, syndicated content leads, third-party intent signals, review site users, etc.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding that underwrites signal substitution syndrome is that any of these signals should be considered as sufficient — or even halfway decent — signals of buyer intent unto themselves. To be sure, by happenstance, some leads have occasionally turned into business in a way that can be seen and understood.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>But if there’s one thing that my time as an analyst taught me, it’s that leads are a depressingly high failure rate (95%-99%) signal. Intent data by itself is worse. However, they are both better than whatever we had before. In fact, none of these signals are, by themselves, actually expressions of intent. Expressions of interest? Sure. Intent, not so fast.</p>
<h2>How product-led growth fits in</h2>
<p>Along comes product-led growth (PLG) with the idea that we’ll offer a free or very low-cost version of our solutions and use adoption of them as the new signals that will lead to enterprise deal generation. Of course, not every product is amenable to a PLG motion. It’s pretty hard to imagine Oracle PLG-ing their manufacturing cloud, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI is facing a potential fine in the UK.</p>
<p>It has also been handed a provisional notice to stop further processing of UK citizens&#8217; data and to delete any data it already holds as a result of what the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) described as &#8220;alleged serious breaches&#8221; of national data protection law.</p>
<p>The ICO has been looking into the tech company &#8212; which sells AI-powered identity matching to law enforcement and other paying customers via a facial recognition platform that it trained covertly on photos harvested from Internet sources (like social media platforms) &#8212; in a joint investigation with the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The OAIC already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">earlier this month</a>, issued an order to Clearview to delete data after finding it broke national laws down under. So the ICO has been the laggard of the two regulators.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/ico-issues-provisional-view-to-fine-clearview-ai-inc-over-17-million/">today</a> it issued the notification of a provisional intention to fine Clearview over £17 million (~$22.6M) &#8212; citing a range of suspected breaches.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/embed/#?secret=CgfrQ06TgA" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the raft of violations the ICO suspects &#8212; following what it describes as &#8220;preliminary enquiries with Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; are failures to process people&#8217;s information fairly or in a way they expect, in line with requirements to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data and to provide adequate information to those whose data is processed; along with a failure to have a process in place to prevent data being retained indefinitely; a failure to meet higher standards required for processing biometric data &#8212; which is considered special category data under the European standard (the GDPR) that&#8217;s transposed into UK law; and also for applying problematic processes when people object to its processing of their information &#8212; such as asking for more personal data (&#8220;including photographs&#8221;) in response to such objections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the ICO&#8217;s provisional findings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson sent this statement (below), attributed to its London based attorney, Kelly Hagedorn (a partner at <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Jenner &amp; Block London LLP</span>) &#8212; who describes the ICO&#8217;s provisional finding as &#8220;factually and legally incorrect&#8221;; says Clearview is considering an appeal and &#8220;further action&#8221;; and claims the company does not do business in the UK (nor have any UK customers currently).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Clearview&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;The UK ICO Commissioner&#8217;s assertions are factually and legally incorrect. The company is considering an appeal and further action. Clearview AI provides publicly available information from the internet to law enforcement agencies. To be clear, Clearview AI does not do business in the UK, and does not have any UK customers at this time.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">Whether the ICO&#8217;s preliminary sanction will go the distance and turn into an actual fine and data processing cessation order against Clearview remains to be seen.</div>
<p>For one thing, the ICO&#8217;s notification is timed a few weeks ahead of the departure of sitting commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is set to be replaced by New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a> in January.</p>
<p>So a new broom will be in charge of deciding whether the provisional findings hold up in the face of Clearview&#8217;s objections (and potential legal action).</p>
<p>In its statement today, the ICO is careful to note that Clearview will have the opportunity to make representations &#8212; which it says it will consider before any final decision is reached, and which it furthermore suggests may not happen until mid-2022.</p>
<p>Under Denham, it&#8217;s also notable that the ICO has substantially shrunk a number of provisional penalties it handed out in relation to other breach investigations (such as those to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/uks-ico-downgrades-british-airways-data-breach-fine-to-20m-after-originally-setting-it-at-184m/">British Airways</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/uk-watchdog-reduces-marriott-data-breach-fine-to-23-8m-down-from-123m/">Marriott</a>).</p>
<p>The ICO also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/facebook-agrees-to-pay-uk-data-watchdogs-cambridge-analytica-fine-but-settles-without-admitting-liability/">settled with Facebook</a> over the Cambridge Analytica scandal after the tech giant appealed its provisional sanction.</p>
<p>And while Facebook agreed to pay the ICO&#8217;s £500k fine in full in that case it did so without admitting any liability and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog/">got the ICO to agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement over the arrangement</a> (which has limited what the commissioner can say in public about its correspondence with Facebook). So, in all, that ended up looking like a sweet deal for Facebook &#8212; agreed to by a regulator apparently concerned at being challenged in the courts over its decision-making processes.</p>
<p>There is fresh complexity on the horizon around enforcement of the UK&#8217;s data protection regime too, now &#8212; in that the government is in the process of consulting on making changes to national law that could see ministers reduce protections wrapping people&#8217;s data &#8212; such as by removing or altering requirements around transparency, fairness and what constitutes a valid legal basis for processing people&#8217;s data &#8212; as part of a claimed &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">simplification</a>&#8216; of the current laws.</p>
<p>So the ICO&#8217;s caveat on its provisional &#8220;view to fine&#8221; Clearview &#8212; which it specifies may be &#8220;subject to change or no further formal action&#8221; &#8212; looks like more than just a reminder to recall its own recent history of enforcements not standing up to its earlier convictions.</p>
<p>Why is it acting at all now if there&#8217;s a risk of ministers moving the goalposts? Denham may have an eye on amplifying her legacy as she departs for pastures new. Or she may hope to try and bind the hands of her successor &#8212; and limit the reformist zeal of DCMS to downgrade UK data protection &#8212; or, indeed, a little of all of the above.</p>
<p>In a statement, the outgoing commissioner said: “I have significant concerns that personal data was processed in a way that nobody in the UK will have expected. It is therefore only right that the ICO alerts people to the scale of this potential breach and the proposed action we’re taking. UK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime but to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products technology providers must ensure people’s legal protections are respected and complied with.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK. However, the evidence we’ve gathered and analysed suggests Clearview AI Inc were and may be continuing to process significant volumes of UK people’s information without their knowledge. We therefore want to assure the UK public that we are considering these alleged breaches and taking them very seriously,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>On the investigation findings itself, the regulator&#8217;s press release on its provisional view and potential fine offers only tentative conclusions, with the ICO writing that: &#8220;The images in Clearview AI Inc’s database are likely to include the data of a substantial number of people from the UK and may have been gathered without people’s knowledge from publicly available information online, including social media platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that it &#8220;understands that the service provided by Clearview AI Inc was used on a free trial basis by a number of UK law enforcement agencies&#8221;, and further specifying that this trial &#8220;was discontinued and Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK&#8221; &#8212; without offering any details on when the tech was being used and when usage stopped.</p>
<p>Clearview has faced regulatory pushback elsewhere around the world too.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this year</a> Canada&#8217;s privacy watchdog concluded its own investigation of the AI firm &#8212; finding multiple breaches of national law and also ordering it to cease processing citizens&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Clearview rejected the findings &#8212; but also said it no longer offered the service to Canadian law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The company has now sent an additional statement on the ICO&#8217;s provisional findings, attributed to CEO Hoan Ton-That, in which he expresses &#8220;deep&#8221; disappointment at what he claims is a misinterpretation of the technology &#8212; and goes on to imply that Clearview AI might have been useful for UK law enforcement investigations into child sexual abuse (an area where the UK government is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">currently spending taxpayer money</a> to try to encourage the development of novel detection technologies).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Ton-That&#8217;s statement [emphasis his]:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;I grew up in Australia and have long viewed the UK as an important, majestic place—one about which I have the deepest respect.  I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner  has misinterpreted my technology and intentions. I created the consequential facial recognition technology known the world over.  My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors, and other victims of unscrupulous acts. <i>It breaks my heart that </i><i>Clearview AI has been unable to assist when receiving urgent requests from UK law enforcement agencies seeking to use this technology to investigate cases of severe sexual abuse of children in the UK.</i> We collect only public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law.  I am disheartened by the misinterpretation of Clearview AI’s technology to society.  I would welcome the opportunity to engage in conversation with leaders and lawmakers so the true value of this technology which has proven so essential to law enforcement can continue to make communities safe.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To kick off <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">re:Invent</a>, AWS&#8217;s flagship conference, the cloud computing giant today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/preview-aws-iot-roborunner-for-building-robot-fleet-management-applications/">announced</a> IoT <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/roborunner/">RoboRunner</a>, a new service for building applications that help large fleets of robots work together. This new service aims to provide the infrastructure necessary to build the work and fleet management applications necessary to run the kind of robot fleets that Amazon itself utilizes in its warehouses, for example.</p>
<p>The company also today announced a new robotics accelerator program.</p>
<p>At its core, RoboRunner helps developers build applications that integrate with robots from different manufacturers and manage the lifecycle of these applications. Currently, AWS argues, it&#8217;s too difficult to integrate robots from different vendors into a single system, leaving enterprises with a number of silos where they manage their robots, which in turn makes it hard to build applications where these heterogeneous fleets cooperate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>RoboRunner provides developers with a centralized data repository for their entire fleet, as well as a registry for modeling all of the destinations in a given facility and a registry for keeping track of all of the tasks performed by these robots.</p>
<p>The target customer for this service is large industrial enterprises that operate fleets of automated guided vehicles, mobile robots and robotic arms.</p>

<p>In addition to RoboRunner, AWS also <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/11/announcing-the-aws-robotics-startup-accelerator.html">announced</a> a new robotics startup accelerator, the AWS Robotics Startup Accelerator, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.massrobotics.org/project/awsroboticsaccelerator/">MassRobotics</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, there are only a few successful commercial robotics companies, and there are a few big reasons for this,&#8221; AWS CTO Werner Vogels writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;First, finding a fit in the robotics product market is difficult because real-world environments are dynamic and unpredictable, so pairing the right niche with the right capabilities can be a challenge. Second, building robots with a high degree of autonomy and intelligence requires multidisciplinary skills that are hard to find and recruit for. Third, robotics is capital intensive and requires large up-front investment in sensors, actuators, and mechanical hardware even when they’re already commercially available.&#8221;</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he new program is open to early-stage startups (less than $10 million in revenue and $100 million raised. The selected companies will get access to specialized training and mentorship from robotics experts and up to $10,000 in AWS credits.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Remember Easy Bake Ovens? You&#8217;d mix up some colored powder and water until a dough or batter formed, put it in a mold, pop it in the oven, and before you knew it &#8212; <em>ding!</em> A disgusting treat. Foundry Lab, a New-Zealand based startup with backing from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, has figured out how to do something similar, except instead of chemicals and an &#8220;oven,&#8221; it&#8217;s metals and a microwave.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which emerged from stealth on Monday with an $8 million Series A raise, is using &#8220;literally a microwave, but on steroids&#8221; to cast metal parts much quicker than metal 3D printing, according to David Moodie, founder and CEO of Foundry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It&#8217;s super easy for the user; they literally take the mold, throw in the cold metal powder or metal ingots, put it in the microwave, press the button and walk away,&#8221; Moodie told TechCrunch. &#8220;It even dings when it&#8217;s done. As easy as heating up a microwave dinner.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239928" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">(Foundry&#8217;s microwave has also been used to cook a typical New Zealand meat pie. It took only a few seconds and didn&#8217;t taste fantastic, according to Moodie.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Typical casting systems like investment casting, 3D printing and die-casting take anywhere from one to six weeks to produce. Foundry says it has been able to turn around brake shoes for cars in under eight hours using molds that had been 3D printed using computer-aided design (CAD) molds and a giant microwave. The startup is currently working with zinc and aluminum, but has done some successful stainless steel trials and wants to move onto other metals like copper and brass in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Foundry&#8217;s tech has future applications in manufacturing industries where metal 3D printing can&#8217;t reach, the near-term goal is to help car manufacturing R&amp;D teams develop production-identical, functional metal parts that can be used for testing and prototyping before committing to mass production.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One of the companies we&#8217;re talking to is making up to 600 prototype cars before one reaches the market, so they&#8217;ll keep changing and keep iterating on it, and that can get expensive really quickly,&#8221; Moodie said, adding that tooling costs could be upwards of $50,000 to $100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Moodie says before starting Foundry, he ran an industrial design consultancy business, designing products for mass manufacture. He felt frustrated that authorities would consistently reject patent applications because they were made with parts produced by 3D printers or CNC machines, and therefore, potentially made with the wrong physical structures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;So I did the Kiwi thing and went to the shed and lucked my way into a system that worked,&#8221; he said, noting that much of his experimenting was done using standard microwaves during New Zealand&#8217;s latest lockdown, during which time Moodie couldn&#8217;t get into his workshop. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to solve is actual castings, trying to simulate a die casting but doing it fast and cheaply. If you machine to a tool to do a die casting, it&#8217;s typically three to six months to get that back.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s still early days for Foundry. The company only has a couple of its very large microwaves out for trial with potential customers at the moment, but it will use the Series A funding, which came from Australian VC Blackbird, to get production-ready by the end of 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the funding will go toward hiring more staff. The company has grown quickly over the past few months, up from six staffers when it first started fundraising to 17 full-time employees now. The goal is to make it to around 35 over the coming months, a task that&#8217;s been difficult with New Zealand&#8217;s strict pandemic-related border closures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The whole border close thing is starting to hit us now,&#8221; said Moodie. &#8220;The country&#8217;s got two microwave experts, and they both have jobs. That&#8217;s been particularly difficult. So we&#8217;re trying to get someone to come across and help us.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">New Zealand is beginning to open up internally, with Auckland coming out of lockdown this week and the city borders opening up to the rest of the country in mid-December. Unless the new omicron variant holds things up, the country is expected to start inviting vaccinated travelers back starting April 30, 2022, giving Foundry and other New Zealand startups the chance to hire talent from abroad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though Foundry is working out of New Zealand, it&#8217;s targeting markets in the United States and Europe. The company&#8217;s long game is to continue to work on the microwaves and get them to a point where they can produce the quantities needed for mass production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YallaMarket, a Dubai-based quick-commerce startup, is planning to expand within the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E), and to enter Saudi Arabia and Qatar next year, to tap the appetite for speedy and convenient grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The startup, which was formally launched last month, is expanding in the U.A.E cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai by setting up an additional 100 dark stores to offer 15-minute delivery services. Dark stores are order fulfillment centers for online retail outlets. These stores are inaccessible to customers but serve the important role of rapid order fulfillment. YallaMarket has two dark stores that are currently operational with plans to open two more in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The instant delivery service will use the $2.3 million it has raised in the pre-seed round to fund expansion within the U.A.E. The round was co-led by Dubai Angel Investors and <a href="https://www.wamda.com/2021/11/yallamarket-2-3-million-pre-seed-rapid-rise-quick-commerce">Wamda</a> Capital, with the participation of a number of angel investors that focus on the Middle-East and North Africa (MENA). YallaMarket is planning to launch the production of ready-to-eat meals that will be available to order via the app, in the near future too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by Dubai-based Russian entrepreneurs Leonid Dovbenko and Stanislav Seleznev, also founders of restaurant automatization services DocsinBox and Tawreed.</p>
<p>“We plan to use the majority of newly secured funding to boost our growth. The MENA region is actively developing…Our goal is to cover as much territory by on-demand fast delivery as possible,” said co-founder Dovbenko, who is also CEO of iiko Middle East, a cloud-based POS for restaurants.</p>
<p>The startup’s dark stores are located in residential areas that make it possible for delivery persons to collect orders within three minutes after purchase, and to deliver to several households on each trip. The company has its own delivery unit that uses e-scooters and bicycles. The average order of everyday goods bought through YallaMarket is $15 (55AED), with fruits, dairy and drinks leading in popularity.</p>
<p>YallaMarket makes a profit on each item it sells as it sources its inventory directly from brands or through large distributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We see that the level of development of the e-grocery in the UAE is far from Russia, where express delivery services have achieved incredible success. Over the past few years, it has become clear that the dark-store model is supposed to replace classic convenience stores,” said Dovbenko.</p>
<p>As it gains more data on user habits, YallaMarket is now investing in product development by implementing a “behavior prediction system” to customize user experiences and offers based on their preferences to reduce the time spent when making orders.</p>
<p>The concept of the instant delivery business model (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/cajoo-raises-40-million-for-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/">quick commerce</a>) grew exponentially last year as the pandemic fueled the adoption of online grocery shopping according to a Coresight Research report. The <a href="https://coresight.com/research/from-quick-commerce-to-instant-needs-exploring-business-models-in-rapid-delivery/">report</a> says that “permanent gains” are expected as consumers continue shopping online even after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Fast and reliable delivery and availability continue to be some of the most important factors when shopping online, as noted by a majority of consumers surveyed in a recent PwC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey/2021/gcis-june-2021.pdf">study</a>. The study expects online shopping to continue to gain ground as people continue to work from home, and as they adopt new habits like shopping online. The report ranked grocery spending as the category which consumers expect their spending to increase followed by takeaway food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/panasonic/">Panasonic</a> has confirmed a data breach after hackers gained access to its internal network.</p>
<p>Panasonic said in <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2021/11/en211126-4/en211126-4.html">a press release dated November 26</a> that its network was “illegally accessed by a third party” on November 11 and that “some data on a file server had been accessed during the intrusion.” However, when reached, Panasonic spokesperson Dannea DeLisser confirmed that the breach began on June 22 and ended on November 3 — and that the unauthorized access was first detected on November 11.</p>
<p>The Osaka, Japan-based company provided few other details of the breach. In its press release, the company said that in addition to conducting its own investigation, it’s “currently working with a specialist third-party organization to investigate the leak and determine if the breach involved customers&#8217; personal information and/or sensitive information related to social infrastructure.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“After detecting the unauthorized access, the company immediately reported the incident to the relevant authorities and implemented security countermeasures, including steps to prevent external access to the network,&#8221; it added. “Panasonic would like to express its sincerest apologies for any concern or inconvenience resulting from this incident.”</p>
<p>News of this data breach comes less than a year after Panasonic India was hit with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack that saw hackers leak 4 gigabytes of data, including financial information and email addresses. It also comes amid a wave of cyberattacks targeting Japanese technology companies. NEC and Mitsubishi Electric both fell victim to hackers last year, and Olympus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">recently forced to suspend its European, Middle East and Africa operations</a> after being hit by BlackMatter ransomware.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The second annual <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17g372ebpuaAB7cJWWACsv">Sight Tech Global</a> happens this week, on December 1-2, and this free, virtual event is incredibly packed with insights about how rapid advances in technology are fostering an accessibility revolution for people who are blind or have low vision. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aM95a8o-S9tKNUaMBC-m0">Register today</a>.</p>
<p>All the sessions have been pre-recorded, and I can tell you first-hand that the panels and fireside chats are really remarkable, whether or not tech accessibility is your area. Join our host Will Butler, VP of Be My Eyes, for two incredibly thought-provoking mornings on Dec. 1-2 starting at 8 a.m. PT. Here’s <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1o4OGyELBtKDFCH_mPnMn4">the agenda</a> and my quick take on the 10 sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple: </strong>A top Apple researcher explains how the cascade of ML/ AI  features (image description, gesture control, scene description) fit together in a customizable accessibility “stack.”</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Alexa: </strong>Alexa’s top AI thinker discusses how Amazon is becoming a more conversational and helpful assistant that talks less and does more.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Seeing AI:</strong> The co-founder explains his vision for how to augment navigation for the blind with customizable audio AR.</li>
<li><strong>Website accessibility 2.0:</strong> There is a little-known technical reason why website accessibility is a costly undertaking. That’s about to change.</li>
<li><strong>Indoor Navigation</strong>: Four of the world’s top researchers discuss how new technologies like LiDAR are the foundation to solve this really difficult problem for blind mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Taxis</strong>: When will they go commercial and will they work well for the blind and visually impaired? A top AI researcher says not soon; Waymo begs to differ.</li>
<li><strong>Inventors</strong>: Products designed to aid blind people have a way of going mainstream. Think OCR reading machines. These tree inventors are taking their shots.</li>
<li><strong>Getting to accessible</strong>. When and how do product companies reach the finish line. Hear from Spotify and Peloton, which take that on. It’s not easy.</li>
<li><strong>Blind Kindle</strong>: Multi-line Braille displays that can also render tactile graphics are the “Holy Braille” of information appliances. APH shows off its AI-powered prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: 75% of mobile users are on Android, and Google’s Lookout app is essential for the blind Android users. The Lookout team is making the most of Google’s accessibility commitment and AI resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re still hungry for more, there are seven, live breakout sessions that go into deeper detail on some of the topics on the main stage as well as new subjects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perkins Access: </strong>Using AI to remove digital barriers for math students</li>

					<description><![CDATA[No, the secular shift to online shopping will not reverse. But it is also seemingly reverting to slower growth rates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce has been on a tear. Lockdowns, a move to remote work and other impacts of COVID pushed a great number of global citizens to spend more of their money online through e-commerce sites and on-demand services.</p>
<p>For companies like Shopify, the period since March 2020 has proven a bonanza. The Canadian e-commerce giant spent last March bouncing between $350 and $420 per share. Today, the company is worth $1,554.74 per share.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Other players saw their businesses scale as consumers spent more time buying online and less time in stores. Instacart&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">grocery delivery business accelerated</a>. DoorDash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">went public on the back of a demand surge</a>. Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">usage skyrocketed</a>, sending it to the public markets on a high. The list goes on.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But while some sectors did well, and many have continued to wow investors, the investor-thrilling run that e-commerce companies, in particular, has been on for five quarters could be slowing.</p>
<h2>Black Friday and earnings warnings</h2>
<p>While I despise astroturfed holidays that revolve around shopping, they can provide useful data points. You will not be shocked that Black Friday was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">bit of a bust</a> in terms of U.S. retail foot traffic. New COVID variants will do that, frankly.</p>
<p>But it may surprise you that <em>online</em> shopping as part of the Black Friday fauxliday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time">fell</a> compared to 2020 levels. Not that the declines were severe, but seeing online spending drift to $8.9 billion this year from $9.0 billion last year made me sit up and take note.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should not have been surprised. There were warning signs.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s Q3 earnings, <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results">reported October 28, 2021</a>, were a letdown. The company&#8217;s posted revenues of $1.12 billion <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shopify-shop-q3-earnings-miss-163804665.html">missed estimates</a>, despite posting 46% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share and gross merchandise volume <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-shopify-earnings-q32021/">also missed</a> analyst guesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chegg, the NYSE listed student media learning platform is acquiring <a href="http://Busuu.com">Busuu</a>, the online language learning startup established in Europe in 2008, for approximately $436 million (€385 million) in an all-cash transaction.</p>
<p>At its exit Busuu had raised only $16.1m in total, a tiny amount even I in European terms, and testament to the sheer grit of the founders who, by the end, had built a business that had reached over 120 million learners to date across more than 160 countries. Busuu provides courses in 12 different languages to over 500,000 paying subscribers.</p>
<p>The company’s last funding round was May 27, 2020 for $2m from GP Bullhound and ultra-high net worths. Prior to that the previous investors had consisted of Harold Primat, McGraw-Hill Education, PROfounders Capital, Martin Varsavsky and Johann &#8220;Hansi&#8221; Hansmann (according to CrunchBase).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg said: “The addition of Busuu gives Chegg the unique opportunity to expand our business while also adding tremendous value to our existing users. It will allow us to drive further into international markets, as well as accelerate Busuu’s growth in the US market. Busuu’s team, who we have known for many years, are a great cultural fit. They have built an incredible learning service for the serious language learner, and we are excited to have them as part of Chegg.”</p>
<p>Chegg says it expects Busuu’s full-year 2021 revenue to be approximately $45 million with year-over-year growth of greater than 20%. The $17 billion digital language market is expected to triple in size in the next five years, said a statement by Chegg.</p>

<p>Founded in 2008 by Bernhard Niesner and Adrian Hilti, with offices in London, UK, and Madrid, Spain, Busuu has made a point of finessing its language-learning model and iterating every aspect of the platform, to the point where a study by ann academic at the University of Maryland, showed that users of Busuu needed only 13 hours of study in a two-month period to move up one college semester (typically 90-105 hours of instruction). The company offers free and paid subscriptions on a monthly, annual, and bi-annual basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Busuu is used by individuals but also offers corporate language training. Last year it added live language tutoring after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/language-platform-busuu-acquires-video-tutor-startup-now-plans-ipo/">acquiring</a> Verbling.</p>
<p>Bernhard Niesner, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Busuu, said: “We are proud and excited to be joining the Chegg family, a world-leading edtech company that puts students first. This partnership will give us an opportunity to leverage Chegg’s tremendous reach to fuel our expansion, particularly in the US. Our vision is to empower everyone in the world through languages, and we believe our relationship with Chegg will enable us to achieve this goal even faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the global corporation formed through a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, signed a binding agreement with a lithium producer as more automakers look to secure key parts of the battery supply chain. The agreement is one in a flurry of deals between automakers and suppliers as the demand for EVs rises.</p>
<p>Vulcan Energy Resources will produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from a brine project in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany. Generally, lithium is produced either via hard rock mining or from brine deposit extraction. While both have environmental drawbacks, Vulcan’s site will use renewable geothermal energy to power the lithium extraction process.</p>
<p>The project will also re-inject the spent brine in a closed-loop cycle, leaving no residual waste, such as production tailings. The project in Germany will use a fraction of water and land compared to other brine projects, such as those found in South America – which means a smaller carbon footprint and potentially a lower operational expenditure, the German-Australian company added on its website.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the five-year supply agreement, Vulcan will send shipments of lithium extracted in Germany to Stellantis beginning in 2026. Over the lifetime of the deal, Vulcan will supply between 81,000 metric tons and 99,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide to the automaker. The two companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal, but it’s subject to both the commencement of commercial operations at the extraction site and product qualification.</p>
<p>The deal is part of Stellantis’ sweeping electrification strategy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">which it outlined in July</a>, that earmarks €30 billion ($35.5 billion) for EVs and new software over the next four years. The automaker aims to manufacture 130 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2025 and around 260 gigawatt hours across five factories in North America and Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>It’s the latest sign that global automakers are looking to secure their slice of finite raw materials like lithium, a key mineral in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has made similar investments in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/">California lithium extraction project</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla has inked its own supply deals</a> for minerals like nickel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renault signed its own agreement with Vulcan last week for up to 32,000 metric tons of European-made lithium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies today want to avoid the lock-in they faced in the past with a single vendor. As a result, they are hedging their bets with a multi-cloud strategy, but this creates a new problem around finding a single tool for managing it all. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://upbound.io/">Upbound</a> comes in with its open source <a href="https://crossplane.io/">Crossplane</a> multi-cloud management tool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big problem, and up until now, companies have relied on the cloud vendors themselves to manage each one separately. While some solutions like Google Anthos and Red Hat OpenShift have come along, there was a lack of open source tooling until Upbound released Crossplane in May 2020.</p>
<p>Investors recognized the need identified by Upbound and rewarded the company with a $60 million Series B to help build the open source project while looking to grow the commercial version of the product. Altimeter Capital led the round with participation from GV, Intel Capital and Telstra Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upbound founder and CEO Bassam Tabbara said that while the market has attempted to find a solution to this management challenge, he believes that his company is the first to build an open source community with the hope of developing this single management console and single API to manage across cloud tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of efforts around trying to build a single point of control. None of them have attacked this problem from a community perspective, creating a universal control plane that enables that in [a] community, while [building] the convergence around it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of Crossplane as the first to get to a point where we actually now have a convergence effect around a single universal cloud API. This has never happened before. It&#8217;s truly the first time that we&#8217;ve gotten to one. You can go to Crossplane right now and you get one declarative API that can be used to address all cloud resources and infrastructure sources across all vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tabbara points out that the project is fully cloud-native and is managed under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which manages Kubernetes and other key open source cloud-native technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that Crossplane allows users to pick and choose the cloud vendors they want to use &#8212; whether cloud infrastructure vendors like AWS, Microsoft and Google or cloud-native tooling like Elastic, Confluent, Databricks and Snowflake &#8212; and manage all of that from a single API.</p>
<p>The company has grown and helped nurture the open source project and developed a commercial product in parallel called Upbound (like the company), which customers can install themselves in their cloud of choice or use a SaaS version that Upbound will manage for them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only catching on with users. Tabbara said he has also been seeing major vendors like AWS, Azure, Equinix and IBM building integrations for Crossplane. He believes this is key, and it&#8217;s similar to the dynamic<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/kubernetes-gains-momentum-as-big-name-vendors-join-cloud-native-computing-foundation/"> we saw in 2017</a> when the major cloud players began to rally around Kubernetes and the CNCF.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s truly to the point where there is now a real convergence effect around Crossplane, not unlike the convergence effect that we saw around Kubernetes as a project, and not unlike the convergence we saw around Linux as a project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It seems to be a project and a commercial vision with tremendous potential, one that investors see as a pivotal piece of the cloud puzzle and are willing to pour in significant capital to help build. If Upbound can execute on this vision, it may be onto something truly transformative, but only time will tell if they can make that happen.</p>
