										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe is “solidifying its place as a global tech power”, according to Atomico’s annual State of European Tech 2021 report, research which has become an annual fixture of the European tech scene. According to the research, Europe is now the second region globally when it comes to early-stage investment, with a total of $3.8B vs the US at $4.1B. Europe now has 321 unicorns, up from 223 in 2020.</p>
<p>The report outlines how $3T of value has been unlocked, but Europe has $23T of potential value still to be unlocked. Some $100B in annual funding has been crossed for the first time. There is now a $100M funding round every 14 hours in Europe. And 100 new unicorns were minted in 2021 (323 overall, more than China). And Europe has now achieved a $250B exit value.</p>
<p>Furthermore, European VCs are outperforming their US counterparts. The Cambridge Associates index for European VC outperforms the US equivalent across 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20-year horizons. Plus, Europe is about to get its first $100B VC-backed tech company (Adyen got to 99B in August).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The report outlines how early-stage investment levels are now “on par” with US levels, with European unicorns on the up, faster growth than even before the pandemic, and growth which added a $1 trillion of value in the first 8 months of 2021.</p>
<p>The report’s key trends will be discussed at a digital event on December 7th at 16:00 GMT with insights from some of Europe’s most prominent founders and investors, <a href="https://hopin.com/events/2021-state-of-european-tech-2021-report-launch">you can access it free here</a>.</p>
<p>The report has outlined 5 key trends which TechCrunch is reproducing in full below, followed by further research TechCrunch requested from the report’s authors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; <strong>Europe is solidifying as a global tech player </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>European tech is projected to cross the $100B milestone of capital invested in a single year, close to 3 times the level in 2020. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>The total number of tech companies that have scaled to $1B+ in Europe has jumped from 223 last year to 321. (Source: Dealroom, Atomico)</p>
<p>Large rounds ($250M+) are now the norm in Europe &#8212; these grew 10x versus last year, now representing 40% of the total capital invested in the region. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Europe has its strongest ever pipeline of early stage startups with the region accounting for 33% of all capital invested globally in rounds of up to $5M. This makes Europe the second region globally when it comes to early stage investment, with a total of $3.8B vs the US at $4.1B. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Looking at the number of unicorns per inhabitant, Cambridge emerges as the unicorn capital of Europe. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Outcomes are exceeding projections in both public and private markets</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, Europe has added over $750B of public tech market cap value and currently sits over $2T. (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>Europe continues to produce more tech IPOs than the US with 122 IPOs versus 89 for the US in 2021, however more needs to be done to address the impediments to large-cap IPOs taking place in Europe. (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>Blockbusters IPOs ($10B+) are becoming the norm. The largest IPO of 2021 is Romanian company UiPath, debuting at around $35.6B after opening day gains. Other large scale public listings included Auto1, Wise and Deliveroo, which all traded above $10B on their first day. (Source: Atomico)</p>
<p>15 European tech companies have gone public via SPACs in 2021 for a combined EV of $62B. 14 of the 15 companies are now listed on US exchanges. 13 of the 15 were VC-backed. </p>
<p>They cover key tech areas, such as quantum computing, electric mobility, semiconductors, fintech and digital health. 9 out of 15 companies from the UK &#8211; all of them went public in the US on US exchanges. (Source: CapitalIQ)</p>
<p>The aggregate value of exits of European tech companies via M&#038;A and public listings is already well over $180B and has exceeded 2020 levels &#8212; this is the highest it has been in the last five years. ​​2021 has been a record year so far for dealmaking, with a total of 47 $1B+ PE-backed exits recorded, almost 4x as much as in the whole of 2020. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>There are currently 26 VC-backed European tech companies with decacorn status compared to 12 in 2020. Adyen is now on track to be the first European tech company founded post 2000 to hit the $100B mark, with their valuation reaching a 2021 YTD high of $99B in November 2021. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; European fintech is soaring; ‘Planet Positive’ startups gain traction</strong></p>
<p>In absolute terms, fintech had the most significant increase  (+132%) with investments growing from $9.4B in 2020 to $21.7B in the first nine months of 2021, followed by enterprise software at +$5.9B (89% increase) and transportation at +$4.9B (95% increase). (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>1 in 5 European unicorns is a fintech company (and that number rises to 1 in 3 for private unicorns). This also includes 4 of the 10 most valuable tech companies in Europe. (Source: Atomico)<br />
Crypto and blockchain deal count is up 5x in Europe over the past 5 years, but lags behind the US. Still, Europe already has 8 crypto unicorns. (Source: Pitchbook, Atomico)</p>
<p>Over $34B has been invested in purpose-driven tech companies in Europe in the last five years, representing 17% of all funding. Purpose-driven companies are defined as companies building a sustainable future for all by addressing one or more SDGs. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Planet Positive investments  &#8212; defined as companies working to make sustainable use of the planet’s resources &#8212; captured 11% of total funding overall in 2021, with Clean Energy and Climate tech startups capturing the lion&#8217;s share of funding with 24% and 19% respectively of all capital invested in purpose-driven tech companies in 2017-2021 YTD. (Source: Dealroom)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Access to funding and talent are key challenges for European tech founders, but a virtuous cycle of talent is well under way</strong></p>
<p>This year, Atomico partnered with Dealroom and Extend Ventures to carry out the biggest ever analysis of the talent pipeline in Europe, screening over 45,000 profiles of founders and senior leaders working across close to 5,000 European tech companies. Close to 40% are multi-generational leaders having worked for both more established tech and younger companies. </p>
<p>Close to 1 in 5 have gained experience in a $1B+ companies, and 16% have moved countries at some point in their career. (Source: Atomico, Dealroom, Extend Ventures)</p>
<p>Although the talent depth continues to improve across all stages of a company&#8217;s journey, it is a lot harder for founders at the seed and series A levels to hire talent. 58% of founders at seed and 64% at series A mention it is harder to acquire talent compared to 12 months ago. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>Compared to 12 months ago, women and ethnic minorities find working for a European tech company more attractive than men or white individuals with 73% of women and 75% of non-white individuals indicating an increasd attractiveness of working in European tech. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>But if Europe wants to reach its long-term ambitions, it needs to address the structural issues that are still holding it back</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Europe needs to fund women and diverse teams</strong></p>
<p>Women and ethnic minorities still find it much harder to raise capital than their male and white counterparts. Overall, 29% of respondents indicate that being from an underrepresented background negatively affected their ability to raise capital. However, this percentage rises to 49% for women and 39% for non-white founders. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>Based on Extend Ventures analysis of a sample of 4,684 tech companies headquartered in Europe that have raised more than $2M of total funding since 1st of January 2020, only 0.7% of the total capital raised to date has been raised by Black women founders, 1.1% by Black men founders, 22.7% by white women founders (Source: Extend Ventures)</p>
<p>Despite evidence showing that mixed and diverse teams perform better &#8212; they still only capture 9% of the capital raised in 2021. (source: Dealroom)</p>
<p>Although the ecosystem has matured as a whole, this is not the case everywhere</p>
<p>Despite having close to 30% of the European population, the CEE region has the lowest inflow of capital into its venture ecosystem amongst all the regions. (Source: Invest Europe)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Pension funds need to step up</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds ($3T in total assets) continue to disappoint in allocations to VC (less than 0.03%). Pushing that allocation to just 1% would be a seismic shift. (Source: Invest Europe)<br />
Smart policy could be a competitive advantage on the global stage</p>
<p>Tech is flourishing in Europe, but it has so far been in spite of rather than thanks to policy and regulatory conditions. Yet smart policy can make the flywheel spin faster and give us a competitive advantage on the global stage. </p>
<p>According to investors, founders and policy experts across Europe, the focus should be on fixing the basics: Lowering the friction on talent, unlocking access to funding for both founders and investors, and harmonising rules between countries. They also think more could be done to make regulation future proof. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p>
<p>There is optimism for better collaboration between startups and scaleups and regulatory bodies. Across all countries analysed, a larger percentage of respondents said the European regulatory environment is getting better rather than worse with the smallest vote of confidence coming from UK based respondents and the largest from Norway. (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p></blockquote>
<p>The report, an annual deep dive into European tech industry data across 45 countries, is published in partnership with tech conference organizer Slush, and with the support of Orrick, Silicon Valley Bank, and Baillie Gifford.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked the Reports authors to comment on the key challenges where European tech needs to work harder on. We are reproducing them below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8211; Access to capital</strong><br />
    •   Based on Extend Ventures analysis of a sample of 4,684 tech companies headquartered in Europe that have raised more than $2M of total funding since 1st of January 2020, only 0.7% of the total capital raised to date has been raised by Black women founders, 1.1% by Black men founders, 22.7% by White women</p>
<p>    •   In all the headlines of $100B raised, the reality for most founders is it&#8217;s still hard to raise money. Access to capital at an early stage is still a real challenge (bifurcating model). So even though there’s been 3X the amount of capital raised, a meaningful proportion of founders say it&#8217;s got harder to raise money over the last year, not easier. The top quartile of European countries raised $496.7 per capita while the 2nd raised $152.1, 3rd $9.9 and bottom raised $1.0.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; The North-South divide is stark: </strong></p>
<p>    •   The five largest hubs by total capital invested (London, Berlin, Stockholm, Munich and Paris) are home to companies that between them captured 54% of total investment in Europe in 2021.</p>
<p>    •   Increased levels of investment in more established, growth stage companies has widened the funding divide in favour of Europe&#8217;s most developed tech ecosystems. </p>
<p>    •   While the level of per capita investment in top and second quartile countries (Northern and Western Europe) spiked materially in 2021 compared to prior years, this has not been mirrored by investment patterns into countries in the lower quartiles (Southern and Eastern Europe). The question then becomes how Europe unlocks the potential of these southern hubs? </p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Pension funds need to step up in a big way (0.018% of their allocation goes to tech) (they have $3T). It’s a huge missed opportunity. </strong></p>
<p>Talent &#8211; although the depth and quality is there, hiring challenges might be a limiting factor. UK startup founders were more likely to find acquisition of new talent becoming harder in the last year than in the rest of Europe.  </p>
<p>Policy: DSA+DMA<DSM. Alongside access to funding and talent, a survey of 5,000 founders across 45 European countries said regulation is one of the big challenges to the ecosystem and fixing it could unlock growth. They want changes to employment law, changes to stock options, the ability to access talent, less fragmentation of rules across countries because as they’re expanding across Europe it’s taking on greater importance. 

15 European tech companies have gone public via SPACs in 2021 for a combined EV of $62B. 14 of the 15 companies are now listed on US exchanges. 13 of the 15 were VC-backed. They cover key tech areas, such as quantum computing, electric mobility, semiconductors, fintech and digital health. We need to build public markets as sophisticated as our private markets are.

<strong>A few thoughts on the UK:</strong></p>
<p>To maintain its edge, UK tech needs to widen its appeal</p>
<p>    •   The UK has the largest number of $1B+ companies listed in Europe but has seen more of its largest tech companies choose to list in the US than other major European countries (14%). (Source: CapIQ)</p>
<p>    •   9 UK companies that went public via SPACs in 2021 all of them went public in the US on US exchanges. </p>
<p>    •   The UK market continues to be extremely competitive, with <strong>UK based founders reporting a net worsening in the depth of the talent pool.</strong> While only 33% of UK based founders are indicating an improvement in the talent pool with 37% saying it has worsened, 54% of founders in France, 52% in Italy, 47% in Sweden, and 46% in Spain are indicating <strong>an improvement in the depth of the talent pool.</strong> (Source: State of European Tech survey 2021)</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung Electronics announced today it has merged its mobile and consumer electronics units and unveiled its new leadership to replace its three major divisions leaders, effective starting today (Dec.7), in the company’s biggest shake-up since 2017.</p>
<p>Jong-Hee (JH) Han, head of visual display business, was promoted to vice chairman and co-CEO and will lead the newly merged mobile and consumer electronics unit, which is also called SET division, and continue to head the visual display business.</p>
<p>Han, who played a key role in the company achieving the company’s top position in global TV sales for the last 15 years, is expected to “strengthen the synergies among the different businesses in the SET division and help drive new business and technologies,” Samsung said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243887" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kyehyun Kyung, CEO of Samsung Elecro-Mechanics, was also named co-CEO of Samsung Electronics and will lead the company’s device solutions (DS) division spanning semiconductor and components units.</p>
<p>The tech giant said the new leadership will help lead “the next phase of the company’s future growth and to strengthen its business competitiveness.”</p>
<p>The consolidation of its two main units, mobile and consumer electronics, is seen as an effort to simplify its structures and focus more on the semiconductor business.</p>
<p>The sweeping reshuffle announcement comes roughly four months after the company’s vice president and de facto leader Jay Y. Lee was released on parole in August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung announced in November its plans for a $17 billion US semiconductor plant in Taylor Texas and laid out a $205 billion investment plan, which includes semiconductor, artificial intelligence, robotics, and biopharma, over the next three years.</p>
<p>Kinam Kim, the former vice chairman and head of the DS division, was named chairman of Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology. As part of its reshuffle, the company also named Hark Kyu Park as its new chief financial officer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By today&#8217;s standards, $10 million isn&#8217;t a lot of capital to invest.  But <a href="https://www.iterative.vc/">Iterative</a>, which describes itself as a YC-style accelerator focused exclusively on Southeast Asia, says the $10 million it has raised from a cadre of Silicon Valley bigs &#8212; including investor Andrew Chen of Andreessen Horowitz, Chi-Hua Chien of Goodwater Capital, and Qasar Younis, the cofounder of Applied Intuition and former COO of Y Combinator &#8212; is enough to make its mark on the region, where it&#8217;s been writing checks to nascent startups over the last 18 months.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate Iterative&#8217;s interest in the region. As Iterative cofounder Brian Ma is quick to note, the vast majority of the 676 million people who live in Southeast Asia are now internet users &#8212; and spending their money online. Indeed, according to report by Google, Temasek Holdings and Bain &amp; Company that was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/southeast-asia-internet-economy-hit-1-trln-by-2030-report-says-2021-11-10/">published early last month</a>, the region has added 60 million new internet users since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total to 440 million. Meanwhile, driven primarily by growth in e-commerce and food delivery, the online industry for Southeast Asia is expected to grow from an estimated $174 billion in gross merchandise volume by the end of this year, to $360 billion by 2025, and $1 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>With a growing number of startups in the region becoming so-called unicorn companies &#8212; including Grab, the ride-hailing app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/super-app-grab-starts-trading-on-supersized-spac-combination/">just went public</a> by merging with a blank-check company, and GoTo, which was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/gojek-to-combine-with-tokopedia-to-create-indonesia-tech-giant">formed this year</a> by merging the ride-hailing company Go-Jek with the popular online shopping portal, Tokopedia (GoTo expects to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-01/andre-soelistyo-indonesian-behind-gojek-tokopedia-merger-bloomberg-50-2021">go public</a> early in 2022) &#8212;  it&#8217;s also probably safe to imagine that competition is heating up and that Iterative won&#8217;t receive the same favorable terms it has garnered thus far for much longer. (Currently, it invests $150,000 per startup in exchange for 10% of the business.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243875" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ma &#8212; who also cofounded Divvy Homes, a rent-to-own platform now value by investors at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/tiger-bets-on-divvy-homes-as-startup-hits-2-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">$2 billion</a> &#8212; readily acknowledges that the investing scene in Southeast Asia is poised to get crowded fast, which could impact terms and valuations. He says that&#8217;s okay with him, though.</p>
<p>For one thing, Iterative has already invested $3.6 million across 26 companies, more than a handful of which have already announced meaningful follow-on funding, including <a href="http://spenmo.com">Spenmo</a> (it just raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/insight-partners-leads-34m-round-in-singapore-based-fintech-spenmo">$34 million</a> round led by Insight Partners), <a href="https://www.coderschool.vn">Coder School</a>, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/vietnam-based-coderschool-gets-2-6m-pre-series-a-to-scale-online-course-platform">$2.6 million</a> in pre-Series A funding led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures, and <a href="https://www.gozayaan.com">Go Zayaan</a>, which has raised <a href="https://e27.co/wavemaker-airbnb-execs-join-us2-6m-financing-round-of-bdesh-ota-startup-go-zayaan-20210929">$2.6 million</a> in seed funding led by Wavemaker Partners. In short, Iterative has already planted many seeds for the amount that just one nascent U.S. company might raised in its first round of funding.</p>
<p>Ma &#8212; who founded Iterative with friend Hsu Ken, the former chief product officer of Workmate, an on-demand blue collar staffing platform in Southeast Asia &#8212; seems also to want to help founders in the region who have relatively little (for now) experience with investors and with seasoned operators.</p>
<p>In fact, he says that when he first began meeting with founders in the region, some told him they were being offered $150,000 checks for upwards of 30% of their company, which is . . . a lot. (Part of Iterative&#8217;s promise is access to both Ma and Ken but also access to a broader network of founders and investors, along with a kind of fundraising bootcamp, so founders know how to pitch, and what agreements not to strike.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Iterative&#8217;s timing looks prescient in the meantime. While regional funds are <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Venture-capital-doubles-down-on-Southeast-Asian-tech2">doubling down</a> on their commitments with bigger funds, like Jungle Ventures and 500 Startups, and while global investors like Tiger Global and Accel <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-14/tiger-global-accel-back-indonesia-s-latest-fintech-unicorn">pick up the pace</a> in a variety of Southeast Asian countries, the seed-stage scene is just forming, by Ma&#8217;s telling. &#8220;It&#8217;s happening literally this year and maybe last year that you&#8217;re starting to see execs from Grab and Facebook and [Southeast Asia shopping giant] Lazada start to write $5,000 and $10,000 checks,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing that makes it really exciting for me. The ecosystem is just now starting to recycle, and when that starts to happen, you see tech ecosystems develop.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Iterative&#8217;s own development, somewhat naturally, the outfit already has a bigger fund in its sights. Asked how much Iterative might raise in 2022, Ma says he expects to close a fund that&#8217;s closer to $50 million, given what the market &#8212; and he and cofounder &#8212; can absorb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still talking to advisors about it,&#8221; Ma says. &#8220;But we&#8217;re definitely going to raise the fund because the pilot fund has gone really well. Obviously, too,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;the opportunity is only accelerating.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A virtual bank is soon coming to Indonesia. WeLab, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/welab-75-million-fundraise-allianz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hong Kong-based fintech unicorn</a>, announced Tuesday its acquisition of Bank Jasa Jakarta (BJJ), an Indonesian commercial bank.</p>
<p>With the deal, WeLab is planning to launch a digital bank to capture the country&#8217;s enormous unbanked population in the second half of next year.</p>
<p>A consortium led by WeLab has raised $240 million from existing and new investors, which the company claimed was the largest fintech funding in Indonesia this year. The capital will go towards acquiring BJJ&#8217;s stakes and &#8220;tech investments&#8221;, the company said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243828" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The consortium, called WeLab Sky,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> will acquire the stakes of BJJ to become its sole controlling shareholder. WeLab Sky has already bought a 24% stake in the bank, while the remaining shares for majority control will be transferred upon securing regulatory approvals.</span></p>
<p>Backed by Hong Kong billionaire<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/hong-kong-based-financial-startup-welab-raises-14m-series-a-from-sequoia-and-tom-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Li Ka-Shing&#8217;s TOM Group</a>, WeLab opened its first digital bank in Hong Kong, a global financial center, last year. The company currently operates a suite of consumer fintech products across Asia, including the virtual bank and a lending product in its home city, as well as several types of lending services in mainland China and Indonesia. It also provides technology &#8220;enabling&#8221; services to traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>In terms of user size, WeLab said it has amassed over 150,000 digital banking customers. Its online lending app for Southeast Asia, Maucash, which it launched through a joint venture with Astra International, has more than three million Indonesian users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel plans to take Mobileye, the advanced driver assistance and automated driving subsidiary it acquired for $15 billion more than four years ago, public next year.</p>
<p>Spinning Mobileye out into a separate publicly traded company could increase value for Intel shareholders, its parent company said in an announcement that went out late Monday. A source told TechCrunch the IPO is expected to take about six months, a timeline that suggests it has not yet started the typical IPO roadshow process.</p>
<p>A source familiar with Intel&#8217;s plans to list shares of Mobileye <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/intel-list-shares-self-driving-car-unit-mobileye-wsj-2021-12-07/">told Reuters</a> the unit could be valued at more than $50 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported Intel&#8217;s intent to sell shares of Mobileye.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243825" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Intel will remain the majority owner of Mobileye, and the two companies will continue as strategic partners, collaborating on projects as they pursue the growth of computing in the automotive sector,&#8221; according to a statement from the company.</p>
<p>Intel said it will hold onto its majority ownership interest, with no intent to spin off or divest at all. A final decision on the IPO still needs to be reached, and is subject to market conditions, but as the majority stakeholder, Intel&#8217;s plan is to continue to fully consolidate Mobileye.</p>
<p>Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua will continue to lead the same executive team. Intel teams working on lidar and radar development will be aligned under Mobileye, as will Moovit, an Israeli trip planning app that was recently acquired by Intel, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye has been a great success. Mobileye has achieved record revenue year-over-year with 2021 gains expected to be more than 40 percent higher than 2020, highlighting the powerful benefits to both companies of our ongoing partnership,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement. “Amnon and I determined that an IPO provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye’s track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its acquisition in 2017, Mobileye has been able to triple annual chip shipments, revenue and headcount, according to Shashua.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our alignment with Intel continues to provide Mobileye with valuable technical resources and support that has yielded strong revenue along with free cash flow that allows us to fund our AV development work from current revenue,&#8221; said Shashua.</p>
<p>The news comes only a few months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/intels-mobileye-rental-giant-sixt-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-germany-next-year/">Mobileye agreed to partner with car rental giant Sixt to launch a robotaxi service in Germany next year</a>. This year, the company has scaled autonomous vehicle testing programs to multiple cities in the U.S., Europe and Asia,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/intels-mobileye-takes-its-autonomous-vehicle-testing-program-to-new-york-city/"> including New York City</a>, and says it has secured 41 new advanced driver assistance system program wins across more than 30 automakers. It also plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ntels-mobileye-teams-with-udelv-to-launch-35000-driverless-delivery-vehicles-by-2028/">35,000 purpose-built driverless delivery vehicles with Udelv</a> by 2028, and has secured <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moovit+mobileye&amp;oq=moovit+mobileye&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.3754j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">multiple deals for mobility-as-a-service programs in 2023</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to Max Q! There was a TON of space news this week so I won&#8217;t ramble too much, other than to remind you that <em>many </em>of the people mentioned below will be at TC Sessions: Space on the 14th and 15th! That includes <strong>Peter Beck</strong>, CEO of Rocket Lab, Nanoracks&#8217; <strong>Jeffrey Manber</strong>, and many, many others. It&#8217;s going to be a really great event and we&#8217;d like for you to be there &#8212; more details are at the bottom of this post.</p>

<h2>Rocket Lab is reimagining rocket design with Neutron launch system</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Rocket Lab finally gave a much-anticipated update on Neutron, its medium-lift launch system, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/rocket-lab-reimagines-rocket-design-with-its-neutron-launch-vehicle/">the company did not disappoint</a>. Neutron features a number of surprising innovations in both operation and development that depart from other rockets of its class &#8212; I&#8217;ll go over a few here.</p>
<p>The first is the material used: Rocket Lab has chosen to go with carbon composites for the body of the rocket, eschewing metal alternatives. This is interesting because SpaceX famously ditched carbon composites for stainless steel for the Starship system, but CEO Peter Beck told me that the lighter structure offers huge advantages in weight and performance.</p>
<p>The other notable alteration I&#8217;ll mention here is the payload fairing. Traditionally, a rocket is stacked vertically, with the second stage sandwiched between the first stage on the bottom and the fairing on the top, like a nose cone. This is not the case with Neutron.</p>
<p>Instead, the company has decided to attach the fairing to the first stage and put the second stage <em>inside </em>it. When the rocket is ready to deploy payload, the fairings will mechanically open, like a weird alien flower or a big claw!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are just a few details on the design &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/rocket-lab-reimagines-rocket-design-with-its-neutron-launch-vehicle/">read the full story for more</a>.</p>

<h2>NASA awards over $400M to Blue Origin, Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman for private space stations</h2>
<p>Big news this week in the world of commercial space stations: NASA has awarded more than $400 million in agreements to three companies to further develop designs for private destinations in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The three companies, which received the awards under the agency’s Commercial low Earth orbit (LEO) Destinations program, are Nanoracks, which received $160 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">&#8220;Starlab&#8221;</a>; Blue Origin, which received $130 million for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/">&#8220;Orbital Reef&#8221;</a>; and Northrop Grumman for $125.6 million, for a station that does not yet have a flashy name.</p>
<p>This first set of awards will help the companies develop their designs, work that is expected to continue through 2025. There will be a second phase of the program, where NASA intends to certify for human use one or more stations (from this group of companies or other entrants) and ultimately become one of many customers purchasing in-orbit services and use of the stations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for December 6, 2021! The holiday news slowdown is very much not here yet. With changes at Alibaba, big startup news, SEC queries and a crypto selloff the other day that is still reverberating through markets, it’s busy out there. So, let TechCrunch catch you up! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/alibaba-undergoes-major-management-reshuffle/">Alibaba shuffles its executive makeup:</a> </strong>More changes are afoot at Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which is said by some to be heading toward a delisting of its shares on U.S. exchanges. Didi is already making progress on that front. For Alibaba, the executive rearrangements are material, and speak to changes in how it operates.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/sensetimes-ipo-to-test-market-demand-for-high-growth-high-loss-shares-in-hong-kong/"><strong>SenseTime’s IPO could set tone for future AI listings:</strong></a> China-based SenseTime’s impending Hong Kong IPO could prove key for both AI listings and for high-growth, high-burn Chinese technology companies. If the decoupling of Chinese companies and global markets continues, Hong Kong could become one of just a few possible places for mainland companies to list, so how SenseTime performs matters. So far signals are mixed at best.</li>
<li><strong>The SEC comes knocking:</strong> If you keep tabs on the EV market, you are familiar with Lucid Group. And if you keep tabs on the social media landscape, there’s a chance you are aware of TRUTH Social and the rest of the upcoming offerings from the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/ev-automaker-lucid-group-under-investigation-by-sec/">Lucid is under investigation by the SEC</a>, while the <a href="http://tcrn.ch/3IoU662">Trump media concern’s SPAC partner is being asked questions</a>. Keep an eye on both.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>To kick off our startup coverage today, news from our own Manish Singh that several venture groups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/vcs-eye-investment-in-polygon/">considering buying into the Polygon project</a>, which is built atop the Ethereum blockchain. That a collection of investors is looking to buy tokens isn’t a shock per se, but is indication that crypto really has moved from fringe to the center of the venture capital world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243674" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/everphone-series-c/"><strong>Smartphones as a service?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Turns out it’s a thing. Evidence of that can be found in Berlin-based Everphone raising $65 million in yet another financing round. What does it do? Per TechCrunch reporting, the startup “takes care of the supply, support, repair/replacement and recycling of mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) for enterprise customers — billed under a per-user monthly subscription.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/platzi-picks-up-62-million-series-b-to-re-skill-latin-american-professionals/"><strong>Platzi’s edtech model raises even more capital:</strong></a> The Latin American edtech market is not just that &#8212; it’s also a hedge on the future. Platzi CEO Freddy Vega told TechCrunch that with much of the Latin American economy “based on natural resources,” there’s a time crunch to get ready for what’s next. Enter edtech and Platzi’s non-cohort based approach that just raised a huge $62 million Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/uber-spinout-serve-robotics-gets-13m-seed-round-to-expand-sidewalk-robot-deliveries/"><strong>Cute robots get checks:</strong></a> The somewhat humorously named Serve Robotics has raised $13 million in new capital. Known as an Uber spinout, the startup builds little robots that make deliveries in urban areas. And, yes, its robots are cute. Which matters, I reckon, as otherwise folks would probably tip them over and generally be brats.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/neobank-hatch-series-b/"><strong>Nearside raises $58M for SMB neobanking:</strong></a> While we await the Chime IPO with bated-ish breath, neobanks with more narrow focuses are busy raising capital. This time it&#8217;s Nearside &#8212; once known as Hatch &#8212; which targets small businesses as its core customer demographic. Nearside just added $58 million to its accounts in a Series B.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/dispatch-goods-restaurant-container-reuse/"><strong>Dispatch Goods may dispatch some good:</strong></a> Thanks to its model of reusing containers, limiting the amount of plastic that folks generate in landfills, communities and oceans. It’s a pretty neat idea, and one that is seeing its market move toward it; I think that we are all a bit more ecologically focused than we once were. Right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/"><strong>TradeDepot raises $110M in debt, equity:</strong></a> The African and North American company operates a marketplace, warehouse network and BNPL solution. Which makes it investor catnip, we imagine. Hence its mega new raise.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/long-time-lyft-cfo-departs-to-become-cfo-at-nft-marketplace-opensea/"><strong>OpenSea hires Lyft’s CFO to be its CFO:</strong></a> Normally when a company hires a CFO and makes it known, we start the IPO countdown. Which brings us to OpenSea, the NFT marketplace, now flush with CFO talent thanks to its pilfering from ride-hailing giant Lyft. Recall that Lyft is public, so its CFO knows a thing or two about going public. To which we must add, please go public OpenSea; we desperately want to see your numbers. We are so, <em>so </em>curious.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Credit Karma, acquired amid COVID chaos, fared in its first year under Intuit</h2>

<p>On the day in February 2020 that Credit Karma planned to announce that it had been acquired by Intuit for more than $7 billion, the stock market tanked, spooked by news that a novel new virus had the potential to start a pandemic.</p>
<p>“I remember waking up and the Dow futures were down something like 600 points because the COVID pieces were starting to hit the market,” Credit Karma CEO Ken Lin said. “I’m up at 5 o’clock in the morning, the Dow is flashing red … and we’re all like, ‘Are we going to do this?’”</p>
<p>They did, and they managed to weather the storm. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/how-credit-karma-acquired-amid-covid-chaos-fared-in-its-first-year-under-intuit/">Ryan Lawler spoke with Credit Karma and Intuit executives</a> to get a full picture on how Credit Karma endured a gauntlet of challenges before returning to growth in 2021.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/astra-will-launch-a-rocket-from-cape-canaveral-in-florida-for-the-first-time-in-january/">The private rocket boom continues:</a> </strong>Perhaps we should say that the private rocket push continues its ascent? Boom seems suggestive and not in a nice way. Regardless, Astra will soon launch a rocket from Florida, for the first time since January, it turns out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/doordash-tests-a-full-time-employment-option-in-new-york-as-it-launches-ultra-fast-delivery/"><strong>DoorDash tests full-time delivery workers:</strong></a> The company is working on a faster delivery system in New York, which makes its move to bring some of its delivery workers in-house pretty understandable. How far the model will penetrate the cohorts of DoorDash giggers who brought you dinner yesterday is not clear at this juncture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/toyota-will-build-its-first-us-battery-plant-in-north-carolina/"><strong>Toyota to build batteries in North Carolina:</strong></a> Japanese auto giant intends to build a battery plant in the United States. Good news for folks in favor of more American manufacturing, and indicative, I’d say, of just how big electric vehicles have become in short order.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/apple-partners-with-boys-girls-clubs-of-america-to-launch-a-new-coding-program/"><strong>Apple teams up with Boys and Girls Club to teach coding:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The youth of the nation will learn Javascript, I suppose. “Apple says the new collaboration will give students the chance to create and learn about the basics of app design and development,” TechCrunch reports. We dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/argo-releases-standard-for-how-self-driving-cars-should-act-around-cyclists/"><strong>Argo AI teams up with cyclist group for AV guidelines:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As you have read in Daily Crunch for some months now, the pace at which self-driving projects are dipping their toes into commercial operations is accelerating. Which puts folks atop two-wheeled, self-powered machines in a tricky spot. Folks are going to keep biking. And autonomous vehicle projects are going to keep progressing. Making the two groups play nice — and keep cyclists alive, let’s be clear — is a big job. So, we’re glad to see some work toward finding common ground for cyclist safety.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has seized control of a number of websites that were being used by a Chinese government-backed hacking group to target organizations in 29 countries, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCI) <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/12/06/cyberattacks-nickel-dcu-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on Monday</a> that a federal court in Virginia had granted an order allowing the company to take control of the websites and redirect the traffic to Microsoft servers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These malicious websites were being used by a state-sponsored hacking group known as Nickel, or APT15, to gather intelligence from government agencies, think tanks and human rights organizations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Microsoft didn’t name Nickel’s targets, but said the group was targeting organizations in the U.S. and 28 other countries. It added that &#8220;there is often a correlation between Nickel’s targets and China’s geopolitical interests.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Microsoft, which has been tracking Nickel since 2016 and <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWMFIi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described</a> it as one of the “most active” hacking groups targeting government agencies, said it observed “highly sophisticated” attacks that installed hard-to-detect malware that facilitates intrusion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/surveillance/">surveillance</a> and data theft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In some cases, Nickel’s attacks used compromised third-party virtual private network (VPN) suppliers and credentials obtained from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phone-spear-phishing/">spear-phishing</a> campaigns, according to Microsoft, and in others, vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s own Exchange Server and SharePoint system were used to infiltrate companies. However, Microsoft noted that it has “not observed any new vulnerabilities in Microsoft products as part of these attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Obtaining control of the malicious websites and redirecting traffic from those sites to Microsoft’s secure servers will help us protect existing and future victims while learning more about Nickel’s activities,” </span>wrote Tom Burt<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for customer security and trust.</span> “Our disruption will not prevent Nickel from continuing other hacking activities, but we do believe we have removed a key piece of the infrastructure the group has been relying on for this latest wave of attacks.”</p>
<p class="">In addition to the U.S., Nickel also targeted organizations in Argentina, Barbados, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Jamaica, Mali, Mexico, Montenegro, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Microsoft said its Digital Crimes Unit, through 24 lawsuits, had taken down more than 10,000 malicious websites used by cybercriminals and almost 600 used by nation-state actors. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/microsoft-domains-covid-19-attacks/">the team took control of malicious web domains used in a large-scale cyberattack</a> that targeted victims in 62 countries with spoofed emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the electric vehicle manufacturer that aims to break up the assembly line in favor of multiple microfactories, is investing $11.5 million to build a high-voltage battery module assembly plant in Charlotte, North Carolina. The plant will provide batteries for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/commercial-ev-company-arrival-to-build-electric-buses-for-anaheim/">electric buses</a> and vans produced at the company&#8217;s microfactories in Rock Hill, South Carolina and Charlotte, respectively.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Arrival also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005108/en/%C2%A0Li-Cycle-Partners-with-Arrival-to-Advance-EV-Battery-Recycling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to collaborate with Li-Cycle</a>, a lithium-ion battery recycler, to create a closed-loop EV battery supply chain. Like most other automakers, Arrival is recognizing the reality of supply chain delays and materials shortages and is working to vertically integrate as much of the process as possible, while also maintaining its commitment to sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not always part of the plan,&#8221; Katie Blixt, Arrival&#8217;s head of PR and communications in North America, told TechCrunch. &#8220;As we&#8217;re figuring out the production plan and timeline and figuring out what makes sense to bring in-house and add to our vertical integration, we just decided that the best move was for us to be able to assemble these ourselves and have more control over the process.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243683" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the next several months, Arrival will be refitting an existing warehouse in order to start production in the third quarter of 2022, according to Blixt, who noted that Arrival&#8217;s battery chemistry supplier is LG. The plant should have a production capacity of up to 350,000 battery modules per year, which can be used across Arrival&#8217;s different commercial vehicle platforms and can be tailored to suit the customer&#8217;s specific battery requirements, according to the company.</p>

<p>Arrival has announced before that it hopes to build 31 microfactories by 2024. So far, it has three planned for 2022; Arrival aims to start production of its buses at Rock Hill in Q2 next year, vans in Bicester, England in Q3 and vans in Charlotte in Q4.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve withdrawn long-term forecasts on microfactory numbers beyond that because the advantage of the microfactory model is that we don&#8217;t have to plan several years in the future and the number will be determined by demand and access to capital,&#8221; said Blixt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever Arrival does start scaling up its microfactories, it will also now scale battery assembly plants alongside them, so it&#8217;s almost an opposite approach to the Tesla gigafactory style of production, said Blixt, noting that Arrival might build multiple regional battery assembly facilities to supply local microfactories.</p>
<p>The battery modules will be software-based and have self-diagnostic capabilities, so if there&#8217;s an issue with one, the module itself can be replaced instead of the entire set of batteries in the vehicle, said Blixt. If the software detects an anomaly, it will send information up to the cloud for Arrival&#8217;s technicians to diagnose and then send instructions back down to Arrival&#8217;s network of outside service providers. The company recently announced partnerships with companies like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valvoline-named-a-network-service-provider-for-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-301435131.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valvoline and Firestone to provide Arrival customers with vehicle maintenance.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) announced in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent filing</a> that it has received questions from the United States government regarding its anticipated combination with Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG). TechCrunch covered the SPAC&#8217;s planned combination with the company associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/">broadly skeptical of the deal</a>, product goals and general vibe. Since then, a few things have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>In late October, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/business/trump-spac-digital-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reported</a> that Trump was in conversation with DWAC CEO Patrick Orlando before the SPAC was put together. &#8220;In doing so, Mr. Orlando’s SPAC may have skirted securities laws and stock exchange rules, lawyers said,&#8221; per the Times.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/04/2346139/0/en/Trump-Media-Technology-Group-Corp-and-Digital-World-Acquisition-Corp-Announce-1-Billion-PIPE-Investment-in-Committed-Capital-to-Fund-Business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DWAC and TMTG picked up</a> &#8220;subscription agreements for $1 billion in committed capital to be received upon consummation of their business combination&#8221; on December 4, per a release.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising, given the two news items, that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are asking questions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the new DWAC filing (emphasis added):</p>
<div align="left">
<blockquote><p><strong>DWAC has received certain preliminary, fact-finding inquiries from regulatory authorities, with which it is cooperating.</strong> Specifically, in late October and in early November 2021, DWAC received a request for information from FINRA, surrounding events (specifically, a review of trading) that preceded the public announcement of the October 20, 2021 Merger Agreement. According to FINRA’s request, the inquiry should not be construed as an indication that FINRA has determined that any violations of Nasdaq rules or federal securities laws have occurred, nor as a reflection upon the merits of the securities involved or upon any person who effected transactions in such securities. Additionally, <strong>in early November 2021, DWAC received a voluntary information and document request from the SEC which sought,<i> inter alia</i>, documents relating to meetings of DWAC’s Board of Directors, policies and procedures relating to trading, the identification of banking, telephone, and email addresses, the identities of certain investors, and certain documents and communications between DWAC and TMTG.</strong> According to the SEC’s request, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has concluded that anyone violated the law or that the SEC has a negative opinion of DWAC or any person, event, or security.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The company stresses, as you read, that it has not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet. But that&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny for a deal that was hard to parse, which has our heads tilting to one side at a rather sharp angle.</p>
<p>The TMTG/DWAC investor presentation was thin on details. And it quickly became apparent that some of the code being used to build TMTG product TRUTH Social <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/mastodon-issues-30-day-ultimatum-to-trumps-social-network-over-misuse-of-its-code/">was not properly sourced</a>. It&#8217;s all a bit whiffy, frankly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why the SPAC would merge with what appeared to be more of a collection of ideas than a company was a question. How the valuation thereof was decided was also a mystery. As was the list of investors putting the $1 billion infusion together for the deal.</p>
<p>The entire affair is not a good look for SPACs, which already earn a goodish bit of side-eye given their somewhat befuddling mechanism that allows a pre-product company to go public via a less mature structure than is generally permitted. This is the sort of deal that gave SPACs &#8212; blank-check companies &#8212; the name that they had until recently, when they got a rebrand of sorts for a short window of time in the eyes of investors.</p>
<p>More to come on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor will build its first battery factory in the U.S. in North Carolina, the company and state officials confirmed Monday, as more automakers seek to take control of the supply chain with in-house battery manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>Toyota will invest $1.29 billion in the plant, which will be called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina (TBMNC), with production anticipated to commence in 2025. That investment is part of a wider pledge to invest $3.4 billion in automotive batteries in the U.S. through 2030.</p>
<p>Once operational, TBMNC will have four production lines, each capable of manufacturing batteries for around 200,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. Toyota’s aim is to expand the factory to at least six production lines, which would produce enough batteries for 1.2 million vehicles per year. The new factory will create around 1,750 new jobs and will use 100% renewable energy to make the batteries, Toyota said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243653" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The news comes as Congress mulls a revision to the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, which currently stands at around $7,500 for OEMs that have sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles. A group of Democrats have proposed adding an additional $500 if the vehicle’s battery was made in the U.S., and another $4,500 on top of that for EVs produced in the U.S. by unionized plants.</p>
<p>Toyota has been squarely against the tax credit revision, calling it “blatantly biased” in a letter to legislators. The bill has received support from the big three automakers &#8212; Ford, General Motors and Stellantis &#8212; as well as the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Toyota is just the latest major automaker to announce a battery manufacturing plant, part of a push to stay ahead of potential supply chain squeezes from raw materials or key battery components. As Rebecca Bellan wrote for TechCrunch+, partnerships and joint ventures with battery suppliers &#8212; like GM’s joint venture with LG Chem, dubbed Ultium, or Ford Motor’s agreement with SK Innovation &#8212; show that OEMs are realizing they need to take control of the supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a year ago, WildWorks, the makers of the kid&#8217;s virtual world game <a href="https://www.animaljam.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Jam</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/makers-of-kids-first-virtual-world-animal-jam-targets-gen-z-teens-with-fer-al-debut/">launched its next big effort</a> with a game aimed at Gen Z teens, called <a href="https://fer.al/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feral</a>. But in recent days, the company has angered many of its core users with <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/29/2342458/0/en/WildWorks-Announces-Entry-Into-Crypto-Gaming-With-Cinder-io.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that it&#8217;s reusing Feral&#8217;s technology platform and many of its assets to enter the crypto-gaming space with a metaverse game called <a href="https://cinder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cinder</a>, powered by the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The response from WildWorks&#8217; core fans has been far less than enthusiastic to this news for a variety of reasons. Already concerned about Feral&#8217;s pace of development and unfinished nature, players are now worried about what it means for Feral&#8217;s future now that the company has moved on to build a crypto gaming experience using Feral&#8217;s assets. They&#8217;re also less than thrilled about the environmental impacts of crypto gaming and NFTs &#8212; an opinion which WildWorks CEO Clark Stacey, until recently, had shared.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://clarkstacey.medium.com/the-crypto-gaming-controversy-331bcf5fb519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Medium post</a>, Stacey addresses this specific concern among others, noting that he himself had believed that technologies like NFTs were &#8220;were irreconcilable with environmental conservation,&#8221; and bereft of value to gamers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However, he says his opinion has since changed as he&#8217;s learned more about blockchain developments beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum, like Bitcoin, depends on an energy-intensive &#8220;proof of work&#8221; system that requires what Stacey called a &#8220;ridiculous amount of computer power&#8221; to validate its transactions, alternatives have emerged that are iterating on the less energy-demanding &#8220;proof of stake&#8221; validation systems instead &#8212; like Wax, Cardano and Solana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transactions on these blockchains can be more efficient than the credit card networks we use to take payments in most of our games now,&#8221; wrote Stacey. &#8220;Coupled with WildWorks’ ongoing efforts to offset and reduce the carbon emissions of game development, we’re determined that our use of the Solana blockchain in our new game will not increase the company’s carbon footprint,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Cinder players will use the Solana blockchain to purchase their &#8220;playable NFTs&#8221; &#8212; the Cinder Fae which will include 11,111 exclusive avatars designed by the WildWorks team. The NFTs feature roughly 150 characteristics of varying rarity across nine categories so each will have a unique look that can&#8217;t be duplicated, the Cinder website explains. Players will be able to connect their NFT avatar to Cinder on the day it&#8217;s minted to join the free-form MMO&#8217;s community and explore the virtual world. The minting is planned for early January. Then, over the next year, players will be able to turn game content they design &#8212; like avatars, play spaces and party rooms &#8212; into NFTs stored on Solana that can be bought or sold through Cinder&#8217;s marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Stacey addressed fans&#8217; concerns around the environmental concerns around crypto technologies, that wasn&#8217;t the only reason fans were frustrated with this shift in direction toward crypto.</p>
<p>Many also felt that today&#8217;s crypto ecosystems still have a lot to answer to in terms of their other downsides &#8212; including their use for money laundering purposes, or how NFTs too easily enable the theft of creators&#8217; art, and the security issues with &#8220;altcoins.&#8221; Stacey acknowledges there&#8217;s some truth to these accusations, but also notes it&#8217;s early days for blockchains in general, and that regulation and further development may address these concerns. He also said that there are creators who do want to involve themselves with these new technologies in order to help contribute to solutions that benefit the creator community, and they should have that opportunity.</p>
<p>One such area includes creator-designed avatars and other tradable content, which can be difficult to profit from on current platforms like Roblox, Stacey said.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2243633 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-06-at-2.47.58-PM.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&#8220;[Roblox doesn&#8217;t] create gameplay experiences themselves; they aren’t the ones whose creative output is actually engaging players, but they get 75% of what creators earn because they control the platform and own their users’ output. If I make a really cool avatar in Roblox and someone wants to buy it from me, I can’t sell it to them without the platform’s intervention,&#8221; Stacey wrote. (The Roblox &#8220;cut&#8221; is actually <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bit more complicated than that</a>, in part because the mobile app stores take their own cut on top of Roblox&#8217;s share. But the general point that developers earn a small portion of the overall revenue is an accurate one.)</p>
<p>Cinder&#8217;s NFTs would instead allow users to tokenize then sell and trade their creations, retaining more of the total revenue. Stacey, in the Discord AMA, said Cinder&#8217;s marketplace will allow players to retain 96% of the transaction, with Cinder only taking 4%.</p>
<p>But Feral fans aren&#8217;t necessarily looking for explanations. They&#8217;re simply opposed to crypto and NFTs and are making their views known. This belief system may also have to do with how the fans still view WildWorks as a kid&#8217;s game maker &#8212; or at the least, a game maker aiming at the under-18 market. Having begun their journey on the kid&#8217;s game Animal Jam, they see the company&#8217;s move into the crypto-gaming space as an inappropriate one.</p>
<p>However, WildWorks had already signaled its interest in expanding beyond the kids&#8217; gaming market with Feral, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/makers-of-kids-first-virtual-world-animal-jam-targets-gen-z-teens-with-fer-al-debut/">which it aimed at teens</a>, not younger children. With Cinder, the market isn&#8217;t kids or teens &#8212; it&#8217;s adults. The company said the new game is meant to attract a similar demographic to those who would play other crypto games like <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">The Sandbox</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/studio-behind-early-access-crypto-game-blankos-block-party-banks-monster-1-25b-valuation-from-a16z/">Blankos Block Party</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, WildWorks needs revenue to continue its gaming ambitions &#8212; Feral or otherwise. Stacey told the Feral Discord community how WildWorks has invested over two years of development and $6 million into building Feral. While it aims to make that a self-sustaining business, that time hasn&#8217;t arrived yet.</p>
<p>Stacey admitted to TechCrunch that it became clear while Feral was in Early Access it wasn&#8217;t achieving the product-market fit WildWorks had hoped for.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reached the point where we couldn’t continue investing in it at the level we had been and stay financially healthy,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;We didn’t shut the game down, however, because there was a passionate community still playing, and we hoped to find either a new publishing home for it or other means to continue development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cinder could provide that &#8220;other means,&#8221; if successful &#8212; but ironically, Feral may not survive to see that happen because of the fan backlash. Fans are threatening to quit the game and cancel their Animal Jam subscriptions in protest.</p>

<p>For some, WildWorks&#8217; shift into crypto gaming was a nail in the coffin, as they took the opportunity to vent about other issues they had with the company. Fans veered into off-topic discussions over perceived failures in WildWorks&#8217; moderation systems, <a href="https://aj-item-worth.fandom.com/f/p/3756416095486237341/r/3757510750109980754" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hackers, </a>data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/animal-jam-data-breach/">breaches</a> and its use of headdresses in Animal Jam &#8212; which Stacey acknowledged had been an &#8220;ignorant&#8221; choice. (The company had discussed the issue with the Native American players who reached out, apologized and agreed that those virtual items would no longer be made or promoted. The company didn&#8217;t delete the items from players&#8217; inventory, if already acquired, however.)</p>
<p>The friction between WildWorks&#8217; business needs, coupled with its desire to explore what it sees as the future of gaming, and the real-world reaction from its longtime fans is an example of how difficult it can be for companies to embrace blockchain and crypto technologies. This problem is worsened as the blockchain&#8217;s potential can often be obscured by the negative aspects of the industry &#8212; or, <a href="https://clarkstacey.medium.com/the-crypto-gaming-controversy-331bcf5fb519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Stacey put</a> it the &#8220;thieves and grifters and bad art&#8221; and the lack of &#8220;regulatory guardrails&#8221; around crypto developments today.</p>
<p>As for Feral, fans&#8217; concerns over its future seem to be valid. Stacey says if the community continues to support the game, it will find a way to continue building it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do not, we’ll announce plans to sunset it as soon as that decision is made. It has not been made to date,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;We understand that many in the Feral community are philosophically opposed to NFTs and blockchain technology in general, but while we’ve attempted to address their questions and concerns, Cinder is being designed for and marketed to a different player. They will lose nothing from the presence of assets we created for Feral also being present in Cinder.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to scaling online communities, <a href="https://platzi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platzi</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnfreddyvega/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freddy Vega</a> thinks that edtech can take a few notes from the video game industry.</p>
<p>League of Legends, for example, doesn’t require players to come to its universe art at a certain time and certain place; instead it lets players naturally connect with others who are learning, and playing, the video game at the same time. Vega, alongside co-founder Christian Van Der Henst, is building Platzi, an online school for Latin American professionals, with a similar ethos, offering pre-recorded material, weekly live learning sessions, and the option to learn with other students who are online at the same time.</p>
<p>“We are creating a generation of people traumatized by online learning because they think it&#8217;s Zoom and cohort-based learning, where you have to be learning at the same time and same moment,” Vega said. “Cohort-based learning is based on nothing, and it’s just convenient for business models.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243642" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s a hot take, considering how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/">cohort-based learning models seem to be taking edtech by storm</a>. Still, Vega’s vision of a more flexible, basic education has resonated with a slew of investors. Platzi announced today the closing of a $62 million Series B, led by Prosus with participation from Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, 500 Startups, FJ Labs, FundersClub and others.</p>
<p>With the new capital, Platzi says it is going to invest more in fresh content and build out its enterprise offering, which helps other startups measure and analyze team member’s coursework on the platform. Perhaps most importantly, it plans to expand its educational offering to help more young professionals, including high schoolers, land jobs in Latin America’s most prominent tech startups.</p>
<p>The most popular classes on Platzi right now are web development, advertising and marketing. The startup also created a soft skills school, and while not mandatory, over 60% of students who take a technical course will blend it with a course on how to communicate effectively or handle deep teamwork.</p>
<p>“The idea is that Latin America in the next 10 years will lose its main source of income, which is oil and coal,” Vega said. “We have economies that are based on natural resources.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Demand within Latin America’s young professional work is one reason why Vega thinks he can address some concerns about a broader changing of tides in the bootcamp world; Lambda School recently rebranded and tweaked its business model in pursuit of sustainability, while Flockjay laid off a number of staff and pivoted to a B2B SaaS model. More than 2.5 million students have used Platzi to date.</p>
<p>As of now, about 60% of Platzi’s students spend $300 per year to access the coursework, which is the same amount of money (or less) that 50% of students make per month per graduation. While salaries will likely increase over time, the co-founder wants this metric to change.</p>
<p>“They had to sacrifice one month of salary to be able to afford Platzi,” he said. “I know I can make it cheaper in the next two years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America</a> to launch a new program that aims to bring coding opportunities to children and teens across the U.S. Using the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum, children and teens at local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs will integrate coding into their activities. Apple says the new collaboration will give students the chance to create and learn about the basics of app design and development. The program will focus on critical thinking and creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>The new program will initially launch in 10 new regions, including Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; metro D.C.; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Wake County, North Carolina and Silicon Valley, with the goal of expanding coding opportunities to clubs nationwide. It has already launched in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Chicago; Detroit; Nashville, Tennessee and Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>“Together with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, we’ve already introduced thousands of students to innovative technology experiences, and we are thrilled to expand our partnership to bring coding with Swift to even more communities across the country,&#8221; said Lisa Jackson, Apple&#8217;s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/12/apple-boys-and-girls-clubs-team-up-to-offer-coding-opportunities-to-kids-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> about the announcement.</p>
<p>This newest launch builds on Apple’s existing partnership with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America through the company’s Community Education Initiative in support of its <a href="https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s latest expansion of its &#8220;Everyone Can Code&#8221; curriculum comes two months after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/apple-launches-new-coding-guide-for-elementary-school-students/">rolled out</a> new resources for elementary school students, including a new “Everyone Can Code Early Learners” activity guide. The recently launched guide extends Apple’s curriculum resources from kindergarten to college. The Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide allows students in kindergarten through third grade to build a foundation in core coding concepts through several subjects including music, art, science and physical education.</p>
<p>The company has been expanding its Everyone Can Code program over the years and making it available for more ages. In 2019, Apple launched a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/apple-expands-and-updates-its-everyone-can-code-program/"> program called Everyone Can Code Puzzles</a>, which aims to help students experiment with concepts. Last year, the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/apple-expands-its-free-coding-courses-and-materials-for-educators/">launched Everyone Can Code Adventures,</a> a program with more advanced coding activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to saving the planet, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajil?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raj Kapoor,</a> Lyft’s former chief strategy officer and head of business, doesn’t think asking consumers (or the government) to change their ways is an effective strategy. Instead, he and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshfelser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Josh Felser</a>, the co-founder of Freestyle Capital and a serial entrepreneur, are betting that the future of climate tech begins in the enterprise.</p>
<p>“What we&#8217;re seeing is that the enterprise is totally changing its behavior,” said Kapoor. “By the end of 2021, the Fortune 500 will all have shared sustainability goals publicly and 65% of global GDP has committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.” Amazon, for example, is making efforts to have net zero carbon operations by 2040 &#8212; and recently dipped back into its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/"> $2 billion climate fund</a> to back fast-charging technology upstart for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the awareness, Kapoor and Felser have spent the last year working on <a href="https://www.climactic.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Climactic</a>, an early-stage venture capital firm that wants to invest explicitly in startups working to fix the climate from an enterprise angle. The investors have backed 11 companies to date, cutting $50,000 to $100,000 checks using personal money. They declined to comment on any fundraising plans, but at this point, Climactic has not filed any paperwork with the SEC indicating plans to raise a formal investment vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Climactic’s primary thesis is helping enterprises hit their net zero emissions goals, followed by an interest to back new consumer products that will not sacrifice value in pursuit of being better for the planet. Felser said that they’re looking for startups that help enterprises, as they become a “captive base of customers that have all publicly raised their hands and asked for help with the innovative technologies they need to meet their publicly started goals.”</p>
<p>Clean tech 1.0 was more about scientific innovation, led by scientists and academia, while clean tech 2.0, happening right now, is about entrepreneurs creating vehicles or software that is ready to go to market sooner, Kapoor said. The shift means that Climactic is keeping busy, investing in everything from technology hoping to measure and analyze carbon emissions, software that leads to more efficient supply chain and mobility tech for both transportation and goods.</p>
<p>“Just because it&#8217;s hard to quantify the impact of software on the planet does not mean we shouldn&#8217;t be funding it,&#8221; he said. “We can solve that problem, and software is going to help in this battle.”</p>
<p>Kapoor, who was also a managing director at Mayfield, left Lyft in April 2021 after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">ride-hailing giant sold off its autonomous vehicle unit</a> to Toyota’s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million. Felser, meanwhile, launched an app (#climate) that aggregates the climate change actions from leading nonprofits and matches them with social media Influencers before eventually co-founding Freestyle Capital. The entrepreneurs eventually teamed up thanks to two catalysts: the planet dying, and the realization that nonprofits were not going to change the planet so there had to be a for-profit, sustainable solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Background in mind, Kapoor admitted that Climactic expertise-specific climate knowledge is “light” compared to the “OG climate investors.”</p>
<p>It’s good news, because Felser said that entrepreneurs are largely asking Climactic for enterprise sales, marketing and pricing help; not nitty-gritty explanations on the bounds of cellular meat commercialization. The firm has employed a number of consultants who have been former head of sales and marketing at other companies, leading to cross-pollination between scientists in charge of revolutionary technology, and people who are less in the weeds (and thus more equipped to help market it to the general public).</p>
<p>“We’re [bringing] a knowledge of sales, enterprise sales and marketing, product expertise and general CEO coaching,” said Kapoor. “And that’s what’s missing from the climate venture community.”</p>
<p>Climactic is breaking out in a time when many are launching climate tech-focused funds, including Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital which just landed an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/chris-saccas-lowercarbon-capital-has-raised-800-million-to-keep-unfcking-the-planet/">$800 million fund</a>, 2150’s new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2/">$312 million fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/wavemaker-impact-launches-to-help-entrepreneurs-build-climate-tech-startups/">Wavemaker Impact’s launch.</a> Kapoor is a limited partner in VSC Ventures, a firm that similarly wants to help climate tech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">hone in on storytelling through public relations guidance. </a>On the other side of the table, recently public EV manufacturer Rivian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">raised $2.5 billion in one of the largest climate tech</a> deals of the quarter, and Redwood Materials, a battery startup launched by a Tesla co-founder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/">raised $700 million.</a></p>
<p>While a spotlight is positive for any nascent sector, climate tech investors must wade through greenwashing, deceptive marketing spin that says products are sustainable when they actually aren’t.</p>
<p>“The word sustainable is appearing in a lot of decks,” said Felser. The other day, he spoke to the CEO of a circular economy company that creates material for more durable clothing. “I looked at it and I’m like, ‘Wait, the source of the material is not sustainable, the manufacturing process is not sustainable…that feels like a sustainable marketing plan, not a sustainable company.” The offset world has similarly received a fair amount of criticism for startups that don’t have the right verification of offsets before selling to enterprises, another red flag that the co-founders are looking for.</p>
<p>The noise just means that Climactic’s first bets will face due diligence around impact, not claims. The bar hasn’t hurt the moonshots (literally): The Climactic portfolio to date includes Orca Mobility, a compact autonomous delivery robot company; Rubi Labs, a service that turns carbon emissions into sustainable textiles; and Muon Space, which is building multi-modal satellite remote sensing systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For now, we can still say that the number of people who&#8217;ve been to space is vanishingly small. But with the new pace at which Blue Origin is sending private citizens up, that might not be the case next decade. We&#8217;re excited to talk to one newly minted private space explorer at our upcoming online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space event</a> next week.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Boshuizen has been to space, and he&#8217;s been there very recently — he was one of four passengers on board Blue Origin&#8217;s second-ever human spaceflight, which took place on October 13, and which also carried TV&#8217;s Captain James T. Kirk, aka Canadian actor William Shatner.</p>
<p>Boshuizen is no stranger to the space business either, having co-founded Planet Labs before becoming a venture investor and now a partner at DCVC, where he invests in space companies and other frontier tech ventures. That&#8217;s why his perspective is super unique, given that he&#8217;ll be able to tell us not only about what it&#8217;s like to actually leave Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, but also tell us what he thinks about Blue Origin&#8217;s business and the space tourism industry in general.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243541" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">Tune in next week</a> to hear from one of only 574 people across all of human history who can talk about what it&#8217;s like to view Earth from space, and stay tuned for his unparalleled take on space startup and VC investing in this brave new era of space exploration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lyft&#8217;s long-time CFO Brian Roberts, who took the company public, announced Monday that he was departing the rideshare company that he joined in 2014 to take the same role at NFT marketplace OpenSea. Roberts <a href="https://twitter.com/bkroberts/status/1467873287405514754?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> earlier reports in a Twitter post.</p>
<p>The departure is another signal of how executives and engineers are migrating from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; roster of big tech companies toward so-called web3 crypto startups. OpenSea is one of several fast-rising startups in the crypto space, which has seen renewed attention from venture capitalists who have minted dozens of crypto unicorns in the past two years.</p>
<p>OpenSea has been the poster-child startup of the booming NFT industry. The startup raised at a $1.5 billion valuation this summer. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-marketplace-opensea-offered-10-billion-valuation#:~:text=OpenSea%2C%20the%20most%20popular%20marketplace,direct%20knowledge%20of%20the%20matter." target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month that OpenSea had received offers to raise at a $10 billion valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>NFTs have had a particularly hot 2021, and while many foresaw the boom earlier this year being followed by a chilly winter of inactivity, the alternative asset class has continued to enjoy builds and busts of enthusiasm while serving as a lightning rod of online conversation and speculation. After an extremely active fall, OpenSea&#8217;s business has cooled a bit, but the marketplace still saw almost $1.9 billion in transaction volume over the past 30 days across over 240,000 active crypto wallet addresses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Gaming might not be a hot streaming destination like Twitch or YouTube Gaming, but the social network is steadily adding interactive features to build its appeal.</p>
<p>Facebook is trying out a new layer of interactivity the company is calling &#8220;play with streamer&#8221; that lets viewers hop into game streams with their favorite streaming personalities. The company is highlighting the feature with the launch of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/pac-man-community-facebook-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pac-Man Community</a>, a version of the classic that adds modern touches like multiplayer, user-generated mazes and viewer interactivity aiming to capture a bit of the magic of something like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/11/twitch-turns-twitch-plays-pokemon-into-a-native-ad-format/">Twitch Plays Pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>For games with the feature enabled, viewers can click a button to open the game directly and join in multiplayer mode. The game selection is very small for now, limited to the new Pac-Man game and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worldsfrvr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds FRVR</a>, a Minecraft clone that quietly introduced the functionality in August.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Streamers have control over who gets the privilege and can dole it out as a perk to their most dedicated supporters, a key tool for creators building and connecting with gaming-based communities.</p>
<p>To make itself attractive as a hub friendly to emerging streamers, Facebook Gaming currently gives 100% of revenue to creators, but if that deal sounds too good to be true, it is: the offer expires in 2022.</p>
<p>In October, Facebook added a co-streaming feature to let creators collaborate with one another and stream simultaneously. It&#8217;s a feature that Twitch has had since back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/twitch-launches-a-four-person-squad-stream-feature-to-help-creators-get-discovered/">2019 in the form of &#8220;Squad Stream&#8221;</a> and a necessary one for building a vibrant streaming ecosystem.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Co-streaming rolls out to all creators on Facebook Gaming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/co-streaming-rolls-out-to-all-creators-on-facebook-gaming/embed/#?secret=iJer3EHWMr" data-secret="iJer3EHWMr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since the dawn of FarmVille, Facebook has hosted a stable of casual games that share little in common with Twitch&#8217;s most popular titles. While Facebook Gaming highlights streams from games like Fortnite and Call of Duty too, the company&#8217;s emphasis on mobile-friendly HTML5 games could lend the platform unique appeal beyond hardcore gamers. As streaming becomes even more mainstream, that could attract first-time viewers who probably wouldn&#8217;t find themselves on Twitch.</p>
<p>Twitch still commands the lion&#8217;s share of streaming hours watched. By the<a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q4-live-streaming-industry-report-a898c98e73f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> end of 2020</a>, the platform accounted for 66% of hours watched, with YouTube Gaming trailing with 23% and Facebook with 11%. But the latter two platforms are gaining ground — in 2020, Facebook Gaming tripled its number of streaming hours watched compared to the year prior while YouTube&#8217;s own numbers doubled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">spun out from Uber-owned Postmates in March</a>, has closed an expanded seed round at $13 million. The company will use the funds to accelerate its expansion plans into new customer segments and geographic areas, which will require them to build more sidewalk robots to fuel that growth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our goal is to put robots in every major U.S. city in the next two to three years,&#8221; Ali Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>Uber participated in the round as a strategic investor, alongside Delivery Hero-backed DX Ventures, 7-Eleven&#8217;s corporate venture arm 7-Ventures and Wavemaker Partners&#8217; food automation-focused venture studio Wavemaker Labs. This round extends Serve&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/uber-spins-out-delivery-robot-startup-as-serve-robotics/">previous seed funding from March</a> and includes participation from existing investors like VC firms Neo and Western Technology Investment, as well as entrepreneur and angel investor Scott Banister.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2242550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Serve has been delivering to Postmates customers in multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods since 2018, when the startup was still &#8220;Postmates X&#8221;, the robotics division of the delivery platform. It started a commercial service in 2020 and its robots have completed tens of thousands of contactless deliveries from over 100 merchants in LA and San Francisco, according to the company. In November, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/serve-robotics-and-uber-expand-partnership-to-bring-robotic-delivery-to-uber-eats-301418245.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Serve said it would be offering its on-demand robotic delivery service to Uber Eats</a> customers in LA early next year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kashani said it made sense to bring on new strategic investors in advance of its Series A round, and these investors provide a hint of what&#8217;s to come for the startup next year.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re expanding beyond Uber Eats customers and Postmates customers, and we are going to increase the number of neighborhoods that we&#8217;re operating in LA next year, as well as going to new cities,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;7-Eleven and Delivery Hero have now invested into the company so hopefully we will share more about any collaborations that develop. There are a number of other partners that we are in discussions with right now whenever we are ready to share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Convenience store giant 7-Eleven is no stranger to autonomous delivery. The company recently began a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/nuro-7-eleven-autonomous-delivery-service-california/">small commercial delivery pilot with Nuro</a> using the company&#8217;s autonomous vehicles. The operator of 7-Eleven stores in Korea also began testing sidewalk delivery robots developed by local startup Neubility, and in 2016, 7-Eleven tested autonomous delivery in Reno, Nevada with drone company Flirtey. Delivery Hero has also experimented with sidewalk robots in the past, enlisting <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/blog/lessons-one-year-robot-food-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starship Technologies in 2018 to serve delivery company Foodora&#8217;s customers</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Serve Robotics has brought self-driving delivery to major U.S. cities and is leading the field of robotics with its cutting-edge autonomous technology,” said Brendon Blacker, partner at DX Ventures, in a statement. “This game-changing technology has the potential to reshape the future of delivery and we are investing in Ali’s vision and the world-class team he has assembled.” </span></p>
<p>Kashani said aside from the closing of its seed round, Serve has some upcoming news about advancements in its autonomy, but wouldn&#8217;t go into specifics. While some companies, like competitor<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/"> Coco, which just signed a deal with Segway</a> to use the manufacturer&#8217;s robotics platform for its future vehicles, often tout the importance of having a human in the loop for autonomy, Serve aims to remove remote pilots from the equation as much as possible.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our robots can operate independently in autonomous mode most of the time,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;This has very important implications for safety and economics of our operation, and is part of the reason we are able to commercially operate our fleet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have humans in the loop, the economics just won&#8217;t work, even if the remote operators are offshore, says Kashani. However, he admitted, relying on humans only doesn&#8217;t make sense if it&#8217;s a one-to-one relationship, as in, one person monitoring one robot at a time. As with Coco, the question with Serve then becomes, how can we improve our autonomy to the point that we can have multiple robots on the streets being supervised by one human at a time? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Robots need to have onboard capability to keep themselves safe when the network drops or when someone is about to make a mistake,&#8221; said Kashani. &#8220;We want people to watch the robots when they&#8217;re doing things like crossing the street, just because, from a safety point of view, this is when they&#8217;re interacting with cars. Sometimes the humans take over if the robot can&#8217;t figure it out, sometimes they don&#8217;t. Usually the robot makes an attempt to figure situations out by itself and then if it can&#8217;t, a person can step in, but part of it is because of the time it takes. You don&#8217;t want to wait if you&#8217;re on a timeline.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sidewalk robot delivery is just starting to heat up as an industry, and with it will be a race among companies to come up with the most sophisticated technology and the best go-to-market strategy. With this round of funding, and its accompanying partners, Serve is already prepping for scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;7-Eleven represents convenience stores we could work with, Delivery Hero gives you a sense of delivery platforms we could work with,&#8221; Aduke Thelwell, head of communications at Serve, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly going to engage with restaurant chains and over time, there&#8217;s medical delivery, pharmacy, alcohol, cannabis, et cetera. So it is the gamut that you&#8217;d expect we&#8217;re going after in terms of partnerships.&#8221;</p>

<p>The allegations were made by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla employee, who filed his complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in 2019, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>. The probe only came to light after Henkes filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the commission regarding the outcome of his original whistleblower allegations.</p>
<p>While the SEC did not provide any records to Henkes, it did confirm in a September 24 letter that “the investigation from which you seek records is still active and ongoing.” The SEC told TechCrunch that it &#8220;does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243525" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In his complaint, Henkes alleges that Tesla and SolarCity &#8212; its subsidiary that it acquired in 2016 &#8212; did not let customers know about defective electrical connectors that could cause fire.</p>
<p>Henkes was fired from Tesla in August 2020 after working for the company for nearly four and a half years, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before his role was terminated, he was a field quality manager. He also previously worked as a manager focused on quality development and planning for Toyota North America.</p>
<p>Henkes later sued Tesla for wrongful termination, claiming that his dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. According to his complaint, he notified Tesla about the fire risk prior to expressing his concerns to the SEC.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that issues regarding the safety of Tesla’s solar panels have come to light. In 2019, the automaker was sued by Walmart over allegations of breach of contract and gross negligence after rooftop solar panel systems on seven of the retailer&#8217;s stores allegedly caught fire. Walmart dropped the lawsuit after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/walmart-reaches-settlement-with-tesla-over-solar-panel-fires-drops-lawsuit/">reaching a settlement</a> with Tesla.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was also revealed by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-project-titan-replace-bad-solar-panel-parts-2019-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Insider</a> that Tesla undertook a massive project, codenamed Project Titan, to replace faulty solar panel connectors.</p>
<p>Tesla is also facing a separate safety investigation from another federal regulator. The National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration is also investigating the automaker regarding incidents of crashes that took place when Tesla’s Autopilot advanced driver assistance system was engaged.</p>
