										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Howard Lerman, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.yext.com">Yext</a>, has a new startup called <a href="https://www.wonder.inc">Wonder Inventions</a>, which is officially launching its first product today — Dynascore.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on Dynascore first. Lerman said he and his team created the product to solve the problem of the ever-growing demand for video content, which often relies on stock music. But by its nature, stock music isn&#8217;t designed for a specific video or a specific length, which can lead to some awkward fits, or require producers to edit their videos to match the music since &#8220;you can&#8217;t just chop three seconds out of a song and put it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dynascore, however, can take an existing piece of music and adapt it to a video of any length. It can also adjust the music to put the transitions, pauses and endings where you want them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lerman and his team demonstrated this for me, taking a fitness commercial and fitting different pieces of music to it, as well as adjusting the length of the commercial and where the transitions fell. Each time, Dynascore would generate a new version of the track that flowed well with the commercial (though I got the sense that if you&#8217;ve picked the wrong song for the video, no amount of adjustment can help).</p>
<p>To achieve this, Lerman said Dynascore examines a song and breaks it down to &#8220;the smallest unit of music that makes musical sense,&#8221; which it calls at a &#8220;morphone.&#8221; So depending on the specifications, it can assemble those morphones in ways that maximize what the company calls &#8220;musicoherence&#8221; — basically, to make sure it still flows like a real song.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135806" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135806" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Dynascore" width="680" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=768,630 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=680,558 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynascore</p></div></p>
<p>Lerman emphasized that that Dynascore&#8217;s technology isn&#8217;t trying to write music from scratch. Instead, it&#8217;s adapting human compositions — there are Masterworks, a.k.a. classic compositions that are in the public domain, as well as around 1,000 original compositions to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a lot of companies out there that use AI to write music,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They train their models on Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, but the stuff that comes out of it is trash [&#8230;] The critical breakthrough we realized is that computers cannot write music, the same way that AI can&#8217;t write a film and can&#8217;t write a book. But AI can reconstruct music in a way that the human ear responds to.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a free trial, pricing for Dynascore starts at $19 per month. It&#8217;s available as a desktop app for Mac and Windows, as well as an extension for editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. The company has also built a Developer API to integrate into other apps, starting with video builder <a href="https://biteable.com">Biteable</a> and marketing production tool <a href="https://rocketium.com">Rocketium</a>.</p>
<p>Dynascore is just the first product that we should from Wonder Inventions, which Lerman said will develop a whole portfolio of new products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135809" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135809" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?w=680" alt="Dynascore" width="680" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynascore</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not starting Wonder Inventions for a single idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wonder Inventions is 20 master inventors who are some of the most creative and brilliant and people we’ve ever met, and they will develop many products that will have synergies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lerman himself is serving as Wonder&#8217;s chairman while he remains CEO at Yext, which he described as his full-time job. When pressed on whether there&#8217;s a unifying vision for the company beyond making cool stuff, he replied, &#8220;Thirty years ago, when people started a business, it would be about the company. Now when a company is started, it’s about the product&#8221; — something he attributed to venture capitalists&#8217; focus on a single, scalable idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any VC would fund Dynascore — it’s too goofy and someone would look at the [total addressable market] and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think this is a multi-million dollar category.'&#8221; Lerman continued. He doesn&#8217;t necessarily disagree with that assessment, but he added, &#8220;It can be great first product, with more hits to come.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago, hands out essential tips and tricks for when you're applying to an accelerator]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Should you try to get your company into an accelerator? How far along should your idea and your team be before applying? When it is time to apply, how do you make your application stand out from hundreds or thousands of others? How fancy do you need to get with the application video?</p>
<p>For answers, we spoke with Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago, and the founder of one of the earliest coding bootcamps with Code Academy (later known as The Starter League). He is an adjunct professor at Northwestern University and was a mayoral candidate in Chicago&#8217;s 2019 election. He&#8217;s got an incredible wealth of knowledge about all things startups — our chat was only about 40 minutes long, but he absolutely crammed it with insights.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from our conversation at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TC Early Stage</a> — Extra Crunch members will find the full video and a transcript below.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why (or why not to) join an accelerator</h2>
<p>Throughout the talk, Neal shares plenty of reasons why you might want to join an accelerator. The connections! The shared knowledge! The support network! The funding is nice too, of course — but he&#8217;s quick to point out that it shouldn&#8217;t be your sole motivation.</p>
<blockquote><p>It can&#8217;t just be about the money. If it&#8217;s just about fundraising and you don&#8217;t really want any of the other parts of the experience, you&#8217;re probably setting yourself up to not have a very good time. I would highly recommend reconsidering that and instead focusing more on talking to early-stage investors who might be interested in providing more hands-on and specific support that you would need.</p>
<p>That being said, doing an accelerator can be amazing, because all those things that you would naturally do as a startup in your local ecosystem or community, or wherever you&#8217;re trying to grow your business … all of that happens in a far more immersive, effective and accelerated way. The mentors that you get connected to, the investors that you get introduced to, the level of knowledge, the holistic educational experience that you gain from being a part of an accelerator can be a game changer for so many startups that are in those early days of trying to figure out and find their path.<br />
<em><strong> (Time stamp: 2:30)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Be prepared and follow up</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to think through the <em>entire</em> interview process — not just your answers to the questions that might pop up. Knowing a little bit about the person interviewing you and showing that you really know what you&#8217;re getting into can go a long way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Historically, the transmasculine community has been neglected by the fashion world. But <a href="https://bothandapparel.com/">Both&amp;</a> is a new brand looking to offer clothing tailored specifically for transmasculine bodies.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Finnegan Shepard, a trans man who started Both&amp; after going through top surgery and feeling like he still couldn&#8217;t find clothing that fit his body. The items are designed to emphasize a masculine figure, disguise bindings, and the line is size inclusive.</p>
<p>The general idea is that our clothing is a representation of who we are, and no one should have their clothing options limited based on their body.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both&amp; is fully bootstrapped and sells direct to consumer through the website. The strategy is to do super small batches of capsule lines, with the first going on pre-order today.</p>
<p>The first line is comprised of three basic t-shirts.</p>
<p>The Finnegan is an everyday basics shirt. The Tyla is similar to the Finnegan, but has a ribbed sleeve cuff for a tighter fit around the biceps. The Khazeel is designed for an oversize fit, and is designed to cover bindings and appear boxy. These items range from $39 to $45.</p>
<p>Both&amp; wants to start with simple designs and forget about color and prints for now.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2135795,2135796,2135797"]</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the basics right in terms of shape, and focus on relatively minimalist-ish colors, and then once we have those nailed, then we move on to a lot more colorful stuff,&#8221; said Shephard. &#8220;We&#8217;re not really interested in prints. That was one of the things that I actually had an adverse reaction to. There are a lot of companies out there that are printing sort of Trans Pride stuff on t-shirts, but they&#8217;re not really changing the shapes or making them fit better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to release new designs every six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for Both&amp; is that the target demographic is very focused on sustainability, but traditionally doesn&#8217;t have a lot of disposable income, according to Shepard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it at an accessible price point and also sustainable and we&#8217;re building items that can also be produced in small batch,&#8221; said Shepard. &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of different things to try and juggle at once.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s been a lot of investment in machine learning startups recently as companies try to push the notion into a wider variety of endeavors. <a href="http://comet.ml">Comet</a>, a company that helps customers iterate on models in an experimentation process designed to eventually reach production, announced a $13 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Scale Venture Partners led the round with help from existing investors Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures. The startup has raised almost $20 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Investors saw a company that has grown revenue over 500% over the last year, says Gideon Mendels, co-founder and CEO. &#8220;Things have been working very well for us. On the product side, we&#8217;ve continued to double down on what we call experimentation management where we are really tracking these models &#8212; data that came into them, the hyper parameters and helping teams to debug and understand what&#8217;s going on with their models,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company is also announcing an expansion of the platform to follow the models into post production with a product they are calling Comet Model Production Monitoring (MPM).</p>
<p>&#8220;The model production monitoring product essentially focuses on models post production. The original product was more around how multiple offline experiments are modeled during training, while MPM is focused on these models once they hit production for the first time,&#8221; Mendels explained.</p>

<p>Andy Vitus, partner at investor Scale Venture Partners, sees model lifecycle management tooling like Comet&#8217;s as a developing market. &#8220;Machine learning and AI will drive the future of enterprise software, and ensuring that organizations have full visibility and control of a model’s life cycle will be imperative to it,&#8221; Vitus said in a statement</p>
<p>As the company grows, it&#8217;s opening a new engineering hub in Israel in addition to its office in NYC. While these offices are closed for now, Mendels says that they will have a hybrid office when the pandemic ebbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving forward we are planning to have an office in New York City and another office in Tel Aviv. But we&#8217;re not going to require anyone to work from the office if they choose not to, or, they can come in a couple days a week. And we&#8217;re still going to support hires from around the world.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Insights Lab is an approach to product development that leverages multidisciplinary teams to rapidly look at what does and does not work in a digital care setting and then scale those tools within the company,” Sean Duffy, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omada </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers care management for diabetes, musculoskeletal issues, preventative health, hypertension, and behavioral health. Its main differentiator from other virtual healthcare providers is the amount of handholding it offers to its patients, which in turn has shown to deliver better health outcomes. Through the Insights Lab, it plans to share insights to help improve care outcomes across the industry.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A shared sense of commitment with an Omada care professional increases the likelihood of a better outcome by 250%,” Duffy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One tactic Omada uses to keep patients on track is the “nudge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like your Apple watch that tells you when to stand up or breathe, the Omada app can remind its diabetes patients to have a meal and to measure their blood sugar, for example. If you’re thinking, “Yeah, but I often ignore my Apple watch,” you’re not alone. The company has also noticed that passive nudges aren’t as successful as a comprehensive and proactive approach to care, especially one that involves human interaction. As a result, the Omada doctors have made changes to their care delivery.</span></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example: the Lab wanted to find out how to help their diabetes prevention patients lose weight &#8211; being overweight is a key indicator of developing diabetes. They looked at the automated nudges, reminders to track meals, mealtime push notifications, and engagement with the care team.</p>
<p>While all of<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the approaches made it more likely that people would track their meals &#8211; an important task that helps patients stay on track with their diets &#8211; only one drove increases in weight loss: engagement with the care team. They found that patients who interact with their care team or community in the first week of the program are 24% more likely to achieve their health goals and patients who message their care teams are twice as likely to achieve positive health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequentially, Duffy said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not just engagement that matters, it&#8217;s the type of engagement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Omada took these insights and reduced the use of nudges and implemented ways for the care team to interact with the patients more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Omada is already using the more than a billion data points it’s recorded from 450,000 members in the company’s 10 years of business to improve its own tools, with the launch of the Lab, the company also plans to share the data and strategies with the broader medical community through content on its website and other outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the company is only virtual, it prides itself on the amount &#8211; and quality &#8211; of its data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so hard to measure small details in in-person settings, but with digital, you can measure everything,” Duffy said. “Everything people are doing in the app are connected to meaningful outcomes,” he added. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honda and Verizon are researching how 5G and mobile edge computing might improve safety for today&#8217;s connected vehicles and the future&#8217;s autonomous ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two companies, which announced the partnership Thursday, are piloting different safety scenarios at the University of Michigan’s </span><a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mcity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a test bed for connected and autonomous vehicles. The aim of the venture is to study </span>how 5G connectivity coupled with edge computing could allow for faster communication between cars, pedestrians and infrastructure. The upshot: faster communication could allow cars to avoid collisions and hazards and find safer routes. <span style="font-weight: 400;">[TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media, which is itself owned by Verizon]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5G testing is in its preliminary research phase and Honda doesn’t intend to implement this new technology as a product feature just yet. The companies do have plans to test 5G-enabled vehicles on public roads in at least four cities this year, according to Brian Peebles, Verizon’s senior manager of technology development and one of the leads on the project.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership builds off of Honda’s onboard SAFE SWARM AI technology, which the automaker began developing in 2017. That technology uses Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, or C-V2X communication, which does what the name implies and lets vehicles communicate with other road users.</span></p>

<div class="p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper p-block_kit_renderer__block_wrapper--first">
<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section">We’ve seen similar tech before with Dedicated Short Range Communications which requires cell towers to communicate between vehicles. V2X and 5G have the advantage of being able to communicate device-to-device, not to mention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/the-station-canoo-hits-the-road-coup-shutters-and-samsung-shifts/">endorsement by the FCC</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditionally, with V2X, the cars talk to each other,” Dr. Ehsan Moradi Pari, research group lead at Honda’s advanced technology research division told TechCrunch. “They provide their information, like their location, speed and other sensor information, and the car does a threat assessment, like whether I’m going to collide with another car. What this [5G and MEC] technology offers is that we all provide our information to the network, and the network tells me if there is a potential for an accident or not.”</span></p>
<p>Honda and Verizon&#8217;s premise is that the technology can handle communication far faster than a car&#8217;s computer. Instead of relying on a car&#8217;s less capable computer to do the work, information generated from connected cars, people and infrastructure is sent <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">up into the 5G network. The computations are then done at the edge of network (meaning not in the cloud) in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The payoff: a car relying on sensors and software might be </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">able to understand a driver is about to hit something and hit the breaks, but the MEC can almost see into the future by checking out and communicating what’s happening farther down the road. </span></p>

<div class="p-rich_text_block" dir="auto">
<div class="p-rich_text_section"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The speed of the communication is what stands out, according to Peebles, who noted that the round trip latency testing performed on Verizon’s 5G network to its MEC came back in under 50 milliseconds.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the safety scenarios that Verizon and Honda tested was a red light runner. Using data from smart cameras, MEC and V2X software they were able to detect the vehicle running a red light and send a visual warning message to other vehicles approaching the intersection. They tested similar scenarios to warn drivers or vehicles about a pedestrian obscured by a building and an oncoming emergency vehicle whose sirens are drowned out by the car’s loud music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ensuring real-time communication among all road users will play a critical role in an automated driving environment,” said Pari. “Through these connected safety technologies, we can develop vehicle systems that detect potential dangerous situations in real time to warn the driver or automated system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this initial research stage involves making human-driven vehicles safer, the Honda-Verizon partnership might eventually lay the groundwork for the use of 5G in future autonomous vehicles. If testing proves out, connected vehicles would be safer and could lead to a more efficient network that smooths out traffic congestion and reduces air pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re primarily doing this to promote vehicle safety and human safety,” Peebles told TechCrunch. “There are over 42,000 people a year in the United States alone that are killed in automobile accidents, and another two million are injured. Technology is becoming more crucial as we undergo an evolution of human drivers, so as that transition happens, we need to do it in a safe and orchestrated manner, such that everything is working together.”</span></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads today don&#8217;t require 5G or edge computing. While autonomous vehicle companies are eyeing what might be possible with 5G, the vehicles they&#8217;re developing are based on present-day technology.</p>
<p>There are headwinds to this 5G-MEC combination. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of interconnectivity only works if there are sensors on every highway and every intersection. Many 5G-enabled vehicles and devices will be able to communicate with one another, but they can only communicate with pedestrians or infrastructure if smart cameras are clocking them and sharing that info with the network. And </span> sensors are not perfect.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would require a huge infrastructure investment as well as public acceptance and cooperation with states, cities and localities to install all of the necessary sensors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one might look to China as a use case. The country has a national policy to move rapidly over to a 5G network, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3088419/why-5g-considered-essential-element-chinas-autonomous-driving-road">Chinese autonomous driving companies</a> are finding this type of connectivity and computational power essential to development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced this morning that private equity firm <a href="http://kkr.com">KKR</a> is investing $500 million in the company, a move that could help the struggling cloud content management vendor get out from under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds in what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp">dutch auction</a>&#8221; style sale to buy back shares from certain investors for the price determined by the auction, an activity that should take place after the company announces its next earnings report in May. This would presumably involve buying out Starboard, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">took a 7.5% stake in the company</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-starboard-exclusive-idINKBN2AN1MX">Reuters reported</a> that Starboard could be looking to take over a majority of the board seats when the company board meets in June. That could have set them up to take some action, most likely forcing a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="voIpvT2YUd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">Box acquires e-signature startup SignRequest for new content workflows</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While it&#8217;s not clear what will happen now, it seems likely that with this cash, they will be able to stave off action from Starboard, and with KKR in the picture be able to take a longer term view. Box CEO Aaron Levie sees the move as a vote of confidence from KKR in Box&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;KKR is one of the world’s leading technology investors with a deep understanding of our market and a proven track record of partnering successfully with companies to create value and drive growth. With their support, we will be even better positioned to build on Box’s leadership in cloud content management as we continue to deliver value for our customers around the world,&#8221; Levie said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, John Park, Head of Americas Technology Private Equity at KKR, will be joining the Box board of directors. The company also announced that independent board member Bethany Mayer will be appointed chairman of the board, effective on May 1st.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest</a>, which could help open up a new set of workflows for the company as it tries to expand its market. With KKR&#8217;s backing, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to expect that Box, which is cash flow positive, could be taking additional steps to expand the platform in the future.</p>
<p>Box stock was down over 8% premarket, a signal that perhaps Wall Street isn&#8217;t thrilled with the announcement, but the cash influx should give Box some breathing room to reset and push forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swag has a long and patchy history in the world of business. For every hip pair of plaid socks, there are five t-shirts you may never wear, an itchy scarf, a notepad your kids might use, and an ugly mug; and most of all, likely thousands of dollars and lots of time invested to make those presents a reality. Now, a startup that has built a service to rethink the concept behind corporate gifts and make them more effective is today announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business &#8212; and one sign that it may be on to something is its progress so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://alyce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce</a>, a Boston startup that has built an AI platform that plugs into various other apps that you might use to interact and track your relationships with others in your working life &#8212; sales prospects, business partners, colleagues &#8212; and then uses the information to personalise gift recommendations for those people, has raised $30 million, a Series B that it will be using to continue building out its platform, signing up more users, and hiring more people for its team.</p>
<p>This round is being led by General Catalyst, with Boston Seed Capital, Golden Ventures, Manifest, Morningside and Victress Captial &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alyce says that it has grown 300% year-over-year between 2019 and 2020, tackling a corporate gifting and promotional items industry that ASI Market Research estimates is worth around $24.7 billion annually. Its customers today include Adobe&#8217;s Marketo, G2, Lenovo, Wex, Invision, DialPad, GrubHub, and 6Sense.</p>
<p>As with so many other apps and services that aim at productivity and people management, Alyce notes that this year of working remotely &#8212; which has tested many a relationship and job function, led to massive inbound and outbound digital activity (the screen is where everything gets played out now), and frankly burned a lot of us out &#8212; has given it also a new kind of relevance.</p>
<p>“As everyone was flooded with spam last year unsubscribing soared,&#8221; Greg Segall, founder and CEO of Alyce, said in a statement. &#8220;When a prospect opts out, that’s forever. It’s clear that both brands and customers crave the same thing &#8211; a much more purposeful and relatable way to engage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alyce&#8217;s contribution to more quality engagement comes in the form of AI-fueled personalization.</p>
<p>Linking up with the other tools people typically use to track their communications with people &#8212; they include Marketo, Salesforce, Vidyard and Google&#8217;s email and calendar apps &#8212; the system has been built with algorithms that read details from those apps to construct some details about the preferences and tastes of the intended gift recipient. It then uses that to come up with a list of items that might appeal to that person from a <a href="https://help.alyce.com/article/111-what-types-of-gifts-can-i-give" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider list that it has compiled</a>, with some 10,000 items in all. (And yes, these can also include more traditional corporate swag items like those socks or mugs.) Then, instead of sending an actual gift, &#8220;Swag Select&#8221;, as Alyce&#8217;s service is called, sends a gift code that lets the person redeem with his or her own choice from a personalised, more narrowed-down list of items.</p>
<p>Alyce itself doesn&#8217;t actually hold or distribute the presents: it connects up with third parties that send these out. (It <a href="http://alyce.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices</a> its service based on how much it is used, and how many more tools a user might want to have to personalise and send out gifts.)</p>
<p>Yes, you might argue that a lot of this sounds actually very impersonal &#8212; the gift giver is not directly involved in the selection or sending of a present at all, which instead is &#8220;selected&#8221; by way of AI. Essentially, this is a variation of the personalization and recommendation technology that has been built to serve ads, suggest products to you on e-commerce sites, and more.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s an interesting solution to the problem of trying to figure out what to get someone, which can be a challenge when you really know a person, and even harder when you don&#8217;t, while at the same time helping to create and fulfill a gesture that, at the end of the day, is about being thoughtful of them, not really the gift itself.</p>
<p>(You could also argue, I think, that since the gift lists are based on a person&#8217;s observations about the recipient, there is in fact some personal touches here, even if they have been run through an algorithmic mill before getting to you.)</p>
<p>And ultimately, the aim of these gifts is to say &#8220;thank you for this work relationship, which I appreciate&#8221;, or &#8220;please buy more printer paper from me&#8221; &#8212; not &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for being rude to you at dinner last night.&#8221; Although&#8230; if this works as it should, maybe there might well be an opportunity to extending the model to more use cases, for example brands looking for ways to change up their direct mail marketing campaigns, or yes, people who want to patch things up after a spat the night before.</p>
<p>Notably, for General Catalyst, it&#8217;s interested indeed in the bigger gifting category, pointing to the potential of how this service could be scaled in the future.</p>
<p>“At General Catalyst, we are proud to lead the latest round of funding for Alyce as the company has reimagined the gifting category with technology and impact. The ability to deliver products and experiences that both the giver and recipient feel good about is incredibly powerful,” said Larry Bohn, Managing Director at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The once quiet world of seed investing became frenetic a few years ago as dedicated seed funds and angel networks increased in scale and velocity. That environment has now crescendoed into the present world of the seed capital hurricane: funds galore, solo capitalists splurging streams of rolling-capital dollars wherever they can find a cap table crevice, crowdfunding cash sloshing around — and in the eye of the storm are the founders looking to just snag a term sheet for their companies and get back to work.</p>
<p>Into that maelstrom comes <a href="https://www.indexventures.com">Index Ventures</a>, which today announced the close and launch of a new $200 million dedicated seed investing vehicle it’s dubbed Index Origin. The fund’s name pays homage to the firm’s long-standing commitment to seed and first-check investing, where it has backed companies as diverse as Robinhood, Figma, Deliveroo and Wise (aka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">the rebranded TransferWise</a>) at the seed state.</p>
<p>“Our view is that seed investing is truly the essence of venture capital,” said Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index since 2020 who joined the firm as a principal in 2017. “It&#8217;s when you as an investor have to take the biggest leap of faith.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She noted that the firm “in the last 18 months, I think we&#8217;ve made over almost 35 seed investments.” The new Index Origin fund would be a ramp up in terms of volume.</p>
<p>There’s extreme competition for cap tables at the earliest stages of startups today, and Index is focusing on a few offerings to maximize its sales pitch to founders.</p>
<p>The first emphasizes flexibility. Achadjian noted that there has been a sort of a devil’s bargain for founders on which type of funds to take at the seed stage. “Do you want a dedicated seed fund who is phenomenal at what they do, or do you want a multi-stage fund that might not have seed-specific resources but they can do a quick follow up [round],” she asked rhetorically. “There hasn&#8217;t really been the right product in the market to help founders have the best of both worlds, and so that was kind of our inspiration for Index Origin.”</p>
<p>Fitting its multi-stage thesis, all Index partners can write seed checks out of the new fund and they can invest in any vertical of interest to them in any geography (primarily the United States and Europe although it’s not explicitly limited to those markets). Achadjian noted that since the firm can potentially double down on later-stage rounds, the fund is more flexible in working with other firms, angels, and the whole coterie of funders at the seed stage.</p>
<p>That solves the capital component. As for providing more dedicated resources for seed founders, Index is offering a trilogy of programs to make it easier to scale businesses. They include a “First Hires” program designed to help with early hires at startups; an Early Adopter Network to help companies connect with potential design customers to find and accelerate product-market fit; and finally, The Index Network, an expert network of specialists (think DevOps, SalesOps, or technical architecture) that startup founders can consult on when they run into roadblocks. These programs and the seed fund writ large will have a dedicated team to help find and grow seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>“Our philosophy has been: we never say it&#8217;s too early for Index,” Achadjian said.</p>
<p>Part of the impetus for these new programs is the diverging mix of founders that have started companies in recent years. “We&#8217;ve actually found that a lot of founders, they used to have technical backgrounds, but in the last couple of years, it&#8217;s shifted to more business-background founders,” she said. That has meant helping these founders find technical talent and building up a network of technical expertise to help them grow.</p>
<p>Secondly, Index wants to increase the diversity of founders in its investment pipeline. “That&#8217;s another driver for why we wanted to do seed, because it gives us a broader access to the very, very top of funnel,” Achadjian explained. “I think if you want to make an impact for diversity, that&#8217;s actually the stage where you can make the biggest impact.”</p>
<p>Index’s approach matches that of Sequoia, which <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/25/sequoia-capital-raises-195-million-for-its-newest-seed-fund/">announced earlier this year</a> that it raised $195 million for a seed fund, also focused on the U.S. and Europe. Most other firms in the multi-stage investing game tuck seed bets inside their early-stage funds, rather than creating standalone investing vehicles. With potentially dozens of checks to write in the coming months, expect to see Index bring even more activity into the white-hot seed market.</p>
<p><em>Update: April 8, 2021: Updated the date Achadjian joined Index.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic sending the planet indoors to workout, the at-home fitness market has boomed. It was only in October last year that three-year-old <a href="https://www.future.co/">Future</a> closed $24 million in Series B and <a href="https://playbookapp.io/">Playbook</a> (streaming for personal trainers) raised $9.3 million in a Series A. Into this market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/fab-founder-jason-goldberg-is-back-with-moxie-a-new-live-streaming-fitness-marketplace/">launched</a> <a href="https://moxie.xyz/">Moxie</a>, a platform that allowed fitness instructors to broadcast live and recorded classes, access licensed music playlists and deploy a CRM and payment tools. Classes range from $5-$25 and various subscriptions and packages are offered.</p>
<p>Moxie has now raised a $6.3M &#8216;Seed+&#8217; funding round led by Resolute Ventures with participation from Bessemer Ventures, Greycroft Ventures, Gokul Rajaram, and additional investors. With the $2.1M Seed round from last October, that means Moxie has now raised a total of $8.4M.</p>
<p>With the funding, Moxie now plans to better optimize the user experience with a curated selection of top Moxie classes; new tools that help connect users to instructors; and the ability to preview classes before attending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company claims to have experienced &#8220;exponential growth” because of its convenience in the pandemic era, with 8,000 classes and 1 million class-minutes completed in March. Moxie’s independent instructors set their own schedules and prices, and get to keep 85% of what they earn on the platform.</p>
<p>The company will also now launch &#8216;Moxie Benefits&#8217; in partnership with Stride Health, provide instructors with access to health insurance, dental and vision plans, life insurance, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Also planned is &#8216;Moxie Teams’, enabling groups of instructors to join together to form small businesses on the platform, not unlike the way some Uber drivers form teams.</p>
<p>Jason Goldberg, CEO and founder said in a statement: “Moxie was born during the pandemic alongside thousands of independent fitness instructors who were forced out of gyms and studios and suddenly had to become entrepreneurs and navigate the new frontier of virtual fitness. Now we are seeing widespread adoption of online fitness into people&#8217;s lives, and Moxie’s growth proves that these shifts in consumer behavior have staying power. We know that 89% of Moxie users plan to continue virtual workouts post COVID — they love the convenience.”</p>
<p>Resolute Ventures Partner &amp; Co-Founder Raanan Bar-Cohen said: “Our investment theory has always been to identify entrepreneurial founders solving for today’s problems. With Moxie, we saw an experienced operator in Jason, with a product that solved for the issues that instructors and consumers had experienced in the shift to online fitness, as well as a clear roadmap for continued success.”</p>
<p>So why has Moxie managed to cleave to the new virtual workout culture? Goldberg tells me it’s down to a range of factors.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s a two-sided fitness marketplace that has live interactive group fitness classes, unlike VOD apps, and, crucially, unlike Peloton. Additionally, any instructor can teach on Moxie, rather than wait to be picked as a ‘star&#8217; by Peloton. Since 90% of classes are live group fitness classes, they are effectively replacing yoga studios and HIIT classes, rather than personal training. He says many top instructors are now earning $6-figures on the platform.</p>
<p>Certainly, Moxie has managed to capitalize on the fact that while gyms are closed, it’s easy to do virtual classes. Will they still stick around when the pandemic is over? Presumably many will find it more convenient than schlepping to the gym and less intimidating than joining classes in person. Additionally, users can switch classes as easily as switching TV channels.</p>
<p>As Goldberg told me via email: &#8220;Covid forced everyone to try virtual fitness for the first time. Guess what? People found it more convenient and more connected than going to offline gyms. And guess what? Peloton is not for everyone.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tines.com/">Tines</a>, a no-code automation platform co-founded by two senior cybersecurity operators, today announced that it has raised a $26 million Series B funding round led by Addition. Existing investors Accel and Blossom Capital participated in this round, which also includes strategic investments from CrowdStrike and Silicon Valley CISO Investments. After this round, which brings the total funding in the company to $41.1 million, Tines is now valued at $300 million.</p>
<p>Given that Tines co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoinhinchy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eoin Hinchy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-kinsella/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Kinsella</a> were both in senior security roles at DocuSign before they left to start their own company in 2018, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that the company&#8217;s platform launched with a strong focus on <a href="https://www.tines.com/security-teams">security operations</a>. As such, it combines security orchestration and robotic process automation with a low-code/no-code user interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tines is on a mission to allow frontline employees to focus on more business-critical tasks and improve their wellbeing by reducing the burden of ‘busy work’ by helping automate any manual workflow and making existing teams more efficient, effective, and engaged,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea here is to free analysts from spending time on routine repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on those areas where they can have the most impact. The tools features pre-configured integrations with a variety of business and security tools, but for more sophisticated users, it also features the ability to hook into virtually any API.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135427" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135427" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=2048,1360 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shot-002.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2135427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tines</p></div></p>
<p>The company argues that even non-technical employees should be able to learn the ins and outs of its platform within about three hours (sidenote: it&#8217;s nice to see a no-code platform acknowledge that users will actually need to spend some time with it before they can become productive).</p>
<p>“If software is eating the world, automation is eating the enterprise,&#8221; Hinchy said. &#8220;Yet, the majority of progress in this space still requires non-technical teams to depend on software engineers to implement their automation. Other platforms are generally either too hard to use, not flexible enough or not sufficiently robust for mission-critical workflows like cybersecurity. Tines empowers enterprise teams to automate any of their own manual workloads independently, making their jobs more rewarding while simultaneously delivering enormous value for their organizations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, which provides corporate cards and spend management software, announced that it has closed $115 million across two investments, the latter of which valued the company at $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-invests-in-brex-rival-ramp-at-1-6-billion-valuation">first reported</a> that Ramp was raising new capital. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/ramp-looks-to-raise-more-capital-as-the-corporate-spend-market-mints-unicorns/">confirmed the news</a> prior to the company&#8217;s announcement earlier today. Ramp raised the capital in two tranches, the first of which, a $65 million investment led by D1 Capital Partners, valued the startup at $1.1 billion. A $50 million investment led by Stripe, the online payments giant, pushed its valuation to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch, Ramp CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman?lang=en">Eric Glyman</a> was demure about the valuation differential between the two investments, only noting that different investing groups can have different assessments of the value of a company. TechCrunch&#8217;s read of the two-part fundraising event is that Stripe likely saw Ramp&#8217;s growing scale and wanted to put capital into it but had to pay a higher price for coming in after D1 had already written a check.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, Ramp&#8217;s latest capital raises are a multiple of the amount it last raised when it pursued primary funds, namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">its $30 million December, 2020 round</a>. The company raised twice in 2020, and once in 2019. More recently, Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">secured a $150 million credit facility</a> to help it support growing spend volume from its corporate customers.</p>
<p>Ramp provides corporate cards to customers, wrapped in software that helps companies track and manage overall spend. As part of its news today, the startup shared that it is &#8220;nearing&#8221; a transaction run rate of $1 billion. Glyman confirmed to TechCrunch that the metric was calculated on a month&#8217;s volume multiplied by 12, a reasonable method of determining the figure.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s spend run rate grew by around 400% in the last half year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;LatAm corporate spend-management startup Clara raises $3.5M, comes out of stealth&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/embed/#?secret=kpge0aDmpA" data-secret="kpge0aDmpA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ramp&#8217;s new capital, debt and valuation gains that it has managed thus far in 2021 may help it navigate competitive waters. Its rivals &#8212; Brex, TeamPay, Divvy, Airbase and others &#8212; are also well-capitalized and hungry to take an ever-larger chunk of the world of corporate expense under their belts.</p>
<p>Ramp, like many of its rivals, makes money by collecting a small slice of customer spend as revenue via interchange incomes. TechCrunch asked Glyman if he has plans to start charging for the software that Ramp currently provides its customers for free, as some of its rivals do. The CEO declined to guide us further than our own hunches.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reckons that while growth remains strong at Ramp and its fellow zero-cost corporate spend providers, they&#8217;ll stick with their current model. In time, however, we expect surviving players to ask their customers to pony up for at least part of the software stack that they currently receive for free.</p>
<p>The possibility is accentuated by the fact that Glyman told TechCrunch that his customers are removing existing software like Expensify in favor of Ramp&#8217;s own code in some instances. That means that those companies have spend budgeted that Ramp and others are not accreting to their own books.</p>
<p>And Ramp is not slowing down its product work. Almost all of its new capital, per Ramp&#8217;s CEO, will go into product work. The roughly 100-person company closed 2020 with around 65 people, and plans to continue doubling its headcount every six or eight months, according to Glyman.</p>
<p>Finally, what to make of Stripe on the Ramp cap table? Stripe itself has a <a href="https://stripe.com/corporate-card">corporate card and spend management product</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">was picky</a> when one of its backers put capital into a company that it construed as a rival. According to Glyman, the decision to take investment from Stripe came down to whether his team wanted to work with the larger company &#8212; they did &#8212; and whether they trusted the payments giant. He decided to. Stripe did not receive a board seat as part of its investment.</p>
<p>Perhaps we&#8217;ll see Ramp move its <a href="https://pages.marqeta.com/hubfs/pdfs/Ramp_Case_Study_v3.pdf">backend off of Marqueta</a> and over to Stripe&#8217;s own? Or perhaps Stripe subsumes Ramp at some point in the future. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.canvasmedical.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canvas Medical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electronic health records (EHR) startup, today announced their $17 million Series A and a new partnership with Anthem, one of the biggest health insurance companies in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-led by Inspired Capital and IA Ventures, with participation from Upfront Ventures. This round brings the company’s total funding to date to $20 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company, which launched in 2015, aims to help doctors experience a more efficient &#8212; and painless &#8212; approach to delivering value-based care by offering an EHR platform that promises “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% fewer clicks, 3x faster workflows, and the ability to truly work on one screen,” said Andrew Hines, the company’s CEO and founder.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2135535" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135535" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135535" style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?w=300" alt="Andrew Hines" width="377" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=768,769 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AndrewHines.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135535" class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Hines. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canvas Medical</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value-based care is a delivery model where providers are paid based on patient health outcomes </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">as opposed to the traditional pay-per-service model where doctors are reimbursed per visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen a transition in the U.S. toward value-based care over the last several years, and that shift is also being reflected in how doctors are getting reimbursed. As a result, existing EHR companies find themselves having to add bells and whistles to their platforms, which in turn has compromised the doctor’s workflow experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What has happened over time is we have asked our clinicians to become sophisticated coders. They are clicking through screens that are cluttered, that are not designed with human factors in mind,” said Steve Strongwater in </span><a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.16.0603"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catalyst</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a journal on innovation in care delivery published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Strongwater is a physician and the CEO of Atrius Health in Boston.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Current EHRs are a workplace hazard from an ergonomics perspective,” said Hines. “It’s like if you sit in the wrong chair day in and day out, your back is going to hurt.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While technology has made many people’s jobs easier, that’s not the case for doctors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown that </span><a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.16.0603"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EHRs are actually a source of physician burnout in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is in and of itself a problem of national concern. </span></p>
<p>The EHR market is extremely fragmented (there are several hundred EHR companies in the U.S.) which makes sharing medical records between physicians a challenge. Because health insurance claims contain significant medical information, insurance companies are a reliable alternative source for a lot of the important data about their members. But if a doctor needs to access that information for treatment purposes &#8211; which they have to do regularly &#8211; they have to log into a different portal or access a different report depending on each patient&#8217;s insurance. That’s one of the problems Canvas aims to solve, and their partnership with Anthem is just the beginning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s often a major amount of inertia &#8212; and associated cost &#8212; with changing EHRs, Hines, a data scientist-turned-entrepreneur, says the company assuages these concerns by leading its sale efforts with its numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doctors who use Canvas experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% more productivity in the first month and are able to save 1-2 hours a day charting &#8212; which allows them to see more patients or go home early,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Nigeria and Kenya have been at the forefront of African fintech innovation, activities in Egypt are beginning to shape up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Egypt is home to a burgeoning fintech startup ecosystem, and today, one of its biggest players, <a href="https://paymob.com/en">Paymob</a> announced that it has completed an $18.5 million Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2020, Paymob raised <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/paymob-3-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3.5 million as its first tranche</a> of Series A investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $15 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was raised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the same investors led by Dubai-based VC firm Global Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other investors include Egyptian investment fund A15 and Dutch development bank FMO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total raise of $18.5 million is the largest Series A round in Egypt yet and one of the largest equity rounds in North Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are delighted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lead this momentous fintech fundraise in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paymob has a perfect combination of high-quality technology, product customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cannot do without, and an outstanding management team, &#8220;Basil Moftah, general partner at Global Ventures, said of the investment.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their market opportunity is also huge; Egypt’s transformation to a cashless society is being enabled by the unique products Paymob has built.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paymob </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 by Alain El Hajj, Islam Shawky, and Mostafa El Menessy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform helps online and offline merchants to accept payments from their customers via several products and solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a payment gateway that merchants can plugin into their sites or mobile application using its APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For offline merchants, Paymob has a POS solution where they can receive in-store card payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also has a payment links feature where merchants share links with their customers to receive payments that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are received</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using mobile wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to the company, 85% of mobile wallets transactions carried out in Egypt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is processed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also claims to be the largest payment facilitator in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Egypt, Paymob is also present in Kenya, Pakistan, and Palestine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Shawky says the company has plans to expand into more Sub-Saharan African countries. However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that will come after focusing on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to gain a large market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regional expansion (with an imminent entry into Saudi Arabia this year) is one of Paymob&#8217;s objectives following this raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a statement released by the company, it will also use the investments to expand its merchant network, meet increasing demand, and improve product offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic presented one of the best opportunities for fintechs all over the world to achieve massive growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For Paymob, it claims to have grown its monthly revenue over 5x last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also recorded a total payment volume of more than $5 billion from over 35,000 local and international merchants like Swvl, LG, Breadfast, and Tradeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growth allowed the fintech company to raise the second tranche of investment after closing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $3.5 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shawky told TechCrunch that the deal materialized after the company&#8217;s investors and management </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an &#8220;unprecedented growth&#8221; driven by the pandemic &#8220;in addition to the new initiatives launched by regulators, which encouraged them to increase their investment to meet our increasing demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As earlier iterated, fintech is on the rise in Egypt with startups like Moneyfellows, NowPay, Raseedi, Flick providing lending, payments, wealth and personal finance management services, etc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Egyptian fintech ecosystem also got a major boost when incumbent fintech Fawry became a publicly-traded unicorn for the first time last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2007, Fawry has been the largest online payment platform in the country and offers a variety of services ranging from mobile wallet to banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ill its longstanding presence pose a challenge to Paymob&#8217;s quest to become a dominant fintech company as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Shawky doesn&#8217;t think so. According to him, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paymob&#8217;s major competitor is cash. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With only a small percentage of the economy operating in digital forms, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transforming cash into digital is yet to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be unlocked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the raise </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">follows the launch of two funds &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/after-its-first-54m-fund-algebra-ventures-launches-another-90m-fund-for-startups-in-egypt/">Algebra Ventures</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">Sawari Ventures</a> in what can be described as an exciting week for startups and VCs in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that began its journey in India 15 years ago, helping businesses reach and engage with users through texts said on Thursday it has attained the unicorn status and is also profitable.</p>
<p>San Francisco-headquartered Gupshup has raised $100 million in its Series F financing round from Tiger Global Management, which valued the 15-year-old startup at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The startup operates a conversational messaging platform, which is used by over 100,000 businesses and developers today to build their own messaging and conversational experiences to serve their users and customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.gupshup.io">Gupshup</a>, which has raised $150 million to date and concluded its Series E round in 2011, says each month its clients send over 6 billion messages.</p>
<p>“The growth in business use of messaging and conversational experiences, transforming virtually every customer touchpoint, is an exciting secular trend,&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global Management, in a statement. “Gupshup is uniquely positioned to win in this market with a differentiated product, a clear and sustainable moat, and an experienced team with a proven track record. In addition to its market leadership, Gupshup’s unique combination of scale, growth and profitability attracted us.”</p>
<p>Tens of millions of users in India, including yours truly, remember Gupshup for a different reason, however. For the first six years of its existence, Gupshup was best known for enabling users in India to send group messages to friends. (These <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-rise-and-fall-of-missed-calls-in-india/">cheap texts and other clever techniques</a> enabled tens of millions of Indians to stay in touch with one another on phone a decade ago.)</p>
<p>That model eventually became unfeasible to continue, Beerud Sheth, co-founder and chief executive of Gupshup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“For that service to work, Gupshup was subsidizing the messages. We were paying the cost to the mobile operators. The idea was that once we scale up, we will put advertisements in those messages. Long story short, we thought as the volume of messages increases, operators will lower their prices, but they didn’t. And also the regulator said we can’t put ads in the messages,” he recalled.</p>
<p>That’s when Gupshup decided to pivot. “We were neither able to subsidize the messages, nor monetize our user base. But we had all of this advanced technology for high-performance messaging. So we switched from consumer model to enterprise model. So we started to serve banks, e-commerce firms, and airlines that need to send high-level messages and can afford to pay for it,” said Sheth, who also co-founder freelance workplace Elance in 1998.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gupshup has expanded to <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/gip-messaging-service">newer messaging channels</a>, including <a href="http://store.gupshup.io">conversational bots</a> and it also helps businesses set up and run <a href="https://www.gupshup.io/developer/whatsapp-api">their WhatsApp channels</a> to engage with customers.</p>
<p>Sheth said scores of major firms worldwide in banking, e-commerce, travel and hospitality and other sectors are among the clients of Gupshup. These firms are using Gupshup to send their customers with transaction information, and authentication codes among other use cases. &#8220;These are not advertising or promotional messages. These are core service information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which had an annual run rate of $150 million, will use the fresh capital to broaden its product offering and court clients in more markets. Sheth said a similar use case with businesses he saw in India a decade ago is playing out in many emerging markets, opening avenue of growth for the business messaging platform.</p>
<p>“Gupshup’s mission is to build the tools that help businesses better engage customers through mobile messaging and conversational experiences. As we work towards our mission, we are delighted with this investment from Tiger Global, given its incredible track record of making big, bold, successful bets on innovative, category-defining companies worldwide,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SaaS to support mid-sized companies&#8217; financial planning with real-time data and native collaboration isn&#8217;t the sexiest startup pitch under the sun but it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s swiftly netted <a href="https://www.abacum.io">Abacum</a> a bunch of notable backers &#8212; including Creandum, which is leading a $7M seed round that&#8217;s being announced today.</p>
<p>The rosters of existing investors also participating in the round are Y Combinator (Abacum was part of its latest batch), PROFounders, and K-Fund, along with angel investors such as Justin Kan (Atrium and Twitch co-founder and CEO); Maximilian Tayenthal (N26 co-founder and co-CEO &amp; CFO); Thomas Lehrman (GLG co-founder and ex-CEO), Avi Meir (TravelPerk co-founder and CEO); plus Jenny Bloom (Zapier CFO and Mailchimp ex-CFO) and Mike Asher (CFO at Neo4j).</p>
<p>Abacum was founded last year in the middle of the COVID-19 global lockdown, after what it says was around a year of &#8220;deep research&#8221; to feed its product development. They launched their SaaS in June 2020. And while they&#8217;re not disclosing customer numbers at this early stage their first clients include a range of scale-up companies in the US and in Europe, including the likes of Typeform, Cabify, Ebury, Garten, Jeff and Talkable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s Spanish co-founders &#8212; Julio Martinez, a fintech entrepreneur with an investment banking background, and Jorge Lluch, a European Space Agency engineer turned CFO/COO &#8212; spotted an opportunity to build dedicated software for mid-market finance teams to provide real-time access to data via native collaborative that plugs into key software platforms used by other business units, having felt the pain of a lack of access to real-time data and barriers to collaboration in their own professional experience with the finance function.</p>
<p>The idea with Abacum is to replace the need for finance teams to manually update their models. The SaaS automatically does the updates, fed with real-time data through direct integrations with software used by teams dealing with functions like HR, CRM, ERP (and so on) &#8212; empowering the finance function to collaborate more easily across the business and bolster its strategic decision-making capabilities.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s sales pitch to the target mid-sized companies is multi-layered. Abacum says its SaaS both saves finance teams time and enables faster-decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prior to using Abacum, finance analysts in our clients were easily spending 50% to 70% of their time in manual tasks like downloading files from different systems, copy&amp;pasting them in massive spreadsheets (that crash frequently), formatting the data by manually adding and removing rows, columns and formats, connecting the data in a model prone to manual error (e.g. vlookups &amp; sumifs),&#8221; Martinez tells TechCrunch. &#8220;With Abacum, this entire manual part is automatically done and the finance professionals can spend their time analyzing and adding real value to the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We enable faster decisions that were not possible prior to Abacum. For instance, some of our clients were updating their cohort analysis on a quarterly basis only because the associated manual tasks were too painful. With us, they&#8217;re able to update the analysis weekly and take better decisions as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SaaS also supports decisions in another way &#8212; by applying machine learning to business data to generate estimates on future performance, providing an AI-based reference point based on historical data that finance teams can use to inform their assumptions.</p>
<p>And it aids cross-business collaboration &#8212; allowing users to share and gather information &#8220;easily through workflows and permissions&#8221;. &#8220;We see that this results in faster and richer decisions as more stakeholders are brought into the process,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Martinez says Abacum chose to focus on mid-market finance teams because they face &#8220;more challenges and inefficiencies&#8221; vs the smaller (and larger) ends of the market. &#8220;In that segment, the finance function is underinvested &#8212; they face the acute complexities of scaling companies that become very pressing but at the same time they are still considered a support function, a back-office,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abacum makes finance a strategic function &#8212; we deliver native collaboration to finance teams so that they become the trusted business partner they want to be. We also see that the pandemic has accelerated the need for finance teams to collaborate effectively and work remotely,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>He also describes the mid market segment as &#8220;fairly unpenetrated&#8221; &#8212; claiming many companies do not yet having a solution in place.</p>
<p>While competitors he points to when asked about other players in the space are long in the tooth in digital terms: Adaptive Insights (2003); Host Analytics (2001); and Anaplan (2008).</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed round in a statement, <span data-token-index="0" data-reactroot="">Peter Specht, principal at Creandum, added</span>: &#8220;The financial planning processes in many companies are ripe for disruption and demand more automation. Abacum&#8217;s slick solution empowers finance teams to be more collaborative, efficient and better informed with access to real-time data. We were impressed by their user-friendly product, the initial hiring of top talent, and crucially the strong founders and their extensive operational experience &#8212; including as CFOs and entrepreneurs who have experienced the problem first-hand. We are delighted to be part of Abacum&#8217;s journey to empower global SMEs to bring their financial operations to new levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abacum&#8217;s seed financing will be ploughed into product development and growth, per Martinez, who says it&#8217;s focused on wooing finance teams in the US and Europe for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://butter.us/">Butter</a>, a startup registered in Denmark but operating fully remote, is building an &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; platform for planning and running virtual workshops.</p>
<p>Offering video software and other features dedicated to workshopping, the idea is to pull people away from using more generic tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which, arguably, aren&#8217;t well suited to workshops. It&#8217;s also an idea that will be welcomed by many remote workers trapped in a groundhog day full of back-to-back Zooms &#8212; and one that has already attracted venture capital.</p>
<p>Backing Butter&#8217;s seed round of $2.75 million, which is being disclosed today, is Project A. Others investing in the burgeoning startup are Des Traynor, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Intercom (amongst other angels). It adds to $440,000 previously raised through a mix of equity funding from Morph Capital, venture debt from The Danish Growth Fund and grants from Innovation Fund Denmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butter co-founder and CEO Jakob Knutzen tells me that workshop facilitators, such as strategy consultants, HR trainers and design sprinters, typically have two problems: technical overload and a lack of energy in the workshops.</p>
<p>The former includes having to juggle too many tools needed to plan, run and disseminate a workshop, coupled with unintuitive interfaces and an inability to set up elements of a workshop in advance. The lack of &#8220;energy&#8221; when delivering workshops virtually is likely a harder nut to define and then crack, but anyone who has taken part in an online workshop has likely experienced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We solve these in two ways,&#8221; says Knutzen, &#8220;[with an] all-in-one tool that helps facilitators prepare, run and debrief the workshop in one place, [and] a delightful design that supports facilitators in delivering a more human experience&#8230; 90% of our users comment on this; Zoom fatigue is real&#8221;.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134583" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134583" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134583" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=2048,1229 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Butter-UI-w.-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134583" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Butter</p></div></p>
<p>You get started in Butter by creating and setting up a &#8220;room,&#8221; including optionally creating an agenda, polls and timers, as well as various customisation, such as a welcome page, image and (yes) music. Next, you invite workshop participants via an automatically generated link that can easily be shared.</p>
<p>On the day, participants join directly in their browser and the workshop leader runs the workshop using the agenda they created as the main guiding point. Butter also supports various third-party integrations, such as for white boarding, note taking, etc. After the session, facilitators can access a &#8220;recap&#8221; in the room overview with a chat transcript, recording and poll results, etc.</p>

<p>Adds the Butter CEO: &#8220;Down the line, we&#8217;ll make this even more &#8216;full workshop flow&#8217; &#8212; [including] more of the planning part, having a full pre-workshop space for participants, building out the post-workshop experience, etc. But for now, we&#8217;ve doubled down on making the &#8216;during&#8217; part flow smoothly&#8221;.</p>
<p>To that end, Butter is yet to monetise, but will adopt a SaaS model. Meanwhile, Knutzen cites competitors as established but generalist platforms, such as Zoom and Teams; legacy specialist platforms, such as Adobe Connect and Webex for Training; and other startups trying to solve the same problem (e.g. Toasty.ai, circl.es and VideoFacilitator).</p>
<p>&#8220;We differentiate ourselves by being laser focused on workshops,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.shilling.vc/">Shilling</a>, an early-stage VC in Portugal, has now launched a new €30M ($35.6M) early-stage fund called Shilling Founders Fund, which is backed just over 35 successful tech founders, as well as large European VC Atomico. The fund will run on a profit-sharing model, sharing fund returns with all of its portfolio founders. While the fund tends to back Portuguese startups it also hold back 40% of its capital for international deals.</p>
<p>The fund says it has already invested in seven companies: Rows (spreadsheet for app creators), Vawlt (secure and resilient multi-cloud platform), Promptly (SaaS platform for health outcomes analytics), Modatta (decentralized marketplace for consented personal data), Biocol Labs (DTC post-chemical pharmacy), Decipad (low-code notebook) and Detech.ai (AI-powered application and infrastructure monitoring platform).</p>
<p>The fund is also launching what it dubs the “Shilling Platform” &#8211; a pool of learnings and resources for startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Pedro Santos Vieira, managing partner at Shilling said: &#8220;We call it experience-based acceleration. Additionally, we run on a profit-sharing model. Each portfolio founder will receive a share of our returns. This twofold approach fully aligns incentives between Shilling, LPs, and portfolio founders.”</p>
<p>Founded by Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, António Casanova, Diogo da Silveira, João Coelho Borges, Juan Alvarez and Pedro Rutkowski in 2011, Shilling was later joined by tech founders Ricardo Jacinto (Elecctro), Miguel Santo Amaro (Uniplaces), Pedro Ramalho Carlos (IP) and Pedro Santos Vieira (GoodGuide) in the last five years. Since 2011, it has invested in a number of breakout hits from the country, including Unbabel; Bizay; Uniplaces; and Best Tables, acquired by TripADvisor.</p>
<p>Hugo Gonçalves Pereira, founder of Shilling, added: “We are a Portugal-based, globally ambitious, VC fund, with a founder-friendly approach to early-stage investing&#8230; and when we say founder-friendly we truly mean it: in our pre-seed program, ventures go from first call, to money in the bank, in less than 30 days.”</p>
<p>As we noted earlier this year in our ExtraCrunch survey of Lisbon, Portugal, the city is gearing up to join other significant tech hubs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://truelayer.com/">TrueLayer</a>, the London startup that offers a developer-friendly platform for companies, including other fintechs, to utilise open banking, is disclosing $70 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The Series D round is led by new investor Addition. Existing investors, including Anthemis Group, Connect Ventures, Mouro Capital, Northzone and Temasek, also participated. New investors include Visionaries Club, Zack Kanter (CEO Stedi), Daniel Graf (ex-Uber, Google, Twitter) and David Avgi (ex-CEO SafeCharge, CEO UniPaaS).</p>
<p>TrueLayer says the Series D brings the total investment to date to $142 million. The injection of capital will be used to continue scaling its open banking network, which brings together payments, financial data and identity to enable companies to build new products that improve &#8220;how we spend, save, and transact online&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will include further development of premium open banking-based services that go beyond simply accessing open banking APIs and will enable more innovation across financial services, including embedded finance and payments more generally.</p>
<p>To do this, and to support what it says is growing demand, TrueLayer is expanding its engineering, product and commercial teams. In the past 12 months, the fintech has expanded its services across 12 European markets.</p>
<p>Over the years, TrueLayer CEO and co-founder Francesco Simoneschi and I have often pontificated on what open banking&#8217;s killer use case or use cases may turn out to be. We may finally have our answer: payments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because one aspect of open banking is payment initiation, which lets an authorised third party initiate the transfer of money out of your bank account on your behalf as an alternative to card payments, which were never built with online payments in mind.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/">TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TrueLayer, the open banking API provider, discloses investment and partnership with Visa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/truelayer-the-open-banking-api-provider-discloses-investment-and-partnership-with-visa/embed/#?secret=VSJVCUMHTf" data-secret="VSJVCUMHTf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We believe open banking payments will become the default way to pay online, replacing other payment methods in the next five years,” says Simoneschi. “Open banking is digitally native and mobile-first, moving money at a fraction of the cost, securely and conveniently, while also delivering a vastly better consumer experience”.</p>
<p>The past year has also exposed some of the problems with existing payments methods, as people have turned to digital channels to manage every aspect of their lives. “The problem is cards,” says the TrueLayer CEO, “which weren’t designed for online and have been retrofitted into current online payment flows. Newer digital approaches such as Google Pay or Apple Pay paper over those cracks but don’t change the fundamentals”.</p>
<p>Simoneschi says the company has seen the use of its payments API grow rapidly as more consumers embrace instant bank payments. Volumes grew by 600x over the last year, driven by more and more companies adopting open banking payments, including the likes of Revolut, Trading 212, Freetrade and Nutmeg.</p>
<p>“We typically see that 1 in 3 customers choose the open banking payment option after trying it once,” he notes, revealing that for some clients, closer to 70% of their customers are using open banking as the primary payment method.</p>
<p>“There are a number of reasons why it makes sense for customers. For one, they don’t need to remember card details. Instead, they authenticate with their face or fingerprint on their mobile device, instantly and securely. Plus, they’ll never need to update stored details if their card is lost, stolen or expires”.</p>
<p>Open banking payments as a checkout option benefits merchants too, argues Simoneschi. “These payments typically convert 20% better than cards (and up to 40% with our flows) and have success rates higher than 95%, equating to millions or hundreds of millions in recovered revenue at the end of the year,” adds the TrueLayer co-founder.</p>
