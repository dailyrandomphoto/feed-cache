<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend was all about memecoins. And I am sorry about that. But Equity doesn&#8217;t run the world, sadly, it merely notes what is going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogecoin dropped during Elon Musk&#8217;s SNL appearance. Which was somewhat ironic. Also there&#8217;s another memecoin that is skyrocketing.</li>
<li>Palantir, DoorDash, Airbnb, Alibaba will report earnings this week, amongst others.</li>
<li>Clubhouse is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">finally coming to Android</a>. In the United States. By invite. So, if that&#8217;s you, congrats, welcome to the app.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/top-us-fuel-pipeline-operator-pushes-recover-cyberattack-2021-05-09/">major cyberattack</a> and ransom situation in the United States is a data point, yet again, that we&#8217;re woefully unprepared for cyber risk.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">StuDocu raised $50 million</a> which was cool, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/telkomsel-invests-an-additional-300-million-in-gojek/">Gojek raised another $300 million</a>, which was the very opposite of surprising.</li>
<li>This week&#8217;s Extra Crunch Live is going to be really good. I will see you there!</li>
</ul>
<p>It is going to be a busy week! Already since we recorded this show there&#8217;s more drama from Box, and more. Strap in!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It is clear that Black, women, Latinx and LGBTQ+ startup founders face an uphill battle when it comes to getting a share of the VC investment pie in Silicon Valley. Perhaps that&#8217;s why <a href="https://www.sixty8.capital/">Sixty8 Capital</a>, a firm based in Indianapolis, Indiana, smack dab in the middle of the country, has chosen to launch a new $20 million fund aimed at providing early stage funding for underrepresented founders.</p>
<p>The fund&#8217;s investors include The Indiana Next Level Fund, 50 South Capital, Bank of America, Eli Lilly and Company, First Internet Bank and the Central Indiana Community Foundation. It&#8217;s working with another Indy based VC firm, <a href="https://www.allosventures.com/">Allos Ventures</a>, and Paul Ehlinger from Allos will be a venture partner at Sixty8.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this fund, what we&#8217;ll get to do is really start to empower people of color, women and other diverse communities by putting capital directly into their hands. Being able to invest directly into companies that are building amazing solutions that just so happen to be founded by diverse people. So that is why we launched Sixty8. I think there&#8217;s a unique opportunity we can address, and I&#8217;m really excited to have an impact both in our community in Indiana, but also around the Midwest and parts of the South as well,&#8221; Kelli Jones, managing partner at the firm explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jones told me that she grew up in Indianapolis, and after moving to New York and later LA to work at the intersection of music, tech and entertainment, she returned to Indy in 2016 to begin helping Black people in the community where she grew up get trained to get decent jobs both in and out of tech. That led to the development of a startup incubator focused on Black founders and later a pitch competition.</p>
<p>She said at that point, it was clear the founders she was working with needed access to capital to have a chance to grow the businesses they were starting as part of the incubator and pitch competition, and the idea of an early stage fund began to take shape. She said that Indiana is known for B2B SaaS and she wanted to tap into that energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we&#8217;re known as B2B SaaS and we&#8217;ve had some amazing exits here with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">ExactTarget and Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/angi/">Angie&#8217;s List</a> and <a href="https://www.genesys.com/en-gb/company/newsroom/announcements/genesys-to-acquire-interactive-intelligence2">Interactive Intelligence and Genesys</a>, and so we&#8217;ve had a lot of really amazing things happening in the tech realm locally, but there&#8217;s not a lot of conversations being had around diversity and seeing more people of color and women and LGBTQ founders,&#8221; Jones told me.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taking stock of the VC industry&#8217;s progress on diversity, equity and inclusion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/taking-stock-of-the-vc-industrys-progress-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion/embed/#?secret=jed0enZHfw" data-secret="jed0enZHfw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The plan is to provide seed, pre-seed and maybe piggyback on an occasional A round with investments that range between $250,000 and $500,000 per company. She says that there is a ready pipeline from her other ventures including the incubator and pitch competitions and she is also plugged into the community where there is lots of startup energy.</p>
<p>She says that they wanted to set up a fund not only to address issues of diversity and having diverse people making decisions on investments, but also based on a strategy where the firm was able to invest in companies that may not always be perceived as typical venture backed business targets.</p>
<p>The first investment is with a B2B SaaS company called <a href="https://www.qualifi.hr/">Qualifi</a>, which uses AI to help companies with high volume hiring loads get through the qualification round much faster, taking from 7-10 days down to 3 or less, Jones told me.</p>
<p>The name of the firm hails back to 1968, a time in history when there was a lot of protest bubbling up around the country and calls for more equality for people of color, women and Gay rights. Jones says they had a different name when the firm first launched in 2019, but this seemed so much more appropriate for a company focused on empowering diverse groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re still marching and trying to survive the same way we were in 1968 during the Civil Rights [movement] where we lost big leaders, and where the fire in everyone was just so big. We were fighting for women&#8217;s rights and Latino rights and Black rights and there was just so much happening, and it seems like in 2021 like we really still are in that same space,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thesnackapp.com/">Snack</a>, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">video-first mobile dating app</a> designed with a younger generation in mind, is opening itself up to Gen Z investors. The startup today announced the launch of its own <a href="https://angel.co/i/0N91X">Gen Z Syndicate</a> on AngelList, which will allow Gen Z community members, influencers, creators and others to participate in the company&#8217;s upcoming $2 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity">SAFE</a>, alongside other funds and angel investors.</p>
<p>The company in February <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">announced $3.5 million</a> in seed funding for its modern, TikTok-style dating app where users post videos to a feed which others then like in order to be matched. Snack believes videos allow users to better showcase their interests and lifestyle, as well as show off their personalities in ways static photos cannot. When two people like each other&#8217;s videos, they&#8217;re invited to direct message one another.</p>
<p>The experience is very much like engaging with a TikTok that&#8217;s built for dating. In fact, Snack is one of the first apps that will be adopting<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/tiktok-expands-integrations-with-third-party-apps-for-logins-sharing-sounds-and-more/"> TikTok&#8217;s new Login SDK for third-party apps,</a> which gives Snack&#8217;s users the ability to reshare their TikTok videos to their dating profiles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Snack&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlykaplan">Kim Kaplan</a>, has a history in the dating app market. She previously led product, marketing and revenue at Plenty of Fish, which later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/match-group-buys-plentyoffish-for-575m-to-bag-more-singles/">sold to Match Group for $575 million</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about Plenty of Fish, we really launched off of Google SEO,&#8221; Kaplan explains. &#8220;Then you had Zoosk and Badoo, which launched off of Facebook &#8212; when it was a really early platform and it was easy to get traffic from it. Then you had Tinder and Bumble, which launched off of mobile-first. They were the first apps to come out and design and build with mobile in mind versus the rest of us which were desktop, trying to cram everything into a mobile phone,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I fundamentally believe now that the right opportunity is the distribution on TikTok, as well as influencers. I think that combination of TikTok being the new distribution channel is going to be a massive opportunity &#8212; and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to leverage,&#8221; Kaplan says.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Snack is likely to grow beyond the young, Gen Z demographic. Already, the app is attracting users in their 20&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s, thanks to its TikTok ties. But as TikTok naturally ages up, so will Snack.</p>
<p>Snack began fundraising in September of last year, then hired the team, built the app and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/snack-where-tiktok-meets-dating-gets-3-5-million-in-funding/">launched</a> in late February.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149736" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149736" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2149736" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/SnackBanner-1920x960-1.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149736" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snack</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re only about eight weeks into this right now, but we&#8217;re seeing a lot of excitement, a lot of user growth,&#8221; Kaplan says. &#8220;Because of that excitement that&#8217;s kind of building, people &#8212; a lot of really interesting people &#8212; came to the table and said they wanted to invest. But I didn&#8217;t have any room left in the previous rounds, so I decided to open up a SAFE.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of that SAFE, Snack is carving out a certain amount to create its own syndicate. That way, Kaplan notes, &#8220;we don&#8217;t have any carry fees with another person, and [we&#8217;re] opening it up to Gen Z investors that want to participate in the round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Originally, the carve-out began at $100,000 but there is already enough interest that Kaplan says she expects it to go higher &#8212; perhaps a couple hundred thousand or larger, based on demand.</p>
<p>Among the Gen Z investors are VCs who have heard about Snack, but whose fund primarily invests at a later stage. Others are just people the company has been working with and getting advice from while building out the the app.</p>
<p>For example, Kaplan had reach out to the <a href="https://genzmafia.com/">Gen Z Mafia</a>, a group of technologists working to make venture capital and startups <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/style/gen-z-tech-mafia.html">more inclusive</a>, to help consult on Snack. The group&#8217;s leaders, <a href="https://twitter.com/emmalsalinas?lang=en">Emma Salinas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhuebecker/">Nicholas Huebecker</a>, are credited with helping Kaplan come up with Snack&#8217;s pretzel logo and its brand name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Video first dating allows a unique sense of expression that you can&#8217;t portray with a few well-crafted words and filtered pictures,&#8221; said Huebekcer, of his interest in Snack. “For a mobile-first generation, this new form of authenticity will grow to be necessary. Snack allows users to express their real selves just like they do on TikTok, Snapchat, and other platforms we love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Technology investor and Founder at The Innovation Armory, Samuel Natbony, is also joining the SAFE, alongside Monique Woodard (Cake Ventures), Backbone Angels, Shakti Ventures, Christian Winklund (previously CEO of dating app Skout <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160627006328/en/MeetMe-to-Acquire-Skout">which sold to Meet Group</a>), Andrew Wilkinson and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Gen Z to have a seat at the table and help shape what Snack becomes,&#8221; says Kaplan. &#8220;I want them to have that voice and participate, and be a champion for Snack,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s make it clear from the outset that this story is about an expense management SaaS business called <strong>Expensify</strong>. As you&#8217;d expect, yes, this is about the expense management market and how Expensify has grown, its technology and all of that. Normally, that would make us change the channel. But this is also a story about pirates; peer-to-peer hackers who asked, &#8220;Why not work from Thailand and dozens of countries across the globe?&#8221; and actually did it using P2P hacker culture as a model for consensus-driven decision-making — all with pre-Uber Travis Kalanick in a guest-starring role.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, this is a story about just not giving a damn about what anyone goddamn thinks, an approach to life and business that led to more than $100 million in annual revenue, and an IPO incoming on what looks to be a very quick timetable. Prodigious revenues, 10 million users and only 130 employees running the whole shebang — that&#8217;s a hell of an achievement in only 13 years.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going a bit &#8220;WTF,&#8221; well, we’d concur. Expensify is as contradictory as they come in the enterprise world. It’s managed to take what might well be the most boring part of the corporate business stack and turn it into something special. It doesn’t borrow its culture from other startups, it built its own tech stack from the ground up, and even hires in a completely radical way. Oh, and no one really has job titles either, because why the hell bother with hierarchy anyway? They’re pirates after all.</p>
<p>If expense management is about avoiding corporate plunder, then letting the pirates and hackers run the ship is probably the best approach. And now, Expensify is plundering the corporate spend world one travel ticket and business meal at a time just as the world is rebuilding in the wake of COVID-19.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <strong>Anna Heim</strong>. Heim is a tech journalist and former startup founder who has written for different tech publications since 2011. She recently joined Extra Crunch as a daily reporter, where she will be sharing insights on startups, particularly in SaaS. The lead editor of this package was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the series editor was <strong>Danny Crichton</strong>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and original illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman </b>with art direction from <strong>Bryce Durbin</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Expensify had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Heim has no financial ties to Expensify or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Expensify EC-1 will be a serialized sequence of five articles published over the course of the coming weeks. We interviewed the company in February and March, well <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en/Expensify-Announces-Confidential-Submission-of-Draft-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering">before the company announced a confidential filing of its S-1 to the SEC</a>. Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s natural to think an expense report management business would play it by the book. But one look at Expensify is enough to tell you that this is a company that never even looked for the book.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Individuality often has no place in the enterprise software space. In a market where a single contract can easily run into the millions, homogeneity is the herald of reliability and serves to reassure buyers of the worth of their potential purchase.</p>
<p>So it’s natural to think a company in the expense report management business would keep it simple and play it by the book. But one look at Expensify is enough to tell you that this is a company that never even looked for the book.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Expensify&#8217;s origin story is one of a scrappy group of developers who turned travel into a catalyst for ideas and stuck together through highs and lows, ending up building one of the most unexpectedly original companies in enterprise software today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Right from its famous &#8220;workcations,&#8221; to its management structure and its decision-making policies, Expensify has it in its DNA to eschew so-called best practices for its own ideas — a philosophy rooted in its founder and early team’s P2P hacker background and do-it-yourself attitude. As a result, Expensify is atypical of startups in many ways, inside and out.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO David Barrett made it clear his company was different in our first call itself: &#8220;We hire in a super different way. We have a very unusual internal management structure. Our business model itself is very unusual. We don’t have any salespeople, for example. We’re an incredibly small company. We focus on the employees over the bosses. Our technology stack is completely different. Our approach toward product design is very different.&#8221;</p>
<p>That description would make some people call Expensify weird even by startup standards, but this essential difference has set it apart in a space dominated by giants such as <a href="https://www.concur.com/">SAP Concur</a> and Coupa. And that’s ultimately been to its benefit: Expensify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a> in 2020, with hefty 25% EBITDA margins to boot. There were also rumors of the company planning to go public during our interviews for this EC-1, but they stopped speaking to us in March, and now we know why: <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">Expensify confidentially filed to go public on May 3</a>.</p>
<p>Expensify&#8217;s origin story is one of a scrappy group of developers who turned travel into a catalyst for ideas and stuck together through highs and lows, ending up building one of the most unexpectedly original companies in enterprise software today.</p>
<h2>When David met Travis …</h2>
<p>To truly understand Expensify, you first need to take a close look at a unique, short-lived, P2P file-sharing company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Swoosh">Red Swoosh</a>, which was Travis Kalanick&#8217;s startup before he founded Uber. Framed by Kalanick as his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QrX5jsiico"> &#8220;revenge business&#8221;</a> after his previous P2P startup<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scour_Inc."> Scour</a> was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/scour-sued-over-downloaded-movies/">sued</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/12/scour-going-going-gone/">into oblivion</a> for copyright infringement, Red Swoosh would be the precursor for Expensify&#8217;s future culture and ethos. In fact, many of Expensify’s initial team actually met at Red Swoosh, which was eventually acquired by Akamai Technologies in 2007 for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/04/12/payday-for-red-swoosh-15-million-from-akamai/"> $18.7 million</a>.</p>
<p>Barrett, a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/david-barrett">self-proclaimed alpha geek</a> and lifelong software engineer, was actually Red Swoosh&#8217;s last engineering manager, hired after the failure of his first project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122173504/http://www.iglance.com/faq.html">iGlance.com</a>, a P2P push-to-talk program that couldn&#8217;t compete against Skype. &#8220;While I was licking my wounds from that experience, I was approached by Travis Kalanick who was running a startup called Red Swoosh,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.sramanamitra.com/2014/08/24/building-a-profitable-steady-growth-subscription-business-expensify-ceo-david-barrett-part-1/">recalled</a> in an interview.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bankwithfair.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multilingual digital bank and financial services platform, is launching to the public after raising $20 million in 40 days earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Khalid Parekh raised the capital primarily from the very demographic that Houston-based Fair aims to serve: from a group consisting of a number of immigrants, many of whom were first-time investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was not a single check from a VC or bank or from a family office,” Parekh told TechCrunch. “Ninety percent of our investors are minorities or are immigrants like myself that believed in the concept of Fair.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could say that it’s also fitting that Fair’s headquarters are in Houston, which at the time of the last census was the most ethnically diverse city in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parekh is not your traditional fintech founder. He doesn’t have banking or financial services experience, although he <em>does</em> have experience founding and running a successful company: AMSYS Group, which is valued at nearly $350 million. His mission with Fair is largely personal. Upon arriving in the U.S. from India with just $100 in his pocket 22 years ago, he struggled to not only get a loan but also to open a bank account. </span></p>

There is not a lot of help for immigrants who don’t understand it well,” Parekh recalls. “My biggest challenge was sending money back home. There was just a lack of welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, he used his own cash to build out the technology behind Fair, which is designed to be an option to those who are new to the country, have no credit or need access to interest-free loans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair operates with Coastal Community Bank as its sponsor bank.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Parekh’s goal with Fair is to provide “ethical, transparent banking” – to anyone – via a membership model that eliminates all banking fees. Members can pay a one-time membership fee of $99 (paid in full or in installments) to have access to all of Fair’s online banking and financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another challenge that I saw is that there were hardly any options for insurance and retirement services for immigrants and low-income people,” Parekh said. “All big institutions catered to people with a lot of money. But we want to create an institution where we are fair to everybody, regardless of religion, race, color, net worth or how much is in their bank account. We want everyone to be treated the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, the nation has seen a surge of neobanks emerge aimed at specific demographics, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Boulevard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/cheese-raises-3-6m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-the-asian-american-community/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/softbank-bets-big-on-a-digital-ellis-island/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also aimed at serving the immigrant population. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair aims to differentiate itself, according to Parekh, by offering interest-free lending, as well as the ability to invest, get insurance and plan for retirement in one platform that is available in English, Arabic and Spanish (with more languages to come). Ultimately, his goal in Fair is to help address</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the “longstanding racial income inequalities and widening wealth disparities in the U.S.” He won’t get a salary for his role as CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Fair’s features are free international transfer, early access to paycheck funds, “instant, interest-free” microloans &#8212; essentially buy now, pay later at the register &#8212; an annual dividend account, debit card accounts for kids and interest-free loans for home, auto and business that are equity-based. Those equity-based loans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are <a href="https://www.guidanceresidential.com/resources/faith-based-financing/what-is-an-islamic-mortgage-and-how-does-it-work/">Sharia compliant</a>, meaning that it’s not kosher to take interest. They also comply </span><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4108763/jewish/Moneylending-and-Jewish-Law.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Jewish law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, if a member wants to buy a home, they can put 20% down, and Fair will provide 80% via an LLC, of which the member and bank will be co-owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The members will have the option of buying out our shares on whatever schedule they wish,” Parekh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In partnership with Avibra, Fair is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering free supplemental life, accident medical and AD&amp;D insurance to all members as part of its banking services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair aims to practice socially responsible investing (SRI), an approach to investing</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that reduces exposure to companies that are deemed to have a negative</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social impact. The fintech also practices ESG investing, which measures the sustainability of an investment</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and its overall impact in three specific categories: environmental, social and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate governance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And, it’s also working with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">United Nations High Commissioner for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Refugees and World Relief, and will donate 2.5% of profits to refugee</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">missions globally, as well as racial economic empowerment initiatives.</span></p>
<p>Among Fair&#8217;s advisors are <span style="font-weight: 400;">Manolo Sánchez, a director at Fannie Mae and Stewart Information Systems and former chair &amp; CEO of BBVA Compass, and Samuel Golden, managing director at management consulting firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal and founder of A&amp;M’s Financial Industry practice.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three years after its inception, crypto financial service provider Babel Finance is racking up fundings and partnerships from major institutional investors. The startup said Monday that it has closed a $40 million Series A round, with lead investors including Zoo Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Dragonfly Capital, Bertelsmann and its Asian fund BAI Capital, and Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>For years, traditional investors were reluctant to join the cryptocurrency fray. But in 2020, Babel noticed that many institutions and high net worth individuals began to consider crypto assets as an investment class.</p>
<p>Babel, with offices in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore, wanted to capture the window of opportunity and be one of the earliest to help allocate crypto assets in investors&#8217; portfolios. But first, it needed to win investors&#8217; trust. One solution is to have reputable private equity and venture capital firms on its cap table.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more of a brand boost so we can attract more institutions and build up credibility,&#8221; Yulong Liu, Babel&#8217;s head of global partnerships, said of the financing which is a strategic round as Babel had<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;reached profitability&#8221; and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t actively looking for funding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>To vie for institutional customers and wealthy individuals, Babel plans to spend its fresh proceeds on product development, compliance and talent acquisition, seeking especially banking professionals and lawyers to work on regulatory requirements. It currently has a headcount of 55 employees.</p>
<p>Mainstream investors are jumping into the crypto scene partly because many see bitcoin as a way to hedge against &#8220;solvency and credibility risks&#8221; amid global economic uncertainties caused by Covid-19, said Liu. &#8220;Bitcoin is not something controlled by the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other trigger, Liu explained, was what shock the industry in February: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Elon Musk bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin</a> and declared Tesla would begin accepting the digital token as payments. That sparked a massive rally around bitcoin, sending its price to over $40,000.</p>
<p>Babel&#8217;s evolution has been in line with the trajectory of the industry. In its early days, the startup was a &#8220;crypto-native&#8221; company offering deposit and loan products to crypto miners and traders. These days, it also runs a suite of asset management products and services tailored to enterprise clients around the world. It&#8217;s applying for relevant financial licenses in North America and Asia.</p>
<p>As of February, Babel&#8217;s crypto lending business had reached an outstanding balance of $2 billion in equivalent cryptocurrency, the firm says. It has served more than 500 institutional clients and sees about $8 billion in direct trading volume each month. 80% of its revenues are currently derived from institutions. The goal is to manage one million bitcoins within four years.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For many founders, Y Combinator is a coveted milestone on the entrepreneurial road. As of<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies"> January 2021</a>, the accelerator has helped create 60,000 jobs, has 125 companies valued over $150 million, and has facilitated top exits totaling more than $300 billion. Past alumni include Airbnb, DoorDash and Coinbase &#8212; all of which are now publicly traded.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the program has a strict selection process &#8212; with rumors claiming that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/startup-odds-of-success-2013-5">less than 5%</a> of startups are accepted, making Y Combinator one of the most prestigious accelerators out there. Competition may be fierce, but it&#8217;s not impossible, and jumping through some hoops is not only worth the potential payoff but is ultimately a valuable learning curve for any startup.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Y Combinator isn&#8217;t bluffing when it says it wants founders to make “something people want.”					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs trying to get into Y Combinator are often at an early point in their journeys and haven’t yet built up the experience to know exactly what kind of business can hit the ground running. This is where a harsh journey of trial and error helps entrepreneurs face the reality of their business model. Going through the Y Combinator program’s rigorous vetting gives founders a sense-check of what they’re missing, and who they&#8217;re missing. Take it from someone who applied to the program 13 times before getting in.</p>
<p>Of course, 13 applications require a degree of time and money that startups don&#8217;t always have, so I&#8217;ve condensed my four biggest takeaways from the experience. Here&#8217;s how to work toward landing in the small percentage of startups successfully accepted to the Y Combinator program:</p>
<h2>Put your business value before your personal vanity</h2>
<p>In a sea of applications, it&#8217;s easy to feel like you have to distinguish yourself and your startup in a striking way. For me, I made my mark through an encounter with Paul Graham, one of the founders of Y Combinator &#8212; although not in the way I had hoped for.</p>
<p>Graham had written a lot of online essays and resources for startups. In 2012, I thought it would be great to download Graham’s essays, browse by most-used words and publish my findings on Hacker News. However, Hacker News is the social news website run by Y Combinator, and the morning after I shared my work I woke up to an email from Graham asking me to swiftly take it down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.teamblind.com">Blind</a> has carved out a unique niche in the social-networking world. It’s an app of verified, pseudonymous employees talking to each other about what’s going on at their employers, trading notes on everything from layoffs, to promotions, to policies. Part LinkedIn, part Reddit, part Slack — it’s become widely popular among tech workers at Silicon Valley companies and even outside the tech industry, with 5 million verified users.</p>
<p>Workplaces have changed dramatically post-COVID-19, with remote work becoming more of a norm, and that has made Blind indispensable for many workers who feel increasingly alienated from their companies and their colleagues.</p>
<p>The company announced this morning a $37 million Series C funding round led by South Korean venture firm Mainstreet Investment along with Cisco Investments and Pavilion Capital, a subsidiary of Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek. The company had <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1651006/000165100621000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">filed a Form D in late March for roughly $20.5 million</a>, and the $37 million represents the final total fundraised.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/11/blind-loyalty/">last did a deep dive in the company back in 2018</a>, so what’s changed? Well, first, there’s the pandemic. Co-founder and general manager Kyum Kim says that Blind’s users are now coming to the app all throughout the day. “Usage used to peak during the commute times,” he said. “8-10 AM before COVID and then after work, 7 PM-10 PM was another timeframe that people used to use Blind a lot. But now, it has kind of flattened out [throughout the day].” The new peak is 2 PM, and according to Kim, users are logging in 30 times per month over about 13-15 days.</p>
<p>This gets to the first of two areas where Blind is experimenting with revenue generation. As remote work has taken hold, particularly at tech companies, internal messaging channels have become less valuable as sources for clear information from executive leadership. Blind believes it has a better pulse on how employees are feeling about policies and their employers, and is building tools around, for example, pulse surveys to give HR teams better insight than they might get from other services.</p>
<p>“People are just more honest on our platform versus these company-sponsored channels,” Kim said. We’re “probably the only platform where people are coming voluntarily, have visibility into their intentions, how they feel about their company’s policies.” Blind wants to protect the identities of its users, while also offering aggregate insights to companies.</p>
<p>To that end, last week the company brought on Young Yuk as chief product officer. Yuk had been an advisor to Blind for the past four years, while daylighting in senior product roles at Intuit, Yelp, and Glassdoor. Kim believes that Yuk’s experience across consumer and enterprise will fit the unique needs of Blind’s business, which combines a consumer social network with B2B products.</p>
<p>For its own users though, the second area of attention is perhaps the most interesting: recruiting. Blind users are obsessed with career paths and compensation, and Kim said that “80% of our search keywords on Blind are company names or company names attached to levels, locations, or teams.” People want to know how to move their careers forward, an area companies are notoriously bad about explaining, and so “people come to Blind to find information from these verified employees.”</p>
<p>Blind is building what it calls “Talent by Blind,” a platform for capturing this hiring intentionality and selling it to recruiters. The goal is to transfer people whose intentions might be, say, L5 engineer at a big tech company in Seattle to a separate platform that can be used as a top-of-funnel for company recruitment efforts. Blind says a couple of companies are currently using this platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148479" style="width: 656px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148479" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148479" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?w=646" alt="" width="646" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png 8100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=285,300 285w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=768,809 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=646,680 646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=1459,1536 1459w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=1945,2048 1945w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Talent-by-Blind.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148479" class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Talent by Blind&#8221; is a platform to help transfer potential recruits into the top of the recruiting funnel at companies.

<p>Ultimately, Blind’s path has been one of slow and steady growth. The company claims to be deliberate in that approach, noting that pseudonymous communities often falter when they grow too fast and norms aren’t established early. Unlike more notorious anonymous communities from years past like Secret or YikYak, the company says that its network tends to be quite safe, since employees verify their identities and know that they are speaking directly to their colleagues.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148480" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148480" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148480" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png 1778w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=1536,696 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BlindZoomPhoto.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148480" class="wp-caption-text">Blind&#8217;s team has expanded in recent years. Image Credits: Blind.</p></div></p>
<p>Revenue approaches remain experimental, but ultimately, the key is that it has the users that companies want to hear from: their own employees and potential future employees. We want to “maintain that integrity with users,” Kim said. “‘Ally to employees and advisor to companies’ is the phrase we are trying to go for.”</p>
<p>“It’s been eight years we have been doing this business, [and] we have been focused on the longness,” he said. “There’s a lot of optimism in the company.” He would know — he probably checked Blind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>What a week! It&#8217;s too much to cover everything that happened in world of transportation, so here are some of the highlights. Oh, and yes, I know that the big story this weekend was Elon Musk&#8217;s appearance on SNL. Since there&#8217;s no shortage of hot — and tepid — takes on Twitter and the rest of the interwebs, I think I&#8217;ll pass on any commentary.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, it&#8217;s worth noting that what Musk says publicly about Tesla Autopilot and the company&#8217;s progress on a fully autonomous driving system directly contradicts with reality — and what his own employees are telling regulators.</p>
<p>A memo that summarizes a meeting between California regulators and employees at the automaker shows that Musk has inflated the capabilities of the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system in Tesla vehicles, as well the company&#8217;s ability to deliver fully autonomous features by the end of the year. The memo was released by transparency site Plainsite, which obtained it via a Freedom of Information Act request. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving/">read the whole story here</a>.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>

<p>News and announcements this week demonstrated how micromobility businesses are evolving and merging with other forms of mobility.</p>
<p>No company embodies this better than <strong>Revel</strong>, the company that began with shared electric mopeds and, since the start of 2021, has evolved into an e-bike subscription service, an EV charging hub and an all-Tesla, all-employee ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>What, one might ask, is founder and CEO Frank Reig up to? Well, we did ask it, and we published our interview so our readers could learn more about Revel&#8217;s journey and plans for the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re talking about electrifying mobility in major cities, it starts with infrastructure. And we&#8217;re the company rolling up our sleeves and doing it now by building that infrastructure and operating fleets. Because in a city like New York, the infrastructure does not exist for electric mobility.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="awOoXNJFE2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/revels-frank-reig-shares-how-he-built-his-business-and-what-hes-planning/">Revel&#8217;s Frank Reig shares how he built his business and what he&#8217;s planning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Revel&#8217;s Frank Reig shares how he built his business and what he&#8217;s planning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/revels-frank-reig-shares-how-he-built-his-business-and-what-hes-planning/embed/#?secret=awOoXNJFE2" data-secret="awOoXNJFE2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another company that&#8217;s diving straight into the subscription model is the Australian startup <strong>Zoomo</strong>. The startup — which connects the gig economy, subscription services, electric mobility and big business — has a business model that wouldn&#8217;t have seemed possible more than a decade ago. Zoomo offers monthly e-bike subscriptions to gig economy bike delivery workers and corporate partners with bike delivery fleets. The startup announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">raised $12 million</a>, only a few months after an $11 million Series A. Zoomo said it will use the fresh cash to expand its service into more of the U.S. and into continental Europe, as well as to further develop its consumer subscription offerings.</p>
<h3>Betting on e-mopeds</h3>
<p>Micromobility charging infrastructure company <strong>Swiftmile</strong> is partnering with European e-moped manufacturer <strong>GOVECS Group</strong> to deploy Mobility Hubs to charge and organize e-mopeds in shared and commercial fleets. With included parking stations, this model, which we&#8217;re starting to see with e-bikes and e-scooters, could be a great way to eliminate the use of vans to swap batteries. Germany is expected to see the first of these hubs in Q1 2022.</p>
<h3>A small win for JOCO</h3>
<p>Last week, I wrote about <strong>NYC Department of Transportation&#8217;s</strong> cease-and-desist order to the new e-bike-sharing platform <strong>JOCO</strong>. The company ignored the order, maintaining that since its bikes are stationed in private garages, the city doesn&#8217;t have the authority to control its operations. To that, the city replied with a lawsuit, demanding a halt in operations and penalties for violations.</p>
<p>On May 7, the court denied the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/nyc-files-lawsuit-to-halt-citi-bike-rival-jocos-ebike-operations/">city&#8217;s request for a temporary restriction</a> on JOCO&#8217;s operations. The case is very much still open, but it&#8217;s a small win for JOCO and will allow the company to continue operating and expanding as scheduled. The hearing is scheduled for June 16, during which time the city is likely to drive home its exclusive partnership with Lyft-owned Citi Bike.</p>
<h3>#BatteriesForBirds</h3>
<p>As a recent transplant to New Zealand, I can tell you that this country really loves its native birds (and therefore, often hates cats, which are not native). Because of the isolation of New Zealand&#8217;s ecosystem, mammalian life never arrived or evolved, meaning the country has only native birds, insects and reptiles and amphibians &#8212; and not much in the way of predators, allowing the birdlife to flourish.</p>
<p>I say all of this so you understand the significance of <strong>Lime&#8217;s</strong> plan to give its old scooter and bike batteries a second life powering tools designed to save these precious birds. The project, done in partnership with <a href="https://cacophony.org.nz/"><strong>The Cacophony Project</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.2040.co.nz/"><strong>2040 Limited</strong></a>, will use damaged Lime e-bike battery cells to power thermal cameras that are used to identify bird predators.</p>
<h3>Bike launches</h3>
<p><strong>CERO</strong>, the LA-based ebike startup, has launched its CERO One electric cargo bike for preorders. The bike, with a small front tire, a big back tire and racks over each one, is designed to carry loads up to 77 pounds. Customers can choose between a Platform, Small Basket, and Big Basket variant. The starting price (including a front platform) is $3,799, and first deliveries can be expected around August or September.</p>
<p><strong>Aventon</strong> has also announced the launch of the newest model of its Aventure e-bike, complete with fat tires and a color display screen that syncs with your smartphone to handle functions like turning the bike on, tracking mileage, powering on and off the lights and planning trips.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all acquisitions and SPAC rumors in the world of autonomous vehicles. There are still traditional VC raises taking place, even in the midst of continued consolidation.</p>
<p><strong>Einride</strong>, the Swedish startup known for its unusual-looking electric and autonomous pods that are designed to carry freight, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/autonomous-trucking-startup-einride-raises-110m-ahead-of-expansion-into-united-states/">raised $110 million</a> to help fund its expansion in Europe and into the United States. The Series B round, which far exceeds its previous raises of $10 million in 2020 and $25 million in 2019, included new investors Temasek, Soros Fund Management LLC, Northzone and Maersk Growth. Existing investors EQT Ventures, Plum Alley, Norrsken VC, Ericsson and NordicNinja VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Einride has raised a total of $150 million to date. The company didn&#8217;t share its post-money valuation.</p>
<p>Einride is an interesting case study in the AV world. It has a present-day business of human-driven electric trucks, which carry freight for customers like Coca Cola and Oatly. It&#8217;s also developing, testing and eventually planning to deploy its Pod vehicles, which are designed without a cab. These Pods are meant to operate autonomously, although it should be noted that they are also supported with teleoperations, which means a human monitors and can control the vehicle remotely.</p>
<p>Einride had planned to expand into the U.S. but COVID-19 interrupted the move. Now, with fresh capital co-founder and CEO Robert Falck told me that the company is planning to have operations up and running in the U.S. before the end of the year. The plan is to set up headquarters in Austin, Texas, and open additional offices in New York and Silicon Valley. Global agreements are in place with brands such as Oatly, which includes U.S. operations, with more to be announced soon.</p>
<p>Einride&#8217;s presence in the United States, and specifically Texas, brings yet another AV company focused on freight into the region. Middle-mile delivery is getting more attention, interest and investment as 2021 unfolds. Another competitor in the region promises to spice things up, particularly on the hiring front.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firefly Aerospace</strong> raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/firefly-aerospace-raises-75m-series-a-at-a-1b-valuation-plus-100m-in-secondary-sale/">$175 million</a>, across a $75 million Series A round that valued the company north of $1 billion, and a $100 million secondary transaction which consisted of the sale of holdings held by primary Firefly investor Noosphere Ventures. The launch startup also announced that it intends to raise another $300 million later in 2021, after its forthcoming inaugural Alpha rocket launch, which is currently targeting a June take-off.</p>
<p><strong>Kneron</strong>, a startup that develops semiconductors to give devices artificial intelligence capabilities by using edge computing, received a $7 million boost in capital from Delta Electronics, a Taiwanese supplier of power components for Apple and Tesla. The $7 million investment pushes Kneron&#8217;s total financing to more than $100 million to date. As part of the deal, Kneron also agreed to buy Vatics, a part of Delta Electronics&#8217; subsidiary Vivotek, for $10 million in cash, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/delta-electronics-kneron/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reinvent Technology Partners X</strong>, a new special purpose acquisition company created by Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828109/000119312521151887/d162107ds1.htm">filed for an IPO</a>. The filing states that the SPAC is looking at merging with a late-stage company in a &#8220;technology sector or subsector, including consumer internet, online marketplaces, ecommerce, payments, gaming, artificial intelligence, SaaS, digital healthcare, autonomous vehicles, transportation, and others.&#8221; The duo&#8217;s previous SPAC announced earlier this year it agreed to merge with <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Power</strong>, Louisville, Colorado-based developer of solid-state batteries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">raised $130 million in Series B funding round</a> led by Ford and BMW, the latest signal that the two OEMs see SSBs powering the future of transportation. Under the investment, Ford and BMW are equal equity owners, and company representatives will join Solid Power&#8217;s board. Solid Power received additional investment in the round from Volta Energy Technologies, the venture capital firm spun out of the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Youibot</strong>, a four-year-old startup that makes autonomous mobile robots for a range of scenarios, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/youibot-funding/">raised 100 million yuan</a> ($15.47 million) in its latest funding round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia, the Seoul-based early-stage arm of the global investment behemoth. Youibot&#8217;s previous investors BlueRun Ventures and SIG also participated in the round. Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that Softbank Ventures Asia led a financing round back in December for another Chinese robotics startup called KeenOn, which focuses on delivery and service robots.</p>

<p>President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> isn&#8217;t the only person in Washington with his eyes on electrifying transportation. Two separate pieces of legislation were introduced in Congress this week aimed at boosting zero-emission vehicle use in the country.</p>
<p>First, we have a $73 billion proposal introduced May 4 by Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). Their plan, &#8220;<a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Clean%20Transit%20for%20America%20FINAL%2005042021.pdf">Clean Transit for America,&#8221;</a> would replace more than 150,000 diesel buses, vans, ambulances and other publicly-owned vehicles with zero-emission models, as well as building out charging infrastructure to support the new fleet.</p>
<p>The following day, Reps. Andy Levin (D-Mich.) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) re-introduced a revised version of the <a href="https://andylevin.house.gov/sites/andylevin.house.gov/files/Levin_EV%20Freedom%20Act_Bill%20Text.pdf">&#8220;Electric Vehicles Freedom Act&#8221;</a> to build out a network of EV charging stations across the country. Democrats supported a version of this bill last year. Although that bill failed, Biden&#8217;s outspoken support for EVs and his $2 trillion climate plan may give this new bill a more optimistic fate.</p>
<p>On the same day that Reps. Levin and Ocasio-Cortez announced their bill, a House subcommittee on Commerce and Energy <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-the-clean-future-act-driving-decarbonization-of-the">held a hearing</a> to discuss yet another bill that was introduced back in March. This bill, known as the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/CFA%20Bill%20Text%202021.pdf">CLEAN Futures Act</a>, is the Democrats&#8217; comprehensive climate legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nationally by 50% by 2030. It would also earmark billions for EV infrastructure and to spurn domestic manufacturing of EV parts, like batteries. (Are you keeping all of this straight?)</p>
<p>Not every lawmaker at the hearing was so enthusiastic on the terms of the CLEAN Futures Act. There was particular pushback from Republicans. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich) said that the bill would &#8220;push&#8221; EVs on Americans &#8220;whether they are ready for them or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have concerns that the CLEAN Future Act puts the cart before the horse by mandating electric vehicles, because there is no consideration for American workers or car buyers, our growing reliance on China for critical materials and minerals to make batteries, and certainly the strain that EVs will place on our grid,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Greg Pence (R-Indiana) added that the future of the transportation industry should not be a &#8220;one-size-fits-all made by Washington.&#8221; He said that hydrogen and renewable diesel should also be considered alongside battery electric.</p>
<p>During that same House subcommittee on Commerce and Energy meeting, most of which was spent on the CLEAN Future Act, several other proposed bills were mentioned, including the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILL-117hr2852ih.pdf">&#8220;NO EXHAUST Act,&#8221;</a>  the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILL-117hr1221ih.pdf">&#8220;Electric Vehicles for Underserved Communities Act of 2021&#8221;</a> and the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILL-117hr2308ih.pdf">&#8220;Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Future Act of 2021&#8221;</a> or the &#8220;ATVM Future Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NO EXHAUST Act promotes the electrification of the transportation sector to improve air quality and electric vehicle infrastructure access &#8212; especially in rural, urban, low-income,and minority communities, according to Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who introduced the bill.</p>

<p>We hear things; and we&#8217;re here to share them with you.</p>
<p>Remember waaaaayyyyy back in April when a report from The Information said that Argo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky told employees in an all-hands meeting that the autonomous vehicle startup was planning for a public listing later this year? At the time, and right here in The Station, I provided a bit more context, noting that while Salesky did indeed mention the prospect of an IPO during the company&#8217;s regular weekly all-hands meeting, there was more to the story.</p>
<p>The comments were made as the CEO discussed upcoming important milestones in 2021 that will lead to an IPO or a significant raise of some kind. The upshot: apparently all fundraising options are on the table, including a merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC. (Argo has raised $2 billion to date.)</p>
<p>Now, it appears that Argo is leaning towards a more traditional investment path — at least, at first. In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-05-04/argo-ai-ceo-salesky-sees-us-deployment-of-autonomous-vehicles-plots-ipo-video?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg&#8217;s Ed Ludlow</a>, Salesky said the company is going to be raising money this summer. His public comments support what I&#8217;ve heard from folks in the know.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">&#8220;We&#8217;re</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">really</span> <span

<p>Speaking of Argo, the company revealed new details on a long-range lidar sensor that it claims has the ability to see 400 meters away with high-resolution photorealistic quality and the ability to detect dark and distant objects with low reflectivity. The technology, which is the product of Argo&#8217;s acquisition of lidar company Princeton Lightwave, is poised to help it deliver autonomous vehicles that can operate commercially on highways and in dense urban areas starting next year.</p>
<p>The company said  the first batch of these lidar sensors are already on some of Argo&#8217;s test vehicles, which today is comprised of Ford Fusion Hybrid sedans and Ford Escape Hybrid SUVs. By the end of the year, Argo&#8217;s test fleet will transition to about 150 Ford Escape Hybrid vehicles, all of which will be equipped with the in-house lidar sensor. Ford, an investor in and customer of Argo, plans to deploy autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing and delivery in 2022. Argo&#8217;s other investor and customer, Volkswagen, said it will launch commercial operations in 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week we saw some major backing of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/in-the-race-towards-web-3-financial-privacy-secret-network-attracts-backing-from-key-players/">Secret Network blockchain</a>, as significant blockchain players Arrington Capital and Blocktower Capital invested in the privacy-first smart contract platform. What this is signaling is the rise of privacy-oriented financial blockchain projects, which are crucial if “DeFi” (decentralized finance) is to have any kind of future. We have come to expect privacy in our ’normal’ financial lives, so we will expect it in the blockchain world.</p>
<p>Today there’s a new signal that this privacy movement in DeFi is taking off with the announcement from privacy decentralized finance company <a href="https://sienna.network/">Sienna Network</a> that it has raised $11.2 million from institutional investors and its public supporters. Of that raise, the private token sale raised $10 million from investors including NGC, Inclusion Capital, Lotus Capital, FBG, Skyvision Capital and others. It also raised $1.2 million on the DaoMaker and Polkastarter exchanges.</p>
<p>Sienna Network is built on the afore-mentioned Secret Network, and pitches itself as a privacy-first and cross-chain decentralized finance platform allowing asset holders to switch to privacy-oriented tokens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sienna is one of an increasing number of blockchain startups tackling the industry-wide problem of &#8216;front-running’. This &#8211; says Sienna &#8211; is where bad actors hijack future trades on public DeFi blockchains.</p>
<p>Monty Munford, chief evangelist and core contributor to Sienna Network said: &#8220;Sienna helps access to the privacy-preserving blockchain in a user-friendly way due to the blockchain’s inherent privacy design. Sienna saves no login information, no wallet data, no transaction data, or anything else. It does not even track its website or give any information to any Third Party.”</p>
<p>Here’s how a front-running scam works: A transaction on Ethereum can be preempted by someone else simply by them paying a higher transaction fee. It&#8217;s the close equivalent in the real world of trumping a trade on the stock market, just because you paid a higher fee to a broker. In other words, it’s a disaster if it continues to happen, and the entire infrastructure of decentralized finance is threatened because of this threat.</p>
<p>Commenting, Tor Bair, CEO Secret Network said: &#8220;We believe Sienna will be a key pillar of Secret DeFi and help drive mass adoption of a more secure decentralized financial ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google, which reaches more than half a billion people in India, is turning its services into tools to help the world&#8217;s second largest internet market fight the pandemic.</p>
<p>Google said on Monday it has rolled out a range of updates to its Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Pay services in India to display and boost authoritative and credible information about the coronavirus to help people in the South Asian nation find vaccination centers and other resources to navigate the crisis.</p>
<p>Google Search, which has been offering updates on the virus for more than a year, now also displays information panels with vaccine registration details in India and highlights the official Indian government website for the vaccine at the top.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Search and Maps that have been showing 2,500 testing centers in India now similarly also show locations of over 23,000 vaccination centers across the country in English and eight Indian languages. The company said it is working with India&#8217;s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to source this information.</p>
<p>Google, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, said it is also testing a Q&amp;A function in Google Maps in India to enable people to ask about and share local information on the availability of beds and medical oxygen in select locations in the country.</p>
<p>The new features rollout comes as India reports over 350,000 infections and over 3,500 fatalities everyday. The nation’s healthcare infrastructure is struggling to serve patients, having largely run out of beds and medical supplies. On May 1, India opened vaccination to those aged between 18 to 45, leaving people in scrambles as they struggled to register on the government website and secure the appointment for a vaccination dose.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/vaccine-finder-locater-india/">scores</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/walmarts-flipkart-to-cover-insurance-for-all-sellers-in-india-and-waive-additional-fees/">firms</a>, startups, entrepreneurs and investors have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">stepped up to fill this gap</a>. And Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp have become the real-time helpline as people exchange leads with one another.</p>
<p>Google said it is also using its various channels to help extend the reach of health information campaigns in India. This “includes the ‘Get the Facts’ around vaccines campaign, to encourage people to focus on authoritative information and content for vaccines. We’re also surfacing important safety messages through promotions on the Google homepage, Doodles and reminders within our apps and services,” it wrote in <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/05/an-update-on-our-covid-response.html">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTube, Google has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YTIndia">curated a set of playlists</a> with videos that offer authoritative information about the vaccine, the spread of the virus, and facts from experts. The company said it has also rolled out a COVID Aid campaign on Google Pay to enable users to donate to non-profit organizations such as GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation, Goonj, Save the Children, Seeds, UNICEF India (National NGOs) and United Way.</p>
<p>The company said a similar campaign to support several other foundations has raised over $4.6 million.</p>
<p>“As India battles this devastating wave, we’ll keep doing all we can to support the selfless individuals and committed organizations on the front lines of the response. There’s a long way to go—but standing together in solidarity, working together with determination, we can and will turn the tide,” <a href="https://india.googleblog.com/2021/05/an-update-on-our-covid-response.html">read</a> a blog post signed by Covid Response team at Google India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telkomsel, a unit of Indonesia’s largest telecom operator Telkom, has invested an additional $300 million in ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek, the two firms said Monday, just months after the network provider <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/indonesian-telecom-network-telkomsel-invests-150-million-in-gojek/">wrote a $150 million check</a> to the Southeast Asian firm.</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid Gojek working to seal a proposed merger with e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/tokopedia-ma-gojek-idUSL4N2M22GY">$18 billion deal</a> would result in a new entity called GoTo, according to media reports. Telkomsel’s investment today likely makes it one of GoTo’s top eight investors.</p>
<p>Gojek &#8212; which has raised over $3.45 billion to date from high-profile investors including Google, Facebook, PayPal, Visa, and Tencent &#8212; and Telkomsel said their strategic partnership will “open up new synergies as the two companies scale up digital services and deliver new, innovative solutions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two firms have maintained a deal since 2018 to subsidize the cost of mobile data consumed by the ride-hailing firm’s driver partners.</p>
<p>With more than 170 million subscribers, Telkomsel is the largest telecom operator in Indonesia. In addition to ride-hailing, Gojek has expanded to several additional businesses, including digital payments and food delivery in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Today’s news follows a $150 million investment Telkomsel made in Gojek in November last year. The two firms have since integrated several aspects of their services to accelerate digitization of micro, small and medium enterprises and bringing greater cost savings for driver partners.</p>
<p>Some of these include integration of Telkomsel MyAds with GoBiz, which enables Gojek&#8217;s MSME partners to use MyAds to efficiently expand their outreach to Telkomsel users, and easy onboarding for Gojek MSME partners to become Telkomsel reseller partners through the DigiPOS Aja! Application.</p>
<p>The two firms also co-market gaming services through Telkomsel’s Dunia Games and GoPay in collaboration with Tencent, providing greater value for PUBGM users, they said.</p>
<p>“Telkomsel is optimistic that this latest investment will open more opportunities for society to access advanced digital technology-based innovations developed by homegrown companies,” said Telkomsel chief executive Setyanto Hantoro in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether learning online or taking a class in person, every student knows all too well how important it is to have good notes from your classes as a key way to remember and apply what you&#8217;ve been taught. Now, an Amsterdam-based startup called <a href="https://www.studocu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StuDocu</a>, which has built a big and profitable business by way of a platform to help source and share the best student-created class notes, is announcing $50 million in funding on the heels of huge growth &#8212; a sign of demand and opportunity in the space.</p>
<p>The Series B is coming from Partech, the French VC, and it comes as StuDocu is gaining some critical mass: the startup says it now reaches 15 million users across 2,000 universities in 60 countries. What&#8217;s notable about that scale is not just the size but the fact that it had been achieved while the company was previously largely bootstrapped: Both <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/90237-70/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/studocu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a> note only about $1.5 million raised before now, but in fact CEO Marnix Broer tells me that it had quietly raised just under $10 million before now with previous investors including Piton Capital, Peak Capital and Point Nine Capital.</p>
<p>A lot of the focus in edtech in the last year of Covid-19 living has been on technology that helps people learn remotely as well (or maybe even better) than they might have done in more traditional, physical environments: improved streaming experiences, better approaches for teaching via a screen, tools for managing the experience, and so on. StuDocu both fits that mold, but also, in a way, is a throwback to the more basic approach we associate with learning: sitting in a class and taking notes during the lessons.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That was the environment in which four students came together and first formed StuDocu.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, where StuDocu is based, a large amount of one&#8217;s evaluation in an undergraduate class is based on how you do in the final exams, and so the notes have perhaps even more disproportionate value.</p>
<p>CEO Marnix Broer, along with his friends Jacques Huppes, Lucas van den Houten and Sander Kuijk, saw an opportunity while still students back in 2013 to leverage the power of the internet and crowdsourcing, to make it easier for people who were studying the same course at university to connect together online and help each other by uploading notes from their courses and exchanging them with each other &#8212; the power of many being one way of better covering your bases in the knowledge department.</p>
<p>(Huppes has stepped away from the company in an active role but remains an advisor, the other two are still there, Broer said.)</p>
<p>Initially the product was &#8220;completely free,&#8221; he said, and was organically a popular enough concept that it not only picked up users at their university in Delft, but also a number of other schools. Then, as the founders approached graduation, &#8220;we decided we needed to earn some money,&#8221; and with the concept still going strong, they turned their attention to making their tool into a business.</p>
<p>Through a couple of iterations, &#8220;We finally came up with trying to keep as much free as we can in a freemium model,&#8221; Broer said. In StuDocu&#8217;s case, using the data they had amassed about how much certain documents were viewed, downloaded and recommended over others, they created a top 20% of all documents, which were labelled premium, &#8220;so you either upload your own docs or pay a small subscription fee to access them.&#8221; Conversely, this also means that 80% of documents on the site are all still free.</p>
<p>StuDocu also built a few pieces of technology into its platform to help fight against scammers or people trying to game it: the only users who it now measures to determine what is premium content are premium users themselves, who do not get any indication of what is premium content on the site and what is not, and are more likely more serious and heavier users of StuDocu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the best quality documents to stay up and the rest to drift down the pile, so that our users only experience great notes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we know if a few upload garbage we haven’t lost money on it. We just gave access for free and should not have. At the end of the day, it’s a community and we believe that will ensure the quality stays high.&#8221; They also incentivise people to review documents with lottery tickets and other rewards.</p>
<p>And it has increasingly been adding in more ways of scanning materials to determine that what people are submitting are actual notes about the subject at hand, rather than blank documents or random unrelated writing. A recent search partnership with Algolia, Broer said, should also help with more granualar document searches, rather than simply searching by university and course to find materials.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a compelling business model that helps square the issue that a lot of user-generated content sites have, which is that the vast majority are consumers rather than creators. Broer said that currently some 15% of its users pay for the service, 15% access it by uploading content, and 70% of its base are using it free and not uploading anything.</p>
<p>Through its gradual building up of a business from a tool that they built to help themselves, StuDocu went, Broer said, from &#8220;working in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squat</a>&#8220;, to taking a small and cheap space with interns, to what Broer describes &#8220;a normal office.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of other edtech companies that have identified the potential of providing platforms for students to help each other with learning. <a href="https://brainly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brainly</a>, another big one out of Europe (specifically Poland) built its concept not around notes but students helping each other answer homework questions, similar to <a href="https://www.chegg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chegg</a>. <a href="https://nexusnotes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NexusNotes</a> out of Australia also has built a platform aimed at amassing notes; <a href="https://www.academia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Academia</a> includes not just notes but also research papers; <a href="https://www.docsity.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docsity</a> also focuses on both class notes and papers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/studysmarter-books-15m-for-a-global-personalized-learning-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StudySmarter</a> also out of Europe also brings in notes but also applies AI to shape a person&#8217;s learning progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most similar and StuDocu&#8217;s biggest competitor of all is <a href="https://www.coursehero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Course Hero</a> out of the U.S., which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/course-hero-a-profitable-edtech-unicorn-raises-rare-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at around $1.1 billion</a> (a notable number here too, since StuDocu is not disclosing valuation).</p>
<p>&#8220;We consider ourselves the leading global player,&#8221; Broer noted, with more than 30 local languages supported across its catalog of courses and notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We help millions of students and have millions of documents, but at the same time we consider ourselves a hyper-local marketplace,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Three hundred people who are on the same law course can now communicate and share knowledge with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>This funding will be an interesting test of both extending that hyper-local concept to more places, but also tapping into opportunities where the help that might come could have a much bigger impact.</p>
<p>In the UK, for example, going down another age bracket younger than university to students of high school age (14 and up), the majority of them are studying to prepare for two sets of tests, GCSEs that you take in year 11 (aged 16/17 usually) and A-Levels you take in year 13 (18/19 years old), both based around very specific subjects and thus based on very particular curriculums that literally the whole country studies together. That is to say, even if individual schools or teachers might have different approaches or teach better or worse, at the end of the day, all the students will be taking the same examinations in their specified subjects.</p>
<p>This presents an interesting opportunity to a company like StuDocu, which could build a much bigger network of users as a result on an even smaller proportion of contributed, strong notes (since more of the users will all be needing the same materials). This is also a model used in other places, and Broer said StuDocu is well on its way to testing and slowly expanding in specifically these kinds of markets at the moment.</p>
<p>And you could argue that even if standardized tests were not a part of the equation, students will want better notes to use for other kinds of coursework, such as essay writing, or simply to help retain knowledge as they continue to learn. With some 200 million people currently in university education, there are a lot of opportunities to find variations on the premise.</p>
<p>There might also be possibilities down the line to work more closely also with universities to build out the course materials &#8212; also a big area considering that a lot of professors already provide notes for their lectures to students &#8212; although Broer said that for now its focus is remaining on students and their needs, since in many cases professors still do not do this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for all of these reasons that investors are there for StuDocu&#8217;s funding.</p>
<p>“StuDocu is a platform already helping millions of students around the world, and we’re excited to partner with this talented team in their mission to make education more accessible to all.” comments Bruno Crémel, a general partner at Partech, in a statement. “When we met the team at StuDocu, we were wildly impressed with their data-driven culture and by how much students really love using their services. We look forward to working closely with Marnix and his team as they accelerate StuDocu’s global expansion and develop even more innovative ways to support students in meeting their learning goals.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse finally has an Android app that you can download from the Play Store &#8212; provided you live in the U.S.</p>
<p>The voice-based social network launched its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clubhouse.app">beta Android app</a> on Play Store for users in the U.S. on Sunday, and said it will gradually make the new app available in other English-speaking countries and then the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The social network, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">valued at about $4 billion</a> in its most recent fundraise, launched as an iPhone-only app last year. The app quickly gained popularity last year, attracting several high-profile celebrities, politicians, investors, and entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/clubhouse-says-its-android-launch-will-take-a-couple-of-months/">developing the Android app</a> early this year and started to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">test the beta version</a> externally this month. In a town hall earlier Sunday, the startup said availability on Android has been the most requested product feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our plan over the next few weeks is to collect feedback from the community, fix any issues we see and work to add a few final features like payments and club creation before rolling it out more broadly,&#8221; the team <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/welcome-android-users">wrote</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149613" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149613" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2149613 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="359" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg 2662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=1536,538 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=2048,717 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/clubhouse-android-appmagic.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149613" class="wp-caption-text">Clubhouse download figures across some of its popular markets, according to estimates by mobile insight firm AppMagic. (Though Clubhouse&#8217;s precise download figures from other mobile insight firms vary, they all agree that Clubhouse app&#8217;s popularity has dropped in recent months.)</p></div></p>
<p>As Clubhouse struggles to maintain its growth &#8212; data from mobile insight firms including <a href="http://appmagic.rocks">AppMagic</a> suggests that Clubhouse installs have drastically dropped in recent months &#8212; the Android app could prove pivotal in boosting the startup&#8217;s reach across the globe.</p>
<p>Clubhouse could potentially &#8212; on paper &#8212; also supercharge its growth by allowing any user to join the service without an invitation. But the startup said retaining the waitlist and invite system is part of its effort to &#8220;keep the growth measured.&#8221; (Clubhouse has faced several moderation challenges in recent months.)</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s launch on Android comes at a time when scores of technology giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/spotify-is-getting-into-live-audio-because-of-course-it-is/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, and Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, have either launched their similar offerings &#8212; or announced plans to do so.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s clone of Clubhouse, called Spaces, has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to the A16z and Tiger Global-backed-startup. An unplanned Twitter Spaces, available on Android as well, hosted by a high-profile Indian startup founder on earlier Sunday attracted hundreds of listeners within a few minutes, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we head into the summer and continue to scale out the backend, we plan to begin opening up even further, welcoming millions more people in from the iOS waitlist, expanding language support, and adding more accessibility features, so that people worldwide can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them,&#8221; Clubhouse team wrote.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s beta Android app currently lacks a number of features such as the ability to follow a topic, in-app translations, localization, ability to create or manage a club, link Twitter and Instagram profiles, payments, as well as the ability to change the profile name or user name.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Android, we believe that Clubhouse will feel more complete,&#8221; read the blog post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disasters may not always be man-made, but they are always responded to by humans. There’s a whole panoply of skills and professions required today to respond to even the tiniest emergency, and that doesn’t even include the needs during pre-disaster planning and post-disaster recovery. It’s not a very remunerative industry for most and the mental health effects from stress can linger for decades, but the mission at the core of this work — to help people in the time of their greatest need — is what continues to attract many to partake in this never-ending battle anyway.</p>
<p>In the last three parts of this series on the future of technology and disaster response, I’ve focused on, well, technology, and specifically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">the sales cycle for new products</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/can-speculative-fiction-teach-us-anything-in-a-world-this-crazy/">the sudden data deluge now that Internet of Things (IoT) is in full force</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/">the connectivity that allows that data to radiate all around</a>. What we haven’t looked at enough so far is the human element: the people who actually respond to disasters as well as what challenges they face and how technology can help them.</p>
<p>So in this fourth and final part of the series, we’ll look at four areas where humans and technology intersect within disaster response and what future opportunities lie in this market: training and development, mental health, crowdsourced responses to disasters, and our doomsday future of hyper-complex emergencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2 id="Training in a hellfire">Training in a hellfire</h2>
<p>Most fields have linear approaches to training. To become a software engineer, students learn some computer science theory, add in some programming practice, and voilà (note: your mileage may vary). To become a medical doctor, aspiring physicians take an undergraduate curriculum teeming with biology and chemistry, head to medical school for two deadened years of core anatomy and other classes and then switch into clinical rotations, a residency, and maybe fellowships.</p>
<p>But how do you train someone to respond to emergencies?</p>
<p>From 911 call takers to EMTs and paramedics to emergency planning officials and the on-the-ground responders who are operating in the center of the storm as it were, there are large permutations in the skills required to do these jobs well. What’s necessary aren’t just specific hard skills like using call dispatch software or knowing how to upload video from a disaster site, but also critically-important softer skills as well: precisely communicating, having sangfroid, increasing agility, and balancing improvisation with consistency. The chaos element also can’t be overstated: every disaster is different, and these skills must be viscerally recombined and exercised under extreme pressure with frequently sparse information.</p>
<p>A whole range of what might be dubbed “edtech” products could serve these needs, and not just exclusively for emergency management.</p>
<p>Communications, for instance, isn’t just about team communications, but also communicating with many different constituencies. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a>, said that “a lot of these skills are social skills — being able to work with different groups of people in culturally and socially appropriate ways.” He notes that the field of emergency management has heightened attention to these issues in recent years, and “the skillset we need is to work with those community structures” that already exist where a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in the tech industry the last few years, cross-cultural communication skills remain scarce. One can always learn this just through repeated experiences, but could we train people to develop empathy and understanding through software? Can we develop better and richer scenarios to train emergency responders — and all of us, really — on how to communicate effectively in widely diverging conditions? That’s a huge opportunity for a startup to tackle.</p>
<p>Emergency management is now a well-developed career path. “The history of the field is very fascinating, [it’s] been increasingly professionalized, with all these certifications,” Clark-Ginsberg said. That professionalization “standardizes emergency response so that you know what you are getting since they have all these certs, and you know what they know and what they don’t.” Certifications can indicate singular competence, but perhaps not holistic assessment, and it’s a market that offers opportunities for new startups to create better assessments.</p>
<p>Like many of us, responders get used to doing the same thing over and over again, and that can make training for new skills even more challenging. Michael Martin of emergency data management platform <a href="https://rapidsos.com">RapidSOS</a> describes how 911 call takers get used to muscle memory, “so switching to a new system is very high-risk.” No matter how bad existing software interfaces are, changing them will very likely slow every single response down while increasing the risk of errors. That’s why the company offers “25,000 hours a year for training, support, integration.” There remains a huge and relatively fragmented market for training staff as well as transitioning them from one software stack to another.</p>
<p>Outside these somewhat narrow niches, there is a need for a massive renaissance in training in this whole area. My colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">Natasha Mascarenhas recently wrote an EC-1 on Duolingo</a>, an app designed to gamify and entrance students interested in learning second languages. It’s a compelling product, and there is no comparative training system for engaging the full gamut of first responders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Duolingo EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/embed/#?secret=UPcJTBYjoT" data-secret="UPcJTBYjoT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Art delaCruz, COO and president of <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org">Team Rubicon</a>, a non-profit which assembles teams of volunteer military veterans to respond to natural disasters, said that it’s an issue his organization is spending more time thinking about. “Part of resilience is education, and the ability to access information, and that is a gap that we continue to close on,” he said. “How do you present information that’s more simple than [a learning management system]?” He described the need for “knowledge bombs like flash cards” to regularly provide responders with new knowledge while testing existing ideas.</p>
<p>There’s also a need to scale up best practices rapidly across the world. Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at <a href="https://www.projecthope.org">Project Hope</a>, a non-profit which empowers local healthcare workers in disaster-stricken and impoverished areas, said that in the context of COVID-19, “a lot of what was going to be needed [early on] was training — there were huge information gaps at the clinical level, how to communicate it at a community level.” The organization <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/news/explore/2020/projecthopeCHRHS">developed a curriculum with Brown University’s Watson Institute</a> in the form of interactive PowerPoints that were ultimately used to train 100,000 healthcare workers on the new virus, according to Cotter.</p>
<p>When I look at the spectrum of edtech products existing today, one of the key peculiarities is just how narrow each seems to focus. There are apps for language learning and for learning math and developing literacy. There are flash card apps like <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> that are popular among medical students, and more interactive approaches like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/labster-gets-millions-from-a16z-to-bring-virtual-science-lab-software-to-the-world/">Labster for science experiments</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/sketchy-medical-series-a-tcg-reach-capital/">Sketchy for learning anatomy</a>.</p>
<p>Yet, for all the talk of boot camps in Silicon Valley, there is no edtech company that tries to completely transform a student in the way that a bona fide boot camp does. No startup wants to holistically develop their students, adding in hard skills while also advancing the ability to handle stress, the improvisation needed to confront rapidly-changing environments, and the skills needed to communicate with empathy.</p>
<p>Maybe that can’t be done with software. Maybe. Or perhaps, no founder has just had the ambition so far to go for broke — to really revolutionize how we think about training the next generation of emergency management professionals and everyone else in private industry who needs to handle stress or think on their feet just as much as frontline workers.</p>
<p>That’s the direction where Bryce Stirton, president and co-founder of public-safety company <a href="https://www.respondercorp.com">Responder Corp</a>, has been thinking about. “Another area I am personally a fan of is the training space around VR,” he said. “It’s very difficult to synthesize these stressful environments,” in areas like firefighting, but new technologies have “the ability to pump the heart that you need to experience in training.” He concludes that “the VR world, it can have a large impact.”</p>
<h2 id="Healing after disaster">Healing after disaster</h2>
<p>When it comes to trauma, few fields face quite the challenge as emergency response. It’s work that almost by definition forces its personnel to confront some of the most harrowing scenes imaginable. Death and destruction are given, but what’s not always accounted for is the lack of agency in some of these contexts for first responders — the family that can’t be saved in time so a 911 call taker has to offer final solace, or the paramedics who don’t have the right equipment even as they are showing up on site.</p>
<p>Post-traumatic stress is perhaps the most well-known and common mental health condition facing first responders, although it is hardly the only one. How to ameliorate and potentially even cure these conditions represents a burgeoning area of investment and growth for a number of startups and investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riskandreturn.com">Risk &amp; Return</a>, for instance, is a venture firm heavily focused on companies working on mental health as well as human performance more generally. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/">In my profile of the firm a few weeks ago</a>, managing director Jeff Eggers said that “We love that type of technology since it has that dual purpose: going to serve the first responder on the ground, but the community is also going to benefit.”</p>

<p>Two examples of companies from its portfolio are useful here to explore as examples of different pathways in this category. The first is <a href="https://www.altoneuroscience.com">Alto Neuroscience</a>, which is a stealthy startup founded by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/amit-etkin">Amit Etkin</a>, a multidisciplinary neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Stanford, to create new clinical treatments to post-traumatic stress and other conditions based on brainwave data. Given its therapeutic focus, it’s probably years before testing and regulatory approvals come through, but this sort of research is on the cutting-edge of innovation here.</p>
<p>The second company is <a href="https://www.neuroflow.com/">NeuroFlow</a>, which is a software startup using apps to guide patients to better mental health outcomes. Through persistent polling, testing, and collaboration with practitioners, the company’s tools allow for more active monitoring of mental health — looking for emerging symptoms or relapses in even the most complicated cases. NeuroFlow is more on the clinical side, but there are obviously a wealth of wellness startups that have percolated in recent years as well like <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.calm.com">Calm</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of therapeutics and software though, there are entirely new frontiers around mental health in areas like psychedelics. That was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/5-startup-theses-that-will-transform-the-2020s/">one of the trends I called out as a top five area for investment in the 2020s</a> earlier this year, and I stand by that. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/osmind-pitches-clinical-management-and-data-analysis-for-mental-health-practices-using-psychedelics/">We’ve also covered</a> a startup called <a href="https://osmind.org/">Osmind</a> which is a clinical platform for managing patients with a psychedelic focus.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Risk &amp; Return itself hasn’t made an investment in psychedelics yet, but Bob Kerrey, the firm’s board chairman and the former co-chair of the 9/11 Commission as well as former governor and senator of Nebraska, said that “it’s difficult to do this if you are the government, but easier to do this in the private sector.”</p>
<p>Similar to edtech, mental health startups might get their start in the first responder community, but they are hardly limited to this population. Post-traumatic stress and other mental health conditions affect wide swaths of the world’s population, and solutions that work in one community can often translate more broadly to others. It’s a massive, massive market, and one that could potentially transform the lives of millions of people for the better.</p>
<p>Before moving on, there’s one other area of interest here, and that is creating impactful communities for healing. First responders and military veterans experience a mission and camaraderie in their service that they often lack once they are in new jobs or on convalescence. DelaCruz of Team Rubicon says that one of the goals of bringing veterans to help in disaster regions is that the veterans themselves “reconnect with identity and community — we have these incredible assets in these men and women who have served.” It’s not enough to just find a single treatment per patient — we oftentimes need to zoom out to the wider population to see how mental health ripples out.</p>
<p>Helping people find purpose may not be the easiest challenge to solve as a startup, but it’s certainly a major challenge for many, and an area fermenting with new approaches now that the the social networking wave has reached its nadir.</p>
<h2 id="Crowdsourcing disaster response">Crowdsourcing disaster response</h2>
<p>Decentralization has been all the rage in tech in recent years — just mention the word blockchain in a TechCrunch article to get at least 50 PR emails about the latest NFT for a toilet stain. While there is obviously a lot of noise, one area where substance may pan out well is in disaster response.</p>
<p>If the COVID-19 pandemic showed anything, it was the power of the internet to aggregate as well as verify data, build dashboards, and deliver highly-effective visualizations of complex information for professionals and laypeople alike. Those products were developed by people all around the world often from the comfort of their own homes, and they demonstrate how crowds can quickly draft serious labor to help respond to crises as they crop up.</p>
<p>Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, said that “COVID has really blown so much of what we think about out of the water.” With so many ways to collaborate online right now, “that’s what I would say is very exciting … and also practical and empowering.”</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsberg of RAND calls it the “next frontier of disaster management.” He argues that “if you can use technology to broaden the number of people who can participate in disaster management and respond to disasters,” then we might be reaching an entirely new paradigm for what effective disaster response will look like. “Formal structures [for professional frontline workers] have strengthened and that has saved lives and resources, but our ability to engage with everyday responders is still something to work on.”</p>
<p>Many of the tools that underpin these crowdsourced efforts don’t even focus on disasters. Sury pointed to <a href="https://www.tableau.com">Tableau</a> and data visualization platform <a href="https://flourish.studio">Flourish</a> as examples of the kinds of tools that remote, lay first responders are using. There are now quite robust tools for tabular data, but we’re still relatively early in the development of tools for handling mapping data — obviously critical in the crisis context. <a href="https://www.unfolded.ai/">Unfolded.ai</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai/">I profiled earlier this year</a>, is working on building scalable geospatial analytics in the browser. A lot more can be done here.</p>

<p>Oftentimes there are ways to coordinate the coordinators. <a href="https://www.developforgood.org">Develop for Good</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/develop-for-good-student-volunteers/">I looked at late last year</a>, is a non-profit designed to connect enterprising computer science students to software and data projects at non-profits and agencies that needed help during the pandemic. Sometimes these coordinators are non-profit orgs, and sometimes, just very active Twitter accounts. There’s a lot more experimentation possible on how to coordinate efforts in a decentralized way while still engaging with professional first responders and the public sector.</p>
<p>Speaking of decentralization, it’s even possible that blockchain could play a role in disaster and crisis response. Many of these opportunities rest on using blockchain for evidence collection or for identity. For example, earlier this week Leigh Cuen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/radical-ethereum-entrepreneurs-are-redefining-what-rape-kit-means/">took a careful look at an at-home sexual assault evidence collection kit</a> from <a href="https://www.leda.co">Leda Health</a> that uses the blockchain to establish a clear time for when a sample was collected.</p>

<p>There is a lot more potential to harness the power of crowdsourcing and decentralization, and many of these projects have applications far outside disaster management itself. These tools not only solve real problems — they provide real community to people who may not be related to the disaster itself, but are enthusiastic to do their part to help others.</p>
<h2 id="The black swans of black swans">The black swans of black swans</h2>
<p>In terms of startups, the three markets I identified — better training, better mental health, and better crowdsourcing collaboration tools, particularly around data — collectively represent a very compelling set of markets that will not only be valuable for founders, but can rapidly improve lives.</p>
<p>In his book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6596.html">Normal Accidents</a>, Charles Perrow talks about how an increasing level of complexity and coupledness in our modern technical systems all but guarantee disasters to occur. Add in a warming world as well as the intensity, frequency, and just plain unusualness of disasters arriving each year, and we are increasingly seeing entirely novel forms of emergencies we have never responded to before. Take most recently the ultra-frigid conditions in Texas that sapped power from its grid, leading to statewide blackouts for hours and days in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsberg said, “We are seeing these risks emerge that aren’t just typical wildfires — where we have a response structure that we can easily setup and manage the hazard, [we’re] very good at managing these typical disasters. There are more of these atypical disasters cropping up, and we have a very hard time setting up structures for this — the pandemic is a great example of that.”</p>
<p>He describes these challenges as “trans-boundary risk management,” disasters that cross bureaucratic lines, professions, societies, and means of action. “It takes a certain agility and the ability to move quickly and the ability to work in ways outside typical bureaucratic structures, and that is just challenging full stop,” he said.</p>

<p>Even as we begin to have better point solutions to the individual problems that disasters and their responses require, we can’t be remiss in neglecting the more systematic challenges that these emergencies are bringing to the fore. We have to start thinking about bringing humans together faster and in more novel ways to be the most effective, while coupling them flexibly and with agility to the best tools that meet their needs in the moment. That’s probably not literally “a startup,” but more a way of thinking about what it means to construct a disaster response fresh given the information available.</p>
<p>Amanda Levin, a policy analyst at the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>, said that “even if we mitigate, there are huge pressures and huge impacts today from a warming world … even if we stop emissions today, [they] will still persist.” As one of my interviewees in government service who asked to go unnamed noted about disaster response, “You always are coming up short somewhere.” The problems are only getting harder, and we humans need much better tools to match the man-made trials we created for ourselves. That’s the challenge — and opportunity — for a tough century ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has launched another 60 Starlink satellites — making 180 delivered to orbit in under two weeks — but the launch early Sunday morning was more notable because it set a new, key record for Falcon 9 rocket reusability. This marked the 10th flight of the first-stage rocket booster used for the launch, which sets a record for re-use for SpaceX as the rocket booster with the most successful mission under its belt.</p>
<p>The launch took place at 2:42 AM EDT, flying from Cape Canaveral in Florida. SpaceX also successfully returned the booster to its drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean for a tenth successful landing for the rocket, too, making it a record-setter in that regard as well, and setting up the possibility that it could fly yet again. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said it could be &#8220;possible&#8221; for a Falcon 9 booster to fly &#8220;100+&#8221; times with servicing and component replacement.</p>
<p>This Falcon 9 has previously flown on missions including the original uncrewed demonstration mission of Crew Dragon, SpaceX&#8217;s astronaut spacecraft, and seven prior Starlink launches. SpaceX has shown just how reusable its rockets are with its aggressive Starlink launch schedule, most of which have employed rocket boosters that have flown a number of missions before, including other launches for the broadband internet megaconstellation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since SpaceX is both launch provider and customer on Starlink, it&#8217;s actually crucial for the company to realize as many cost savings as possible during its frequent flights building the network of low Earth orbit satellites. Re-use of the boosters is a key ingredient, and one where the cost savings definitely accrue over time. Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1295883862380294144">previously said</a> that the economics are such that for its external customer flights, it&#8217;s at about &#8220;even&#8221; on the second use of a booster, and &#8220;ahead&#8221; in terms of costs by the third. During its Starlink launch program, SpaceX has repeatedly set and broken its own reusability records, indicating a key means of keeping the costs of building out its in-space satellite infrastructure is using flight-proven boosters as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is the 27th Starlink launch thus far, and SpaceX has another planned just six days from now on May 15, with at least one more likely in the works for later this month after that. The company hopes to have its broadband network built out to the point where it has global reach by the end of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the heart of Duolingo is its mission: to scale free education and increase income potential through language learning. However, the same mission that has helped it grow to a business valued at $2.4 billion with over 500 million registered learners, has led to tensions that continue to define the business.</p>
<p>How do you survive as a startup if you don’t want to charge users? How do you design a startup that isn’t too hard to lose people, but isn’t too easy to compromise education? How do you balance monetization goals while also keeping education as a product free?</p>
<p>For my first EC-1, I spent months with Duolingo executives, investors, and of course, competitors, to answer some of these questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">How a bot-fighting test turned into edtech’s most iconic brand, Duolingo </a>(3,300 words/13 minutes)</li>

</ul>
<p>One of my favorite details in the story that got left on the cutting room floor was Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn comparing his company to the elliptical. I was pressing him on the efficacy of Duolingo, and the long-standing critique that it still can&#8217;t teach a user how to speak a language fluently.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now, there&#8217;s a difference between whether you know you’re doing the elliptical or yoga or running, but by far, the most important thing is that you’re doing something [other than] just walking around,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>What von Ahn is getting at is that Duolingo’s biggest value proposition is that it helps people get motivated to learn a language, even if it’s just five minutes — or an elliptical workout — a day. He thinks motivation is harder than the learning itself. Do you agree?</p>

<h2>There’s always a Tesla angle</h2>
<p>When I was working in Boston, the newsroom saying was &#8220;there’s always a Boston Angle.” In a remote, tech-dominated world, I’ll tweak it: There’s always a Tesla angle. While we all prepare for Elon Musk to grace the SNL stage, there’s a story you might want to check out.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/tesla-taps-tiny-startups-tech-to-build-cheaper-cleaner-batteries/">Tesla tapped a small Canadian startup</a> to build cleaner and cheaper batteries. The price tag will shock you, but the story tells a bigger narrative about patented technology, and the outsized impact that a tiny startup has on Tesla’s route to batteries.</p>

<h2>The clash of the CFOs</h2>
<p>While Equity usually keeps it light and punny, we chewed into a deeper topic this week: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/the-morality-and-efficacy-of-going-public-earlier/?+Exits%29">the morality of going public. </a>Startups are staying private longer than ever before, but one CFO argues that it’s a moral obligation to leave the nest and provide returns to the general public. We had that CFO on the show, along with another CFO at a company pursuing a SPAC. It ended up being the most interesting clash of the CFOs I’ve been a part of.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The growth of venture capital as an asset class has a role to play in this whole mess and has kept the nest warm for many startups. We talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/the-morality-and-efficacy-of-going-public-earlier/?+Exits%29">if the tides are turning</a>, or we’re saying goodbye to a world in which a company like Salesforce would debut price <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108800363785245318">for $11 per share. </a></p>

<h2>Where telehealth goes from here</h2>
<p>As I start to cover digital health, one of the biggest questions I ask and get asked is where telehealth goes from here. Virtual caretaking had an uptick in usage because of the pandemic but is now starting to slow as the world reopens and vaccinations are on the rise. For telehealth startups, it means crafting a pitch that explains why virtual care makes sense for the conditions you serve.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>I talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/expressable-seed/">how to become pandemic-proof in healthcare</a> with Expressable, a virtual speech therapy startup that just raised millions in venture capital money. Part of the startups’ product differentiation is an edtech platform that motivates consumers to asynchronous practice speech exercises with the help of parents and friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On this week&#8217;s Found podcast, we sat down with <a href="https://dandelionenergy.com">Dandelion</a> co-founder and President Kathy Hannun. Kathy came up with the idea for Dandelion while working at Google X, tackling some of the world&#8217;s most intractable problems, and making them tractable through the application of technology. Kathy realized that harnessing geothermal energy was a way to make an entirely new category of sustainable energy accessible at scale to markets where it makes the most sense over other green energy options.</p>
<p>Kathy told us all about how she ended up with her dream job at X, and then decided to make the leap from that to building her own company from the ground up to address a solution she saw an obvious need for. She also explains how despite dealing with some natural imposter syndrome finding herself at Google&#8217;s moonshot division solving problems with some of the smartest people in the world, but also how her natural inclination is to believe that she can solve any challenge she&#8217;s faced through, through a combination of dedication and learning.</p>
<p>We also heard from Kathy about making the difficult decision to change a fundamental element of how Dandelion&#8217;s business works, fairly late in the game, after realizing that the existing strategy wasn&#8217;t working. Her tough call literally came while she was scaling a mountain — it&#8217;s hard to get more allegorical than that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
