		Currently senior principal at <a href="https://6sense.com/">6sense</a>, Kerry Cunningham is a thought leader in B2B marketing and is a former SiriusDecisions and Forrester analyst.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A few years back, my former colleagues and I at SiriusDecisions introduced what we called the Intent Data Framework (IDF). About a year ago, we updated the model to include non-behavioral signals and called it the Buyer Signals Framework (BSF).</p>
<p>Already, it’s clear we left something out of the IDF and even BSF: product-led growth.</p>
<h2>Signal substitution syndrome</h2>
<p>Both versions of the framework were attempts to address a misunderstanding that was, and still is, so rampant in B2B that I have a name for it — signal substitution syndrome. The nature of this syndrome is simple: In B2B, both marketing and sales practitioners tend to see each new source of information about their potential buyers — each signal type — as a substitute for the last one that didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If people are using the product, the need is not prospective or theoretical, it is actual.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The history of B2B could be written in the successive failure of these signals to be what we all hoped for. Whether it was people showing up at trade show booths, people filling out bingo cards from the back of magazines, the people and bots filling out website forms, webinar registrations, syndicated content leads, third-party intent signals, review site users, etc.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding that underwrites signal substitution syndrome is that any of these signals should be considered as sufficient — or even halfway decent — signals of buyer intent unto themselves. To be sure, by happenstance, some leads have occasionally turned into business in a way that can be seen and understood.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>But if there’s one thing that my time as an analyst taught me, it’s that leads are a depressingly high failure rate (95%-99%) signal. Intent data by itself is worse. However, they are both better than whatever we had before. In fact, none of these signals are, by themselves, actually expressions of intent. Expressions of interest? Sure. Intent, not so fast.</p>
<h2>How product-led growth fits in</h2>
<p>Along comes product-led growth (PLG) with the idea that we’ll offer a free or very low-cost version of our solutions and use adoption of them as the new signals that will lead to enterprise deal generation. Of course, not every product is amenable to a PLG motion. It’s pretty hard to imagine Oracle PLG-ing their manufacturing cloud, for example.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition company Clearview AI is facing a potential fine in the UK.</p>
<p>It has also been handed a provisional notice to stop further processing of UK citizens&#8217; data and to delete any data it already holds as a result of what the Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office (ICO) described as &#8220;alleged serious breaches&#8221; of national data protection law.</p>
<p>The ICO has been looking into the tech company &#8212; which sells AI-powered identity matching to law enforcement and other paying customers via a facial recognition platform that it trained covertly on photos harvested from Internet sources (like social media platforms) &#8212; in a joint investigation with the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The OAIC already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">earlier this month</a>, issued an order to Clearview to delete data after finding it broke national laws down under. So the ICO has been the laggard of the two regulators.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/ico-issues-provisional-view-to-fine-clearview-ai-inc-over-17-million/">today</a> it issued the notification of a provisional intention to fine Clearview over £17 million (~$22.6M) &#8212; citing a range of suspected breaches.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI told it broke Australia&#8217;s privacy law, ordered to delete data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/embed/#?secret=CgfrQ06TgA" data-secret="CgfrQ06TgA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the raft of violations the ICO suspects &#8212; following what it describes as &#8220;preliminary enquiries with Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; are failures to process people&#8217;s information fairly or in a way they expect, in line with requirements to have a valid legal basis for processing personal data and to provide adequate information to those whose data is processed; along with a failure to have a process in place to prevent data being retained indefinitely; a failure to meet higher standards required for processing biometric data &#8212; which is considered special category data under the European standard (the GDPR) that&#8217;s transposed into UK law; and also for applying problematic processes when people object to its processing of their information &#8212; such as asking for more personal data (&#8220;including photographs&#8221;) in response to such objections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the ICO&#8217;s provisional findings.</p>
<p>A spokesperson sent this statement (below), attributed to its London based attorney, Kelly Hagedorn &#8212; who describes the ICO&#8217;s provisional finding as &#8220;factually and legally incorrect&#8221;; says Clearview is considering an appeal and &#8220;further action&#8221;; and claims the company does not do business in the UK (nor have any UK customers currently).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Clearview&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;The UK ICO Commissioner&#8217;s assertions are factually and legally incorrect. The company is considering an appeal and further action. Clearview AI provides publicly available information from the internet to law enforcement agencies. To be clear, Clearview AI does not do business in the UK, and does not have any UK customers at this time.&#8221;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">Whether the ICO&#8217;s preliminary sanction will go the distance and turn into an actual fine and data processing cessation order against Clearview remains to be seen.</div>
<p>For one thing, the ICO&#8217;s notification is timed a few weeks ahead of the departure of sitting commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is set to be replaced by New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a> in January.</p>
<p>So a new broom will be in charge of deciding whether the provisional findings hold up in the face of Clearview&#8217;s objections (and potential legal action).</p>
<p>In its statement today, the ICO is careful to note that Clearview will have the opportunity to make representations &#8212; which it says it will consider before any final decision is reached, and which it furthermore suggests may not happen until mid-2022.</p>
<p>Under Denham, it&#8217;s also notable that the ICO has substantially shrunk a number of provisional penalties it handed out in relation to other breach investigations (such as those to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/uks-ico-downgrades-british-airways-data-breach-fine-to-20m-after-originally-setting-it-at-184m/">British Airways</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/uk-watchdog-reduces-marriott-data-breach-fine-to-23-8m-down-from-123m/">Marriott</a>).</p>
<p>The ICO also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/facebook-agrees-to-pay-uk-data-watchdogs-cambridge-analytica-fine-but-settles-without-admitting-liability/">settled with Facebook</a> over the Cambridge Analytica scandal after the tech giant appealed its provisional sanction.</p>
<p>And while Facebook agreed to pay the ICO&#8217;s £500k fine in full in that case it did so without admitting any liability and also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/facebooks-secret-settlement-on-cambridge-analytica-gags-uk-data-watchdog/">got the ICO to agree to sign a non-disclosure agreement over the arrangement</a> (which has limited what the commissioner can say in public about its correspondence with Facebook). So, in all, that ended up looking like a sweet deal for Facebook &#8212; agreed to by a regulator apparently concerned at being challenged in the courts over its decision-making processes.</p>
<p>There is fresh complexity on the horizon around enforcement of the UK&#8217;s data protection regime too, now &#8212; in that the government is in the process of consulting on making changes to national law that could see ministers reduce protections wrapping people&#8217;s data &#8212; such as by removing or altering requirements around transparency, fairness and what constitutes a valid legal basis for processing people&#8217;s data &#8212; as part of a claimed &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">simplification</a>&#8216; of the current laws.</p>
<p>So the ICO&#8217;s caveat on its provisional &#8220;view to fine&#8221; Clearview &#8212; which it specifies may be &#8220;subject to change or no further formal action&#8221; &#8212; looks like more than just a reminder to recall its own recent history of enforcements not standing up to its earlier convictions.</p>
<p>Why is it acting at all now if there&#8217;s a risk of ministers moving the goalposts? Denham may have an eye on amplifying her legacy as she departs for pastures new. Or she may hope to try and bind the hands of her successor &#8212; and limit the reformist zeal of DCMS to downgrade UK data protection &#8212; or, indeed, a little of all of the above.</p>
<p>In a statement, the outgoing commissioner said: “I have significant concerns that personal data was processed in a way that nobody in the UK will have expected. It is therefore only right that the ICO alerts people to the scale of this potential breach and the proposed action we’re taking. UK data protection legislation does not stop the effective use of technology to fight crime but to enjoy public trust and confidence in their products technology providers must ensure people’s legal protections are respected and complied with.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK. However, the evidence we’ve gathered and analysed suggests Clearview AI Inc were and may be continuing to process significant volumes of UK people’s information without their knowledge. We therefore want to assure the UK public that we are considering these alleged breaches and taking them very seriously,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>On the investigation findings itself, the regulator&#8217;s press release on its provisional view and potential fine offers only tentative conclusions, with the ICO writing that: &#8220;The images in Clearview AI Inc’s database are likely to include the data of a substantial number of people from the UK and may have been gathered without people’s knowledge from publicly available information online, including social media platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that it &#8220;understands that the service provided by Clearview AI Inc was used on a free trial basis by a number of UK law enforcement agencies&#8221;, and further specifying that this trial &#8220;was discontinued and Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK&#8221; &#8212; without offering any details on when the tech was being used and when usage stopped.</p>
<p>Clearview has faced regulatory pushback elsewhere around the world too.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this year</a> Canada&#8217;s privacy watchdog concluded its own investigation of the AI firm &#8212; finding multiple breaches of national law and also ordering it to cease processing citizens&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Clearview rejected the findings &#8212; but also said it no longer offered the service to Canadian law enforcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To kick of <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">re:Invent</a>, AWS&#8217;s flagship conference, the cloud computing giant today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/preview-aws-iot-roborunner-for-building-robot-fleet-management-applications/">announced</a> IoT <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/roborunner/">RoboRunner</a>, a new service for building applications that help large fleets of robots work together. This new service aims to provide the infrastructure necessary to build the work and fleet management applications necessary to run the kind of robot fleets that Amazon itself utilizes in its warehouses, for example.</p>
<p>The company also today announced a new robotics accelerator program.</p>
<p>At its core, RoboRunner helps developers build applications that integrate with robots from different manufacturers and manage the lifecycle of these applications. Currently, AWS argues, it&#8217;s too difficult to integrate robots from different vendors into a single system, leaving enterprises with a number of silos where they manage their robots, which in turn makes it hard to build applications where these heterogeneous fleets cooperate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In addition to RoboRunner, AWS also <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2021/11/announcing-the-aws-robotics-startup-accelerator.html">announced</a> a new robotics startup accelerator, the AWS Robotics Startup Accelerator, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.massrobotics.org/project/awsroboticsaccelerator/">MassRobotics</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, there are only a few successful commercial robotics companies, and there are a few big reasons for this,&#8221; AWS CTO Werner Vogels writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;First, finding a fit in the robotics product market is difficult because real-world environments are dynamic and unpredictable, so pairing the right niche with the right capabilities can be a challenge. Second, building robots with a high degree of autonomy and intelligence requires multidisciplinary skills that are hard to find and recruit for. Third, robotics is capital intensive and requires large up-front investment in sensors, actuators, and mechanical hardware even when they’re already commercially available.&#8221;</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he new program is open to early-stage startups (less than $10 million in revenue and $100 million raised. The selected companies will get access to specialized training and mentorship from robotics experts and up to $10,000 in AWS credits.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Remember Easy Bake Ovens? You&#8217;d mix up some colored powder and water until a dough or batter formed, put it in a mold, pop it in the oven, and before you knew it &#8212; <em>ding!</em> A disgusting treat. Foundry Lab, a New-Zealand based startup with backing from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Peter Beck, has figured out how to do something similar, except instead of chemicals and an &#8220;oven,&#8221; it&#8217;s metals and a microwave.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which emerged from stealth on Monday with an $8 million Series A raise, is using &#8220;literally a microwave, but on steroids&#8221; to cast metal parts much quicker than metal 3D printing, according to David Moodie, founder and CEO of Foundry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It&#8217;s super easy for the user; they literally take the mold, throw in the cold metal powder or metal ingots, put it in the microwave, press the button and walk away,&#8221; Moodie told TechCrunch. &#8220;It even dings when it&#8217;s done. As easy as heating up a microwave dinner.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239928" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">(Foundry&#8217;s microwave has also been used to cook a typical New Zealand meat pie. It took only a few seconds and didn&#8217;t taste fantastic, according to Moodie.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Typical casting systems like investment casting, 3D printing and die-casting take anywhere from one to six weeks to produce. Foundry says it has been able to turn around brake shoes for cars in under eight hours using molds that had been 3D printed using computer-aided design (CAD) molds and a giant microwave. The startup is currently working with zinc and aluminum, but has done some successful stainless steel trials and wants to move onto other metals like copper and brass in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Foundry&#8217;s tech has future applications in manufacturing industries where metal 3D printing can&#8217;t reach, the near-term goal is to help car manufacturing R&amp;D teams develop production-identical, functional metal parts that can be used for testing and prototyping before committing to mass production.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One of the companies we&#8217;re talking to is making up to 600 prototype cars before one reaches the market, so they&#8217;ll keep changing and keep iterating on it, and that can get expensive really quickly,&#8221; Moodie said, adding that tooling costs could be upwards of $50,000 to $100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Moodie says before starting Foundry, he ran an industrial design consultancy business, designing products for mass manufacture. He felt frustrated that authorities would consistently reject patent applications because they were made with parts produced by 3D printers or CNC machines, and therefore, potentially made with the wrong physical structures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;So I did the Kiwi thing and went to the shed and lucked my way into a system that worked,&#8221; he said, noting that much of his experimenting was done using standard microwaves during New Zealand&#8217;s latest lockdown, during which time Moodie couldn&#8217;t get into his workshop. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to solve is actual castings, trying to simulate a die casting but doing it fast and cheaply. If you machine to a tool to do a die casting, it&#8217;s typically three to six months to get that back.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s still early days for Foundry. The company only has a couple of its very large microwaves out for trial with potential customers at the moment, but it will use the Series A funding, which came from Australian VC Blackbird, to get production-ready by the end of 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the funding will go toward hiring more staff. The company has grown quickly over the past few months, up from six staffers when it first started fundraising to 17 full-time employees now. The goal is to make it to around 35 over the coming months, a task that&#8217;s been difficult with New Zealand&#8217;s strict pandemic-related border closures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The whole border close thing is starting to hit us now,&#8221; said Moodie. &#8220;The country&#8217;s got two microwave experts, and they both have jobs. That&#8217;s been particularly difficult. So we&#8217;re trying to get someone to come across and help us.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">New Zealand is beginning to open up internally, with Auckland coming out of lockdown this week and the city borders opening up to the rest of the country in mid-December. Unless the new omicron variant holds things up, the country is expected to start inviting vaccinated travelers back starting April 30, 2022, giving Foundry and other New Zealand startups the chance to hire talent from abroad.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though Foundry is working out of New Zealand, it&#8217;s targeting markets in the United States and Europe. The company&#8217;s long game is to continue to work on the microwaves and get them to a point where they can produce the quantities needed for mass production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YallaMarket, a Dubai-based quick-commerce startup, is planning to expand within the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E), and to enter Saudi Arabia and Qatar next year, to tap the appetite for speedy and convenient grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The startup, which was formally launched last month, is expanding in the U.A.E cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai by setting up an additional 100 dark stores to offer 15-minute delivery services. Dark stores are order fulfillment centers for online retail outlets. These stores are inaccessible to customers but serve the important role of rapid order fulfillment. YallaMarket has two dark stores that are currently operational with plans to open two more in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The instant delivery service will use the $2.3 million it has raised in the pre-seed round to fund expansion within the U.A.E. The round was co-led by Dubai Angel Investors and <a href="https://www.wamda.com/2021/11/yallamarket-2-3-million-pre-seed-rapid-rise-quick-commerce">Wamda</a> Capital, with the participation of a number of angel investors that focus on the Middle-East and North Africa (MENA). YallaMarket is planning to launch the production of ready-to-eat meals that will be available to order via the app, in the near future too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by Dubai-based Russian entrepreneurs Leonid Dovbenko and Stanislav Seleznev, also founders of restaurant automatization services DocsinBox and Tawreed.</p>
<p>“We plan to use the majority of newly secured funding to boost our growth. The MENA region is actively developing…Our goal is to cover as much territory by on-demand fast delivery as possible,” said co-founder Dovbenko, who is also CEO of iiko Middle East, a cloud-based POS for restaurants.</p>
<p>The startup’s dark stores are located in residential areas that make it possible for delivery persons to collect orders within three minutes after purchase, and to deliver to several households on each trip. The company has its own delivery unit that uses e-scooters and bicycles. The average order of everyday goods bought through YallaMarket is $15 (55AED), with fruits, dairy and drinks leading in popularity.</p>
<p>YallaMarket makes a profit on each item it sells as it sources its inventory directly from brands or through large distributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We see that the level of development of the e-grocery in the UAE is far from Russia, where express delivery services have achieved incredible success. Over the past few years, it has become clear that the dark-store model is supposed to replace classic convenience stores,” said Dovbenko.</p>
<p>As it gains more data on user habits, YallaMarket is now investing in product development by implementing a “behavior prediction system” to customize user experiences and offers based on their preferences to reduce the time spent when making orders.</p>
<p>The concept of the instant delivery business model (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/cajoo-raises-40-million-for-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/">quick commerce</a>) grew exponentially last year as the pandemic fueled the adoption of online grocery shopping according to a Coresight Research report. The <a href="https://coresight.com/research/from-quick-commerce-to-instant-needs-exploring-business-models-in-rapid-delivery/">report</a> says that “permanent gains” are expected as consumers continue shopping online even after the pandemic.</p>
<p>Fast and reliable delivery and availability continue to be some of the most important factors when shopping online, as noted by a majority of consumers surveyed in a recent PwC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey/2021/gcis-june-2021.pdf">study</a>. The study expects online shopping to continue to gain ground as people continue to work from home, and as they adopt new habits like shopping online. The report ranked grocery spending as the category which consumers expect their spending to increase followed by takeaway food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/panasonic/">Panasonic</a> has confirmed a data breach after hackers gained access to its internal network.</p>
<p>Panasonic said in <a href="https://news.panasonic.com/global/press/data/2021/11/en211126-4/en211126-4.html">a press release dated November 26</a> that its network was “illegally accessed by a third party” on November 11 and that “some data on a file server had been accessed during the intrusion.” However, when reached, Panasonic spokesperson Dannea DeLisser confirmed that the breach began on June 22 and ended on November 3 — and that the unauthorized access was first detected on November 11.</p>
<p>The Osaka, Japan-based company provided few other details of the breach. In its press release, the company said that in addition to conducting its own investigation, it’s “currently working with a specialist third-party organization to investigate the leak and determine if the breach involved customers&#8217; personal information and/or sensitive information related to social infrastructure.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“After detecting the unauthorized access, the company immediately reported the incident to the relevant authorities and implemented security countermeasures, including steps to prevent external access to the network,&#8221; it added. “Panasonic would like to express its sincerest apologies for any concern or inconvenience resulting from this incident.”</p>
<p>News of this data breach comes less than a year after Panasonic India was hit with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack that saw hackers leak 4 gigabytes of data, including financial information and email addresses. It also comes amid a wave of cyberattacks targeting Japanese technology companies. NEC and Mitsubishi Electric both fell victim to hackers last year, and Olympus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">recently forced to suspend its European, Middle East and Africa operations</a> after being hit by BlackMatter ransomware.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing NASA to the Moon and Back</strong> — Kathy Leuders is the head of the new Space Operations Mission Directorate, responsible for activities in orbit and soon, well beyond that. How will she and NASA meet the unprecedented challenge of establishing a lasting human presence on the Moon?</p>
<p><strong>Maneuvering Towards Better In-space Propulsion</strong> — What goes up must come down, but we can delay that second part a bit with better propulsion on our satellites and spacecraft.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The second annual <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17g372ebpuaAB7cJWWACsv">Sight Tech Global</a> happens this week, on December 1-2, and this free, virtual event is incredibly packed with insights about how rapid advances in technology are fostering an accessibility revolution for people who are blind or have low vision. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aM95a8o-S9tKNUaMBC-m0">Register today</a>.</p>
<p>All the sessions have been pre-recorded, and I can tell you first-hand that the panels and fireside chats are really remarkable, whether or not tech accessibility is your area. Join our host Will Butler, VP of Be My Eyes, for two incredibly thought-provoking mornings on Dec. 1-2 starting at 8 a.m. PT. Here’s <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/agenda/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1638118879937000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1o4OGyELBtKDFCH_mPnMn4">the agenda</a> and my quick take on the 10 sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple: </strong>A top Apple researcher explains how the cascade of ML/ AI  features (image description, gesture control, scene description) fit together in a customizable accessibility “stack.”</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Alexa: </strong>Alexa’s top AI thinker discusses how Amazon is becoming a more conversational and helpful assistant that talks less and does more.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Seeing AI:</strong> The co-founder explains his vision for how to augment navigation for the blind with customizable audio AR.</li>
<li><strong>Website accessibility 2.0:</strong> There is a little-known technical reason why website accessibility is a costly undertaking. That’s about to change.</li>
<li><strong>Indoor Navigation</strong>: Four of the world’s top researchers discuss how new technologies like LiDAR are the foundation to solve this really difficult problem for blind mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Taxis</strong>: When will they go commercial and will they work well for the blind and visually impaired? A top AI researcher says not soon; Waymo begs to differ.</li>
<li><strong>Inventors</strong>: Products designed to aid blind people have a way of going mainstream. Think OCR reading machines. These tree inventors are taking their shots.</li>
<li><strong>Getting to accessible</strong>. When and how do product companies reach the finish line. Hear from Spotify and Peloton, which take that on. It’s not easy.</li>
<li><strong>Blind Kindle</strong>: Multi-line Braille displays that can also render tactile graphics are the “Holy Braille” of information appliances. APH shows off its AI-powered prototype.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: 75% of mobile users are on Android, and Google’s Lookout app is essential for the blind Android users. The Lookout team is making the most of Google’s accessibility commitment and AI resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re still hungry for more, there are seven, live breakout sessions that go into deeper detail on some of the topics on the main stage as well as new subjects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perkins Access: </strong>Using AI to remove digital barriers for math students</li>

<li><strong>W3C ARIA-AT: </strong>Screen readers, interoperability, and a new era of web accessibility</li>

					<description><![CDATA[No, the secular shift to online shopping will not reverse. But it is also seemingly reverting to slower growth rates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, e-commerce has been on a tear. Lockdowns, a move to remote work and other impacts of COVID pushed a great number of global citizens to spend more of their money online through e-commerce sites and on-demand services.</p>
<p>For companies like Shopify, the period since March 2020 has proven a bonanza. The Canadian e-commerce giant spent last March bouncing between $350 and $420 per share. Today, the company is worth $1,554.74 per share.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Other players saw their businesses scale as consumers spent more time buying online and less time in stores. Instacart&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">grocery delivery business accelerated</a>. DoorDash <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">went public on the back of a demand surge</a>. Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">usage skyrocketed</a>, sending it to the public markets on a high. The list goes on.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But while some sectors did well, and many have continued to wow investors, the investor-thrilling run that e-commerce companies, in particular, has been on for five quarters could be slowing.</p>
<h2>Black Friday and earnings warnings</h2>
<p>While I despise astroturfed holidays that revolve around shopping, they can provide useful data points. You will not be shocked that Black Friday was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">bit of a bust</a> in terms of U.S. retail foot traffic. New COVID variants will do that, frankly.</p>
<p>But it may surprise you that <em>online</em> shopping as part of the Black Friday fauxliday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time">fell</a> compared to 2020 levels. Not that the declines were severe, but seeing online spending drift to $8.9 billion this year from $9.0 billion last year made me sit up and take note.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should not have been surprised. There were warning signs.</p>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s Q3 earnings, <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shopify-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results">reported October 28, 2021</a>, were a letdown. The company&#8217;s posted revenues of $1.12 billion <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/shopify-shop-q3-earnings-miss-163804665.html">missed estimates</a>, despite posting 46% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share and gross merchandise volume <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/shopify-stock-shopify-earnings-q32021/">also missed</a> analyst guesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chegg, the NYSE listed student media learning platform is acquiring <a href="http://Busuu.com">Busuu</a>, the online language learning startup established in Europe in 2008, for approximately $436 million (€385 million) in an all-cash transaction.</p>
<p>At its exit Busuu had raised only $16.1m in total, a tiny amount even I in European terms, and testament to the sheer grit of the founders who, by the end, had built a business that had reached over 120 million learners to date across more than 160 countries. Busuu provides courses in 12 different languages to over 500,000 paying subscribers.</p>
<p>The company’s last funding round was May 27, 2020 for $2m from GP Bullhound and ultra-high net worths. Prior to that the previous investors had consisted of Harold Primat, McGraw-Hill Education, PROfounders Capital, Martin Varsavsky and Johann &#8220;Hansi&#8221; Hansmann (according to CrunchBase).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg said: “The addition of Busuu gives Chegg the unique opportunity to expand our business while also adding tremendous value to our existing users. It will allow us to drive further into international markets, as well as accelerate Busuu’s growth in the US market. Busuu’s team, who we have known for many years, are a great cultural fit. They have built an incredible learning service for the serious language learner, and we are excited to have them as part of Chegg.”</p>
<p>Chegg says it expects Busuu’s full-year 2021 revenue to be approximately $45 million with year-over-year growth of greater than 20%. The $17 billion digital language market is expected to triple in size in the next five years, said a statement by Chegg.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by Bernhard Niesner and Adrian Hilti, with offices in London, UK, and Madrid, Spain, Busuu has made a point of finessing its language-learning model and iterating every aspect of the platform, to the point where a study by ann academic at the University of Maryland, showed that users of Busuu needed only 13 hours of study in a two-month period to move up one college semester (typically 90-105 hours of instruction). The company offers free and paid subscriptions on a monthly, annual, and bi-annual basis.</p>
<p>Busuu is used by individuals but also offers corporate language training. Last year it added live language tutoring after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/language-platform-busuu-acquires-video-tutor-startup-now-plans-ipo/">acquiring</a> Verbling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bernhard Niesner, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Busuu, said: “We are proud and excited to be joining the Chegg family, a world-leading edtech company that puts students first. This partnership will give us an opportunity to leverage Chegg’s tremendous reach to fuel our expansion, particularly in the US. Our vision is to empower everyone in the world through languages, and we believe our relationship with Chegg will enable us to achieve this goal even faster.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the global corporation formed through a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, signed a binding agreement with a lithium producer as more automakers look to secure key parts of the battery supply chain. The agreement is one in a flurry of deals between automakers and suppliers as the demand for EVs rises.</p>
<p>Vulcan Energy Resources will produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide from a brine project in the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany. Generally, lithium is produced either via hard rock mining or from brine deposit extraction. While both have environmental drawbacks, Vulcan’s site will use renewable geothermal energy to power the lithium extraction process.</p>
<p>The project will also re-inject the spent brine in a closed-loop cycle, leaving no residual waste, such as production tailings. The project in Germany will use a fraction of water and land compared to other brine projects, such as those found in South America – which means a smaller carbon footprint and potentially a lower operational expenditure, the German-Australian company added on its website.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the five-year supply agreement, Vulcan will send shipments of lithium extracted in Germany to Stellantis beginning in 2026. Over the lifetime of the deal, Vulcan will supply between 81,000 metric tons and 99,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide to the automaker. The two companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal, but it’s subject to both the commencement of commercial operations at the extraction site and product qualification.</p>
<p>The deal is part of Stellantis’ sweeping electrification strategy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">which it outlined in July</a>, that earmarks €30 billion ($35.5 billion) for EVs and new software over the next four years. The automaker aims to manufacture 130 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2025 and around 260 gigawatt hours across five factories in North America and Europe by 2030.</p>
<p>It’s the latest sign that global automakers are looking to secure their slice of finite raw materials like lithium, a key mineral in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has made similar investments in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/gm-is-investing-in-a-california-lithium-extraction-project/">California lithium extraction project</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tesla-bhp-ink-supply-deal-for-nickel-ahead-of-demand-surge/">Tesla has inked its own supply deals</a> for minerals like nickel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renault signed its own agreement with Vulcan last week for up to 32,000 metric tons of European-made lithium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies today want to avoid the lock-in they faced in the past with a single vendor. As a result, they are hedging their bets with a multi-cloud strategy, but this creates a new problem around finding a single tool for managing it all. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://upbound.io/">Upbound</a> comes in with its open source <a href="https://crossplane.io/">Crossplane</a> multi-cloud management tool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big problem, and up until now, companies have relied on the cloud vendors themselves to manage each one separately. While some solutions like Google Anthos and Red Hat OpenShift have come along, there was a lack of open source tooling until Upbound released Crossplane in May 2020.</p>
<p>Investors recognized the need identified by Upbound and rewarded the company with a $60 million Series B to help build the open source project while looking to grow the commercial version of the product. Altimeter Capital led the round with participation from GV, Intel Capital and Telstra Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Upbound founder and CEO Bassam Tabbara said that while the market has attempted to find a solution to this management challenge, he believes that his company is the first to build an open source community with the hope of developing this single management console and single API to manage across cloud tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of efforts around trying to build a single point of control. None of them have attacked this problem from a community perspective, creating a universal control plane that enables that in [a] community, while [building] the convergence around it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of Crossplane as the first to get to a point where we actually now have a convergence effect around a single universal cloud API. This has never happened before. It&#8217;s truly the first time that we&#8217;ve gotten to one. You can go to Crossplane right now and you get one declarative API that can be used to address all cloud resources and infrastructure sources across all vendors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tabbara points out that the project is fully cloud-native and is managed under the umbrella of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which manages Kubernetes and other key open source cloud-native technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that Crossplane allows users to pick and choose the cloud vendors they want to use &#8212; whether cloud infrastructure vendors like AWS, Microsoft and Google or cloud-native tooling like Elastic, Confluent, Databricks and Snowflake &#8212; and manage all of that from a single API.</p>
<p>The company has grown and helped nurture the open source project and developed a commercial product in parallel called Upbound (like the company), which customers can install themselves in their cloud of choice or use a SaaS version that Upbound will manage for them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only catching on with users. Tabbara said he has also been seeing major vendors like AWS, Azure, Equinix and IBM building integrations for Crossplane. He believes this is key, and it&#8217;s similar to the dynamic<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/kubernetes-gains-momentum-as-big-name-vendors-join-cloud-native-computing-foundation/"> we saw in 2017</a> when the major cloud players began to rally around Kubernetes and the CNCF.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s truly to the point where there is now a real convergence effect around Crossplane, not unlike the convergence effect that we saw around Kubernetes as a project, and not unlike the convergence we saw around Linux as a project,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It seems to be a project and a commercial vision with tremendous potential, one that investors see as a pivotal piece of the cloud puzzle and are willing to pour in significant capital to help build. If Upbound can execute on this vision, it may be onto something truly transformative, but only time will tell if they can make that happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Francisco Partners <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400">bought Quest Software in 2016</a> when Dell was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/dell-needs-to-decide-what-to-keep-and-what-to-sell-after-emc-deal/"> selling off some assets</a> to help pay for the massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/dell-buys-emc-for-67b-in-largest-deal-in-tech-history/">$67 billion EMC deal</a>. Dell itself had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/02/dell-acquires-quest-software-for-2-4-billion/">purchased Quest in 2012</a> for $2.4 billion. Today, the company was on the move again, with Clearlake Capital picking it up this time.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400"> The Wall Street Journal</a>, the firm bought Quest for $5.4 billion. Reuters<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dellsoftware-m-a-franciscopartners-idUSKCN0Z609F"> reported in 2016</a> that Francisco and Elliot Management paid around $2 billion for Quest and another asset, SonicWALL. If all of these figures are accurate, Francisco made a nice little profit off of its 2016 investment and managed to nurture the company to more than double its value. It&#8217;s worth noting that the parties have not officially acknowledged the price.</p>
<p>While a private company doesn&#8217;t have to reveal its financials, it seems likely that Quest has been doing pretty well since the 2016 transaction. Perhaps even more revealing is that Clearlake has decided to retain CEO Patrick Nichols and his entire management team.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240071" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Quest is your classic legacy security vendor. The company was founded in 1987 and has been shuffled between owners, modernizing along the way and managing to continually stay alive and increase in value.</p>
<p>Dipanjan “DJ” Deb, co-founder and CEO at Francisco Partners, is justifiably proud of building Quest into a more valuable property under its stewardship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a long and successful track record executing divisional carve-out transactions and are grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the Quest team to create value for the company, its customers and its partners,&#8221; Deb said in a statement about the deal.</p>
<p>The company has built up a stable of security products, including identity products One Identity and OneLogin. It also offers an endpoint solution and a Microsoft-focused security product, among other products and services. Clearlake certainly liked the broad portfolio and customer base that Quest is bringing to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With a robust portfolio of market-leading software and SaaS solutions alongside a rich history of product innovation, we believe Quest is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends in identity-centric cybersecurity, data intelligence and IT operations management software markets,” Clearlake&#8217;s Prashant Mehrotra and Paul Huber said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close early next year pending standard regulatory approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online marketplace eBay is further investing in its sneaker business with <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-acquires-sneaker-con-authentication-business/">today&#8217;s news</a> that it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://sneakercon.com/">Sneaker Con Digital&#8217;s</a> authentication business, which verifies the authenticity of high-value footwear. The business has operations in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany, and had been previously working with eBay to vet the sneakers being bought and sold on its platform.</p>
<p>Sneakers have become a large category on eBay&#8217;s marketplace, where today there are over 1.9 million pairs available to buy every day.</p>
<p>In October 2020, eBay launched an &#8220;Authenticity Guarantee&#8221; service in partnership with Sneaker Con, whose team of experts would verify the sneakers at no cost to sellers before items were shipped to the buyers. If the buyer then returns the sneakers, the authenticators would inspect them again before they&#8217;re sent back to the seller. This multi-point inspection system involves checking various aspects of the shoes in question, including the sizing, labels, stitching, logos, heel tabs, laces, and more, and even the box itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240068" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the shoes were verified, the left sneaker is given an NFC-enabled tag that provides more detailed information about the sneakers&#8217; authenticity when scanned. Verifiable listings also receive a blue check mark next to the item. The service was available for any sneaker over $100 being sold on eBay&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>Many buyers and sellers preferred to shop sneakers through eBay as they&#8217;d be able to see photos of the exact shoes they&#8217;d be getting, instead of stock photos, and there were fewer fees <a href="https://www.insider.com/ebay-sneakers-authenticity-guarantee-review">compared</a> with some rival sneaker marketplaces. Attracting this kind of buyer is also part of eBay&#8217;s larger strategy to drive enthusiasts to its site across various high-end categories, like handbags, watches, and sneakers, then benefit as they shop more items on eBay. The company recently <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/ebay-inc-ebay-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/">noted</a> the average sneaker buyer on eBay spends approximately $2,000 in other categories, for example.</p>
<p>Ebay says its Authenticity Guarantee service led to quarter-over-quarter category growth and, in just over a year, it&#8217;s authenticated over 1.55 million sneakers worldwide.</p>
<p>In its Q3 2021 earnings, eBay also noted its U.S. sneaker business was healthy and growing at double-digit rates, and it was expanding to other markets, including Germany. The company additionally announced plans to invest in 3D image capability on sneaker listings that would allow buyers to interact with a 360-degree view of the item they&#8217;re purchasing, as another means of instilling buyer confidence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the acquisition, eBay is bringing its partnered authentication business in-house where it will continue to build on its offerings to accommodate resale market trends, the company said about today&#8217;s news. Deal terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>However, the deal is only for Sneaker Con&#8217;s authentication business &#8212; its events business will continue to operate separately. The deal was signed and closed on November 24, 2021, notes eBay.</p>
<p>&#8220;eBay has always been a vibrant community of enthusiasts, with deeply knowledgeable buyers, sellers and employees,&#8221; said Jordan Sweetnam, SVP and General Manager of eBay North America, in a statement. &#8220;We partnered with Sneaker Con to launch sneaker authentication on eBay last year because the team shared our passion for the category – with best-in-class capabilities to deliver what our customers want most. The response to our authentication offering has been overwhelming, and this acquisition allows us to continue to transform eBay and bring a higher level of trust and confidence to every transaction,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>With a holiday-impacted week behind us, we hope that you are ready for the next few weeks of busy news. Because starting in the back-half of December, the world is going to slow down dramatically. Make sure that you are <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">following the show on Twitter</a>, and let&#8217;s get into it!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240020" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>No tech IPOs this week, though we will see <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/17494/next-week-earnings-calendar-stocks">earnings from select SaaS companies</a>. That means that our information flow will slow over the next few days.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/27/22804830/starlink-india-not-to-subscribe-license">India is irked at Starlink</a>, telling the Elon Musk company to get its regulatory paperwork in order.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi is going public, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/11/27/personal-computer-maker-raspberry-pi-plans-london-listing/">it&#8217;s expected</a>. The micro-computer company could debut in Spring of 2022 on the London exchanges.</li>

<li>Two acquisitions took place recently that caught our eye, including <a href="https://skift.com/2021/11/23/booking-holdings-to-buy-flights-partner-etraveli-group-for-1-8-billion/">Booking Holdings buying Etraveli Group for $1.8 billion</a>, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearlake-capital-to-buy-quest-software-from-francisco-partners-11638140400?mod=djemalertNEWS">Clearlake buying Quest from Francisco Partners</a>.</li>
<li>From the startup world, two deals: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/28/slice-220-million-fundraise-credit-card-challenger-india/">Slice is now a unicorn thanks to Tiger Global</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/thought-machine-series-c-unicorn/">Thought Machine is <em>also</em> now a unicorn</a> thanks to its own six-figure round.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-is-expected-to-step-down-sources-say.html">CNBC reported</a> this morning that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is expected to step down from his role at the social media company. Shortly after, Dorsey himself <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">confirmed</a> the rumors and Twitter <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-steps-down-as-twitter-ceo-board-unanimously-appoints-cto-parag-agrawal-as-successor-301432989.html">issued a press release</a> with more details. Parag Agrawal, who joined Twitter as an engineer in 2011 and has served as CTO since 2017, will take over as Dorsey&#8217;s successor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being &#8216;founder-led,'&#8221; Dorsey wrote in an email to Twitter&#8217;s staff, which he also <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1465347002426867720%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2240050action%3Dedit">tweeted</a>. &#8220;Ultimately I believe that&#8217;s severely limiting and a single point of failure. I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorsey is the CEO of both Twitter and Square, a financial company that serves both consumer and corporate customers with payment, cash management and transference services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240050" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Twitter says Dorsey will remain on Twitter&#8217;s Board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders. Alongside Dorsey&#8217;s departure, Bret Taylor, the president and COO of Salesforce, was named the new Chairman of the Board, succeeding Patrick Pichette who will remain on the Board and continue to serve as chair of the Audit Committee, the company said.</p>
<p>Dorsey points to Taylor&#8217;s addition to the board as one of the reasons he felt comfortable stepping down, noting Taylor &#8220;understands entrepreneurship, taking risks, companies at massive scale, technology, product, and he&#8217;s an engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter said there are no changes to the company&#8217;s previously shared outlook for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021, or its 2023 goals, as a result of these leadership changes.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s stock rose on the news that Dorsey may step down, trading up 6.1% as of the time of writing after giving up some early gains in the first minutes of the week&#8217;s trading cycle. <strong>Update: Twitter shares are now effectively flat on the day, off some 0.13% as of the time of this update (12:43 ET on Monday). </strong></p>
<p>For comparison purposes, Twitter is worth around $40 billion today. No small number, to be clear, but less than half the value of Square, which has a public-market worth of just over $99 billion.</p>
<p>Running <em>one</em> public company is work. Running <em>two</em> is uncommon and, we presume, not a simple feat. Square shares are also trading higher this morning, albeit to a smaller degree. (Twitter has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-under-fire-from-activist-investor-2020-3">attracted investor dissent</a> for its CEO&#8217;s split time.) Square confirmed to TechCrunch there are no changes to Dorsey&#8217;s role there, nor anything else related to leadership, strategy, or financial outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it,&#8221; Dorsey wrote to his team. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t many founders that choose their company over their own ego. I know we&#8217;ll prove this was the right move.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My trust in Parag as Twitter&#8217;s CEO is deep,&#8221; he said, praising his successor in the issued statement. &#8220;His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I&#8217;m deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It&#8217;s his time to lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his time at Twitter, Agrawal has been responsible for the company&#8217;s technical strategy and has led the work to improve development velocity. He also advanced the state of machine learning across Twitter. Prior to being appointed CTO, Parag was Twitter&#8217;s first Distinguished Engineer due to his work across revenue and consumer engineering, including his impact on the re-acceleration of audience growth in 2016 and 2017, the company said. The exec holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from <span class="xn-org">Stanford University</span> and a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the <span class="xn-org">Indian Institute of Technology</span>, <span class="xn-location">Bombay</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank the Board for their confidence in my leadership and Jack for his continued mentorship, support, and partnership,&#8221; said Agrawal, in a statement. &#8220;I look forward to building on everything we have accomplished under Jack&#8217;s leadership and I am incredibly energized by the opportunities ahead. By continuing to improve our execution, we will deliver tremendous value for our customers and shareholders as we reshape the future of public conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also shared his email to Twitter&#8217;s team in a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1465349749607854083%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2240050action%3Dedit">tweet</a>, noting that he&#8217;s committed to executing Twitter&#8217;s strategy and hitting its &#8220;ambitious goals,&#8221; but that the company will be challenged in how it works to execute its plans and deliver results. Twitter will have an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, with a Q&amp;A session for employees, he noted.</p>

<h2>A great product run</h2>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s leadership and product direction have received criticism over the years for being too conservative or too slow &#8212; or both. In recent quarters, however, Twitter&#8217;s ability to develop and ship new products and services has accelerated.</p>
<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s functionality remained largely stagnant for years &#8212; save for some major changes like making tweets longer &#8212; the app has introduced a slew of new features and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Twitter entered the live audio race with Spaces, then introduced monetization features, like Ticketed Spaces, Tip Jar and livestream shopping (Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram have also picked up the pace when it comes to e-commerce). More recently, the platform launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">subscription Twitter Blue service</a>, which offers a more customizable user experience &#8212; including the ability to undo tweets &#8212; for $2.99 per month.</p>
<p>The social giant also opened its checkbook to bring more capabilities to its service. So far this year, Twitter has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/twitter-acquires-threader-an-app-that-compiles-and-shares-threads/">companies like Threader</a> (which helped develop a thread reading experience for Twitter Blue), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/twitter-acquires-group-chat-app-sphere/">Sphere</a> (a group social messaging app), Breaker (which helped build Spaces), and, most notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, a newsletter platform that gives writers the convenience of linking their posts directly on their profile.</p>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s no secret that Dorsey is interested in crypto &#8212; his Twitter bio is literally just &#8220;#bitcoin&#8221; &#8212; but he&#8217;s not the company&#8217;s only proponent. Twitter has been working on a way for users to display NFTs in their profile and, more broadly, Twitter houses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">Bluesky</a>, a decentralized web project. But Dorsey&#8217;s departure may not slow the momentum of Twitter crypto, especially after the company announced earlier this month that it will build a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/twitter-is-building-a-crypto-team/">crypto team</a>. At the time, Twitter told TechCrunch that Agrawal would be working with the new crypto team on the future of crypto at Twitter, helping drive Twitter&#8217;s push toward decentralizing social media through blockchain technology.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately reply to a request for further comment about the news.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-plays-best-of-2021/">announced</a> the winners of its &#8220;<a href="https://play.google.com/bestof2021">Best of 2021</a>&#8221; app awards, which highlight both the company&#8217;s and users&#8217; picks for the best apps and games from the past year. This year, Google is expanding its awards lineup to include apps and games on tablets, Wear OS and Google TV, it says. Its U.S. winners included meditation app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elevatelabs.geonosis">Balance</a> as its app of the year and top game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Pokémon UNITE</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cbs.app">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefiremax">Garena Free Fire MAX</a> won the user&#8217;s choice awards.</p>
<p>In 2020, the award winners had reflected a world undergoing a pandemic, where stressed users had turned to apps and soothing games to relax &#8212; like top sleep app Loóna, which was last year&#8217;s &#8220;Best App,&#8221; or escapist games like winner Genshin Impact.</p>
<p>With the early days of the pandemic now behind us, some of this year&#8217;s award winners are apps that now focus on personal growth and creativity, instead of just relaxing or escaping. This, too, seems to reflect where we are as a society. Over this past year, we saw the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation">great resignation</a>&#8221; where U.S. employees voluntarily quit their unfulfilling, underpaid jobs in search of something better, and the creator economy began to boom as people pursued their passions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240026" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition to Best of 2021 app Balance, which offers personalized meditation, other personal development-styled winners include <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonly.android">Moonly</a>, an app for &#8220;harmonizing your life&#8221; with the lunar calendar; a &#8220;comedic relaxation&#8221; app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.launchpad.laughscape">Laughscape</a>; a hypnotherapy app for women, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clementine.clementineapp">Clementine</a>; better sleep app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle">Sleep Cycle</a>; mentorship community <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentorspaces">Mentor Spaces</a>; habit tracker and planner <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blu.rabito">Rabit</a>; and an app for navigating grief from loss, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.empathy.companion">Empathy</a>.</p>
<p>Other winners showcased how we adapted to pandemic life, as with audio chatroom <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clubhouse.app">Clubhouse</a>, tools for reducing screen time, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cliffweitzman.speechify2">Speechify</a>, or those for reconnecting with nature, like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptivapps.blossom">Blossom</a>.</p>

<p>The year&#8217;s best games were led by top game Pokémon UNITE, which focused on cross-platform gaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pokémon Unite is Pokémon’s first strategic team battle game, co-developed by The Pokémon Company and TiMi Studio Group. We tried to distill the best parts of the MOBA genre to create a new kind of game, but I must admit that I was unsure if it would be well received by players around the world,&#8221; noted Masaaki Hoshino, Producer, Pokémon UNITE, in a statement. T&#8221;his award shows that our game has been positively received by fans and the media, and while this is a great relief, at the same time it reaffirms our determination to continue doing our best to make Pokémon UNITE an even more exciting experience that meets our players’ expectations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The larger lineup also included indie experiences like the introspective <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GeorgeBatchelor.BirdAlone">Bird Alone</a>, which challenges you to become friends with the &#8220;loneliest bird in the world.&#8221; Annapurna Interactive&#8217;s Donut County won for its physics-based puzzle game, among others.</p>
<p>The full list of game winners included:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">QR code ordering at restaurants has been around for years, but the pandemic increased<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/21/qr-codes-have-replaced-restaurant-menus-industry-experts-say-it-isnt-a-fad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its adoption as social distancing and hygiene measures went into place</a>. <a href="https://mryum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr Yum</a>, a Melbourne-based mobile ordering and payments platform that was founded in 2018, announced today it has raised a $65 million USD Series A round, led by Tiger Global.</p>
<p>Other participants in the round included Commerce VC, VU Venture Partners, Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar and Kim Jackson through Skip Capital, San Antonio Spurs player Patty Mills and music group Rüfüs Du Sol. Returning investors included TEN13 and AirTree.</p>
<p>Mr Yum announced a $8 million USD post-seed round just seven months ago in April and its Series A brings its total funding so far to $74 million (about $103 million AUD).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240007" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founded in Melbourne, Mr Yum now has offices across Australia and in the United States and United Kingdom, too. Its clients include E.P. and L.P. and Strings of Life in Los Angeles, and Magic Mike Live Las Vegas and Sahara Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The startup says it has a total of more than 1,500 venues on its platform, including shopping centers, movie theaters and airports in addition to restaurants, and 13 million users. Over the past 18 months, its team has grown from 12 to more than 120 full-time staff, with teams in Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Brisbane and its Melbourne headquarters.</p>
<p>The company says that, based on <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a> data, this is the largest, this is is the third largest Series A in Australian history, and the largest Series A for an Australian female-led startup.</p>
<p>In an email, co-founder and CEO Kim Teo told TechCrunch that the startup’s goal is, “to build ‘the Shopify for restaurants.’” The company was first created because “menus hadn’t evolved in hundreds of years, consumers are visual and want to understand what they’re ordering,” she explained, “So Mr Yum was created with the simple idea of bringing menus to life with photos of every dish.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YJXUuzhTtU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/sunday-raises-100-million-for-its-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">Sunday raises $100 million for its fast restaurant checkout flow</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sunday raises $100 million for its fast restaurant checkout flow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/sunday-raises-100-million-for-its-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/embed/#?secret=YJXUuzhTtU" data-secret="YJXUuzhTtU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it expanded into mobile QR ordering, which Teo says eliminates administrative tasks like writing down orders, processing payments and splitting bills. She adds that restaurants using Mr Yum have increased their average order value by 20% to 40% and it has a monthly merchant churn rate of less than 0.5%.</p>
<p>“We made a big bet on QR codes early on,” Teo said. “We saw that QR code readers had been embedded into the iPhone camera about three months before we launched, so we took that as a signal they would become more widely used. Obviously QR codes are now commonplace and the past couple of years has saved us years of consumer education and any hesitation around them.”</p>
<p>Mr Yum began pitching its mobile ordering platform to businesses before the pandemic, but the pandemic has accelerated adoption.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has so drastically changed the mindset and adoption of technology for the hospitality and entertainment industries globally,” said Teo. She believes this change is permanent, because Mr Yum’s platform can make increase order sizes and also has marketing and customer analytic tools. These include a loyalty platform called Boomerang, which lets venues create gift vouchers, free item codes and dollar or percentage.</p>

<p>Another way Mr Yum wants to be different from other QR ordering platforms is through integrations, which Teo calls its “bread and butter,” with partners like Impact Data, Sprout and Mailchimp. It also has more than 75 integrations with point-of-sale, marketing and payment providers, like Square, Toast and Deliverect. In terms of its payment features, Mr Yum has a partnership with Afterpay in the dining category, and also added a pay at table function to the platform so merchants have more flexibility in how they use the platform with their customers.</p>
<p>Mr Yum’s competitors vary by the geographic regions it operates in. Teo said Mr Yum will continue differentiating itself with product innovation, like Group Tabs and Advanced Batching, which combines separate orders to print together in kitchen bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Mr Yum raised again just a few months after its post-seed round because “over the past few years, startup investment rounds have grown significantly in size and frequency. To become a market leader in a category and sustain this long term requires a lot of firepower,” she added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Particular Audience provides product discovery tools for retailers to offer personalization without compromising personal data.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Being in control of customer data is one of the ways retailers, like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix, are able to tap into consumer behavior and create customized experiences whenever a user logs in.</p>
<p>Those are some of the reasons Amazon, in particular, is <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/788109/amazon-retail-market-share-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poised to grab 50% of the U.S. e-commerce market</a> this year, and why Sydney-based <a href="https://particularaudience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Particular Audience</a> wants to break down the data silos going on within e-commerce to give any retailer a chance to gather similar data on their customers to personalize experiences.</p>
<p>Particular Audience provides product discovery tools for retailers that are powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. In fact, the company wants to go further and offer personalization based on anonymity and without compromising personal data, CEO James Taylor told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239441" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Taylor launched Particular Audience in 2019 after taking a few years to work out the technology. The global pandemic threw a wrench in some plans, with Taylor and a handful of executives taking a pay cut so as to not have to let any employees go. However, with the e-commerce industry growing over the past 18 months, the company was able to get back to where it was, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The company has now amassed a real-time data set on product search, sales, pricing and availability from across the internet, from its browser plugin <a href="https://similarinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SimilarInc.com</a>, which gathers the data from its online shopper community without tracking or cookies. Retailers can analyze that data to tell them, for example, how better to promote high-margin or overstocked items.</p>
<p>“Data IP is the current frontier,” he said. “It is data that is going to improve predictions to personalize inventory and reduce waste while also helping with supply chain management. The goal is to create website data visibility that would benefit all of the other merchants other than Amazon.”</p>
<p>To continue developing its technology, the company secured $7.5 million in Series A funding in a round led by Equity Venture Partners and that included existing investors Carthona Capital and a group of angel investors. This latest investment gives the company $9.5 million in total funding raised to date, which includes $1.3 million in seed funding raised in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Particular Audience is working with approximately 100 websites currently. In addition to Sydney, the company also has an office in London. Europe makes up more than 50% of Particular Audience’s global revenue, and the new funding enables the company to open a new office in Amsterdam next year.</p>
<p>North America is also a growth territory for the company, where it has already opened an office in Vancouver, with plans to open a New York office in 2022 as well. The company has 60 employees, up from 20 last year, and Taylor expects to add 40 more in the next year, including rounding out its leadership team with a head of product.</p>
<p>The funding will also be invested into building out an API-first product suite and retail media platform so retailers can gain a revenue stream from cost per clicks. Meanwhile, the company saw 460% year over year in revenue growth and expects to hit $100 million in gross merchandise value through its products this year, up 19 times in the last two years, Taylor said.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Daniel Szekely, partner at Equity Venture Partners, will join the board.</p>
<p>“Personalization of the internet is a critical frontier for e-commerce retailers, and in a world of growing online shopping options and diminishing consumer attention spans, delivering an experience that meets individual consumers’ needs is absolutely critical,” he said in a written statement. “James and his outstanding team have tackled this issue in a novel way, and the important need for their solution has been made obvious as the business gets pulled into multiple geographies. We’re thrilled to back them in their Series A and know this is just the beginning of the journey.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ability to purchase something at the point of discovery from digital content exists, but Bolt is ready to give that purchase its “one-click” treatment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ability to purchase something at the point of discovery from digital content exists, but checkout technology company <a href="https://www.bolt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt</a> has the opportunity to give that its “one-click” treatment. It announced Monday that it made its first acquisition in <a href="https://tipser.co/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tipser</a>, a Swedish-based technology company enabling direct checkout on any digital surface.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based Bolt is fresh off of raising <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$393 million in Series D funding</a> in October, bringing total capital raised to date to $600 million. And though the Tipser acquisition is in line with the company’s plans of what it wanted to do with the new capital, Ryan Breslow, founder and CEO of Bolt, told TechCrunch the deal “had been in the works for a while.”</p>
<p>Tipser’s technology enables consumers to purchase products natively from sites like online publications, mobile marketplaces, price comparison sites, social media platforms or search engines. The company is led by Marcus Jacobsson, co-founder and CEO, who started the company in 2012 with Axel Wolrath and Jonas Sjöstedt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In fact, when Bolt initially began talking to Tipser, the company was not in a place to sell, and was actually working on their next investment round (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tipser/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they raised just over $14 million</a>), but the two companies ended up going into deeper conversations and found their cultural resonances worked better together, Breslow said.</p>
<p>“We saw how significant Tipser could be for Bolt,” he added. “They had been perfecting their embedded commerce technology for a decade and were the only formidable player. They were stronger than us in areas where we were weaker. It is very strategic to have them on our team.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yurhjbIiXk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/">As 2020 ends, new unicorn formation continues to impress</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As 2020 ends, new unicorn formation continues to impress&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/as-2020-ends-new-unicorn-formation-continues-to-impress/embed/#?secret=yurhjbIiXk" data-secret="yurhjbIiXk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Exact transaction figures were not disclosed, but Breslow did reveal to TechCrunch that the acquisition, which was an all-stock deal, came in “just shy of $200 million.” The entire Tipser team is staying put, so Bolt will be adding 100 more people to its team. Tipser’s presence in Sweden will now also serve as Bolt’s European headquarters to go with the company’s <a href="https://www.bolt.com/blog/bolt-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent announcement of expanding into Europe</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the acquisition, Bolt is launching Remote Checkout, a tool for shoppers to make a purchase from the exact point of discovery. Instead of seeing something on social media — where <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84% of shoppers look for reviews</a>, according to Pew Research Center — then going to another website to make the purchase,</p>
<p>The new tool is one that Bolt was working on internally for over a year and was inspired by Instagram Checkout, also a tool where you can discover a product and check out directly from the app, Breslow said.</p>
<p>“With the death of tracking and cookies, we could see the need for native checkout so retailers can track conversion,” he added. “It’s better for consumers to not have to click a million things.”</p>
<p>Bolt’s Remote Checkout features include the direct one-click checkout, engagement with Bolt’s network of shoppers and the ability for merchants to boost conversion rates while receiving orders through multiple channels and building direct relationships with visitors. It also turns anonymous visitors into logged-in account holders and monetizes traffic on-site.</p>
<p>The added feature of publishers and creators being able to monetize traffic coming to their sites was one that Jason Wagenheim, president and CRO at media publisher BDG (formerly known as Bustle Digital Group), found particularly interesting. BDG’s brands include Bustle, EliteDaily and Fatherly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He was a bystander of sorts for the merger, having signed up with Tipser in January as the company’s first U.S. publisher, going live with the product in April on two of BDG’s 13 sites, Wagenheim said in an interview.</p>
<p>“What I love most about this acquisition is that we can accelerate the onboarding of hundreds of more merchants onto our platform,” he said. “This is a marriage of content and commerce.”</p>
<p>Before social media and companies like Bolt and Tipser, shopping directly from a magazine page meant utilizing QR codes, but that didn’t take off like people thought it would, Wagenheim said.</p>
<p>Other publishers tried to crack the code, and he noted Goop being one of the few able to do it. Now with these new technologies, any publisher or creator can close the gap between the upper and lower funnels and drive awareness because its commerce is shoppable and one click away.</p>
<p>He considers BDG’s project with Tipser still in the beta phase, but there are plans to roll out the technology on all of its sites next year. The company already had its audience engage in over 25 million sessions with people, on average, seeing 10 products per session, a metric Wagenheim says means the process is working: people are spending time with the products, are engaged and adding products to carts.</p>
<p>“With hundreds more merchants for editors to write about, and the one-click transaction happening, that is a game-changer,” he added.</p>
