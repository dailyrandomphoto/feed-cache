		Chuck Phillips is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.meetwell.app/">MeetWell</a>, an application that enables teams to achieve a better work-life balance while saving companies money by reducing the amount of bad meetings they attend.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Bad meetings are the fast food of the knowledge worker; it&#8217;s so deliciously quick and easy to throw a 60-minute default meeting on everyone&#8217;s schedule, but the long-term costs are extremely unhealthy.</p>
<p>Busy meeting organizers drive-thru schedule meetings because they think they don&#8217;t have time to plan. They expect good outcomes to come from little preparation, which doesn&#8217;t happen. The meetings are being held and progress is stilted.</p>
<p>One way to save everyone significant time (and win lots of friends) would be to just get rid of all meetings, but a well-prepared and well-run session can expedite communication and get a team closer to its goals. Unfortunately, most meetings are <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/16-tips-for-running-remarkably-effective-meetings.html">lazily planned and poorly run</a>, imprisoning attendees and halting productivity.</p>
<p>So how can you separate the good meetings from the bad?</p>
<h2>Measure your meeting waistline</h2>
<p>No one measures the impact of their meetings. So the first step is to start keeping meeting metrics so that you can identify the bad meetings on your teams&#8217; calendars.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My company has created <a href="https://www.meetwell.app/">a calendar assistant</a> that automatically measures and stops bad meetings before they occur, but if you can&#8217;t automate the prevention of bad meetings, survey and learn from attendees after the meeting to record and measure them.</p>
<p>Create taxonomies and quantify the types of meetings that are being held — for example: &#8220;information sharing,&#8221; &#8220;brainstorming,&#8221; &#8220;1:1,&#8221; &#8220;decision-making,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>After several months (ideally a year) of collecting metrics, you can grade the quality and look for patterns. You will probably find something along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very few employees decline meetings, even when it&#8217;s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What are the most important factors when you&#8217;re pitching your startup for fundraising? What questions come to the minds of the VCs you&#8217;re pitching? How do you get the deal across the finish line? Or choose the right investors for your company to begin with?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> looks to answer all these questions and more. Thus far, Coda&#8217;s Shishir Mehrotra and investor S.

We&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/toasts-aman-narang-and-bvps-kent-bennett-on-how-customer-obsession-is-everything/">heard how important it is to be customer-obsessed</a> from Toast&#8217;s Aman Narang and BVP&#8217;s Kent Bennett. And Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/fifth-walls-brendan-wallace-and-hippos-assaf-wand-discuss-proptechs-biggest-opportunities/">laid out all the biggest opportunities in prop tech</a>. And that was just in the last month or so.</p>
<p>In July, we have more top-notch speakers on the roster, including big-name founders and seasoned investors. What&#8217;s more, these speakers are ready to hear about your startup. ECL features the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can pitch their products to speakers and get live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having read more SPAC investor decks in the last twelve months than I&#8217;d like to admit to, I thought I was over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/dont-trust-that-spac-deck/">being irked</a> by their bullishness. Call me conservative, but public companies shouldn&#8217;t be full of shit, and companies going public should probably aim for a similar target.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why S-1 filings for traditional IPOs are great. When it comes to numbers, they are honest. The filings don&#8217;t include forecasts for the next year, let alone the next half decade. Sure, companies will make a pitch for their model and methods, but S-1 filings are pretty good from an honesty perspective. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/wework-files-its-s-1-we-dive-into-the-numbers-and-pose-some-questions/">Mostly</a>.</p>
<p>SPAC investor decks are the opposite. I mean, look at <a href="http://www.spacbyccac.com/doc/Project%20Vision%20PIPE%20Presentation%20vPublic.pdf">this chart</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2169355 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-1.54.22-PM.png" alt="" width="626" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-1.54.22-PM.png 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-1.54.22-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-1.54.22-PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-1.54.22-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></p>
<p>Historical revenue? Who needs it! Look at the growth that could maybe, possibly, theoretically happen! 201% CAGR!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.wallbox.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Wallbox_Investor_Presentation_June_2021.pdf">another favorite</a>:</p>

<p>Sure, Bob.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a super-grainy image from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840780/000119312521194145/d133780dex992.htm">Local Bounti SPAC investor deck</a>. It&#8217;s the least-blurry version I could find. Enjoy the charts!</p>

<p>And one more, this time from the <a href="http://www.northerngenesis.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Project-Empire-Investor-Presentation_v20210622.pdf">recent Embark deal</a> that TechCrunch covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/">here</a>:</p>

<p>What about historical revenues? Or expectations from 2021, 2022 or 2023? Who knows!</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/dont-trust-that-spac-deck/">what we&#8217;ve learned about the accuracy of SPAC performance predictions</a>, I think we need a Godzilla-sized Salt Bae to make all of this palatable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ecosystems make strange bedfellows. Here’s one of the stranger in recent memory – and one of the most unexpected bits of news from today’s Windows 11 event. Microsoft announced today that it will be making Android apps available on the next major version of its operating system.</p>
<p>Chief Product Officer Panos Panay called the addition, “just one more small surprise,” noting that the mobile apps can be integrated into the Start menu and taskbar. They’ll also tile or “window” as part of the OS’s new application placement UI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169861" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169861" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="552" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg 1767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083937.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The apps will be available through the Microsoft Store by way of the Amazon Appstore. The company highlighted TikTok running on a demo of the operating system. The app is presented in a vertical, portrait orientation, as you would expect from a mobile-first design.</p>
<p>With 1.85 million Android apps, it’s currently a way to flood the Microsoft app store with a whole bunch of new content – and make sure the latest popular mobile apps are suddenly available on the platform. Though time will tell how good the experience (built on top of Intel Bridge) ultimately is.</p>
<p>Windows 11 arrives this holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The other week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility,</a> I spoke to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/experts-from-ford-toyota-and-hyundai-outline-why-automakers-are-pouring-money-into-robotics/">a trio of executives</a> at top automotive companies about why they’re all so bullish about robotics. There are the obvious implications, of course. Automakers have long employed robotics for manufacturing – they were really ahead of the curve on those concerns about automating job loss. And then there’s the fact that self-driving cars are effectively robots.</p>
<p>Beyond that, however, it’s clear that car companies see robotics as a key investment in their future. What really struck me about the conversation, is how differently the three companies – Hyundai, Ford and Toyota – are approaching the space. If nothing else, it’s a sign that there’s plenty of opportunity here.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/robotics-roundup-4/">wrote quite a bit about Ford’s ambitions in the category</a> several roundups ago, including an interview with Mario Santillo, who joined us for the recent panel. As evidenced by the company’s recent investment in University of Michigan, Ford’s approach is largely research-based. The company wants to be in on the ground floor both in terms of technology and talent. Though when I pressed Santillo about acquisitions, however, (specifically as it pertains to Digit-maker, Agility), he told me, “that&#8217;s always something we&#8217;re looking at.” So don&#8217;t rule it of, especially as other car companies begin to lockdown big names in the category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1885677" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/atlas-gymnastics-boston-dynamics.gif" alt="atlas gymnastics boston dynamics" width="960" height="533" /></p>
<p>Hyundai, of course, made one of the biggest robotics acquisitions in recent memory, picking up Boston Dynamics after its short stint in the Softbank portfolio (the investment firm remains a shareholder). Of course, that post-Google time has been important for the company, seeing the commercialization of Spot and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/this-is-boston-dynamics-next-commercial-robot/">upcoming sale of Stretch.</a> Hyundai’s Ernestine Fu shed some more light for us on the deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/hyundai-completes-deal-for-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/">which officially closed this week</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>With New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles. Obviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2111206" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111206" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2111206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg" alt="Hyundai Tiger walking robot" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg 1079w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.54.46-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>As we discussed, the driving force in the Toyota Research Institute’s interest in the category Japan’s aging population. Eldercare forms the basis of much of what the company does in robotics, including some home robotics research that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/toyota-research-institute-shows-how-its-robotics-work-with-difficult-surfaces-in-the-home/"> it showed off this week</a> – specifically how its imaging can handle reflective and transparent surfaces. Both have traditionally been tricky for robotic systems.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGCwhjw-NTo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As TRI’s Max Bajracharya told me,</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]n Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That’s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It’s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don’t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.</p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve been following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/nvidia-launches-its-isaac-sdk-to-help-democratize-ai-powered-robot-development/">NVIDIA’s Isaac software</a> for a while now, and the robotic simulation software <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-isaac-sim-on-omniverse-now-available-in-open-beta/">is available as an open beta</a>. Built on top of Omniverse, the software is designed to test a wide range of different camera and sensor capabilities for robotics. It&#8217;s a fascinate project and potentially a big deal for early-stage robotics startups.</p>
<p>Quick follow up to some funding last week from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/robotics-roundup-16/">a robots landscaping company</a>, I asked iRobot what’s going on with their Terra mower, which was delayed amid pandemic-related cuts. The company tells me there’s still no clear timeline for the indefinitely delayed robot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168197" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2168197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/02-Automated-Beverage-Dispenser-Demo-Miso-Robotics-and-Lancer-Worldwide.2021-06-21-13_28_45.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168197" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Miso Robotics, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/hamburger-flipping-robotics-maker-miso-introduces-automated-beverage-dispenser/">continues to build out from Flippy</a>, the hamburger-flipping robot with an automated beverage dispenser. The machine, created with beverage dispenser manufacturer Lancer, fully automates the process, right down to adding the cap on the cup. No clear timeline on the product yet, however, but it’s fun to see some of these companies branch out in a given sector.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169256" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169256" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2169256" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg 5556w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/download-3.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169256" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkshire Grey</p></div></p>
<p>A pair of warehouse automation stories worth highlighting here. <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/17/2249041/0/en/Berkshire-Grey-Unveils-Next-Generation-of-Intelligent-Enterprise-Robotic-Picking-and-Advanced-Mobility-Solutions-to-Accelerate-Fulfillment.html">Berkshire Grey has unveiled</a> a bunch of new fulfillment robots. Per the company,</p>
<blockquote><p>This new generation of mobile robots offers increased fulfillment throughput at a lower cost point to enable shorter delivery times and support a larger number of SKUs. Unlike fixed conveyor belts and early generation mobile robots, Berkshire Grey’s intelligent fleets harness the power of AI to orchestrate tens to thousands of mobile robots to pick, organize, and deliver items for a wide variety of customer and store orders.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbmE0pHBrz4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The company will tell you the same thing as every robotics maker: it&#8217;s all about helping retailers compete with the behemoth that is Amazon. Fittingly, the ecommerce giant also showed off <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/new-technologies-to-improve-amazon-employee-safety">some new robots this week</a>. Amazon says it&#8217;s utilized 350,000 mobile drive units since the company acquired Kiva Systems, which formed the foundation for its Amazon Robotics wing. The post has caused <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/whats-going-on-with-amazons-hightech-warehouse-robots">some to wonder</a> whether, in spite of a head start and some massive funding, whether the company is beginning to fall behind a number of aggressive warehouse robotics startups.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hjZtBvsmVY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Not a ton of funding news this week, but that should change soon. Hot bot summer is nearly upon us. I feel it in the air. Meantime,  please enjoy this submersible drone designed to track a wide range of creators in the mesopelagic &#8220;twilight&#8221; zone. Developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/whoi-uro061621.php">Mesobot</a> is designed to observe zooplankton, gelatinous animals and more, without disturbing their habitat. Here&#8217;s Senior Scientist Dana Yoerger,</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect that Mesobot will emerge as a vital tool for observing midwater organisms for extended periods, as well as rapidly identifying species observed from vessel biosonars. Because Mesobot can survey, track, and record compelling imagery, we hope to reveal previously unknown behaviors, species interactions, morphological structures, and the use of bioluminescence.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy Windows 11 day. Microsoft is giving us our best look <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/microsoft-announces-windows-11-generally-available-by-the-holidays/">yet at its upcoming operating system</a>, which is due out over the holidays. Following a year when the vast majority of our interpersonal communications arrived through computer and phone screens, the company is putting its communication software front and center.</p>
<p>Windows 11 will have Microsoft Teams built in, in a bid to compete more directly with communication platforms like Apple’s FaceTime. And like FaceTime, the key here is cross-device integration, making the service more hardware-agnostic as people move from desktop to mobile and back again.</p>

<p>In an era when we&#8217;ve got more video chat platforms than we know what to do with, it&#8217;s hard to shake the feeling that we might be seeing the final nail in the coffin for the once-mighty Skype, which the company bought way back in 2011 for $8.5 billion. As it tried to do with Skype, Microsoft is looking to blur the line between consumers and professionals with the platform.</p>
<p>All versions of the new operating system will have Teams baked directly into the Start menu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After weeks of leaks and hype, Microsoft today officially <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/introducing-windows-11/">announced Windows 11</a>, the next version of its desktop operating system. While the company may have once said that Windows 10 was the last version of Windows, forgoing major point launches for a regular cadence of bi-annual upgrades, but it clearly believes that the changes &#8212; and especially the redesigned user interface &#8212; in this update warrant a new version number.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to release <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11">Windows 11</a> to the general public by the holidays, so we can probably expect it sometime around late November. Before that, we&#8217;ll likely see a slew of public betas, starting next week.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh9643c2P6k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you followed along with the development and eventual demise of Windows 10X, Microsoft&#8217;s operating system with a simplified user interface for dual- and (eventually) single-screen laptops, a lot of what you&#8217;re seeing here will feel familiar, down to the redesigned Start menu. Indeed, if somebody showed you screenshots of Windows 11 and early previews of Windows 10X, you&#8217;d have a hard time telling them apart.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169816" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169816" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169816" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-080912.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169816" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>As Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the overall idea behind the design is to make you feel &#8220;an incredible sense of calm,&#8221; but at the same time, the Windows team has also worked to make it a lot faster. Windows Updates, for example, are supposed to be 40 percent faster, but Panay also noted that starting up your machine and even browsing should feel much faster.</p>

<p>One surprise feature here is that you will now also be able to run Android apps on Windows. These apps will seem like native apps that can be integrated into the taskbar, for example. These apps will be in the redesigned Microsoft Store, via &#8212; you want to sit down for this &#8212; the Amazon Appstore. Didn&#8217;t see that coming, did you?</p>

<p>Besides the new user interface, which makes copious use of translucency and shadows and new features for touch screen users, one of the core new UI features is what Microsoft calls Snap Layouts, which pops up a small widget when you hover over the icon that maximizes your window to allow you to move the window to any corner, something that previously involved dragging your window to the corner of your screen (which was often hard when you used multiple screens).</p>

<p>Another major new feature is that Windows 11 will come with Teams built-in from the outset. It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft is bullish when it comes to Teams. It recently launched the consumer version of Teams, so it makes sense to now bring it to Windows 11, too. It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft never brought Skype to Windows, so this is quite a change, but it basically makes Teams Microsoft&#8217;s Facetime.</p>

<p>If you saw the Windows 11 leaks, you know that web widgets are one of the more visible new features. &#8220;Windows widgets is a new, personalized feed, powered by AI, serving you curated content,&#8221; Panay said. Widgets aren&#8217;t a new thing, of course, and in many ways, they make up for the removal of Live Tiles in the Start Menu. They&#8217;ll also give developers a new canvas to surface information from their applications.</p>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be a new Windows without Microsoft talking about gaming, of course. The company argues that Windows 11 will &#8220;deliver the best PC gaming experience yet,&#8221; but what else would they say?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169849" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-24-083153.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169849" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft promises better graphics thanks to Auto HDR, a feature that&#8217;s already available on Xbox. Thousands of games, Microsoft says, will be automatically enhanced with Auto HDR on Windows 11. In addition, the company argues that thanks to a new storage API in Windows 11, games will be able to quickly load game assets without bogging down the CPU (but it&#8217;ll take a compatible PC to do so). Oh, and Microsoft&#8217;s Game Pass subscription will be built right into Windows 11, too.</p>

<p>As expected, there will be a new Microsoft Store, too, which Panay said was built from the ground up for speed (because speed was what people were complaining about?). Panay argues that Microsoft wants to help developers bring more of their applications to the store. One area where Microsoft is obviously trying to set itself apart from Apple is that it will allow developers to use their own commerce engine in their apps and that Microsoft will not take any cut from that.</p>

<p>Indeed, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that he wants developers to have the opportunity to build their own platforms on Windows 11. &#8220;Windows is the stage for the world&#8217;s creation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With this new version of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. [&#8230;] Today, the world needs a more open platform &#8211; one that allows apps to become platforms in their own rights. Windows is the platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born &#8212; like the web. That&#8217;s our aspiration with Windows 11.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happs, an app that lets creators stream live video simultaneously across social platforms, has raised $4.7 million in a post-seed round. The product originally began as a platform for independent journalists, but expanded its mission last year to offer tools to all online creators while connecting them through a new social network.</p>
<p>The funding was led by Bullpen Capital and Crosslink, Goodwater, Corazon, Rob Hayes of First Round Capital and Bangaly Kaba, previously at Instagram and Sequoia, also participated.</p>
<p>What sets <a href="https://about.happs.tv/?redirect_source=happs">Happs</a> apart from some established competitors in the space is the team&#8217;s desire to not only build tools that help video creators produce professional-looking online streams, but to cultivate a kind of meta-community that brings people together from across other social media sites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We kind of view this as the essence of what the creator economy is all about,&#8221; Happs CEO Mark Goldman told TechCrunch. &#8220;The idea of locking creators into an individual platform is a very traditional way of thinking about content creation.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2169799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?w=680" alt="Happs app multistreaming" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png 2646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=2048,1223 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/multistreaming@2x.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Like Goldman, the other co-founders, David Neuman and Drew Shepard, come from the media world. Goldman was the founding COO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/currenttv/">Current TV</a>, an experimental TV channel that dabbled in user-generated content and eventually sold to Al Jazeera in 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole idea was to democratize media and open it up,&#8221; Goldman said of his time working on Current TV, which he connects directly to his interest in building Happs. &#8220;[We] loved the creativity unleashed by that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online creators tend to be siloed within the app where they&#8217;ve built the biggest community, but Happs wants to empower them to reach as many followers as possible in a platform-agnostic way. For creators, the appeal with multistreaming is maximizing reach while making content efficiently. There&#8217;s a risk of alienating YouTube followers at the expense of your Twitch community if you don&#8217;t play your cards right, but some savvy content creators have turned toward the model to grow their audiences.</p>
<p>Happs connects people across platforms in a few ways. For one, Happs users can broadcast live to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Twitch simultaneously. The app also collects live comments from all supported social media sites and beams them into its own interface where they appear in a continuous cross-platform stream.</p>
<p>The integrated comment feature is nice built-in option for anyone who&#8217;s straddled comments across multiple devices simultaneously while livestreaming, which is no easy feat. When you&#8217;re streaming live you can feature a comment so that followers can see it on the screen no matter what platform they&#8217;re watching on.</p>
<p>Other companies in the space like <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS,</a> <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/restream-raises-50m-to-help-creators-program-and-stream-to-multiple-platforms/">Restream</a> are focused on the tools part of the equation, offering power users a useful backend for pushing out multi-streamed live video. <a href="https://streamyard.com/">Streamyard</a> also offers multistreaming to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other platforms through a simple browser interface.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sLOKiL8mS3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/restream-raises-50m-to-help-creators-program-and-stream-to-multiple-platforms/">Restream raises $50M to help creators program and stream to multiple platforms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Restream raises $50M to help creators program and stream to multiple platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/restream-raises-50m-to-help-creators-program-and-stream-to-multiple-platforms/embed/#?secret=sLOKiL8mS3" data-secret="sLOKiL8mS3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike those services, Happs feels more like a social network, with familiar features like user profile photos, follower counts and a feed next to a &#8220;go live&#8221; button. Anyone can use the multi-streaming platform through its iOS or Android apps or a web interface, whether they&#8217;re a creator signing up for the tools or a fan looking to support the content they love.</p>
<p>Happs lacks some of its competitors&#8217; bells and whistles, stuff like fancy customized graphics and lower-thirds, but has a few interesting tricks of its own. While streaming live on Happs, you can invite someone else on the app to join your feed for a real-time collaboration. The social networking elements are meant to encourage cross-platform creativity, so a YouTuber and a Twitch personality could hang out together and boost both of their reaches, all while streaming to a bunch of other apps.</p>
<p>Happs also offers users monetization tools from the get-go, with no requirements before they can start making money. That speaks to the app&#8217;s appeal for creators who might be less established or just starting out. Happs could be a much harder sell for a popular creator deeply invested in a platform like Twitch, which has rules against multi-streaming for most accounts that are allowed to monetize.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to monetize. One lets anyone on Happs sponsor a broadcaster through regular monthly payments. The other is a one-off option that lets you chip in an award for any livestream, or to the VOD (video on demand) after the fact. The in-app currency is a virtual coin that users can buy or earn through doing stuff on the app. There are no plans for ads (yet, anyway).</p>
<p>The company will take 30% cut of subscription earnings, though according to Goldman they&#8217;ll be waiving those fees for an unspecified period of time to attract people to the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised this round to really build up product and tech team [and] to make the platform much more stable and reliable,&#8221; Goldman said. The company is looking forward to leveraging the new resources to &#8220;really go out now and get in front of creators so they know Happs exists.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few spaces have grown hotter in the past year than the creator economy has, but for all of the new tools available to those starting a podcast, newsletter or storefront, most players have been more focused on building out their own platform opportunity rather than selling full independence to creators.</p>
<p><a href="https://spore.build/">Spore</a> wants to transform the creator web experience into a Shopify-like basket of tools that users tap into to connect with their audience across a variety of mediums. Spore CEO Austin Hallock is looking to compete with other creator giants for the &#8220;link in bio&#8221; real estate on social media sites with a white-label option that uses a creator&#8217;s own URL, selling an easy-to-build hub focused solely on connecting personalities with their fans.</p>
<p>With Spore, users can manage their audience, communicate with them and analyze what is and isn&#8217;t working.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform allows for blasting out newsletter updates, podcasts or texts while embedding functionality like storefronts or Discord-like chat feeds into their sites to keep the interactions going 24/7. Creators can also use the tool to convert free subscribers to paying ones, managing the payments flow while also building flows to allow creators to send certain content to their paying fans.</p>
<p>The small startup has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by SignalFire with additional participation from Justin Kan &amp; Robin Chan&#8217;s GOAT, Canaan, Lenny Rachitsky, Nathan Baschez, Justin Waldron and Dave Nemetz, among others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169807" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169807" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169807" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png 1974w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-24-at-9.03.31-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169807" class="wp-caption-text">Spore&#8217;s creator platform backend</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first lead investment for former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine in his role at SignalFire (full disclosure: I used to work closely with Josh). Constine started using Spore to build out a site for his regular show on Clubhouse, fellow investor Justin Kan also grew familiar with the team by building out a website for his podcast and YouTube channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose Spore as my first lead investment as a VC because it solves creators’ biggest problems by giving them their own white-labeled website they control, and combining all the best content, communication, analytics, and payment tools so creators can spend their time making art instead of being web developers,&#8221; Constine tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Spore is certainly a small-scale operation at the moment with 4 full-time employees, though they&#8217;re hoping to grow their team with this raise. All of these features are in their early MVP stages, but Hallock wants his company to continue building out its utility to creators so that they can build a direct connection with their fans, one that isn&#8217;t obfuscated by algorithms..</p>
<p>&#8220;We definitely want to give creators ownership,&#8221; Hallock tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Today, you&#8217;re promoting your Linktree page or Patreon rather than just promoting your own brand&#8230; We don&#8217;t want it to be about Spore.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Content is king, as the saying goes. But in actual fact, a lot of what companies do today with content, and thus the power of that content, is relatively limited by the tools that exist to present it. That is slowly changing, and now a startup called <a href="https://www.sanity.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanity</a>, which has built a system to make it easier to repurpose and use content assets across a number of places, and to more easily use data as content, is announcing $39 million in funding on the back of strong demand for its tech.</p>
<p>This round, a Series B, is led by ICONIQ Growth (the growth round investment arm of the storied ICONIQ, backed by a number of high profile family offices including that of Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg). Lead Edge Capital, Threshold Ventures, Heavybit, and Alliance Venture are also in this round, some of which also participated in Sanity&#8217;s previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/sanity-a-platform-to-build-and-manage-content-flows-on-sites-raises-9-3m-from-ev-williams-threshold-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$9.3 million fundraise</a> in October 2020.</p>
<p>This latest investment brings the total raised by Sanity to $51.8 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Magnus Hillestad, Sanity&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, said the company was &#8220;very happy&#8221; with the number. In any case, it comes on the back of some very strong growth. Sanity is now being used by almost 100,000 developers, marketers, content creators and product professionals, the company said, with &#8220;active users&#8221; numbering at 30,000 (double the number of active users the company had in October, he said). Customers include the likes of National Geographic, Puma, InVision, Datastax and Brex &#8212; who are using it to manage their content repositories and letting them flexibly use information across a range of endpoints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Headless&#8221; has become a big theme in the world of technology, covering services as varied as content (by way of content management systems, commerce, banking and financial services. Organizations that want to buy systems to, say, build websites without putting a lot of investment into design can use platforms that both help them manage the content of the sites, as well as the look of them. But some might want a more customized experience, and they will opt for headless offerings, where there are systems still built to help automate and manage data at the backend, but giving them the ability to design front ends that are tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<p>In Hillestad&#8217;s view, the rise of headless services has been an important development, but what Sanity has conceived of is the next step in extensibility: a platform that lets you use content on the fly in a number of ways without people having to work on that in separate systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking a programmatic approach to content,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What businesses need now are not just marketing, or product, or e-commerce experiences.&#8221; These are all converging, he believes, &#8220;So you need to be able to build experiences to catch people wherever they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is content, but content is also data. If you think about what we are doing, what we are giving companies is a content lake,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Like data lakes, a content lake is structured, yet schema-less.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p4">This in turn gives companies the ability to use it across a number of use cases. This is notable because typically content is stored in silos created for specific purposes, part of the limitation of how CMS systems, even typical headless CMS systems, are conceived and built.</p>
<p>For now, there are however also limitations in Sanity: the company has yet to come up with interesting ways to enable translations between, say, audio and printed content, although that would appear to be a logical step for the company to take as it grows, given how many consumers already switch between different kinds of media formats.</p>
<p class="p4">“In an era of digital globalization, companies must rapidly deliver complex, multi-channel, and engaging digital experiences to reach customers wherever they are. This is forcing them to rethink the CMS. At the same time, developers are increasingly leading the adoption of new technologies and holding the keys to adapt effectively to this shift,” said Doug Pepper, general partner at ICONIQ Growth, who is joining the board with this round. “Sanity has created the hero product for building innovative product experiences, with an impressive developer-oriented approach to content delivery and a personalized product experience that breaks down silos for content creators, marketing and developer teams. We&#8217;re excited to support the Sanity team as they enter this next phase of growth.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[News that the firm is making $2.2 billion in capital available for crypto projects is driving this morning's headlines, but the dollar figure should not be a surprise.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The big news in tech this morning is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">new a16z cryptocurrency-focused fund</a> totaling some $2.2 billion. The new investment vehicle is worth around four times what the company&#8217;s preceding crypto fund &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/andreessen-horowitz-just-closed-its-second-crypto-fund/">its second</a> &#8212; was worth.</p>
<p>Andreessen&#8217;s wager on cryptocurrency is only accelerating over time as the investing house raises larger funds focused on the market with less time between them.</p>

<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why a16z is so enthused about the crypto market; its investments into trading house Coinbase paid off handsomely this year when the unicorn direct listed at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">huge valuation premium</a> to its previous worth. Why not put more capital into a startup cohort that was recently immensely lucrative?</p>

We can tell that much from the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/06/24/crypto-fund-iii/">short post</a> announcing its new fund. Mix in a recent interview with a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen concerning the American regulatory environment, and we can understand that the firm is not simply planning a flurry of new deals.</p>
<h2>Defending the future of crypto</h2>
<p>The headline figure of $2.2 billion in capital available for crypto projects is driving headlines this morning, but the dollar figure should not be a surprise. There&#8217;s essentially infinite money in the market for name-brand venture capital firms today, it appears, and with a16z&#8217;s recent Coinbase win, I doubt it was monstrously difficult for the firm to compile a new, larger crypto-focused vehicle.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deliver code ever faster, they need tooling to provide some semblance of control and governance over the cloud resources being used to deliver it. <a href="https://www.env0.com/">Env0</a>, a startup that is helping companies do just that, announced a $17 million Series A today.</p>
<p>M12, Microsoft’s Venture Fund, led the round with participation from previous investors Boldstart Ventures, Grove Ventures and Crescendo Ventures. The company received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/">a $3.3 million seed round</a>, which we covered, last April and a previously unannounced $3.5 million add-on last summer. Today&#8217;s round brings the total raised to $23.8 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service helps companies control cloud costs, while giving developers the ability to deploy to the cloud with cost limits. It also provides a level of governance for code as it moves through the development cycle to deployment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When we spoke to the company last April<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/env0-announces-3-3m-seed-to-bring-more-control-to-infrastructure-as-code/"> around its seed round</a>, the company&#8217;s product was just entering beta. It has been generally available for about 4 months now and they&#8217;ve built out a lot of functionality since then, according to company co-founder and CEO Ohad Maislish.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time we spoke we were just focussed on manual self service and empowering developers in non production environments. Now with infrastructure as code automation and teams and governance, we basically manage all of the cloud deployments for our customers,&#8221; Maislish explained.</p>
<p>Since going generally available with the product this year, he reports the company now has dozens of paying customers and is generating revenue. Customers includes JFrog, Varonis and BigID.</p>
<p>The startup has also grown from just 7 employees in April 2020 to 17 today with plans to reach 50 in the next 18 months it begins putting the new capital to work. He says that bringing in a diverse group of workers should help his company grow and bring different ways of solving problems. &#8220;I think that bringing people with different cultures, different backgrounds, is key in that they will bring [different ways of thinking].&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, the company is based in Israel with plans to open offices in the U.S.. Mailslish says that his plans to move to California were put on hold by the pandemic, but he hopes to open an office in Sunnyvale in the fall.</p>
<p>The Israeli office is a minimum of two days in the office, three days at home or whatever combination employees wish. He says that he plans to hire people in the U.S. office as he establishes himself there and some of those employees can be remote if it makes sense for the role.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The business operation automation startup's CEO says the new capital will give it the space it needs to hire and build faster than if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business operation automation startup <a href="https://tonkean.com/">Tonkean</a> announced this morning that it closed a $50 million Series B round of capital. Accel led the round, which came just over a year after the startup <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tonkean-closes-24m-series-a-to-automate-operations/">raised a $24 million Series A</a>. Lightspeed Ventures, which led the company&#8217;s preceding venture capital round, also participated in its new funding event.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/esbsagi?lang=en">Sagi Eliyahu</a>, Tonkean&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview that his company&#8217;s valuation rose by around 4x in its latest funding round.</p>
<p>The startup was able to secure more capital at a higher price thanks in part to quick growth in 2020, which Eliyahu said was concentrated in the second half of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tonkean is an interesting mix of business process automation, no-code and humans. In short, the startup allows a company&#8217;s ops groups &#8212; sales ops, marketing ops, etc. &#8212; to set up automated business logic across applications that can include human-in-the-loop elements. And Tonkean built its system to be IT-friendly, allowing it to support enterprise-scale customers.</p>
<p>The automation space has been broadly hot in recent quarters. Robotic process automation (RPA) is great for mechanizing repetitive tasks that waste human time. The method of using computers to do stuff that humans previously had to do by clicking far too much has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">proven to be big business</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TrnbToiERV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/embed/#?secret=TrnbToiERV" data-secret="TrnbToiERV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonkean allows for something a bit different. An example may help: During our interview, Eliyahu mused about what might happen if a salesperson for a Tonkean client wanted to send a lead into a nurture campaign. Tonkean would let the sales ops team set up logic so that when the frontline salesperson selects the lead for a nurture effort inside their CRM, the lead would then automatically be added to a specific Marketo campaign. Furthermore, the click-to-nurture system would alert a human on the sales team, perhaps asking for approval of the decision.</p>
<p>Tonkean software employs no-code tools to let ops groups use off-the-shelf command modules to build business logic &#8212; or craft their own as needed. The use of the company&#8217;s software could allow for more empowered teams at companies that are less reliant on engineering groups for help in accelerating and automating their work.</p>
<p>That thematically fits inside the general narrative we&#8217;ve seen from no-code startups in general: They want to allow non-technical folks to have more control of their work through less reliance on technical teams at their place of employment.</p>
<p>Tonkean employs around 60 people today, up from around 15 folks at the time of its Series A. It plans to hire rapidly now that it has more capital. Eliyahu claims most of its Series A is still in the bank. So why did it raise?</p>
<p>Because Eliyahu considers his startup&#8217;s market to be so large that he wants to pull the company&#8217;s future closer to today; the new capital will give Tonkean the space it needs to hire more rapidly and build more quickly than it might have if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case.</p>
<p>Fifty million dollars is a lot of money. Let&#8217;s see how far it gets Tonkean. The next time we talk to the company, we&#8217;ll demand some harder growth metrics so we can see if the additional capital was the accelerant that the company hopes it will be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update:</strong> Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/">now confirmed</a> the delay, writing in a blog post that its engagement with UK regulators over the so-called &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; means support for tracking cookies won&#8217;t start being phased out in Chrome until the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;We plan to continue to work with the web community to create more private approaches to key areas, including ad measurement, delivering relevant ads and content, and fraud detection,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Today, Chrome and others have offered more than 30 proposals, and four of those proposals are available in origin trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Chrome, specifically, our goal is to have the key technologies deployed by late 2022 for the developer community to start adopting them. Subject to our engagement with the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and in line with the <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/our-commitments-privacy-sandbox/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29&quot;}">commitments</a> we have offered, Chrome could then phase out third-party cookies over a three month period, starting in mid-2023 and ending in late 2023.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The delay gives the adtech industry more time to adapt to a post-tracking-cookie online realm &#8212; assuming the CMA is happy to let Google go ahead with the major retooling.</p>
<p>The losers, meanwhile, are Internet users &#8212; who will continue to be subject to third party tracking for years longer at least (or, well, Chrome users will; other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">privacy-centric web browsers are available</a>).</p>
<p><em>Our original report follows below&#8230; </em></p>
<p>Adtech giant Google appears to be leaning toward postponing a long planned deprecation of third party tracking cookies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">plan dates back to 2019</a> when it <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html">announced</a> the <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/">long-term initiative</a> that will make it harder for online marketers and advertisers to track web users, including by deprecating third party cookies in Chrome.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">January 2020</a> it said it would make the switch within two years. Which would mean by 2022.</p>

<p>Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it has a Privacy Sandbox announcement incoming today &#8212; set for 4pm BST/5pm CET &#8212; after we contacted it to ask for confirmation of information we&#8217;d heard, via our own sources.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been told Google&#8217;s new official timeline for implementation will be 2023.</p>
<p>However a spokesman for the tech giant danced around providing a direct confirmation &#8212; saying that &#8220;an update&#8221; is incoming shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have an announcement today that will shed some light on Privacy Sandbox updates,&#8221; the spokesman also told us.</p>
<p>He had responded to our initial email &#8212; which had asked Google to confirm that it will postpone the implementation of Privacy Sandbox to 2023; and for any statement on the delay &#8212; with an affirmation (&#8220;yep&#8221;) so, well, a delay looks likely. But we&#8217;ll see how exactly Google will spin that in a few minutes when it publishes the incoming Privacy Sandbox announcement.</p>
<p>Google has previously said it would deprecate support for third party cookies by 2022 &#8212; which naturally implies that the wider Privacy Sandbox stack of related adtech would also need to be in place by then.</p>
<p>Earlier this year it slightly hedged the 2022 timeline, saying in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">January</a> that any changes would not be made before 2022.</p>
<p>The issue for Google is that regulatory scrutiny of its plan has stepped up &#8212; following antitrust complaints from the adtech industry which faces huge changes to how it can track and target Internet users.</p>
<p>In Europe, the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority has been working with the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office to understand the competition and privacy implications of Google&#8217;s planned move. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">earlier this month</a>, the CMA issued a notification of intention to accept proposed commitments from Google that would enable the regulator to block any deprecation of cookies if it&#8217;s not happy it can be done in a way that&#8217;s good for competition and privacy.</p>
<p>At the time we asked Google how the CMA&#8217;s involvement might impact the Privacy Sandbox timeline but the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Increased regulatory oversight of Big Tech will have plenty of ramifications &#8212; most obviously it means the end of any chance for giants like Google to &#8216;move fast and break things&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JW Player</a>, a very early mover in the market for online video technology &#8212; it powered YouTube&#8217;s first video player, before Google acquired it and it built its own &#8212; has long been profitable through a business model of providing one-to-many video streaming tools to publishers and others that want to bring video into their own online experiences, without building the technology from the ground up, nor being beholden to companies that might themselves profit from the videos and the customer data that is generated through video views.</p>
<p>Now, after a year of strong growth on the back of the bigger boom in online video from Covid-19, the New York-based company is announcing a big funding round &#8212; $100 million &#8212; to expand its tech, and to be where it believes video is going next.</p>
<p>The capital is coming from a single investor, <a href="https://www.llrpartners.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLR Partners</a>, and while the JW Player&#8217;s valuation is not being disclosed, we understand it&#8217;s not quite yet at $1 billion, but fast approaching it. It comes on the heels of the company charting some massive growth, despite being a relatively quiet player in the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dave Otten, the CEO and co-founder of the company (which is named after another co-founder, Jeroen Wijering, who developed the initial technology), told TechCrunch in an interview that the company&#8217;s video streaming traffic by nearly 200% over the last year, with live streaming growing 400% in that period.</p>
<p>There are now over 600,000 applications and sites running video powered by JW Player, with about 10,000 of those premium users; the rest use its software for free, Otten said.</p>
<p>This is enough of a balance that the company has been profitable for a number of years, he said. And in cases where the software is being used for free, JW Player is getting &#8220;paid&#8221; in a  Some of the many customers using its tools include Sesame Street, TIME, Hearst, Insider, IMDB and the Chelsea Football Club.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2169713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?w=566" alt="" width="566" height="424" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png 566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image2-3.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long way away from JW&#8217;s early days powering YouTube &#8212; screen shot of how it looked above &#8212; but contrary to so many examples of early movers being some of the slowest to innovate later on, JW is hoping that the fact that it was a first mover in video does not mean it will be the last to anticipate what is coming in the future.</p>
<p>The current product challenge for JW Player mirrors that of its customers: monetization.</p>
<p>Just as companies have increasingly started to create paywalls around their written content, they are looking to do the same for their video catalogues, too, and JW Player wants to be their partner for this. That will include more investments into subscription services, as well as a a new set of tools for personalizing videos and providing advertising opportunities by way of the extensive data that it has amassed and continues to gather about video usage.</p>
<p>The company has a strong card to play in its hand for the latter business: those who use the free version of JW Player &#8220;pay&#8221; the company by way of helping it gather lots of insights into how videos are watched.</p>
<p>Another area that the company will be doing more is in the area of live and on-demand video. In May, it acquired Vualto, a UK-based specialist in these areas that also builds DRM solutions, which it has already integrated into its platform.</p>
<p>Video now accounts for a whopping 80% of all online traffic, with people typically spending more than two hours days watching it. While some of that is inevitably going big platforms like YouTube, Facebook, social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, there remains a big opportunity for others, aided by the likes of JW, to carve out spaces for themselves in the mix.</p>
<p>“JW Player has been at the forefront of digital video innovation ever since founder Jeroen Wijering created YouTube’s original video player in 2008. Today, the company offers the most comprehensive technology, advertising and data analytics platform in the digital video ecosystem,” said David Reuter, Partner at LLR Partners, in a statement. “We look forward to partnering with the JW Player team as they expand their platform and continue to elevate the way brands can host, stream and monetize video.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric propulsion developer Orbion Space Technology has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round, which it says it will use to scale production capacity of its Aurora propulsion system.</p>
<p>The Michigan-based startup manufactures Hall effect plasma thrusters for use in small and cube satellites. Thrusters are used throughout the lifespan of a satellite (or any object in space that needs to maintain its orbit, like the space station) to adjust orbital altitude, avoid collisions, and de-orbit the craft once it has reached the end of its useful life. Hall thrusters use a magnetic field to ionize a propellant and produce plasma.</p>
<p>While they have long been used in space, this type of thruster has mostly been too expensive for small satellite operators. <a href="https://orbionspace.com/">Orbion</a> says it has created a cost-effective production capacity to meet the growing demand of startups and developers launching to low Earth orbit. Orbion CEO Brad King said in a statement that the company considered contract manufacturers but ultimately chose a vertically integrated manufacturing model. Now, the company says it has outgrown its existing manufacturing space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is facing “unprecedented market demand” for its Aurora system, King said. With the boom of the so-called new space economy, driven in part by the decreased costs of processors, components and even launch, it’s no surprise that there’s been a concurrent uptick in demand for efficient in-space propulsion systems.</p>

<p>The company had previously raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/orbion-raises-9-2m-to-mass-produce-plasma-thrusters-for-small-satellites/">$9.2 million Series A</a> in August 2019. Since that time, the company secured a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/orbion-partners-with-u-s-department-of-defence-on-small-satellite-propulsion-tech/">research partnership</a> with the U.S. Department of Defense that’s testing the resiliency of American space systems. Orbion also landed a contract with satellite manufacturer Blue Canyon Technologies last September.</p>
<p>This most recent funding round was led by the US-India VC firm Inventus Capital Partners, with additional participation from Material Impact, Beringea and Wakestream Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The space game is changing,” Inventus Capital Partners investor Kanwal Rekhi said in a statement. “Large satellites are being replaced by a multitude of nano-satellites; just like the PCs replaced mainframes. Orbion is providing these nano-satellites maneuverability to get into more precise orbits and stay there longer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars and Luminar Technologies are beefing up their partnership. The two companies said Thursday that Luminar’s autonomous driving stack – a combination of hardware and software that includes lidar sensors and a proprietary perception system – will be standard on Volvo’s forthcoming flagship electric SUV.</p>
<p>Luminar had previously announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/volvo-to-use-luminars-lidar-in-production-vehicles-to-unlock-automated-driving-on-highways/">the production deal with Volvo last May</a>. But at that time, Luminar’s stack was going to be optional on the flagship vehicle — an upgrade that would add on cost. Now, it will be built into each vehicle as a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, customers will still have to pay if they want to take advantage of the Highway Pilot functionality. That capability, which will be available only when the vehicle is driving on a highway, puts the driver out of the loop — they won’t even have to actively monitor the vehicle, as is common in some systems already on the road today, a source familiar with the technology told TechCrunch. It’s the highest capability of autonomy that the system offers, and if customers want it, they will have to pay for it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That functionality will be activated wirelessly when the conditions are verified to be safe, Luminar said in a news release. What customers won’t have to pay for is a suite of safety capabilities, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping, that target the most common cause of car accidents.</p>
<p>The deal is undoubtedly a major boon for Luminar. In addition to higher production volumes, the company will also benefit from the many thousands of driving miles its system will be exposed to — valuable data that it can feed back into its autonomous driving stack. The system will also be capable of wireless over-the-air updates, so drivers should benefit as it grows &#8216;smarter&#8217; over time.</p>
<p>Volvo did not reveal how much the Highway Pilot add-on will cost, nor whether it will be available in a subscription model or as a one-time purchase. But the carmaker did say that all vehicles will be “hardware ready” for unsupervised autonomous driving once it&#8217;s available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of startups were built to help people make all-cash offers on homes with the purpose of gaining an edge against other buyers, especially in ultra-competitive markets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://accept.inc/">Accepti.inc</a> is a Denver-based company that is attempting to create a new category in real estate technology. To help scale its digital mortgage lending platform, the company announced today that it has secured $90 million in debt and equity – with $78 million in debt and $12 million in equity. SignalFire led the equity portion of its financing, which also included participation from existing seed investors Y Combinator and DN Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept.inc describes itself as an iLender, or a “technology-enabled lender” that gives people a way to submit all-cash offers on a home upon qualifying for a mortgage.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using its platform, a buyer gets qualified first and then can start looking for homes that fall at or under the amount he or she is approved for. They can purchase a more expensive home, but any amount above what they are approved for would have to come out of pocket. Historically, most buyers don’t know that they will have to pay out of pocket until they’ve made an offer on a specific home and an appraisal comes under the amount of the price they are paying for a home. In those cases, the buyer has to cough up the difference out of pocket. With Accept.inc., its execs tout, buyers know upfront how much they are approved for and can spend on a new home “so there are no surprises later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SignalFire Founding Partner and CTO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilya Kirnos describes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept.inc as “the first and only iLender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He points out that since it is a lender, Accept.inc doesn’t make its money by charging buyers fees like some others in the all-cash offer space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike ‘iBuyers’ or ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/homeward-secures-371m-to-help-people-make-all-cash-offers-on-homes/">alternative iBuyers</a>,’ Accept.inc fronts the cash to buy a house and then makes money off mortgage origination and title, meaning sellers, homebuyers and their agents pay no additional cost for the service,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBuyers instead buy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> homes from sellers who signed up online, make a profit by often fixing up and selling those homes and then helping people purchase a different home with all cash. They also make money by charging transaction fees. A slew of companies operate in the space including established players such as <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/guides/what-is-an-ibuyer">Opendoor</a> and Zillow and newer players such as Homelight.</span></p>

Left to right: Co-founders Adam Pollack, Nick Friedman and Ian Perrex.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2016 inception, Accept.inc says it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped thousands of buyers, agents and sellers close on “hundreds of millions of dollars” in homes. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw ”14x” growth in 2020 and from June 2020 to June 2021, it achieved “10x” growth in terms of the size of its team and number of transactions and revenue, according to CEO and co-founder Adam Pollack. Accept.inc wants to use its new capital to build on that momentum and meet demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollack and Nick Friedman met while in college</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and started building Accept.inc with the goal of &#8220;turning every offer into a cash offer.&#8221; The pair essentially “failed for two years,” half-jokes Pollack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically became an encyclopedia of 1,000 ways the idea of helping people make all-cash offers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> work,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team went through Y Combinator in the winter of 2019 and that’s when they created the iLender concept. In the iLender model, the company uses its cash to buy a house for buyers. Once the loan with Accept.inc is ready to close, the company sells back the house to the buyer “at no additional cost or fees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically what we learned through those two years is that you have to vertically integrate all of your core competencies, and you can&#8217;t rely on third parties to own or manage your special sauce for you,” Pollack told TechCrunch. “We also realized that if you&#8217;re going to build a cash offer for anyone who could afford a mortgage, you’ve got to make it a full bona fide cash offer that closes in three days as opposed to a better version of what existed. And you have to own that, and take the risk that comes with it and be comfortable with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of their model, the pair say, is that buyers get to be cash buyers, sellers can close in as little as 72 hours, and agents “get a guaranteed commission check.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is that everyone should have an equal chance at homeownership,” Friedman said. “We not only want to level the playing field, we want to create a new standard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers using Accept.inc win 6-7 times more frequently, the company claims. With its new capital, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to double its team to 90 and enter new markets outside of its home base of Denver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SignalFire Partner Chris Scoggins believes that Accept.inc is different from other lenders in that its focus is on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “winning the home, not just servicing the loan, with a business model that’s 10x more capital-efficient than other players in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is driven&#8230;to level the playing field for homebuyers who today lose out against all-cash offers from home-flippers and wealthy individuals,” he added. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see an enormous opportunity for Accept.inc to become the backbone of the future of mortgage lending.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no surprise that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we shop, especially when it comes to groceries. Grocery delivery apps experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/grocery-delivery-apps-see-record-downloads-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">a record number of downloads</a> in March 2020, and by the following month, Walmart Grocery (which is now integrated into the Walmart app) surpassed Amazon as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/walmart-grocery-app-sees-record-downloads-amid-covid-19-surpasses-amazon-by-20/">No. 1 shopping app</a> on both Google Play and the App Store. But even as pandemic restrictions have eased, consumers are still using ordering groceries for delivery or pickup <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/11/four-ways-consumer-spending-will-change-once-people-are-vaccinated.html">more frequently</a> than they were pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>As Walmart&#8217;s grocery delivery services have continued to boom, posing competition to companies like Amazon and Instacart, the tech that Walmart uses has expanded too. Today, Walmart shared information about how it&#8217;s training its AI to make smarter substitutions in online grocery orders.</p>
<p>Bringing this technology to grocery delivery isn&#8217;t novel by any means. Last May, Walmart reported how it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/walmart-is-piloting-a-pricier-2-hour-express-grocery-delivery-service/">used to AI to determine eligibility</a> for its Express delivery service, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/walmart-is-piloting-a-pricier-2-hour-express-grocery-delivery-service/">brand new</a> at the time. A year into the United States&#8217; coronavirus outbreak, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/the-algorithms-that-make-instacart-roll">Instacart engineers reported</a> that they crunched &#8220;petabytes daily to predict what will be on grocery shelves and even how long it will take to find parking.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what makes Walmart&#8217;s AI for grocery substitutions unique? According to Srini Venkatesan, an Executive Vice President at Walmart Global Tech, it&#8217;s the sheer quantity of data that Walmart can use to teach its AI. Over 200 million people shop at Walmart in-store and online each week for more than 150,000 different grocery products. The AI uses that data to predict consumer behavior, preferences, and needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tech we built uses deep learning AI to consider hundreds of variables &#8212; size, type, brand, price, aggregate shopper data, individual customer preference, current inventory and more &#8212; in real time to determine the best next available item,&#8221; explained Venkatesan. &#8220;It then preemptively asks the customer to approve the substituted item or let us know they don’t want it, an important signal that’s fed back into our learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of future recommendations.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169273" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169273" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2169273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png 1910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=1536,851 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-10.53.02-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2169273" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Rather than asking a Personal Shopper to make a quick decision about how to substitute for cherry yogurt (do you get a different flavor from the same brand, the same flavor from a more expensive brand, and so on), the AI makes that choice for them. Walmart started developing this algorithm last year, and in the time since, customer acceptance of substitutions has improved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were at about 90% before this algorithm rolled out,&#8221; said Venkatesan. &#8220;We are now around 97% to 98%.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last year, Walmart doubled its number of Personal Shoppers to over 170,000 workers. About 3,750 stores are enabled for order pickup, and 3,000 stores are enabled for delivery, which covers 68% of the population. Earlier this year, Walmart <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/walmart-drops-the-35-order-minimum-on-its-2-hour-express-delivery-service/">dropped the $35 order minimum</a> on its Express delivery service, a competitor to Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://primenow.amazon.com/">Prime Now</a>.</p>
