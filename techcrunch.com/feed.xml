</div><p id="speakable-summary">While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on countless businesses across the globe, the $118 billion gaming industry not only survived, it thrived, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us">55%</a> of American consumers turning to gaming for entertainment, stress relief, relaxation and a connection to the outside world amid lockdowns.</p>
<p>This drove a 20% boost in gaming sales globally and created nearly 20,000 jobs in 2020 alone. And it’s not expected to stop any time soon: According to research company <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/video-games-industry/">IBISWorld</a>, the industry is set to grow again in 2021, adding to the year-over-year growth the industry has seen in the preceding half-decade.</p>
<p>This is great news for the growing gaming industry and especially those looking to score a job at a company developing the next blockbuster. The unemployment rate is <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/employment/video-games-united-states/">already near zero</a> for those with gaming development and design skills, which means there is an unprecedented opportunity to join the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Gamesmith, a digital community dedicated to the gaming industry, currently has more than 5,750 open jobs posted on its site, with roles in design, engineering and animation leading the way. In other words, if you never considered a career in the gaming industry &#8212; or thought that your skill set wouldn’t translate &#8212; this expanding job market needs employees from all types of backgrounds. Chances are one of your interests &#8212; besides gaming, of course &#8212; can act as a conduit into finding a career.</p>
<p>One career path for those with art skills &#8212; particularly with a talent for digital art tools like Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop &#8212; is animation. An animator can do any number of jobs at a gaming company or studio, from building immersive landscapes and cities to modeling what a certain character will look like to designing user interfaces and navigational components. There is significant growth here, too: According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005429/en/Global-Animation-VFX-Video-Games-Market-Report-2021-Strategies-Trends-Opportunities-2020-2025---ResearchAndMarkets.com">recent study</a>, most sectors of the animation industry are growing 2% to 3% year over year. According to Gamesmith, the average 30-year-old female artist or animator makes a salary of just under $90,000 a year.</p>
<p>If you’re a whiz with words and witty dialogue, then you might consider applying for a job as a writer at a studio. Writers are responsible for writing everything from the profanity-laced shouts heard in the background in the Grand Theft Auto series to the long speeches in epic adventures like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Employers are looking for writers with a flair for crafting stories and understanding characters, so even if you’re not a career writer, highlight the work you’ve done that fits in the mold of what game publishers are looking for.</p>
<p>One of the most important segments of the industry &#8212; and one of the fastest-growing &#8212; is developing and designing the gaming experiences themselves. The job market for these roles is predicted to grow by 9.3% between 2016 and 2026, <a href="https://www.neit.edu/blog/video-game-designer-job-outlook#:~:text=Video%20Game%20Designing%20is%20one,9.3%25%20between%202016%20and%202026.">according to the New England Institute of Technology</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> and the breadth of jobs in this wing of the industry range from level designers to lead designer and developers.</p>
<p>Gamesmith calculated that these jobs account for 16% of the available openings, but make up only 5% of all applications. While you will need at least a computer science degree and an understanding of the fundamentals of programming to land one of these jobs, the payoff for the time spent hitting the books is worth it. Gamesmith estimates that the average 28-year-old male engineer earns a salary north of $100,000.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have any of these skills to help design a game from the ground up, there are still plenty of ways to break into the industry. No matter how good a game is, it will only be a success if people know about it, so the marketing and promotions teams at studios play a crucial role in making sure that consumers purchase the latest release and that it gets written about. If you have great communication skills and can work through people’s problems, companies always need customer service representatives.</p>
<p>Across all sectors of the gaming world, companies are looking to diversify their workforce and move away from an image as a job sector solely populated by white men in their early to mid-30s. Gamesmith research found that currently 74% of the industry’s workforce is male and 64% is white.</p>
<p>But that is changing. While in 2020, only 24% of studios invested moderate resources into diversity initiatives, out of those studios that did invest those resources, 96% reported at least moderately successful results and improvements to company culture. It may seem slow, but there does seem to be a recognition that the gaming industry needs a more diverse workforce as a way not just to bring more equity to their offices, but to make better games in the future and make the industry look more like the people who play games.</p>
<p>“Diversity isn’t a nicety; it’s a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people who play games every day in this country,” said Jo Twist, the CEO of the U.K.-based gaming trade association Ukie. “A diverse industry that draws on myriad cultures, lifestyles and experiences will lead to more creative and inclusive games that capture the imagination of players and drive our sector forward.”</p>
<p>Between the push to diversify the industry and a slew of new opportunities in the field, the key takeaway is that there are a wide range of possible careers in the industry and, even if you don’t think they do, your skills probably translate into one of the many roles that a gaming company needs to fill. Avid gamers know that you’re not going to beat a game the first time you turn on your console. So hone your skills, build up your experience and continue your quest to land a job in the industry of your dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last call, y’all. Today’s the final day to keep more money in your pocket and still enjoy three opportunity-packed days at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. Our super early-bird price — $99 — disappears <strong>tonight, May 14 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Get your click on, avoid the price hike and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass right here, right now</a>. Unless, of course, you enjoy paying more than necessary. Hey, we don’t judge.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about just some of the reasons why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TC Disrupt</a> ranks as the must-attend event for anyone within the early-stage startup ecosystem. Connection is key to growth, and you’ll connect with thousands of attendees from around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An all-virtual Disrupt means you can build relationships and collaborate with Silicon Valley movers and shakers no matter where Google Map pins you. And you never know where in the world you might find the perfect partner or eager investor.</p>
<p>Networking at Disrupt is practically an Olympic sport, and now you have two ways to make those vital connections. First up, here’s what Ada Lau, the manager of market development at Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, had to say about networking on the fly.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The virtual platform’s chat feature made it easy to connect with participants. People got creative using it to promote their business, like posting a LinkedIn profile or offering 15-minute time slots to review business pitches. I even saw a product-naming competition. You could find lots of opportunity rolling through the chat area.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to target people based on shared business goals, you’ll love CrunchMatch, our AI-powered platform. Answer a few quick questions during registration, and you can schedule one-on-one meetings with the people who can help you move forward — pitch investors, demo products, interview tech talent, build important relationships.</p>
<p>Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, shared this about her networking experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;CrunchMatch made networking easy. We sent quick introductions, scheduled meetings with investors and other smart people who could add value to our company. A person we connected with at Disrupt is currently helping us with marketing, which is fantastic.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond networking, you’ll find plenty of possibilities in our expo area. Hundreds of early-stage startups in the Startup Alley ready to showcase their tech products, services and platforms.</p>
<p>You won’t want to miss any of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">incredible speakers</a>, interviews, presentations and panel discussions — and thanks to the combination of live-streaming and video-on-demand with your complementary 3-month Extra Crunch membership, you can catch them all at your convenience.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23, but today is the last day you can attend all three days for less than $100. Don’t miss out on serious savings. Stop what you’re doing right now and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">buy your pass your TC Disrupt 2021</a>. The deadline expires tonight, <strong>May 14 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Similar to how telehealth faced declines as patients returned to in-person care, edtech will face similar drops as schools become a safer option for students and teachers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years in the backwaters of venture capital, edtech had a booming 2020. Not only did its products become must-haves after schools around the globe went remote, but investors also poured capital into leading projects. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/how-is-edtech-spending-its-extra-capital/">There was even some exit activity</a>, with well-known edtech players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/5-takeaways-from-the-coursera-ipo-filing/">Coursera going public</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>But despite a rush of private capital &#8212; which has continued into this year, as we’ll demonstrate &#8212; edtech stocks have taken a hammering in recent weeks. So while venture capitalists and other startup investors are pumping more capital into the space in hopes of future outsize returns, the stock market is signaling that things might be heading in the other direction.</p>
<p>Who’s right? One investor that The Exchange spoke to noted that market turbulence is just that, and that he’s tuning into activity but not yet changing his investment strategy. At the same time, the recent volatility is worth tracking in case it&#8217;s a preview of edtech&#8217;s slowdown.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the changing value of edtech stocks in recent months, parse some preliminary data via <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> that provides a good feel for the directional momentum of edtech venture capital, and try to see if there’s irrational exuberance among private investors.</p>
<p>You could argue that it’s public investors who are suffering from irrational pessimism and that private-market investors have the right to it. But since public markets price private markets, we tend to listen to them. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>Falling shares</h2>
<p>We’re sure that you want to get into the private-market data, so we’ll be brief in describing the public-market carnage. What follows is a digest of edtech stocks and their declines from recent highs:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Compared to its 52-week high, <strong>Chegg</strong> stock has lost over a third of its value.</li>
<li aria-level="1">After reaching $62.53 per share in April, <strong>Coursera</strong> has shed about half of its value and is trading close to its $33 IPO price.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>2U</strong> closed at $33.92 per share yesterday, its shares also losing half of their value compared to their 52-week high.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Staying on that theme, <strong>Stride</strong> (K12) closed at $26.77 per share yesterday, which is about half of its 52-week high.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://cisco.com">Cisco</a> has been busy on the acquisition front this week, and today the company announced it was buying threat assessment platform <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/">Kenna Security</a>, the third company it has purchased this week. The two companies did not disclose the purchase price.</p>
<p>With Kenna, Cisco gets a startup that uses machine learning to sort through the massive pile of threat data that comes into a security system on a daily basis and prioritizes the threats most likely to do the most damage. That could be a very useful tool these days when threats abound and it&#8217;s not always easy to know where to put your limited security resources. Cisco plans to take that technology and integrate into its SecureX platform.</p>
<p>Gee Rittenhouse, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco’s Security Business Group <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/news/364250">wrote in a blog post</a> announcing the deal with Kenna, that his company is getting a product that brings together Cisco&#8217;s existing threat management capabilities with Kenna&#8217;s risk-based vulnerability management skills.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is why we are pleased to announce our intent to acquire Kenna Security, Inc., a recognized leader in risk-based vulnerability prioritization with over 14 million assets protected and over 12.7 billion managed vulnerabilities. Using data science and real-world threat intelligence, it has a proven ability to bring data in from a multi-vendor environment and provide a comprehensive view of IT vulnerability risk,&#8221; Rittenhouse wrote in the blog post.</p>

<p>The security sphere has been complex for a long time, but with employees moving to work from home because of COVID, it became even more pronounced in the last year. In a world where the threat landscape changes quickly, having a tool that prioritizes what to look at first in its arsenal could be very useful.</p>
<p>Kenna Security CEO Karim Toubba gave a typical executive argument for being acquired: it gives him a much bigger market under Cisco than his company could have built alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our opportunity to change the industry: once the acquisition is complete, we will be one step closer to delivering Kenna’s pioneering Risk-Based Vulnerability Management (RBVM) platform to the more than 7,000 customers using Cisco SecureX today. This single action exponentially increases the impact Kenna’s technology will have on the way the world secures networks, endpoints and infrastructures.,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/blog/evolving-vulnerability-management-cisco-announces-intent-to-acquire-kenna-security/">in the company blog</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which launched in 2010, claims to be the pioneer in the RBVM space. It raised over $98 million on a $320 million post-money valuation, according to Pitchbook data. Customers include HSBC, Royal Bank of Canada, Mattel and Quest Diagnostics.</p>
<p>For those customers, the product will cease to be stand-alone at some point as the companies work together to integrate Kenna technology into the SecureX platform. When that is complete, the stand-alone customers will have to purchase the Cisco solution to continue using the Kenna tech.</p>
<p>Cisco has had a busy week on the acquisition front. It announced its intent to acquire <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/corporate-strategy-office/acquisitions/sedona-systems.html">Sedona Systems</a> on Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/cisco-to-acquire-indy-startup-socio-to-bring-hybrid-events-to-webex/">Socio Labs on Wednesday</a> and this announcement today. That&#8217;s a lot of activity for any company in a single week. The deal is expected to close in Cisco Q4 FY 2021. The company&#8217;s 170 employees will be joining the Security Business Group led by Rittenhouse.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The fully-vaxxed and officially fully-immune took over the podcast this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> co-hosting the show while the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> is out from Shot #2. <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris, </a>as always, were behind the scenes making sure we sound pretty and don&#8217;t fall down too many punny board game rabbit holes after vacation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown of what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/05/13/tesla-and-ethereum-billionaires-spark-shock-300-billion-crypto-price-crash-as-bitcoin-and-dogecoin-suddenly-plummet/?sh=35c7582f34f6">Crypto crashed &#8211;</a>  thanks to either<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/elon-musk-bitcoin-crash-tesla-cryptocurrency-b1846650.html"> Elon</a> or the guy who created Ethereum and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/vitalik-buterin-donates-1-billion-worth-of-meme-coins-to-india-covid-relief-fund/">donated some to relief efforts for COVID-19.  </a>We debated how signal gets lost and rediscovered and lost again in this news cycle, and what that means for anyone in tech trying to get a pulse of. what&#8217;s actually happening.</li>
<li>One symptom of market craze and disconnected booms? A startup named <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/is-buying-and-selling-short-positions-in-private-companies-next-this-fintech-startup-is-banking-on-it/">Caplight that wants more people to buy and sell short positions on private startups. </a></li>
<li>We then pivoted into the last bit of our &#8216;The World Is Melting&#8217; section to talk about home ownership and the slow stink of real estate stocks right now.

<li>A mention of SPACs obviously opened up a can of worms, or should I say, oasis of woods.</li>
<li>The world might be melting, but Softbank could be having the last word. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/softbank-joins-top-corporate-earners-with-its-37-billion-vision-fund-profit.html">The Japanese conglomerate shut us up</a> with its recent profits &#8211; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">proving Danny&#8217;s point in an old EC piece</a><em> (use code EQUITY for a discount).</em></li>
<li>We switched gears and talked about a neat new $20 million fund coming out of the Midwest, Sixty8 Capital, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannegarrett/2021/05/10/the-talent-is-here-black-women-led-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-first-20-million-fund-to-invest-in-underrepresented-midwestern-founders/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">its plan to invest in underrepresented founders</a>.</li>
<li>The show ended as chaotically focused as it began with a round robin of the most interesting funding rounds of the last week, not limited to but including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/blind-raises-37m-to-double-down-on-workplace-gossip-and-career-advice/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Blind&#8217;s $37 million raise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-last-gameboard-raises-4m-to-ship-its-digital-tabletop-gaming-platform/">The Last Gameboard&#8217;s $4 million check</a>, <a href="https://www.insider.com/just-womens-sports-funding-wnba-uswnt-stars-kevin-durant-2021-5">Just Women&#8217;s Sports</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/morressier-wants-academic-conferences-to-feel-cutting-edge/">Morressier&#8217;s $18 million Series A.   </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While modern machine learning systems act with a semblance of artificial intelligence, the truth is they don&#8217;t &#8220;understand&#8221; any of the data they work with — which in turn means they tend to store even trivial items forever. Facebook researchers have proposed <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-how-to-forget-at-scale">structured forgetfulness</a> as a way for AI to clear the decks a bit, improving their performance and inching that much closer to how a human mind works.</p>
<p>The researchers describe the problem by explaining how humans and AI agents might approach a similar problem.</p>
<p>Say there are ten doors of various colors. You&#8217;re asked to go through the yellow one, you do so and then a few minutes later have forgotten the colors of the other doors — because it was never important that two were red, one plaid, two walnut, etc, only that they weren&#8217;t yellow and that the one you chose was. Your brain discarded that information almost immediately.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But an AI might very well have kept the colors and locations of the other nine doors in its memory. That&#8217;s because it doesn&#8217;t understand the problem or the data intuitively — so it keeps all the information it used to make its decision.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an issue when you&#8217;re talking about relatively small amounts of data, but machine learning algorithms, especially during training, now routinely handle millions of data points and ingest terabytes of imagery or language. And because they&#8217;re built to constantly compare new data with their accrued knowledge, failing to forget unimportant things means they&#8217;re bogged down by constant references to pointless or outdated data points.</p>
<p>The solution hit upon by Facebook researchers is essentially — and wouldn&#8217;t we all like to have this ability — to tell itself how long it needs to remember a piece of data when it evaluates it to begin with.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151984" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151984" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2151984" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/expirespan-1.gif" alt="Animation showing 'memories' of an AI disappearing." width="692" height="368" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151984" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Each individual memory is associated with a predicted expiration date, and the scale of the memory depends on the task,&#8221; explained Angela Fan, a Facebook AI researcher who <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/not-all-memories-are-created-equal">worked on the Expire-Span paper</a>. &#8220;The amount of time memories are held depends on the needs of the task—it can be for a few steps or until the task is complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in the case of the doors, the colors of the non-yellow doors are plenty important until you find the yellow one. At that point it&#8217;s safe to forget the rest, though of course depending on how many other doors need to be checked, the memory could be held for various amounts of time. (A more realistic example might be forgetting faces that aren&#8217;t the one the system is looking for, once it finds it.)</p>
<p>Analyzing a long piece of text, the memory of certain words or phrases might matter until the end of a sentence, a paragraph, or longer — it depends on whether the agent is trying to determine who&#8217;s speaking, what chapter the sentence belongs to, or what genre the story is.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/">Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Vision announces its low-latency AI processor for the edge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/deep-vision-announces-its-low-latency-ai-processor-for-the-edge/embed/#?secret=Le7rbbFP18" data-secret="Le7rbbFP18" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This improves performance because at the end, there&#8217;s simply less information for the model to sort through. Because the system doesn&#8217;t know whether the other doors might be important, that information is kept ready at hand, increasing the size and decreasing the speed of the model.</p>
<p>Fan said the models trained using Expire-Span performed better and were more efficient, taking up less memory and compute time. That&#8217;s important during training and testing, which can take up thousands of hours of processing, meaning even a small improvement is considerable, but also at the end user level, where the same task takes less power and happens faster. Suddenly performing an operation on a photo makes sense to do live rather than after the fact.</p>
<p>Though being able to forget does in some ways bring AI processes closer to human cognition, it&#8217;s still nowhere near the intuitive and subtle ways our minds operate. Of course, being able to pick what to remember and how long is a major advantage over those of us for whom those parameters are chosen seemingly randomly.</p>

<p>Peloton wasn&#8217;t the only at-home workout giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">exposing private account data</a>. Rival exercise giant Echelon also had a leaky API that let virtually anyone access riders&#8217; account information.</p>
<p>Fitness technology company Echelon, like Peloton, offers a range of workout hardware — bikes, rowers, and a treadmill — as a cheaper alternative for members to exercise at home. Its app also lets members join virtual classes without the need for workout equipment.</p>
<p>But Jan Masters, a security researcher at Pen Test Partners, found that Echelon&#8217;s API allowed him to access the account data — including name, city, age, sex, phone number, weight, birthday, and workout statistics and history — of any other member in a live or pre-recorded class. The API also disclosed some information about members&#8217; workout equipment, such as its serial number.</p>
<p>Masters, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">if you recall</a>, found a similar bug with Peloton&#8217;s API, which let him make unauthenticated requests and pull private user account data directly from Peloton&#8217;s servers without the server ever checking to make sure he (or anyone else) was allowed to request it.</p>
<p>Echelon&#8217;s API allows its members&#8217; devices and apps to talk with Echelon&#8217;s servers over the internet. The API was supposed to check if the member&#8217;s device was authorized to pull user data by checking for an authorization token. But Masters said the token wasn&#8217;t needed to request data.</p>
<p>Masters also found another bug that allowed members to pull data on any other member because of weak access controls on the API. Masters said this bug made it easy to enumerate user account IDs and scrape account data from Echelon&#8217;s servers. Facebook, LinkedIn, Peloton and Clubhouse have all <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/tour-de-peloton-exposed-user-data/?=050420210000">fallen victim to scraping attacks</a> that abuse access to APIs to pull in data about users on their platforms.</p>
<p>Ken Munro, founder of Pen Test Partners, disclosed the vulnerabilities to Echelon on January 20 in a Twitter direct message, since the company doesn&#8217;t have a public-facing vulnerability disclosure process (which it says is now &#8220;under review&#8221;). But the researchers did not hear back during the 90 days after the report was submitted, the standard amount of time security researchers give companies to fix flaws before their details are made public.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Echelon for comment, and was told that the security flaws identified by Masters — which <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/echelon-pii-leak-and-disclosure-fail/?=13052021000">he wrote up</a> in a blog post — were fixed in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hired an outside service to perform a penetration test of systems and identify vulnerabilities. We have taken appropriate actions to correct these, most of which were implemented by January 21, 2021. However, Echelon’s position is that the User ID is not PII [personally identifiable information,&#8221; said Chris Martin, Echelon&#8217;s chief information security officer, in an email.</p>
<p>Echelon did not name the outside security company but said while the company said it keeps detailed logs, it did not say if it had found any evidence of malicious exploitation.</p>
<p>But Munro disputed the company&#8217;s claim of when it fixed the vulnerabilities, and provided TechCrunch with evidence that one of the vulnerabilities was not fixed until at least mid-April, and another vulnerability could still be exploited as recently as this week.</p>
<p>When asked for clarity, Echelon did not address the discrepancies. &#8220;[The security flaws] have been remediated,&#8221; Martin reiterated.</p>
<p>Echelon also confirmed it fixed a bug that allowed users under the age of 13 to sign up. Many companies block access to children under the age of 13 to avoid complying with the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, a U.S. law that puts strict rules on what data companies can collect on children. TechCrunch was able to create an Echelon account this week with an age less than 13, despite the page saying: &#8220;Minimum age of use is 13 years old.&#8221;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One. That&#8217;s the number of African tech companies that have gone public on the NYSE in the last 10 years. Two, if you&#8217;re counting local exchanges. The former is African-focused e-commerce company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">Jumia</a> and the latter is Egyptian fintech company Fawry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a tech company, Fawry&#8217;s listing on the Egyptian Stock Exchange is a rarity. Typically, most exchanges in emerging markets like Africa, India, and Latin America are filled with traditional companies in age-old sectors like banking, telecoms, manufacturing, and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Fawry, what you see these days are new-age tech companies from these markets going public abroad, especially in the U.S. Due to the friendly nature of U.S. exchanges such as Nasdaq and the NYSE, and their history building up the FAANG and other multibillion-dollar companies, they have become the top destination for IPO-ready companies in emerging markets.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the U.S. IPO market was caught in a frenzy with a different way of going public: via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Although these acquisition vehicles have been around for quite some time, they&#8217;ve lacked the sensational attributes we&#8217;ve now become accustomed to. Public and influential entrepreneurs from Chamath Palihapitiya to Richard Branson have made sure that SPACs &#8212; which many have called a fad &#8212; are here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/beyond-the-fanfare-and-sec-warnings-spacs-are-here-to-stay/">issues with the SEC</a> as a liquidity option, SPACs have continued to remain popular for many companies because they have less completion time and regulatory hurdles than a traditional IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve covered a lot on this subject within the past year, and this</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does a good job explaining SPACs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. alone, there are <a href="https://stockmarketmba.com/listofshellcompanies.php#:~:text=List%20of%20Shell%20Companies%20or%20Special%20Purpose%20Acquisition%20Companies%20(',These%20securities%20are%20common%20stocks.">more than 300 SPACs</a>. Last year, more than 85% of deals completed were executed with companies in the country, per Bloomberg. With fewer targets to acquire, an increasing number of SPACs are eyeing startups in other markets like <a href="https://braziljournal.com/por-que-o-ipo-da-mosaico-foi-coisa-de-nasdaq">Asia</a> and <a href="https://neofeed.com.br/negocios/spacs-a-brasileira-devem-captar-mais-de-us-11-bilhao-e-essa-febre-esta-so-no-comeco/">Latin America</a>, with the same endgame: take them public in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Africa cannot be compared to these other regions in terms of technology and investment activities, it has some success stories. Companies like Jumia, GetSmarter, Paystack and Flutterwave are bright examples from the continent. But except for Tidjane Thiam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spac-freedom-acquisition-i-led-by-the-former-ceo-of-credit-suisse-files-for-a-%24250-million">$300 million blank-check company Freedom Acquisition I Corp</a> (which has found no fintech target yet), there&#8217;s practically no SPAC targeting African tech companies.</span></p>

<h2>Not SPACworthy?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eaboyeji">Iyinoluwa Aboyeji</a>, founder and general partner at Future Africa, an early-stage VC firm, told TechCrunch that SPAC targets are most often billion-dollar companies. &#8220;The way the economics of a SPAC work, you want a billion-dollar company, and that&#8217;s a very short list in Africa. You can&#8217;t SPAC anything less than a billion dollars as you wouldn&#8217;t make enough money for it to be worth your while,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only a handful of African tech companies worth that much. Just recently, Flutterwave joined the illustrious club that includes Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch. If what Aboyeji said is anything to go by, SPACs can only target <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a> and Interswitch. Yet, the chances of this happening are quite slim because the pair have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/why-covid-19-could-delay-interswitch-africas-next-big-ipo/">expressed interest in going public via IPOs</a> on local and international exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, where exactly does it leave the continent if there are no billion-dollar companies to SPAC? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aboyeji thinks SPACs could narrow down targets to companies that could become unicorns with their next rounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/eghosaomoigui&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjF-Y2H2cjwAhVC8hQKHe1vBmAQjjgwAXoECAMQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lwmwAJ4Me433EE6NvPUd9">Eghosa Omoigui</a>, managing partner at EchoVC Partners, an early-stage VC firm focused on sub-Saharan Africa, shares this view and adds that selecting these companies will boil down to the thrill they offer blank check companies should they choose to look Africa&#8217;s way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you think about it, there&#8217;s only a small number of startups on the continent that have enough traction or excitement to be [packaged] in a SPAC,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a neutral lens, some companies fit into this box of attractive African-focused companies with unicorn potential. A few of them, including Andela, Branch, Gro Intelligence and TymeBank, are worth more than $500 million and can easily double that with any SPAC activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Omoigui believes a large number of these startups aren&#8217;t ready to go public yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The real question I think is, even if you file for a SPAC and merge it with an African target, is that company ready to be public? The truth of the matter is that the valuations they get when private are much better than what they&#8217;ll get in the public markets.&#8221; </span></p>
<h2>Private capital seems sufficient&#8230; for now</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continent&#8217;s tech ecosystem is still very much nascent. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">African startups raised a total of $2 billion</a>, which is the peak of investments to have flowed in a year so far. That same year, Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/29/indian-tech-startups-funding-amount-2019/">raised $14.5 billion</a>. This disparity in investments is one reason there are few unicorns and acquisitions in the region. So it pretty much shows that there&#8217;s still a lot of ground to cover for African startups before thinking of going public. Maybe this is why SPACs aren&#8217;t targeting African startups now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way I see it, African startups are not ready yet to go public,&#8221; Aboyeji remarked. &#8220;They still need more time in the private markets. If you&#8217;re pursued by private capital and you see what happened to the likes of Jumia that went public, your inclination is just to take the private capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to that, private equity is catching up with what public financing can offer. Startups globally are staying private longer than ever. In the U.S., the number of publicly listed companies has</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/company-ipo-buyout-private.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped by 52%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the late 1990s to 2016. It&#8217;s a trend that has been passed to other markets, so it&#8217;s likely that African companies might stay private for the foreseeable future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Omoigui is optimistic that this situation might change in fewer than three years. In his opinion, SPACs will run out of interesting targets in other emerging markets and might start broadening their scope to include African companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EchoVC managing partner added that the continent could do well with more SPACs from indigenous personalities like Thiam while waiting for those from foreign entities. This will build more excitement on the continent because in most cases, it isn&#8217;t the target that people usually get enthusiastic about but the vehicle itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sometimes you realize that it&#8217;s not really the startups that need to be hot and exciting; it is the SPAC sponsor. That&#8217;s what people are hopping on the bandwagon for.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before running Future Africa full-time, Aboyeji had stints with Andela as a co-founder and as CEO of Flutterwave. The startups are still private to date but are on anyone&#8217;s cards to go public within this decade. For Aboyeji, however, make that three as the entrepreneur-cum-investor wants to take his investment firm public, maybe via a SPAC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely going to exit on the public market with Future Africa. That&#8217;s my goal. I would consider a SPAC as an entrepreneur, but it&#8217;s likely that I&#8217;ll decide to directly list as well,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela CEO <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiahjohnson&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi3vInK2cjwAhVHDGMBHWb9BGAQjjgwC3oECCcQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wwr5LN0nekteWuTupA8qq">Jeremy Johnson</a> told me SPACs are here to stay, and most African startups will go public that way. However, he didn&#8217;t say if there was any chance his company would do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the benefits is that they allow you to talk about the future, and Africa&#8217;s growth rate means its future is going to be brighter than the past,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think African startups will end up going public via this route.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="epi-fontLg bwalignc">Electric car startup Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Production on the car, which will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India, will begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023.</p>
<p class="epi-fontLg bwalignc">Numerous details, including the name of the car and the location of future manufacturing plants, have not been disclosed by the two companies. As for form factor, Fisker describes it as a &#8220;breakthrough new segment vehicle,&#8221; so neither a sedan nor an SUV, that&#8217;s capable of carrying five people, a Fisker spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Fisker is calling the joint program Project PEAR, which stands for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution. Fisker chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker has bragged that the PEAR vehicle will be the &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/henrikfisker/status/1392323394079580165?s=20">next big thing in car design</a>,&#8221; a car that&#8217;s both &#8220;emotionally desirable&#8221; and &#8220;eco-friendly,&#8221; meaning a car that doesn&#8217;t shout &#8220;Look at me, I&#8217;m electric!&#8221; and rather appeals to the driver moving over from gasoline vehicles, according to a spokesperson from Fisker</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/"> signed a memorandum of understanding agreement</a> in February, setting the expectation that a formal agreement would be reached by this time. Included in the agreement signed on Thursday is a goal to produce 250,000 units annually across multiple sites. In January,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/"> Foxconn partnered with Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group</a> to form a joint venture that would provide car manufacturers with production and consulting services, so the deal with Fisker is one of the company&#8217;s first forays into the automotive industry.</p>
<p>“In order to deliver on our promise of product breakthroughs from Project PEAR, we needed to rethink every aspect of product development, sourcing and manufacturing,&#8221; said Fisker chairman and CEO Henrik Fisker in a statement. &#8220;Our partnership with Foxconn enables us to deliver those industry firsts at a price point that truly opens up electric mobility to the mass market.”</p>
<div class="bw-release-subhead">
<p>The new vehicle will be priced under $30,000, according to Fisker, who touted the uniqueness and innovation of his car&#8217;s designs. Fisker will also begin production on its first model, Ocean, an electric SUV, in Europe by the end of next year. The company also intends to release a prototype of Ocean at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have world-class supply chains in place to support Project PEAR – in particular, securing the reliable delivery of chipsets and semiconductors,&#8221; said Young-way Liu, chairman of Foxconn, in a statement.</p>
<p>Liu noted how Foxconn would be able to connect Project PEAR with suppliers around the world through its software and hardware open platform for EVs, MIH, which aligns with the company&#8217;s &#8220;3+3&#8221; vision which symbolizes the infinite technological and industry advancements available through the platform.</p>
<p>Foxconn and Fisker are still shopping for potential U.S. manufacturing sites, so they&#8217;ve set up an office between the U.S. and Taiwan to coordinate design, engineering, purchasing and manufacturing operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New media poster child Substack <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/growing-the-pie-for-writers">announced</a> today that they&#8217;ve added a small community-building consultancy team to its ranks, acquiring the Brooklyn-based startup <a href="https://www.people-and.com/">People &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>The small firm has been working with clients to build up their community efforts, and its team will now be tasked with building up some of the newsletter company&#8217;s upstart efforts for writers in its network.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/growing-the-pie-for-writers">blog post</a>, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie said that the company had previously used the People &amp; Co. team to consult on their fellowship and mentorship programs and that members of the team would now be working on a variety of new efforts, from scaling programs to help writers with legal support and health insurance to community-guided projects like workshops and meetups to help crowdsource insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These people are the best in the world at what they do, and now they’re not only working for Substack, but they’re also working for you,&#8221; McKenzie wrote.</p>
<p>Beyond Substack, previous partners with People &amp; Company include Porsche AG, Nike and Surfrider.</p>
<p>Substack has been blazing ahead in recent months, adding new partners and raising cash as it aims to bring on more and more subscribers to its network. The firm shared back in late March that it had raised a $65 million round at a reported valuation around $650 million, according to earlier reporting by <a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html">Axios</a>.</p>

		Dominik Angerer is CEO and co-founder of headless CMS <a href="https://www.storyblok.com/">Storyblok</a>, which provides best practice guidance for startups on how to build a sustainable approach to marketing their content.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Search engine optimization, PR, paid marketing, emails, social — marketing and communications is crowded with techniques, channels, solutions and acronyms. It&#8217;s little wonder that many startups strapped for time and money find defining and executing a sustainable marketing campaign a daunting prospect.</p>
<p>The sheer number of options makes it difficult to determine an effective approach, and my view is that this complexity often obscures the obvious answer: A startup’s best marketing asset is its story. The knowledge and expertise of its team, together with the why and the how of its offering provides the most compelling content.</p>
<p>Leveraging this material with best practice techniques enables any startup, no matter how limited its budget, to run an effective marketing campaign.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many startups make the mistake of choosing systems and employing procedures to solve the immediate needs of the department that requires them.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I know this approach works, because this is exactly what I did with my co-founder Alex Feiglstorfer when we set up Storyblok. To be clear, we are developers not marketers. However, our previous experience building CMS systems taught us that the main driver of organic engagement for most businesses was customer conversations around content.</p>
<p>Specifically, sharing experiences, expertise and what we learned. We had committed nearly all of our available cash to developing our product, so we knew that the only way to market Storyblok was to do it all ourselves.</p>
<p>As a result, we focused solely on problem-solving content. This took the form of tutorials on web development and opinion pieces on headless CMS and other topics within our areas of expertise. The trick was that what we published wasn’t made just for marketing, it was based on our own internal documentation of problems we encountered as we developed our product. In essence, we were &#8220;learning in public.&#8221; Through this approach we were able to acquire thousands of customers in our first year.</p>
<p>Retelling this story isn’t to blow my own trumpet, it’s to make clear that you don’t have to be a marketer by training or commit a huge amount of time and resources to successfully market your startup. So, how do you get started?</p>
<h2>Getting your structure and technology right</h2>
<p>Although there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to how you organize your startup’s marketing function, there are some basic principles that apply in nearly every situation. A recent survey of 400+ executives from CMS Wire helpfully identified the following factors as the &#8220;top digital customer experience challenges&#8221; for businesses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limited budget/resources.</li>
<li>Siloed systems and fragmented customer data.</li>
<li>Limited cross-department alignment/collaboration.</li>
<li>Outdated/limited technology, operations or processes.</li>
<li>Lack of in-house expertise/skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Challenges two to four are the pitfalls that we can focus on avoiding. They are directly related to how a startup produces, organizes and distributes its content.</p>
<p>With regard to the siloing of systems and fragmentation of customer data, the overriding goal is to ensure all your systems are integrated and speak to one another. In practice, this means that the data gathered in different departments — whether its feedback from sales, engagement on your website, customer service responses or product development information — is collected in a uniform and methodical manner and is readily accessible across the business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda School</a> has attracted a lot of attention, and raised some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/lambda-school-raises-74m-for-its-virtual-coding-school-where-you-pay-tuition-only-after-you-get-a-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$130 million in venture funding</a>&nbsp;from an impressive list of investors, for its novel approach to coding education: offering six-month virtual computer science courses for $30,000, with the option of paying for the courses in installments based on a sliding scale that only kicks in after you land a job that makes at least $50,000.</p>
<p>But it turns out that the startup is attracting a lot of controversy, too. In the latest development, three students have filed lawsuits against the company in California, claiming misleading financial and educational practices.</p>
<p>The suits &#8212; which are being brought by the nonprofit <a href="https://www.defendstudents.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Student Legal Defense Network</a> on behalf of Linh Nguyen, Heather Nye and Jonathan Stickrod &#8212; go back to a period of between 2018 and 2020, and they focus on four basic claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, that Lambda School falsified and misrepresented job placement rates. Second, that Lambda School misrepresented the true nature of its financial interest in student success (specifically, there are question marks over how Lambda handles its ISA contracts and whether it benefits from those). Third, that it misrepresented and concealed a regulatory dispute in California that required the school to cease operations. And fourth, that it enrolled and provided educational services and signed ISA contracts in violation of that order.</p>
<p>The filings for the three cases are embedded below.</p>
<p>The three students are all currently on the hook for their Lambda tuitions, which they opted to pay back in installments by way of the school&#8217;s income share agreement (ISA) model. The suits do not disclose how much the three individuals are seeking in damages.</p>
<p>For those who have been following news of Lambda School over the last several years, the claims detailed in the suit will sound familiar.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflated job placement rates</a>; and the fact that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21131848/lambda-school-coding-bootcamp-isa-tuition-cost-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn&#8217;t legally allowed to operate</a>, yet was still accepting students, signing ISA deals, and teaching, for example, were all reported over that period of time, along with other criticisms about how CEO and founder Austen Allred, a self-proclaimed &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Sauce-Ultimate-Growth-Hacking/dp/1635877393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth hacker</a>&#8220;, leveraged his and Lambda&#8217;s other Twitter accounts to hype up the school.</p>
<p>Some of the issues that are raised in the lawsuits have also been resolved since then. For example, the prominent display of over 80% of students finding jobs can no longer be found on the Lambda site, and in California you no longer get an ISA but a retail installment contract (similar but different). But as is the way of litigation, lawsuits based on past issues from people who were impacted by them when they were still active, are, in many ways, the next logical, unsurprising step.</p>
<p>There is also a specific strategy behind these three cases being filed at the same time.</p>
<p>Alex Elson, the co-founder of the National Student Legal Defense Network, told TechCrunch in an interview that the ISA contracts that students sign at Lambda have arbitration clauses that preclude students from arbitrating against Lambda in groups, i.e. class action suits.</p>
<p>The idea is that by bringing three nearly identical individual cases simultaneously against the school, the defendants can both expose the widespread practices of Lambda, and pave the way for broader relief for others similarly impacted. (The Student Defense Network&#8217;s co-counsel in the case is CalebAndonian PLLC and Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP.)</p>
<p>Originally incubated at Y Combinator and backed by a long list of investors that include GV (Google Ventures), Gigafactory (ex-Founders Fund partners), GGV and more, Lambda School has had a tough time of it in the last year, a period that has seen the COVID-19 pandemic have a disproportionate impact on some parts of the economy but not others.</p>
<p>Edtech has largely been seen as a huge growth area, but that may not have been the case for edtech startups specifically focused on vocational, technology jobs, given that the tech world has seen a lot of hiring freezes, and layoffs, as companies sought to keep down costs in the face of the unknown.</p>
<p>Lambda went through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/lambda-school-cuts-staff-and-exec-pay-amid-market-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two sets</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> in the space of a year, and it seems that in one of them it also changed its teaching model, doing away with TLs (team leads), paid mentors who helped assess students, and instead moved to a model where students mentored each other and assessed themselves.</p>
<p>It has also changed the courses themselves, shortening them to six months from their original nine- and 18-month formats &#8212; but not reducing the prices for those courses.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s not quite past all of its regulatory issues, either.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, California&#8217;s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) announced a <a href="https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/539482519/lambda-school-reaches-settlement-with-dfpi-agreeing-to-end-deceptive-educational-financing-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement</a> with the school over the language that it uses in financing contracts with students.</p>
<p>Specifically, the DFPI took issue with how it said Lambda falsely described its financial arrangement with students as a “qualified educational loan&#8230; subject to the limitations on dischargeability contained in&#8230; the United States Bankruptcy Code.”</p>
<p>(Educational loans are usually exempt from bankruptcy discharge &#8212; when a debtor is not required to pay a debt because that debtor is bankrupt, it&#8217;s a bankruptcy discharge; typically educational loans are not covered by this, so the issue here was the Lambda School was claiming that even if a student files for bankruptcy that student would still have to pay back Lambda.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The language violates the new California Consumer Financial Protection Law (CCFPL), which took effect this year and prohibits companies from engaging in practices that are unlawful, unfair, deceptive, or abusive,&#8221; the DFPI noted.</p>
<p>The settlement requires Lambda to notify students that the bankruptcy dischargeability provision language is not accurate; retain a third party to review the terms of the school’s finance contract to ensure that it complies with all applicable laws; and undergo a review of its marketing materials to ensure that the information is accurate and not likely to mislead consumers.</p>

<p>You could say that all of these issues are the table stakes of being a startup and trying something new: the school is moving fast, breaking things and iterating along the way to figure it all out.</p>
<p>But for a service that can leave students liable for paying back $30,000, it&#8217;s a big price for others to pay when those things don&#8217;t quite work as advertised.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">Still, despite all that, Lambda also continues to have a lot of supporters and partners. Just last month, for example, it announced a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px" href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/lambda-school-launches-backend-engineering-program-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new backend engineering program that it developed with Amazon</a>. And while it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px">doesn&#8217;t seem guaranteed taking the course will get you an instant open door to a job with the tech giant, it&#8217;s a sign of how there </span>remains<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px"> interest in Lambda&#8217;s big idea.</span></p>
<p>We have also reached out to the company&#8217;s CEO and founder Austen Allred, and the company itself, for a response and we will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p><em>Updated with Lambda&#8217;s response:&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Per policy, we don’t speak about individual student or alumni situations in detail publicly, but we’re of course happy to review matters directly and will review any cases that are filed. In general, though, for any student’s ISA payments to be activated, they would have first signed an ISA contract and subsequently landed a role leveraging skills learned at Lambda School that pays $50K or more in salary.</p>
<p>Our mission is to de-risk education and expand access to higher paying jobs. For that reason, our ISAs (and RICs in California) are designed with policies that are as flexible and student-centric as possible. That includes our purposely generous proration refund and proration policy for students who decide to leave the program, regardless of tuition payment method. Additionally, if an alumnus loses their job, salary, or is making under $50K a year, their payments are immediately paused. ISAs expire completely after 24 payments or 60 deferred months, even if the total paid is less than $30,000.</p>
<p>Our number one priority is student success. We stand behind the quality of our instructors and our proven student outcomes (which we go into more detail about <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-outcomes-data-lambda-school-austen-allred/&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1621029363889000&#038;usg=AFQjCNHcxnGfp357SZariyNJ_PlFIC43JQ">here</a> and in our <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/reports/h2-2019-outcomes-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lambdaschool.com/reports/h2-2019-outcomes-report&#038;source=gmail&#038;ust=1621029363889000&#038;usg=AFQjCNGk_kylcFfEuavS_FbBw2VSwzcN7g">outcomes reporting</a>).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, the organization behind Burning Man announced that the festival/experience would not be returning to the desert of Nevada this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and would instead be attempting a virtual event, once again aiming to bring attendees access to a handful of web-based experiences.</p>
<p>Today, the Burning Man org <a href="https://here.burningman.org/event/virtualburn?utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=VirtualBurn">released tickets</a> for its online events taking place between August 22 and September 7.</p>
<p>There have been few illusions for attendees that a virtual event is any substitute for the real thing, but organizers have tried to get creative when it comes to the social web experiences so that attendees can reclaim some of the camaraderie. While the organization won&#8217;t be setting up an official presence, some camps have already committed to hosting an unofficial return to the desert.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, TechCrunch profiled the Burning Man org as they struggled to pull together a virtual event that captured the feeling of the in-person experience using virtual reality, mobile apps and virtual experimental theater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital imagery is in demand, and if you think having daily images of everywhere on Earth is going to be enough in a few years, you need a lesson in ambition. <a href="http://www.albaorbital.com">Alba Orbital</a> is here to provide it with its intention to provide Earth observation at intervals of 15 minutes rather than hours or days — and it just raised $3.4 million to get its next set of satellites into orbit.</p>
<p>Alba attracted our attention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">at Y Combinator&#8217;s latest demo day</a>; I was impressed with the startup&#8217;s accomplishment of already having six satellites in orbit, which is more than most companies with space ambition ever get. But it&#8217;s only the start for the company, which will need hundreds more to begin to offer its planned high-frequency imagery.</p>
<p>The Scottish company has spent the last few years in prep and R&amp;D, pursuing the goal, which some must have thought laughable, of creating a solar-powered Earth observation satellite that weighs in at less than one kilogram. The joke&#8217;s on the skeptics, however — Alba has launched a proof of concept and is ready to send the real thing up as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Little more than a flying camera with a minimum of storage, communication, power and movement, the sub-kilogram Unicorn-2 is about the size of a soda can, with paperback-size solar panel wings, and costs in the neighborhood of $10,000. It should be able to capture up to 10-meter resolution, good enough to see things like buildings, ships, crops, even planes.</p>

<p>&#8220;People thought we were idiots. Now they&#8217;re taking it seriously,&#8221; said Tom Walkinshaw, founder and CEO of Alba. &#8220;They can see it for what it is: a unique platform for capturing data sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, although the idea of daily orbital imagery like Planet&#8217;s once seemed excessive, in some situations it&#8217;s quite clearly not enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The California case is probably wildfires,&#8221; said Walkinshaw (and it always helps to have a California case). &#8220;Having an image once a day of a wildfire is a bit like having a chocolate teapot&#8230; not very useful. And natural disasters like hurricanes, flooding is a big one, transportation as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walkinshaw noted that they company was bootstrapped and profitable before taking on the task of launching dozens more satellites, something the seed round will enable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gets these birds in the air, gets them finished and shipped out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then we just need to crank up the production rate.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151886" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg" alt="Alba Orbital founder Tom Walkinshaw next to a Y Combinator sign." width="450" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg 1078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tom-walkinshaw.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2151886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alba Orbital</p></div></p>
<p>When I talked to Walkinshaw via video call, 10 or so completed satellites in their launch shells were sitting on a rack behind him in the clean room, and more are in the process of assembly. Aiding in the scaling effort is new investor James Park, founder and CEO of Fitbit — definitely someone who knows a little bit about bringing hardware to market.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the next batch to go to orbit (perhaps as soon as in a month or two, depending on the machinations of the launch provider) will be focusing on nighttime imagery, an area Walkinshaw suggested was undervalued. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-vus-5m-seed-round-will-fuel-the-launch-of-its-thermal-imaging-satellites/">orbital thermal imaging startup Satellite Vu has shown</a>, there&#8217;s immense appetite for things like energy and activity monitoring, and nighttime observation is a big part of that.</p>

<p>The seed round will get the next few rounds of satellites into space, and after that Alba will be working on scaling manufacturing to produce hundreds more. Once those start going up it can demonstrate the high-cadence imaging it is aiming to produce — for now it&#8217;s impossible to do so, though Alba already has customers lined up to buy the imagery it does get.</p>
<p>The round was led by Metaplanet Holdings, with participation by Y Combinator, Liquid2, Soma, Uncommon Denominator, Zillionize and numerous angels.</p>
<p>As for competition, Walkinshaw welcomes it, but feels secure that he and his company have more time and work invested in this class of satellite than anyone in the world — a major obstacle for anyone who wants to do battle. It&#8217;s more likely companies will, as Alba has done, pursue a distinct product complementary to those already or in the process of being offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Space is a good place to be right now,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As an entrepreneur, you started your business to create value, both in what you deliver to your customers and what you build for yourself. You have a lot going on, but if building personal wealth matters to you, the assets you&#8217;re creating deserve your attention.</p>
<p>You can implement numerous advanced planning strategies to minimize <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp">capital gains tax</a>, reduce future <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/120715/estate-taxes-who-pays-what-and-how-much.asp">estate tax</a> and increase <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset-protection.asp">asset protection</a> from creditors and lawsuits. Capital gains tax can reduce your gains by up to 35%, and estate taxes can cost up to 50% on assets you leave to your heirs. Careful planning can minimize your exposure and actually save you millions.</p>
<p>Smart founders and early employees should closely examine their equity ownership, even in the early stages of their company&#8217;s life cycle. Different strategies should be used at different times and for different reasons. The following are a few key considerations when determining what, if any, advanced strategies you might consider:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ol>
<li>Your company&#8217;s life cycle — early, mid or late stage.</li>
<li>The value of your shares — what they are worth now, what you expect them to be worth in the future and when.</li>
<li>Your own circumstances and goals — what you need now, and what you may need in the future.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some advanced equity planning strategies that you can implement at different stages of your company life cycle to reduce tax and optimize wealth for you and your family.</p>
<h2>Irrevocable nongrantor trust</h2>
<p><a href="https://keystonegp.com/insights/founders-and-entrepreneurs-guide-to-qsbs">QSBS</a> allows you to exclude tax on $10 million of capital gains (tax of up to 35%) upon an exit/sale. This is a benefit every individual and some trusts have. There is significant opportunity to multiply the QSBS tax exclusion well beyond $10 million.</p>
<p>The founder can gift QSBS eligible stock to an irrevocable nongrantor trust, let’s say for the benefit of a child, so that the trust will qualify for its own $10 million exclusion. The founder owning the shares would be the grantor in this case. Typically, these trusts are set up for children or unborn children. It is important to note that the founder/grantor will have to gift the shares to accomplish this, because gifted shares will retain the QSBS eligibility. If the shares are sold into the trust, the shares lose QSBS status.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151725" style="width: 1060px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151725" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151725 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png" alt="QSBS tax strategy" width="1050" height="359" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png 1050w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png?resize=768,263 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png?resize=680,232 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image1-2.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits</strong>: Peyton Carr</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the savings on federal taxes, founders may also save on state taxes. State tax can be avoided if the trust is structured properly and set up in a tax-exempt state like Delaware or Nevada. Otherwise, even if the trust is subject to state tax, some states, like New York, conform and follow the federal tax treatment of the QSBS rules, while others, like California, do not. For example, if you are a New York state resident, you will also avoid the 8.82% state tax, which amounts to another $2.6 million in tax savings if applied to the example above.</p>
<p>This brings the total tax savings to almost $10 million, which is material in the context of a $40 million gain. Notably, California does not conform, but California residents can still capture the state tax savings if their trust is structured properly and in a state like Delaware or Nevada.</p>
<p>Currently, each person has a limited lifetime <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gifttax.asp">gift tax exemption</a>, and any gifted amount beyond this will generate up to a 40% gift tax that has to be paid. Because of this, there is a trade-off between gifting the shares early while the company valuation is low and using less of your gift tax exemption versus gifting the shares later and using more of the lifetime gift exemption.</p>
<p>The reason to wait is that it takes time, energy and money to set up these trusts, so ideally, you are using your lifetime gift exemption and trust creation costs to capture a benefit that will be realized. However, not every company has a successful exit, so it is sometimes better to wait until there is a certain degree of confidence that the benefit will be realized.</p>
<h2>Parent-seeded trust</h2>
<p>One way for the founder to plan for future generations while minimizing estate taxes and high state taxes is through a parent-seeded trust. This trust is created by the founder’s parents, with the founder as the beneficiary. Then the founder can sell the shares to this trust — it doesn&#8217;t involve the use of any lifetime gift exemption and eliminates any gift tax, but it also disqualifies the ability to claim QSBS.</p>
<p>The benefit is that all the future appreciation of the asset is transferred out of the founder&#8217;s and the parent’s estate and is not subject to potential estate taxes in the future. The trust can be located in a tax-exempt state such as Delaware or Nevada to also eliminate home state-level taxes. This can translate up to 10% in state-level tax savings. The trustee, an individual selected by the founder, can make distributions to the founder as a beneficiary if desired.</p>
<p>Further, this trust can be used for the benefit of multiple generations. Distributions can be made at the discretion of the trustee, and this skips the estate tax liability as assets are passed from generation to generation.</p>
<h2>Grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT)</h2>
<p>This strategy enables the founder to minimize their estate tax exposure by transferring wealth outside of their estate, specifically without using any lifetime gift exemption or being subject to gift tax. It&#8217;s particularly helpful when an individual has used up all their lifetime gift tax exemption. This is a powerful strategy for very large &#8220;unicorn&#8221; positions to reduce a founder’s future gift/estate tax exposure.</p>
<p>For the GRAT, the founder (grantor) transfers assets into the GRAT and gets back a stream of annuity payments. The <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/section-7520-interest-rates">IRS 7520 rate</a>, currently very low, is a factor in calculating these annuity payments. If the assets transferred into the trust grow faster than the IRS 7520 rate, there will be an excess remainder amount in GRAT after all the annuity payments are paid back to the founder (grantor).</p>
<p>This remainder amount will be excluded from the founder&#8217;s estate and can transfer to beneficiaries or remain in the trust estate tax-free. Over time, this remainder amount can be multiples of the initial contributed value. If you have company stock that you expect will pop in value, it can be very beneficial to transfer those shares into a GRAT and have the pop occur inside the trust.</p>
<p>This way, you can transfer all the upside gift and estate tax-free out of your estate and to your beneficiaries. Additionally, because this trust is structured as a grantor trust, the founder can pay the taxes incurred by the trust, making the strategy even more powerful.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that the grantor must survive the GRAT&#8217;s term for the strategy to work. If the grantor dies before the end of the term, the strategy unravels and some or all the assets remain in his estate as if the strategy never existed.</p>
<h2>Intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT)</h2>
<p>This is similar to the GRAT in that it also enables the founder to minimize their estate tax exposure by transferring wealth outside of their estate, but has some key differences. The grantor must &#8220;seed&#8221; the trust by gifting 10% of the asset value intended to be transferred, so this approach requires the use of some lifetime gift exemption or gift tax.</p>
<p>The remaining 90% of the value to be transferred is sold to the trust in exchange for a promissory note. This sale is not taxable for income tax or QSBS purposes. The main benefits are that instead of receiving annuity payments back, which requires larger payments, the grantor transfers assets into the trust and can receive an interest-only note. The payments received are far lower because it is interest-only (rather than an annuity).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151728" style="width: 1060px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151728" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2151728 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png" alt="IDGT Estate tax savings" width="1050" height="498" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png 1050w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png?resize=768,364 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png?resize=680,323 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image2-1.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151728" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Peyton Carr</p></div></p>
<p>Another key distinction is that the IDGT strategy has more flexibility than the GRAT and can be generation-skipping.</p>
<p>If the goal is to avoid <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/generation-skipping-transfer-tax.asp">generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT)</a>, the IDGT is superior to the GRAT, because assets are measured for GSTT purposes when they are contributed to the trust prior to appreciation rather than being measured at the end of the term for a GRAT after the assets have appreciated.</p>
<h2>The bottom line</h2>
<p>Depending on a founder&#8217;s situation and goals, we may use some combination of the above strategies or others altogether. Many of these strategies are most effective when planning in advance; waiting until after the fact will limit the benefits you can extract.</p>
<p>When considering strategies for protecting wealth and minimizing taxes as it relates to your company stock, there&#8217;s a lot to take into account — the above is only a summary. We recommend you seek proper counsel and choose wealth transfer and tax savings strategies based on your unique situation and individual appetite for complexity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the market close this afternoon ahead of its earnings report, <a href="http://newrelic.com">New Relic</a>, an applications performance monitoring company, announced that founder Lew Cirne would be stepping down as CEO and moving into the executive chairman role.</p>
<p>At the same time, the company announced that Bill Staples, a software industry vet, would be taking over as CEO. Staples joined the company last year as chief product officer before being quickly promoted to president and chief product officer in January. Today&#8217;s promotion marks a rapid rise through the ranks to lead the company.</p>
<p>Cirne said when he began thinking about stepping into that executive chairman role, he was looking for a trusted partner to take his place as CEO, and he found that in Staples. &#8220;Every founder&#8217;s dream is for the company to have a long-lasting impact, and then when the time is right for them to step into a different role. To do that, you need a trusted partner that will lead with the right core values and bring to the table what the company needs as an active partner. And so I&#8217;m really excited to move to the executive chairman role [and to have Bill be that person],&#8221; Cirne told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9DbQAn9tjs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/">New Relic is changing its pricing model to encourage broader monitoring</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;New Relic is changing its pricing model to encourage broader monitoring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/new-relic-is-changing-its-pricing-model-to-encourage-broader-monitoring/embed/#?secret=9DbQAn9tjs" data-secret="9DbQAn9tjs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Staples, who has worked at large organizations throughout his career, this opportunity to lead the company as CEO is the pinnacle of his long career arc. He called the promotion humbling, but one he believes he is ready to take on.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a new chapter for me, a new experience to be a CEO of a public company with a billion-dollar-plus value valuation, but I think the experience I have in the seat of our customers, as well as the experience I&#8217;ve had at Microsoft and Adobe, very large companies with very large stakes running large organizations has really prepared me well for this next phase,&#8221; Staples said.</p>
<p>Cirne says he plans to take some time off this summer to give Staples the space to grow as the leader of the company without being in the shadow of the founder and long-time CEO, but he plans to come back and work with him as the executive chairman moving forward come the fall.</p>
<p>As he steps into this new role, Staples will be taking over. &#8220;Certainly I have a lot to learn about what it takes to be a great CEO, but I also come in with a lot of confidence that I&#8217;ve managed organizations at scale. You know I&#8217;ve been part of P&amp;Ls that were many times larger than New Relic, and I have confidence that I can help New Relic grow as a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope Cochran, managing director at Madrona Ventures, who is also the chairman of the New Relic Board, said that the board fully backs of the decision to pass the CEO torch from Cirne to Staples. &#8220;With the foundation that Lew built and Bill’s leadership, New Relic has a very bright future ahead and a clear path to accelerate growth as the leader in observability,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>The official transition is scheduled to take place on July 1st.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Jean-Michel Lemieux, the chief technology officer of <span class="il">Shopify</span>, and the company&#8217;s chief talent officer, Brittany Forsyth, both announced that they are stepping down from their roles. Chief legal officer Joe Frasca is also set to leave the e-commerce giant, with all three ending their tenures next month. In their next chapters, all seem keen to advise, invest in or even launch startups, joining a growing number of former Shopify executives and employees to do the same.</p>
<p>For an enterprise of Shopify&#8217;s size &#8212; the 15-year-old, 7,000-person, Ottawa-based outfit boasts a $130 billion market cap &#8212; that&#8217;s not a surprise. Still, because of the vast wealth that Shopify has helped create, its former employees look to have an impact on the Canadian entrepreneurial ecosystem like no company before it.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is there someone that needs a hand, pep talk, career advice? How can I help?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>— Jean-Michel Lemieux (@jmwind) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1392653927871664128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Take Craig Miller, formerly the chief product officer of Shopify who left the company back in October. He&#8217;d already invested in several venture funds that are focused on clean tech and Canada while still working full time; now, he&#8217;s investing both his money and time in individual companies that he thinks &#8220;have a real shot at making a big social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these include tools that enable people to run their own businesses, including <a href="https://www.housecallpro.com/">Housecall Pro</a>, and startups looking to reverse climate change, like the carbon capture startup <a href="https://www.planetaryhydrogen.com/">Planetary Hydrogen</a>.</p>
<p>Miller says his time is more compelling to the founders, which include former Shopify colleagues. &#8220;Raising money is important, but there&#8217;s already more than enough people willing to invest money in them,&#8221; he says, so most of his value comes in talking with teams about how to scale up their startups, given there are &#8220;so few people who know how to drive huge growth in a company, have seen a company [grow] from $100 million to $100 billion plus, [and] who know how to think about scaling a product to millions of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t a lot of people on the planet who&#8217;ve lived through that kind of hyper growth, he notes, but that&#8217;s especially true in Canada, &#8220;where there are basically no role models.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As e-commerce booms during the pandemic, Shopify accelerates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/as-e-commerce-booms-during-the-pandemic-shopify-accelerates/embed/#?secret=H2gBZTyQx3" data-secret="H2gBZTyQx3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Miller is a product of his environment, he suggests, offering that Shopify actively educated its employees, albeit informally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;One of the things that I loved most was how open we were,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;All employees knew the roadmap, could look at the code, they could access the data . . . we even shared our board presentation with the entire company. Doing so let people who were interested in how to build an incredible company take notes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Seemingly, plenty of people had their pens out. Among those who&#8217;ve left Shopify to spin up their own business are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlperry/">Michael Perry</a>, who left Shopify last year to build an app called <a href="https://www.growmaple.com/">Maple</a> that helps organize busy families; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-tran-3ba70217/">Helen Tran</a>, who left Shopify in 2017 to start <a href="https://tryjupiter.com/">Jupiter</a>, which makes software for beauty and personal care brands; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drupeek/?originalSubdomain=ca">Andrew Peek</a>, who started the investment advisory <a href="https://delphia.com/">Delphia</a>; and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/effie-anolik/">Effie Anolik</a>, whose startup, <a href="https://afterword.com/">Afterword</a>, helps the bereaved plan both virtual and offline memorial services.</p>
<p>Another founder and proud Shopify alum is former director of product marketing Arati Sharma, who calls Shopify a &#8220;special place&#8221; that taught a lot of people how to scale a business and to do it in a very Shopify-specific way.</p>
<p>Because Shopify is the first company of its size in Canada, it didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;fixed mindset&#8221; about &#8220;how companies of our size should be run&#8221; and it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;beholden to playbooks of the past,&#8221; she says, leaving much to employees to figure out.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Shopify aims to level the playing field with its machine learning-driven model of lending&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/how-shopify-aims-to-level-the-playing-field-with-its-machine-learning-driven-model-of-lending/embed/#?secret=spDDHQtxQL" data-secret="spDDHQtxQL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sharma admits there are practical limits to how much the experience could teach her about starting her own company, <a href="https://shopghlee.com/">Ghlee</a>, a ghee-based skincare brand based in Toronto that she launched in 2019. &#8220;Though I’ve had the opportunity to build from scratch inside of Shopify, being in the founder seat is a whole new ballgame,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Yet as with Miller, Sharma credits Shopify with many lessons, including &#8220;how culture and commerce intersect so deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also observes that &#8220;whether you join [Shopify] as a former founder or you catch the entrepreneurial bug while working there, it’s remarkable how many employees run their own businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some are actually running them on the side of continuing to work at Shopify. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atleeclark/">Atlee Clark</a>, for example, founded a children&#8217;s clothing company called <a href="https://pikalayers.com/">Pika Layers</a>, while remaining a full-time director with the company.</p>
<p>Others have launched investment firms since leaving. Among these: a former VP of product, Adam McNamara, today runs <a href="https://www.ramen.vc/">Ramen Ventures</a>, an impact angel fund, with another former Shopify colleague, Joshua Tessier.</p>
<p>Very notably, Sharma is herself an active angel investor, even co-founding a collective of 10 investors earlier this year called <a href="https://www.backboneangels.com/#team">Backbone Angels</a> to &#8220;optimize for speed and to move quickly on a couple of deals that are coming our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the members of Backbone Angels are women. All are former Shopify employees, including outgoing chief talent officer Brittany Forsyth. All are focused on increasing the number of women and non-binary investors on cap tables with the belief that doing so will change how boards will look going forward and how companies are built.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to Shopify &#8212; whose share price, and profits, surged throughout the pandemic &#8212; there is apparently no shortage of opportunities to fund.</p>
<p>Though Sharma began investing earlier on with her husband, she says that of the more than 30 startups she has funded altogether, nine of those deals came together just this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is expanding into live events. The company is planning to host a three-day virtual event that will feature livestreamed sessions from top creators, including big names like Jonathan Van Ness and Rebecca Minkoff, among others. The virtual event will run <a href="https://pin.it/4IxiDMt">inside the Pinterest app</a> from May 24th through May 25th, and will serve as the company&#8217;s first public test of directly streaming creator content to its more than 475 million global users.</p>
<p>The rise of the creator economy and a pandemic-fueled demand for virtual events led Pinterest to explore the idea of livestreaming. Last fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pinterest-tests-online-events-with-dedicated-class-communities/">it began testing a &#8220;class communities&#8221; feature</a> that allowed users to sign up for Zoom classes through Pinterest, while creators used Pinterest&#8217;s boards to organize materials, notes and other resources. These communities also included a group chat option and shopping features.</p>
<p>The new livestreamed sessions will operate a bit differently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For starters, they&#8217;re not directing users off-site to Zoom for the sessions. Instead, users will launch the livestreaming experience directly inside Pinterest mobile app and remain there during the sessions. Pinterest users can also comment to interact with the creator during their stream, but there is no longer any shopping functionality, Pinterest tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2151936" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2151936" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2151936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_9265.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2151936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>The livestreams allow up to five &#8220;guests&#8221; and an unlimited number of viewers. Meanwhile, moderators &#8212; which may include Pinterest employees, during this test &#8212; will help to control the experience. They will also have the ability to remove people from the chat if they do not uphold Pinterest&#8217;s Community Standards.</p>
<p>The forthcoming event&#8217;s lineup will focus a variety of topics, including food, design, cooking, style and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/live-session/872924340243705056/?referrer=225">Jonathan Van Ness</a>&#8216; session will discuss morning rituals and self-care routines. Fashion designer <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/live-session/120189883795053121/?referrer=225">Rebecca Minkoff</a> will teach Pinterest users how to style their summer wardrobe. Others featured during the event include food creators <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/grossypelosi/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/grossypelosi/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHx76XuHktmxe0CfYFAHVwZSs4tkA">GrossyPelosi</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/petersom/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/petersom/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiCs26tNa57VaKTewkgjN5xMmI6g">Peter Som</a>, who will showcase favorite recipes; <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/womenshealthmag/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/womenshealthmag/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHf39-c5VRRHhN-UQEL82kxeLza_w">Women’s Health</a> magazine will talk about using vision boards to achieve your goals; <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pricklyblonde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/pricklyblonde/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHbyWMr1agVXPj7WRNhl4G42Tp1UQ">Jennifer Alba </a>will show how to communicate the Zodiac through sign language; and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/hbronfman/_created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pinterest.com/hbronfman/_created/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621007320019000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGXNvkU2M8jHKfiFRFfQmWQevDiKA">Hannah Bronfman</a> will offer ideas for creating an at-home spa night.</p>
<p>In total, Pinterest will feature around 21 creators throughout the three-day event, with around seven different sessions per day. Users will be directed to the live event via a new &#8220;<a href="https://pin.it/4IxiDMt">Live</a>&#8221; tab inside the Pinterest app for iOS and Android, where they can view the schedule and join sessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a visual platform, people discover billions of ideas on Pinterest every day, and we’re always looking for new ways to help them bring those ideas to life,&#8221; says David Temple, Pinterest&#8217;s head of Creators.</p>
<p>Temple notes Pinterest has integrated with third-party livestreaming technologies and built its own in-house messaging systems to power live interactions.</p>

<p>&#8220;We’re excited about the opportunity to respond to Pinner feedback for more dynamic and timely events as new interests like cooking have emerged for many in quarantine, and trends like beauty, fashion, and home renovation are on all-time highs as we move into a post-pandemic world,&#8221; Temple adds.</p>
<p>However, Pinterest isn&#8217;t discussing how it views the potential for live events longer-term. For the time being, it&#8217;s not offering tools that could woo creators away from other platforms where they can monetize their fans through features like donations, tips, virtual gifts, paid ticketing, subscriptions or brand partnerships via a creator marketplace. Without such options, Pinterest could have a hard time competing for creators&#8217; attention.</p>

<p>Nearly every big tech platform today is making a play for creators, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">some</a> are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">even</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-to-reel-in-tiktok-creators-raising-stakes-in-social-media-rivalry-11595928600">willing</a> to throw cash at them to win them over. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter are all building out features that let creators do more than build an audience to monetize through ads or brand deals. Now, fans can send creators money during or after streams, subscribe for exclusive content, pay for access and more, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>New types of creator services are emerging, too, including the audio chat room experience pioneered by Clubhouse (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">and</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">being</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">cloned</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/">by</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">everyone</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">else</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/event-networking-app-grip-raises-13m-as-pandemic-forces-events-to-stay-virtual/">as</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/welcome-raises-12-million-to-be-the-ritz-carlton-for-event-platforms/">well</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/hubilo-raises-4-5-million-led-by-lightspeed-to-focus-on-virtual-events/">as</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/looped-raises-7-7m-to-expand-its-interactive-live-event-platform/">dozens</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/">of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/">virtual</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/looped-raises-7-7m-to-expand-its-interactive-live-event-platform/">events</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/live-video-platform-bright-lets-you-zoom-with-your-favorite-creators/">startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/">hoping</a> to win the market.</p>

<p>Pinterest&#8217;s attraction among such heavy competition isn&#8217;t clear, but the company will use this experiment to learn more about what works for its own community.</p>
<p>Pinterest tested its livestreaming technology with employees a few weeks ago, but this will be the first time the feature will be available to the public.</p>
<p>While the event lineup can be viewed on the web, the livestreams themselves will only run inside the Pinterest app for iOS and Android starting May 24th.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">How should venture capitalists and corporate innovators assess Din Djarin, the protagonist of The Mandalorian? He’s introduced as a bounty hunter, a mercenary vocation in the Star Wars mythos that has been reserved primarily for villains.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of Jon Favreau’s show is how Din Djarin wrestles with the orthodoxy of his Mandalorian beliefs. His insistence on honor makes the character an appealing hero, and his character’s growth is demonstrated by when he chooses to be flexible versus when he holds fast to the rules he believes.</p>
<p>Although <em>&#8220;This is the way&#8221;</em> emerged as the show’s quotable soundbite, there is another line that’s more relevant to venture capital and corporate innovation: &#8220;<em>You’re changing the deal.&#8221;</em> Din Djarin uses this phrase to spar with adversaries who try to advance their objectives by disregarding clearly understood agreements.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Enforcement is so unusual in the world of startups that I consider it a mostly dead-end path.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Of course, terms change in venture capital and entrepreneurship all the time, with investors and entrepreneurs finding themselves in Din Djarin’s position.</p>
<p>This challenge is built into the very structure of venture capital fund raising, in which a Series A financing is usually followed by Series B, and then Series C, and each of these transactions frequently adds, subtracts, and modifies terms, changing the deal from the perspective of the startup and existing investors.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
