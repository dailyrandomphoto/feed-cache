					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 17, 2021. Today we have what struck us as the most interesting collection of startup news in some time. And we’re keeping an international perspective, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">diving into Brazil’s IPO market</a> and &#8212; see below &#8212; fintech industry, while also looking at what’s ahead for Nigeria’s burgeoning startup industry. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">Africa is busy</a>!)</p>
<p>Before we dive into all of the goodness, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/reserve-your-demo-table-at-tc-sessions-saas-2021-today/">demo tables are now live</a> for our October TC Sessions: SaaS 2021 event, and we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/discover-all-things-biotech-with-mayfield-at-disrupt-2021/">got big biotech plans for Disrupt</a>. Now, the news. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/"><strong>Salesforce starts to integrate with Slack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As Ron Miller notes, we’ve known that SFDC has big plans for workplace chat app Slack. You don’t spend $28 billion without a plan (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/is-slack-overpriced-now-that-the-market-knows-salesforce-might-buy-it/">the deal wasn’t cheap</a>). Today the CRM giant announced early integrations with Slack, which should be exciting to all you BigCorp denizens who use both tools. In the set of new tooling are things like “dedicated deal rooms,” which are like huddles, but for a particular sales effort.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/"><strong>Travel startups are fundable again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the takeaway from news that Hopper, a startup that helps consumers book flights and hotel stays, raised $175 million in a new round that values the company at $3.5 billion. What about the COVID-19 resurgence that many markets are currently enduring? The startup’s products that facilitate more flexible travel are doing numbers, Hopper told TechCrunch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/trading-platform-bitpanda-raises-263m-at-a-4-1bn-valuation/"><strong>Crypto exchanges are venture darlings:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s news that crypto trading platform Bitpanda has raised $263 million at a $4.1 billion valuation is merely part of a trend that TechCrunch has seen in recent weeks of crypto exchanges raising huge checks at high prices. What’s driving the trend? Coinbase’s simply enormous and very public success in recent quarters. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">Everyone wants to fund the next Coinbase</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>First up, TechCrunch has been covering the African startup market with much more focus in recent quarters, as you may have noticed. Sadly, per our own Tage Kene-Okafor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/a-leaked-bill-for-nigerian-startups-reveals-a-theme-of-licenses-fees-fines-and-sentences/">news from a key nation in the African tech scene is not good</a>. New regulations that could land in Nigeria are more “concerning than friendly,” he writes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/"><strong>OnlyFans markets SFW app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, OnlyFans is known mostly for its adult content and monetization thereof, but there’s more to the service than just that. The company is pushing a porn-free app that is devoid of monetization to highlight content from its creators that you could watch at work. Let’s see how it performs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/"><strong>Maven earns unicorn horn:</strong></a><strong> </strong>On the back of a $110 million round co-led by Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital, Maven is now a unicorn. The startup’s valuation is “a rare landmark moment for women’s health, and women-led startups more broadly,” Natasha Mascarenhas wrote for TechCrunch. Maven focuses on comprehensive women’s health support.</li>
<li>More on Brazil in a moment, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brazils-nuvemshop-raises-500m-at-a-3-1b-valuation-months-after-last-raise/"><strong>Nuvemshop is now worth $3.1 billion after raising $500 million</strong></a> in a single round. Nuvemshop is a Brazilian e-commerce company that is often likened to a Shopify for the region. Its latest round was co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/aurora-propulsion-technologies-will-be-sending-up-space-junk-removal-tech-on-rocket-labs-electron-later-this-year/"><strong>Startup takes on space junk:</strong></a> The issue of space around our planet being full of, well, junk is being taken on by “Aurora Propulsion Technologies, a Finnish company that develops thrusters and de-orbiting modules for small satellites,” TechCrunch reports. Rocket Lab is handling the launch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/split-io-announces-50m-series-d-to-continue-growing-feature-flag-platform/"><strong>$50M for better feature flags:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are building an application, you may want to test new features with a limited set of users. Feature flags can help you do just that. The tech is big enough business that Split.io just landed eight figures of capital to keep building its business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/monte-carlo-closes-60m-series-c-on-the-back-of-rapid-arr-growth/"><strong>Monte Carlo proves that the data market is more than just lakes:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Data observability startup Monte Carlo just closed a $60 million round at four times the price that it raised its Series B earlier this year. The company has seen 8x ARR growth in the last year. The company is a reminder that for high-growth software, there is no limit to available capital in today’s market.</li>
<li>And because you’ve read this far, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/picnic-launches-its-first-robotic-pizza-sytem/">how about some robot pizzas?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What does Brazil’s new receivables regulation mean for fintechs?</h2>
<p>The Brazilian Central Bank made a major reform to the way payments are processed that may throw the doors open for e-commerce in South America&#8217;s largest market.</p>
<p>Historically, merchants who accepted credit card payments had two options: Receive the full payment distributed over two to 12 installments, or offer a deep discount to receive a smaller sum up front.</p>
<p>But in June 2021, the BCB created new &#8220;registration entities&#8221; that permit &#8220;any interested receivables buyer/acquirer to make an offer for those receivables, forcing buyers to become more competitive in their discount offers,&#8221; says Leonardo Lanna, head of payment products at Monkey Exchange.</p>
<p>The new framework benefits consumers and sellers, but for the region&#8217;s startups, &#8220;it opens the door to a plethora of opportunities and new business models, from payments to credit.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["With these self driving cars, it's only a matter of time before a country song is written about a guy's truck leaving him."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2010, Google&#8217;s autonomous vehicle project placed self-driving cars on Bay Area streets and freeways, but practical applications were thought to be at least a decade away.</p>
<p>The futurists were right on schedule: In 2020, Mountain View-based Nuro was testing its second-generation R2 robotic vehicle, the first to earn a federal exemption to operate an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>But before Nuro could even consider reaching product-market fit, its founders had to overcome technological challenges, win over regulators and strike partnerships with a range of consumer-facing companies.</p>
<p>“Neither JZ nor I think of ourselves as classic entrepreneurs or that starting a company is something we had to do in our lives,” says co-founder Dave Ferguson. “It was much more the result of soul searching and trying to figure out what is the biggest possible impact that we could have.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p>Across four articles, reporter Mark Harris (The Guardian, Wired, MIT Technology Review) explores Nuro&#8217;s origins and operations, including the founders&#8217; decision to focus on creating autonomous delivery vehicles instead of entering the passenger EV market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived inside the San Francisco Bay Area bubble for most of my adult life, so it&#8217;s interesting to see how people in Houston&#8217;s Woodland Heights neighborhood react to seeing Nuro&#8217;s R2 delivering pizza and prescriptions on a limited basis.</p>
<p>As one Redditor recently posted in r/houston: &#8220;With these self-driving cars, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before a country song is written about a guy&#8217;s truck leaving him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why bother to beat the competition when you can buy them outright?</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that if you were a fintech startup or, for lack of a better term, a digitally native financial services business, you might be eyeing an acquisition from an incumbent in the industry,&#8221; Ryan Lawler writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But lately, fintech upstarts are the ones doing the acquiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Salesforce announced last week that it plans to launch a video streaming service.</p>
<p>The industry analysts who enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed said the initiative has tremendous potential, but one noted that Salesforce will have to dig deep to compete in today&#8217;s crowded media landscape.</p>
<p>Salesforce hasn&#8217;t released details on the type of programming it plans to offer, but given its vast and diverse customer base, its options are many. Said Brent Leary of CRM Essentials:</p>
<p>“A customer could sponsor a show, advertise a show or possibly collaborate on a show. And have leads generated from the show [which could be] directly tied to the activity from those options and track ROI. And it’s all done on one platform. And the content lives on with ads living on with them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced two feature updates today to make it easier for people to find the content they&#8217;re looking for on the platform. This includes visual search features and easier discovery of foreign language videos that have captions in the user&#8217;s local language.</p>
<p>On desktop, YouTube users can hover over a video&#8217;s thumbnail and watch a brief clip play. This functionality will now extend to mobile with the added ability to browse the chapters within a video. From the search page, users can jump directly to the chapter they&#8217;re most interested in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter wp-image-2190724 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?w=393" alt="chapters appear in youtube search" width="393" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png 682w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=393,680 393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtubechapters.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re looking for a good sourdough recipe and want to work on your kneading technique. With these new search results, you can see all the steps in the video, from feeding the starter to pulling the bread out of the oven — and skip right to the chapter on kneading,&#8221; wrote Pablo Paniagua, director of Product Management, in a <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/next-phase-searching-youtube">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The other product update recommends videos in other languages to the user, so long as the video has captioning available in their language. So, to extend YouTube&#8217;s sourdough example, if you speak Icelandic and can&#8217;t find a good sourdough tutorial in your language, YouTube might recommend an English-language tutorial with Icelandic subtitles. To start, YouTube will supplement search results with English-language videos, but it plans to expand to more languages.</p>

<p>In India and Indonesia, YouTube is also testing a feature to complement search results with links to other sites from Google Search.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Not all searches may have enough high-quality or relevant video content to fully address what you’re looking for,&#8221; Paniagua explained.</p>
<p>Google Search already had a feature that let users skip to select moments in a video. Even late last year, Google (parent company to YouTube) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/google-pilots-a-search-feature-that-aggregates-short-form-videos-from-tiktok-and-instagram/">experimented</a> with a mobile search feature that would recommend short-form videos from TikTok and Instagram. But, the video would open within the search engine to keep users on Google, rather than opening the TikTok or Instagram apps.</p>

<p>These updates to YouTube&#8217;s search feature emerge in the midst of ongoing controversy around the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth">search algorithm</a>. Last month, Mozilla published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/youtubes-recommender-ai-still-a-horrorshow-finds-major-crowdsourced-study/">research</a> suggesting that YouTube&#8217;s algorithm continued to promote &#8220;bottom-feeding&#8221; content. Mozilla crowd-sourced data from participants who used a browser extension called <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/">RegretsReporter</a>, which asks users to self-report YouTube videos they wish they didn&#8217;t watch. Mozilla found that YouTube regrets were 60% higher in countries where English isn&#8217;t the primary language. Still, a representative from YouTube said that features that might potentially mitigate this &#8212; for example, recommending foreign videos with local language captions &#8212; were not developed in response to the Mozilla report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our teams have been working on these features for months with the goal of helping users find what they’re looking for, from how-tos to DIYs,&#8221; a spokesperson from YouTube said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fortnite now boasts its own version of one of the pandemic&#8217;s hottest games.</p>
<p>Fortnite-maker Epic just introduced into the game a new limited-time mode called Impostors; it follows the hit format that sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/among-us-launches-on-the-nintendo-switch/">Among Us</a> to Twitch&#8217;s front page — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">and Congress</a> — during the pandemic&#8217;s earlier days.</p>
<p>Up to 10 people can play the new Impostors game mode simultaneously, divided into two competing factions: agents and&#8230; impostors. Eight agents work to complete tasks around the new map before the two impostors can sabotage their efforts by eliminating agents and undoing their work. And because it&#8217;s Fortnite, you can also teleport players randomly around the map and turn everyone into a banana.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1RNbUaCKHA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The game takes place in a new interior map location that properly conjures the claustrophobic paranoia that makes the social deception-style game intense to play and fun to watch. During each round, the players come together to vote on who they think is secretly working against the agents, which generally leads to a lot of spicy conversation. Players can stick with a smaller group (by picking the private game mode) if they&#8217;d like to keep things intimate.</p>
<p>Happily, you can still try it out if you don&#8217;t have a group of friends to play with, though this kind of game works best with people you know. While public voice chat is off in the new mode, players in open matches can communicate through a quick chat box and the game&#8217;s emotes to vote on who they think has infiltrated the group.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too early to say if Fortnite&#8217;s Among Us clone will take off in the same way as the game that inspired it, or how long it&#8217;ll stick around. But considering that Fortnite is still one of the most popular games in the world, a new hit whodunnit game mode that&#8217;s eminently streamable is just icing on the cake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you’re a tech company offering anyone a service, somewhere in your future is a security assessment giving you the seal of approval to manage clients’ data and operate on your devices. No one takes security lightly anymore. The business costs of cyberattacks have now hit an <a href="https://qz.com/2039599/why-the-cost-of-getting-hacked-is-higher-than-ever/">all-time high</a>. Government bodies, companies and consumers need the assurance that the next software they download isn’t going to be an open door for hackers.</p>
<p>For good reason, security certifications like the SOC 3 really put you through the wringer. My company, Waydev, has just attained the SOC 3 certification, becoming one of the first development analytics tools to receive that accreditation. We learned so much from the process, we felt it was right to share our experience with others that might be daunted by the prospect.</p>
<p>As a non-tech founder, it was hard not only to navigate the process, but to appreciate its value. But by putting our business caps on, our team was able to optimize our approach and minimize the time and effort needed to achieve our goal. In doing so, we were granted SOC 3 compliance in two weeks, as opposed to the two months it takes some companies.</p>
<p>We also turned the assessment into an opportunity to better our product, align our internal teams, boost our brand and even launch partnerships.</p>
<p>So here’s our advice on how teams can smoothly reach an SOC 3 while simultaneously balancing workloads and minimizing disruption to users.</p>
<h2>First, bring your teams on board</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Because we can’t expect employees to stack those hours on top of their regular workdays, as a leader you have to accept — and communicate — that the speed of your output will inevitably decrease.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As a founder, you’ll be acting as captain steering a ship into that SOC 3 port, and you’ll need all members of your crew to join forces. This isn’t a job for a specially designated security team alone and will require deep involvement from your development and other teams, too. That might lead to internal resistance, as they still have a full-time job tending to your product and customers.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to start by being crystal clear with your employees about what this process will mean to their work lives. However, they have to embrace the true benefits that will arise. SOC 3 will immediately raise your brand&#8217;s appeal and likely see new customers come in as a result.</p>
<p>Each employee will also come out the other end with well-honed cybersecurity skills — they’ll have a deep understanding of potential cyber threats to the company, and all security initiatives will carry a far lighter burden. There&#8217;s also the sense of pride and fulfillment that comes with having an indisputable edge over your competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter introduced a new test feature Tuesday that allows users to report misinformation they run into on the platform, flagging it to the company as “misleading.” The test will roll out starting today to most users in the U.S., Australia and South Korea.</p>
<p>In the new test, Twitter users will be able to expand the three dot contextual menu in the upper right corner of a tweet to select &#8220;report tweet&#8221; where they&#8217;ll be met with the new option to flag a misleading tweet. The next menu offers users a choice to specify that a tweet is misleading about &#8220;politics,&#8221; &#8220;health&#8221; or &#8220;something else.&#8221; If they select politics, they can specify if the misleading political tweet pertains to elections and if they choose health they can flag a misleading tweet about COVID-19 specifically.</p>
<p>Twitter has added a way for users to report election-related misinformation before, though previously those options were temporary features linked to global elections. Back in 2019, the platform rolled out the option to report misleading tweets about voting to help safeguard elections <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/twitter-to-offer-report-option-for-misleading-election-tweets/">in Europe and India</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene temporarily for spreading vaccine misinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/marjorie-taylor-greene-mjt-twitter-suspension/embed/#?secret=nOhTx4UjRn" data-secret="nOhTx4UjRn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The intention is to give users a way to surface tweets that violate Twitter&#8217;s existing policies around election and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">pandemic-related misinformation</a>, two topics it focuses policy and enforcement efforts around. The user reporting system will work in tandem with Twitter’s proactive systems for identifying potentially dangerous misinformation, which rely on a combination of human and automated moderation. For now, users won’t receive any updates from the company on what happens to misleading tweets they report, though those updates could be added in the future.</p>
<p>While the new reporting feature will be available very broadly, the company describes the test as an “experiment,” not a finished feature. Twitter will observe how people on the platform use the new misinformation reporting tool to see if user reporting can be an effective tool for identifying potentially harmful misleading tweets, though the company isn’t on a set timeline for when to fully implement or remove the test feature.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YYiWGb7sMO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">Twitter broadly bans any COVID-19 tweets that could help the virus spread</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter broadly bans any COVID-19 tweets that could help the virus spread&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/embed/#?secret=YYiWGb7sMO" data-secret="YYiWGb7sMO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For now, Twitter doesn’t seem very worried about users abusing the feature, since the new user reporting option will plug directly into its established moderation system. Still, the idea of users pointing the company toward “misleading” tweets is sure to spark new cries of censorship from corners of the platform already prone to spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>While the option to flag tweets as misleading is new, the feature will feed reported tweets into Twitter’s existing enforcement flow, where its established rules around health and political misinformation are implemented through a blend of human and algorithmic moderation.</p>
<p>That process will also sort reported tweets for review based on priority. Tweets from users with large followings or tweets generating an unusually high level of engagement will go to the front of the review line, as will tweets that pertain to elections and COVID-19, Twitter’s two areas of emphasis when it comes to policing misinformation.</p>
<p>The new test is Twitter&#8217;s latest effort to lean more on its own community to identify misinformation. Twitter&#8217;s most ambitious experiment along those lines is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Birdwatch</a>, a crowdsourced way for users to append contextual notes and fact-checks to tweets that can be upvoted or downvoted, Reddit-style. For now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/twitter-starts-rolling-out-birdwatch-fact-checks-inside-tweets/">Birdwatch is just a pilot program</a>, but it&#8217;s clear the company is interested in decentralizing moderation — an experiment far thornier than just adding a new way to report tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth marketing is often misconceived as a set of tactics when it&#8217;s much more: It is a process that startups need to put in place in their early days that will scale as their customer base and internal teams grow.</p>
<p>This is where British growth agency <a href="https://ascendant.uk/">Ascendant</a> shines, Robyn Weatherley, head of marketing at <a href="https://www.thirdfort.com/">Thirdfort</a>, let us know via our growth marketing survey. Ascendant&#8217;s consultants haven&#8217;t just helped the British legal tech startup execute growth tactics, she <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/growth-roundup-investing-in-community-targeting-developers-new-marketer-recs/">wrote</a>: &#8220;They’ve helped us set up the framework to keep executing on those whether we are five, 50 or 500 people.&#8221; (If you too have growth marketers to recommend, please<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"> fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>

<p>We followed up on this recommendation by interviewing Ascendant co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fergus1/">Gus Ferguson</a> and partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssabc/">Alyssa Crankshaw</a> for our ongoing series of growth marketer profiles. If you are in the U.K., you might know them from the <a href="https://techlondon.io/">TechLondon</a> Slack community, or bumped into them pre-COVID at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Online-Marketing-London/">OMN London events</a>, the digital marketing meetups they co-organize. In the interview below, they share how they work with early-stage companies, including tactical planning and building out tools for marketers to use without taking up internal engineering resources.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>Can you tell us about your background and how you came to work with startups?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>I&#8217;ve been a digital marketer for the last 15 or 16 years, and in 2009, I started one of the first content marketing agencies in the U.K. We did a lot of work with big travel brands, but the problem was that in big corporates, teams are in silos, so they weren&#8217;t able to take advantage of being at the forefront of marketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>I was based in East London and I started working with a couple of startups. It&#8217;s also around that time that I partnered up with Alyssa. But we were looking at startups being hampered by traditional marketing &#8212; because traditional marketers were bringing big corporate problems to startups, when their key strength is their nimbleness and their agility and their ability to adapt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when we started developing processes for basically building businesses from scratch &#8212; when you don&#8217;t have any historical data to base your marketing strategies on. We were saying to them: Don&#8217;t ask us for a 12-month plan, because it&#8217;s a waste of time. But because there was that mindset at the time, that&#8217;s just what people expected. So we were going in and saying: You need a broad three-month plan, maximum; then a one-month plan in detail, and ideally a two-week sprint.</p>
<p><b>What kind of clients does Ascendant work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Thanks to the growth framework that we&#8217;ve built up over time, we can pretty much work with any new business where there&#8217;s no existing process for marketing. We work with fintech, healthcare and legal companies, e-commerce brands, and both B2C and B2B. So startups, but also startup-type businesses. For instance, we worked with corporate ventures like Canon and VCs like Forward Partners, which was really interesting learning, because we were working with earlier-stage businesses than we would normally.</p>
<p>One million in funding is our sweet spot for startups. The reason for that is that it costs money to bring experienced growth experts into business, and up to that point, I believe it is important for founders to understand growth themselves. Being able to understand how to do it at that early stage will create such a valuable foundation of audience centricity for that business moving forward. A lot of what we do is bringing audience centricity into product-focused businesses &#8212; and generally encouraging founders to think about why their audience should care that they&#8217;ve got a solution to their problem.</p>
<p><b>Right, &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; is a mistake that founders make all the time! Could you give more details on how you help them?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Generally we&#8217;ll look at whatever they have as a foundation, and at similar businesses, and we&#8217;ll create an initial growth model. We&#8217;ll start putting hypotheses in place as to which channels are going to be the most effective at hitting their short-term objectives if they have them ready. But often, part of the process is also defining which metrics matter for that business, and working out how to measure them.</p>
<p>We always start working with founders and sales, and generally before or with one first marketing hire in place. Part of our work is to come up with projected results based on their funnel, but very often, with product-centric businesses, it will be that funnel that&#8217;s missing. So we bring in a bit of funnel thinking to those businesses and get that in place.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p>And then there&#8217;s all sorts of what we call framework building that needs to be in place before you can start doing more traditional campaign-based marketing. So we&#8217;ll start looking at the specific frameworks around data, and how to form an objective truth for that business, with a shared understanding of the key metrics. When nobody knows what the fundamental data framework of that business looks like, for instance, because of team turnover or silos, we&#8217;ll tighten that up and make sure that everything is functioning together so that things like marketing automation are possible.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s perhaps a bit surprising about siloed teams at an early stage; how big are the startups you work with?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>We start when they are small, but we keep our clients for a long time. So, for example, we worked with <a href="https://www.elder.org/">Elder,</a> which is a health tech startup. When we started off with them, there were 12 people, and when we finished with them, there were hundreds of people. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/soldo/">Soldo</a> is another example: When we started the marketing team was one person, and by the time we left, they were spanning three floors at WeWork.</p>
<p>Our lifecycle ends at Series B, because at that point, all the frameworks will be in place and they&#8217;ll be bringing everything in-house. So that&#8217;s our happy ending when the clients get to huge Series B raises. And then we move on to the next one that needs our help to get there.</p>
<p>But to go back to your question, slips happen because these are very venture-backed companies with very high growth not just in customers but also in their internal teams. Everybody is doing everything, everybody is new at their jobs, and there aren&#8217;t very many internal processes, so there&#8217;s an element of chaos. That&#8217;s where the need for cross-functional teams grew from &#8212; to step out of everybody&#8217;s individual chaotic worlds and create an island of shared objectives and order.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189509" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189509" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2189509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?w=270" alt="Alyssa Crankshaw - Ascendant" width="270" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png 306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Alyssa-bw.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189509" class="wp-caption-text">Alyssa Crankshaw. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ascendant</p></div></p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw: </b>It&#8217;s just important for us to make people communicate. We often end up actually becoming a reason for the whole team to talk to each other &#8212; because we are external, they see more value in these tasks that they wouldn&#8217;t do otherwise.</p>
<p><b>How does that work in practice?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>An example of that is the CMS system we are putting in place for one client that we&#8217;re working with at the moment, where salespeople use it, marketing people use it, customer services people use it &#8212; and those teams were fairly siloed beforehand.</p>
<p>We also know that probably one of the biggest barriers to growth is marketers being dependent on developers, which are such a rare resource. We address that by implementing marketing frameworks at a basic level of the business whereby marketers are able to at least control basic marketing operations directly.</p>
<p>But one of the most important processes that we bring in is the cross-functional team, with one stakeholder from each department. It means that there&#8217;s at least one person on each team who understands what the objectives are, and then people start problem-solving together.</p>
<p><b>Didn&#8217;t that become more difficult with COVID-19?</b></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Potentially it got easier with remote. Usually, we find one person on each team — generally the team&#8217;s leader — and we bring them as spokespersons into the cross-functional team. In a remote world, it&#8217;s actually easier because you can just all jump on Zoom calls.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: Even before COVID, we weren&#8217;t the type of consultants who sit several days a week in their client&#8217;s office. We are problem-solvers across the company, and we&#8217;ve always done that, whether it was from our old office or remotely now.</p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Our own model also proved exceptionally flexible when we needed it to be during the pandemic. We are a core team of three people, and we are working with a network of specialized freelancers &#8212; so instead of worrying about fixed overheads, we can have agreements with trusted partners and morph into whatever our clients need at that time. Because of the nature of startups, as I said earlier, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to have long-term plans for businesses where there&#8217;s such a high rate of change. And from an agency perspective, it means that what we&#8217;re doing one month is always very different from what we&#8217;re doing the next month.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: It&#8217;s a conscious decision not to follow a traditional agency model, because it helps us be flexible and bring in the specialists when we need them, rather than just having to use that person that sits on your payroll just because you have them. It&#8217;s much more effective for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a thing that people might not know about what you do?</strong></p>
<p><b>Gus Ferguson: </b>Growth marketing is a process; it&#8217;s really how I differentiate it from traditional marketing. A lot of people will say that growth marketing is the AARRR funnel, but is that really any different from traditional marketing? Not really. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a broader set of channels than a traditional marketer would focus on. But what&#8217;s really different is the process that gives our clients confidence that they&#8217;re doing the right thing, even if they&#8217;ve never done it before. Because that&#8217;s how you learn.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with doing something new for the first time, in a team of people who are also doing a new thing for the first time with no historical data, is that you quite often don&#8217;t even know how to frame that. If you don&#8217;t come from a growth marketing background, you don&#8217;t know how to even frame the problem, let alone fix it. This is why so much startup marketing is tactical rather than strategic, or even worse, tool-led. People think: &#8220;Oh, if I was using this tool, then all my problems would be solved,&#8221;  when, actually, you need to be able to create the hypotheses and understand the objectives that the hypotheses are answering.</p>
<p><b>Alyssa Crankshaw</b>: We give our clients the roadmap, the foundation and the operational structure in which to run campaigns, retention, acquisition or whatever the target may be, which is huge for them. Because when creating everything from scratch, that&#8217;s where we often see a lot of overtesting. We love a good test &#8212; we&#8217;re both marketers &#8212; but we only like to test the big things. And sometimes when working with inexperienced people, we see a lot of new tests about the smallest things, which is a waste of time and resources. And there are some other things that are foundational, and you just know which they are if you are an experienced marketer and you have done this so many times in your life.</p>

The program now has its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/08/apple-selects-15-black-and-brown-owned-businesses-for-impact-accelerator/">first 15 participants</a>, gathered from all over the country for a three-month program and a shot at an Apple contract.</p>
<p>The Impact Accelerator is part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/">$100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative</a>, which is being divided between a number of efforts, some directly funding existing programs, some going to venture firms owned by people of color, and generally whatever the Initiative&#8217;s team thinks is a good investment.</p>
<p>These companies will take part in a three-month-long virtual program (the details are not discussed in Apple&#8217;s announcement post) and then will have the opportunity to become suppliers for Apple&#8217;s carbon neutral supply chain goals.</p>

		Leonardo Lanna is head of payment products at <a href="https://www.monkey.exchange/">Monkey Exchange</a>, a Brazilian marketplace startup that enables sellers to offer receivables from sales in a single platform to many buyers at once, receiving the best price with low effort. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Something strange is afoot in Brazil, and it promises great changes for how merchants get paid.</p>
<p>This the story of one regulator, the Brazilian Central Bank, and how it has taken center stage in creating a framework that will have far-reaching effects across merchants and fintechs in this fast-growing Latin American nation.</p>
<p>But first, some background: Unlike in the rest of the world, when a credit card is used for payment in Brazil, the merchant does not receive the funds owed to them all at once. Instead, nearly 50% of card sales are completed in monthly installments, leaving the sellers to manage a difficult cash flow process.</p>
<p>The most common solution for merchants is that they end up selling the remaining receivable at a discount — taking less than they are owed — in order to get their money sooner. And we’re not talking about a small-volume market: Some R$2 trillion (Brazilian Reais) in card transactions were processed in 2020.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			This compelling new regulatory framework brings new opportunities for many players willing to participate in receivables discounting operations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like in practice: Let&#8217;s say Maria purchases a few articles of clothing from retailer Clothing Incorporated. When paying via her credit card at checkout, Maria can choose to pay in two to 12 installments. Maria decides to pay the balance of R$620 over six installments.</p>
<p>While Maria is happy with the products in hand, Clothing Incorporated is without the full payment — and for small merchants in particular, the difficulties associated with limited working capital can be acute. Clothing Incorporated can either wait the full six months to be paid, receiving payments from their merchant acquirer each month until they are paid in full, or they can choose to dramatically discount the amount they are owed and not have to wait the six months.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say Clothing Incorporated merchant acquirer is ExMarko — instead of receiving R$620 over six months (net of any merchant discount rates), they could receive R$520 within days after the purchase, with ExMarko pocketing the rest when it comes in. This comes at a steep cost of doing business to the merchant, with an implied annualized interest rate that sometimes can reach  ~70% — for a risk-free operation, since the acquirer is only liquidating earlier its own obligation to pay the merchant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s no secret that Google is in the midst of a pretty massive overhaul of its Pixel division. The Pixel 6 offers the next major Hail Mary for the company’s hardware division, complete with its own custom chip, Tensor.</p>
<p>This is not that. The new flagship won’t be available until the fall. Meantime, here’s the 5a, the latest addition to the “budget flagship” line that’s proven a nice overall sales boost for a struggling department.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190622" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190622" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2190622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png" alt="" width="1000" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=768,295 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=680,261 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/blog_image_P5aCase_2021Q2_21_0306_04902_PD.max-1000x1000_bcclwt3.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190622" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google confirmed the phone’s existence back in April, mostly as a way of curbing rumors prematurely predicting the unannounced handset’s death. “Pixel 5a 5G is not canceled,” the company told TechCrunch at the time. “It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.”</p>
<p>And, indeed, here it is. The handset officially goes on sale August 26 for $449. <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel5a-with-5g-new-google-phone/">The Pixel 5a with 5G</a> is, in a word, “safe” &#8212; a fact highlighted by the recent announcement of the Pixel 6. This is very much not a phone from a company looking to shake things up, but rather, the remnants of a division that was content to play right down the middle in the smartphone wars. Safe isn’t a bad word &#8212; particularly not at this price point. It’s sturdy (now with IP67 water resistance!) and it’ll get the job done.</p>

<p>As the name very clearly implies, the price includes 5G connectivity. That’s coupled with a dual-camera &#8212; with the same 12- and 16-megapixel setup as the Pixel 5. Those perform a slew of software-enabled modes, including Night Sight, Live HDR+ and Portrait Light. The phone is powered by the same mid-tier Snapdragon 765G process, while the RAM has been reduced down to 6GB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Storage is the same at 128GB and, interestingly, the battery has actually been bumped up from 4080 mAh to 4680. The screen, too, has been expanded from 6.0 to 6.34 inches, with the same resolution. It drops the Pixel 5’s wireless charging, but hey, there’s a headphone jack.</p>
<p>The Pixel 5a with 5G is up for preorder starting today.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">IKEA won&#8217;t just sell you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-28-ikea-smart-lighting-range-uk.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">smart lights</a> — it&#8217;ll soon sell you the electricity to power those lights, provided you live in the right country. <em>Electrek</em> <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/17/ikea-is-now-selling-clean-energy-to-swedish-households-no-allen-key-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">notes</a> that IKEA has <a href="https://www.ingka.com/news/sweden-first-ikea-market-to-start-offering-electricity-from-wind-and-solar-through-stromma-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">revealed</a> plans to sell clean energy to Swedish homes through a Strömma subscription service. Pay the (as yet unmentioned) fee and you&#8217;ll get certified solar- or wind-generated electricity with usage you can track through a mobile app.</p>
<p>The home furnishings giant didn&#8217;t say whether it would expand the clean energy sales to other countries, although it hoped to let people &#8220;use and generate&#8221; renewable energy in &#8220;all our Ingka Group markets&#8221; by 2025. The company already sells solar panels.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The retailer is no stranger to eco-friendly efforts. It stopped selling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-01-ikea-to-sell-only-led-based-lighting-by-2016.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">non-LED lights</a> and will soon drop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-stop-selling-alkaline-batteries-by-october-2021-153546827.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">non-rechargeable alkaline batteries</a>. It&#8217;s even planning to turn a Swedish city <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-swedish-sustainable-community-152015989.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1">into a sustainable community</a>. And there&#8217;s little doubt this will help burnish IKEA&#8217;s public image. It can address concerns about the chain&#8217;s environmental impact by serving as a clean energy source.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a significant move, though, and we wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other larger stores followed suit. It&#8217;s not just a feel-good effort that could reduce emissions — sales of excess clean energy could recoup costs and boost profits.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We are brainstorming a new solution to a widespread challenge in many countries: How to develop a self-sustaining, independent local tech ecosystem. We propose that governments should systematically support funding for their diaspora founders, not just founders locally.</p>
<p>There are three main players in any tech ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first are founders who want to build companies and need funding. In many ecosystems outside of the major tech hubs, founders face cultural, legal, reputational and other hurdles to building a successful tech company. As a result, many of them emigrate to the U.S. Immigrants contribute to the success of the U.S. innovation economy at a vastly <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/kauffman_compilation_immigration_entrepreneurship.pdf">disproportionate</a> rate.</li>
<li>Next are VC firms looking for founders. In a very small number of geographies, there is no shortage of VC funds (NY, CA, Boston, Israel, Beijing). But in most cities in the world, there is only a relatively small number of VC funds.</li>
<li>Then you have national and local governmental organizations interested in promoting economic growth and job creation. They particularly want to see a thriving tech ecosystem generating high-paid jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our proposal is that many governments that are not major tech hubs (i.e., most countries excluding the U.S., China, Israel and India) should stop restricting themselves to supporting locally domiciled VC funds.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Many countries’ governments (Canada, France, etc.) have created or supported funds to invest in local VC managers. Usually, governments have a two-part goal: Achieve good returns and generate jobs. However, in many cases, these VC funds have failed on one or both counts.</p>
<p>There is a reason the definitive book on the topic has such a depressing title: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boulevard-Broken-Dreams-Entrepreneurship-Failed/dp/0691154538">&#8220;Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Why Public Efforts to Boost Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Have Failed — and What to Do about It,&#8221;</a> by my former professor, Josh Lerner, head of the entrepreneurial management unit and the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking at Harvard Business School.</p>
<blockquote><p>Silicon Valley, Singapore, Tel Aviv ― the global hubs of entrepreneurial activity ―all bear the marks of government investment. Yet, for every public intervention that spurs entrepreneurial activity, there are many failed efforts that waste untold billions in taxpayer dollars … [The book] reveals the common flaws undermining far too many programs ― poor design, a lack of understanding for the entrepreneurial process, and implementation problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our proposal is that many governments that are not major tech hubs (i.e., most countries excluding the U.S., China, Israel and India) should stop restricting themselves to supporting locally domiciled VC funds. Instead, they should consider investing in VC funds that invest in their diaspora.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We argue that this benefits the home country in three ways:</p>
<p><strong>Remittances:</strong> Entrepreneurs will send money home to their families.</p>
<p><strong>Brain gain:</strong> If you look at the leaders of the tech ecosystem in most countries, you will see a very disproportionate number of people who have education and work experience abroad, especially in the U.S. Diaspora entrepreneurs bring the knowledge and understanding acquired outside the country that may help them see possibilities not apparent to people who have not lived elsewhere. On the other hand, these entrepreneurs often encounter entrenched attitudes, resentment from non-migrants, and administrative barriers in bringing money, materials and equipment from abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Job creation:</strong> Even if a French emigrant starts their business in New York, when they expand, France will be a logical place for a European HQ. In addition, as the firm grows, there are many functions they may set up in their home country, such as engineering, QA and customer support.</p>
<p>The private sector has already identified this opportunity. In New York City, there already exist numerous VC funds with particular interest in certain diasporas. For Israel, we have <a href="http://www.elevatorfund.com/">Elevator Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.hanacovc.com/">Hanaco</a>, <a href="http://www.innovationendeavors.com/">Innovation Endeavors</a>, <a href="http://janvest.com/">JANVEST Capital Partners</a>, <a href="http://www.peregventures.com/">Pereg Ventures</a>, <a href="https://team8.vc/">Team8</a>, numerous others. See <a href="https://www.israel21c.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-us-investor-programs-in-israeli-startups/">&#8220;The ultimate guide to US investment in Israeli startups.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>For the Canadian diaspora, you have <a href="https://inovia.vc/">iNovia Capital</a> and <a href="http://hofvc.com">HOF Capital</a> for people from MENA, while <a href="http://fvc.com">ff Venture Capital</a> looks at Poland.</p>
<p>Governments could model these efforts on leading global public/private organizations that have supported diaspora entrepreneurs in many other ways.</p>
<p><strong>Networking, mentoring and training:</strong> Governments can offer opportunities for diaspora and local business leaders to meet one another and discuss potential business and investment opportunities in the homeland. Many of these groups also offer startup services such as market research, business plan advisory, matching with seasoned executives and registering a business. A few such groups are the <a href="https://africandiasporanetwork.org/">African Diaspora Network</a> (ADN), <a href="https://tie.org/">The Indus Entrepreneurs</a> (TiE) (Southeast Asia), <a href="https://advance.org">Advance</a> (Australia) based in New York, <a href="https://www.thec100.org/">C100</a> (focused on Canadian tech leaders), <a href="https://www.globalscot.com/home">GlobalScot</a>, <a href="https://www.ireland101.com/mentoring/register">Irish Executive Mentorship Program</a> and <a href="https://www.gob.mx/ime/acciones-y-programas/red-global-mx">Red de Talentos Mexicanos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investment</strong> (almost entirely in the home country): Investment is typically in the form of pooled private and public funds, or matching grants, and typically requires a physical presence in the home country. A few such organizations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.afford-uk.org/">African Foundation for Development</a> (AFFORD) was founded in 1994 as a nonprofit organization by Africans living in the U.K. to help expatriates there create wealth and jobs back home. Its investment activities include the Diaspora Finance Initiative (DFI), AFFORD Diaspora Grants and the AFFORD Business Club.</li>
<li>Moldova has a <a href="https://www.odimm.md/ro/pare">Pare 1+1</a> program that offers funding and entrepreneurial training to immigrants (and returnees) into Moldova.</li>
<li><a href="https://chileglobalventures.cl/portafolio/">Chile Global Ventures</a> (part of Fundación Chile) finances startups through its network of over 100 influential Chileans living in the U.S., Canada and Europe. They invest in Chilean startups or companies abroad founded by Chileans.</li>
<li><a href="https://migrationsmartpractices.ifrc.org/smart-practice/fondo-concursable-el-cucayo-ecuador/">Ecuador’s Fund El Cucayo</a> provides risk capital in a matching-funding format, 50-50 or 25-75, to returning Ecuadorian entrepreneurs in Ecuador.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recruiting new citizens: </strong>The Canadian <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa.html">Startup Visa Program</a> is great for recruiting international talent. This is an enormous opportunity for Canada to further leverage its historic openness to immigrants. From my point of view as an American, our history of welcoming immigrants (including my French father) is one of our greatest advantages compared to our geopolitical rivals. We’re fools if we don’t aggressively leverage this unique asset.</p>
<p>So here’s our question: Which forward-thinking governments are open to the idea of supporting funding to their diaspora? In our conversations with some senior government officials outside of the U.S., what we’ve heard is, “We love the idea, but it would be difficult to get political support for anything that involves sending money abroad.”</p>
<p>Who can surmount this challenge?</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There are many high-quality tech companies being built in Brazil with very experienced management teams and very exciting stories that will capture the hearts and wallets of Brazilian … investors."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil’s startup market is reaching new heights, and its domestic stock market could benefit from the boom.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/07/venture-pulse-q2-2021.pdf">data from KPMG</a>, Brazilian startups raised the most capital in a single quarter in Q1 2021, when some $1.4 billion flowed into domestic technology upstarts. That record stood until the second quarter of 2021 saw $2.7 billion raised by Brazilian startups.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Inflows are only half of the startup equation, however. Brazil has seen notable acquisitions in recent years, including <a href="https://contxto.com/en/brazil/silicon-valley-twilio-buys-brazilian-startup-teravoz/">Twilio buying Teravoz in January 2020</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/etsy-acquires-elo7-known-as-the-etsy-of-brazil-for-217m/">Etsy buying Elo7</a> in June for more than $200 million. Magazine Luiza <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kabum-m-a-magazine-luiza/brazils-magazine-luiza-to-buy-e-commerce-retailer-kabum-for-200-million-idUSKBN2EL1FU">spent $528 million to buy Kabum</a>, a Brazilian e-commerce player, earlier this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Acquisitions are merely one path to liquidity, however. IPOs are another. The good news for Brazil and its startup ecosystem is that despite a historical dearth of technology public offerings on domestic exchanges, the IPO market for Brazilian tech startups could be gearing up for more volume.</p>
<p>GetNinjas, a platform for hiring local labor for household needs like plumbing and painting, went public earlier this year on the B3 exchange, located in São Paulo. And it’s not alone.</p>
<p>The IPO market in Brazil is changing, data indicates. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/will-brazils-roaring-20s-see-the-rise-of-early-stage-startups/">noted last year</a> that in the decade leading up to 2020, just two of the 56 IPOs in Brazil were technology companies. More recently, the number of technology companies listed in the country <a href="https://invest.exame.com/me/empresas-de-tecnologia-dominam-ipos-e-quadruplicam-em-dois-anos-na-b3">has swelled to at least 16</a>, up from just four in 2019.</p>
<p>Will the trend of domestic IPOs continue for Brazilian technology companies? Or will U.S. IPOs play a preeminent role for the country’s leading tech startups?</p>
<p>The question is not idle, with São Paulo-based fintech giant Nubank heading toward an eventual public offering and more capital than ever wagered on the country’s current generation of startups, all of which must aspire to the most famous of exit paths. Brazil is also minting new unicorns, with <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/unico-becomes-a-new-brazilian-unicorn-and-the-fifth-invested-by-softbank/">at least four graduating</a> to the valuation threshold this year alone.</p>
<p>But even that data point is outdated: Just this morning, Nuvemshop, a Brazilian e-commerce company, announced a <a href="https://labsnews.com/en/articles/business/nuvemshop-new-unicorn/">new $500 million round</a> valuing it at more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>To better understand the recently expanding number of domestically listed Brazilian technology offerings, and what could be ahead for the country’s startups, The Exchange spoke to GetNinjas CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardolhotellier/?originalSubdomain=br">Eduardo L&#8217;Hotellier</a> about its IPO and <a href="https://twitter.com/rquintini">Renata Quintini</a> from <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/">Renegade Partners</a>, a venture capital firm, about what’s happening in the country. We’ll lean on data as we go. Let’s explore Brazil!</p>
<h2>What’s driving rising technology IPO volume in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The number of public companies, overall depressed compared to historical highs in the Brazilian market, is impacted by both sector-specific and more macro trends. When we consider what is driving more technology offerings in Brazil, we’ll want to think about larger macroeconomic factors along with what’s happening in technology more specifically.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnlyFans — the platform where adult creators can directly monetize their audience — is pushing its safe-for-work app OFTV, which is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oftv/id1521600438">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zype.oftvandroid&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>. The ad-free app launched in January, sharing over 800 videos from OnlyFans creators, like cooking tutorials, yoga routines and interviews. But this week will be the first time that OnlyFans will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost">market the app</a> to reach people who aren&#8217;t existing OnlyFans customers.</p>
<p>“There’s no adult content on OFTV. Because it’s not being monetized and there’s no direct impact on creators’ earnings, we are able to be in the app store,&#8221; OnlyFans CEO Tim Stokely told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/onlyfans-creates-its-first-app-with-a-twist-no-nudity-no-cost">Bloomberg</a>. The App Store and Google Play both prohibit pornography, but in the case of apps with user-generated content (like Reddit), NSFW content can slide as long as it&#8217;s labeled as such and hidden by default. OnlyFans, as it exists on the web, hasn&#8217;t been approved on Apple&#8217;s App Store or Google Play.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190588" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190588" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="750" height="599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=768,613 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=1536,1227 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/oftv.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OFTV (screenshots by TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>OnlyFans is profitable, but to continue to grow, it is seeking funding at a valuation of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/onlyfans-is-said-to-seek-funding-at-valuation-above-1-billion?sref=lAVQtUwz">over $1 billion</a>. Per Bloomberg, OnlyFans wants to become a more mainstream platform in order to solicit advertisers that may be worried about its adult reputation. Even celebrities like Cardi B and athlete Floyd Mayweather Jr. have joined OnlyFans. In March 2020, the app also launched a Creative Fund, which rewarded four musical artists with a <a href="https://blog.onlyfans.com/meet-the-winners-of-the-creative-fund/">£20,000 grant</a>. Plus, the &#8220;<a href="https://blog.onlyfans.com/july-2021-rising-stars-on-onlyfans/">rising stars</a>&#8221; the app features on its blog include songwriters, photographers, stylists, personal trainers and chefs. Its effort to highlight SFW creators is clear, and the promotion of OFTV supports that.</p>
<p>The platform has paid out more than $3 billion in creator earnings since its founding in 2016 — in particular, revenue grew <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/onlyfans-lockdown-boom-transactions-hit-24b-revenue-up-553-2021-4">over 553%</a> in 2020, when many people turned to OnlyFans for an income stream in a time of pandemic-induced financial strain. OnlyFans takes 20% from creators&#8217; earnings; comparatively, Patreon charges between 5-12%, while Cameo takes 25%. Even if OnlyFans were accepted to app stores — NSFW content and all — it may not even be good for creators, who would then lose an extra 30% to app store fees on top of the platform&#8217;s 20% cut. But OFTV doesn&#8217;t sell content or allow unsolicited users to upload videos, so its apparent purpose is to generate more excitement around non-pornographic OnlyFans content.</p>
<p>To appeal to SFW creators, OnlyFans might have to shed its image (for those concerned with that), but perhaps more importantly, the platform would need to show that it is a particularly profitable space for creators. Its sales speak volumes, but that could have more to do with the booming creator economy and the nature of the content it hosts, rather than the platform itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For Kate Ryder, the founder of women’s health clinic and benefits platform Maven, business is personal. During the first year of building her company, Ryder experienced a miscarriage. Maven began offering support for pregnancy loss and high-risk care management as the founder herself waded through the emotions and confusion of it.</p>
<p>Ryder was then a Maven “customer” for her following three pregnancies, using the platform for after-hours advice, virtual access to specialists or, more recently, guidance on how to prepare for a breech birth. As a founder-turned-repeat-customer, Ryder gained a key perspective on parenthood: it’s a diverse experience.</p>
<p>The insights were poured back into her business, a platform that offers services addressing everything from fertility to family care. And today, Maven is making history in its own way.</p>
<p>Maven announced that it has raised $110 million in a Series D financing co-led by Dragoneer Investment Group and Lux Capital. BOND also participated in the round, alongside existing investors, including Sequoia, Oak HC/FT and Icon Ventures. Oprah Winfrey also invested in the round, bringing Maven’s total known funding to date to $200 million.</p>
<p>The financing event valued Maven at $1 billion, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">a rare landmark</a> moment for women’s health, and women-led startups more broadly.</p>
<h2>Maven</h2>
<p>After raising one of the largest Series C rounds <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maven-raises-45-million-in-series-c-one-of-the-largest-funding-rounds-for-female-led-womens-and-family-health-company-301007525.html">for women’s health startups in 2020</a>, Maven’s latest financing came after some strong growth.</p>
<p>The startup said that it has partnered with five new Fortune 15 clients, including Microsoft, and has achieved a near 100% retention rate. While the company didn’t disclose client growth more specifically, it did say that membership in its employer and payer-sponsored clinical problems increased 400% year over year &#8212; suggesting that revenue similarly grew as the company hit larger scale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While COVID-19 refocused women’s health as a top priority, Maven began when that wasn’t a baseline assumption. The company was founded in 2014 to help working women plan and start families. It started by selling to employers as a benefits platform, which it still does today &#8212; the idea being that women could turn to their employers to get access to a network of women’s health and family health provider networks.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qNudwhKIg7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=qNudwhKIg7" data-secret="qNudwhKIg7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The focus has aged well as companies rethink health benefits in the wake of the coronavirus, which has disproportionately seen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/women-pandemic-harris.html">women depart from the workforce</a>. Ryder says this wasn’t always the case, noting how many rejections she got in the early years of building.</p>
<p>After five years, Maven has grown to offer support services ranging from preconception to post-pregnancy to family care. Companies are able to offer their employees access to 30 different provider types, which include OB-GYNs, pediatricians, therapists and career coaches. Because the options can be overwhelming, Maven also introduced care advocates &#8212; people whose entire job it is to support existing patients in navigating the resources.</p>
<p>“For anyone who says that telemedicine isn&#8217;t important in this user journey is somebody who is not really deeply immersed in the needs of the patient,” Ryder said. “A new mom, particularly in childbirth recovery, has a baby and can&#8217;t really get out of bed and has all of these needs&#8230; There’s no better time to use telemedicine.”</p>
<p>More than 2,000 doctors, caretakers and specialists exist in Maven’s network, a total that represents over 250 subspecialties, from egg donor consultants to fertility awareness educators. The startup has served over 10 million women and families to date.</p>
<p>A growing focus for Maven is being able to match its members to providers who are culturally aware and relatable to them. Black women, for example, face higher mortality rates compared to their white counterparts &#8212;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nathalie-walton-expectful-seed/"> a factoid that seeded another startup</a>, Expectful, to pivot its focus.</p>
<p>Ryder said that 40% of Maven’s providers are BIPOC, and can speak across 30 languages.</p>
<p>Even with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">introduction of white-labeling services</a> that make it easier for competitors to spin up telehealth services overnight, Ryder said Maven wants to stick to hiring in a more incremental way. The startup accepts about 35% of provider applications that it gets, she said.</p>
<p>“If we were starting today, we’d look at [outsourcing] platforms because we’d need it to compete in the market &#8212; we have the benefit of starting in 2014, when we were able to take our time and just be really thoughtful about the types of providers that work with Maven.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hormonal health is a massive opportunity: Where are the unicorns?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/embed/#?secret=T4eicq1s5n" data-secret="T4eicq1s5n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The rise of competition makes Maven’s status as a unicorn more broadly relevant, with investors thinking it could prove opportunity in women’s health and give the growing sector a fresh consolidator to acquire some startups.</p>
<h2>The rising tide</h2>
<p>Maven’s raise wasn’t only a milestone from a fundraising perspective, but also a board perspective. Most of the startup’s investors are women and mothers, she noted &#8212; a bright spot when looking at data that suggests that nearly half of private companies don’t even <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/2020-diversity-study-on-private-company-boards/">have a woman on the board at all. </a></p>
<p>Deena Shakir, partner at lead investor Lux Capital, said this was her largest check to date into a startup.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dmpQY6psdI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">Mental wellness platform Lyra Health is raising up to $175M at a $2.25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental wellness platform Lyra Health is raising up to $175M at a $2.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=dmpQY6psdI" data-secret="dmpQY6psdI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“The idea of the woman as the primary decision maker in healthcare is just part of my overall thesis around women&#8217;s health,” Shakir said. “A woman is more than just, obviously, her reproductive identity &#8212; that’s for sure.” As well-funded startups in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/mental-wellness-platform-lyra-health-is-raising-up-to-175m-at-a-2-25b-valuation/">mental health</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">musculoskeletal</a> worlds &#8212; two other top priorities for employers &#8212; kept growing, Shakir felt like maternal health was the last top cost center that employers needed to address.</p>
<p>Maven is compelling to Shakir because of how comprehensive it is, which she thinks is increasingly important as new vendors and point solutions enter the market and exhaust employers through decision fatigue.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just in maternity and it&#8217;s not just in fertility, and not just in pedes or mental health,” she added. Maven’s language is already starting to look more broad in branding, moving from women’s health to family and child health. “There’s also male infertility, couples therapy, and beyond the gender binary&#8230;it&#8217;s very sensitive to providing inclusive care for everyone.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Ro’s acquisition of Modern Fertility</a> showed that hormonal health and women’s health are being looked at as an attractive opportunity for digital health startups more broadly.</p>
<p>“Ro started off as men’s health,” Shakir said. “I’m excited for when it’s going to be the women&#8217;s health company that&#8217;s going to be making the other, you know, several $100 million acquisitions here.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Christina Farr</a> covered the rise of digital health as a journalist for CNBC before leaving her post to become an investor at OMERS Ventures, which does not have a stake in Maven.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A2waK0F0bk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/">Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ro acquires Modern Fertility in a deal north of $225 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/embed/#?secret=A2waK0F0bk" data-secret="A2waK0F0bk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As a reporter, Farr said that one of the things she would often hear is that women’s health was too niche as an investment category.</p>
<p>“Which is obviously upsetting, and just not true,” Farr said. “How could you ever refer to 50% of the population as niche on top of the fact that women are the primary buyers of healthcare services in their household &#8212; to me that’s just an ignorant perspective.”</p>
<p>Farr said that she’s not aware of any other companies in the digital health, women’s health space that have raised this much money with a female-founder. “I believe at this stage, the CEO became a man,” she said, of another startup. Long-term, Farr thinks that Maven has the potential to bring together a lot of the different point solutions for women and family health under one roof, whether it&#8217;s postpartum recovery or physical health.</p>
<p>“In my mind, these companies can exist in their own right, but there&#8217;s also an incredible value to pulling together all of us in one kind of platform in one place,” she said. “I think a big kind of potential area for Maven is to be a navigator for all the women’s health solutions that are out there.”</p>
<p>Ryder maintains that her personal experience has given her a lot of opinions &#8212; ones that she thinks have helped the company stay focused, even in the wake of new competition and potential acquisitions.</p>
<p>“We know what we stand for, we know what we do for patients, we know that our care model works, and so we&#8217;re unwilling to kind of bend,” she said. “If there’s the latest shininess that everyone goes rushing for that doesn’t help the patient, then we’re not going to run towards it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monterey Car Week wrapped up on Sunday with the return of the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance. A black 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurrier took top honors at the show, now in its 70th year, held on the golf course overlooking the Pacific Ocean. But it was the electric hypercars and high-performance hybrids, not the historics that stood out this year.</p>
<p>Over the years, the glitz and glam of Pebble Beach has ballooned into a week of activities around racing, displaying, parading and selling cars throughout the picturesque Monterey Peninsula. Last year, car week was canceled. This year, despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Champagne was flowing.</p>
<p>When the New York Auto Show was canceled earlier in the month due to concerns over the presence of the delta variant, there was speculation that Pebble would also be canceled. But it snuck through as the de facto show that must go on before the uncertainty of the fall season amid pandemic shutdowns.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190468" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190468" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190468 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/pebble-GettyImages-1234707352.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2190468" class="wp-caption-text">The 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurier, winner of the Best of Show award at the 2021 Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance in Pebble Beach on Aug. 15, 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Paul Morris/Bloomberg</p></div></p>
<p>On the days leading up to the Concours, the streets of Carmel and Monterey were quieter and less busy, and there seemed to be fewer old cars driving around. There were plenty of modern Lamborghinis, Bentleys and Ferraris revving their engines in parking lots. Many guests slipped masks on and off at gatherings, which were mostly held outside, despite misty rain and cool temperatures. By Sunday, the crowds were back in full force for the Concours, which seemed as packed as ever.</p>
<p>The main event, the Pebble Beach Concours d&#8217;Elegance, was once dedicated to restored pre-war classic cars. But as generations and tastes shifted, newer cars were featured on the green. The attendees also seemed younger; high-performance sports cars dominated the scene.</p>
<p>A 1995 McLaren F1 was auctioned for a record-breaking $20 million at the Gooding &amp; Company auction on Friday night. Meanwhile, automakers hurriedly pulled together splashy car launches of their limited edition high-dollar supercars for the media and their top customers who milled about at private events.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Pebble Beach is an important pillar,&#8221; said Lamborghini CTO Maurizio Reggiani. &#8220;Pebble Beach told us what people love in terms of the aesthetic of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most notably, Audi showed the futuristic Skysphere concept on Wednesday. Mercedes-Benz previewed a new California-style convertible SL on Friday, which won&#8217;t be officially revealed until September. Aston Martin showed its Valkyrie and Valhalla models on a generous stand overlooking the golf course at Pebble Beach, but only allowed media and serious, vetted customers a close look at its models.</p>
<p>Both Rimac Automobili and Lucid Group showed up at Pebble Beach to connect with potential customers that can afford to invest in the most pricy electric powertrains. Rimac used the podium to debut its blistering fast Nevera sports car. Monterey 2021 seemed to have shifted to where new cars and new players overtook the old on the periphery.</p>
<p>After a year of pent-up demand for super luxury cars, it was the perfect setting for showing off all of those pandemic purchases on the race track and roads in and around Monterey and Carmel. As auction prices soared and seven-figure sports car sold out, it became clear that performance car enthusiasm hasn&#8217;t waned. The new cars shown at Pebble Beach share much in common: All are pricey, packed with sports car technology and manufactured in low volumes. Here are some of the highlights.</p>
<h2>Aston Martin</h2>

<p>After several delays in recent years, the Aston Martin Valkyrie Spider was unveiled as a sold-out car by new CEO Tobias Moers. The Valkyrie has removable roof panels and a top speed of 217 miles per hour. Moers, who took the role over the pandemic, has been making drastic changes to the way Aston produces its cars.</p>
<p>Moers said that adding new in-car technology is essential to the brand&#8217;s future and will pivot away from using last generation Mercedes-Benz tech. Also on display at the Aston stand was the 2024 Valhalla, which will have a hybrid powertrain.</p>

<p>The self-driving Skysphere concept looked more like it belonged at the CES show than a vintage car concours. It stuck out as the most interesting car unveiled at Pebble Beach. Audi says it can slim down its wheelbase from a larger car into a small roadster.</p>

<p>While the luxe interior of the Bentley Flying Spur Mulliner drew compliments for its lush leather, news that it would include a hybrid powertrain is significant for Bentley.</p>

<p>The Bolide wasn&#8217;t at Pebble but announced at a press conference held at The Quail on Friday. For the ultra-exclusive automaker, a new car is a big deal, especially one that will be its last gasoline-powered car. Bugatti says it will make 40 Bolides priced at $4 million apiece. It will have a top speed of 300 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Rimac stamped its mark on Monterey with its U.S. debut of the Nevera, a $2.44 million electric super car. Rimac says Nevera will run up to 400 miles on a full charge, at a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Rimac’s buzzy presence around town is a reminder that while Pebble Beach was once about the past, there’s a hunger for new EV players that can outrun the competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just five months after raising $90 million, Brazil’s Nuvemshop announced today it has raised $500 million in a round co-led by Insight Partners and Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values Nuvemshop &#8212; which some say is Latin America’s answer to Shopify &#8212; at $3.1 billion, and brings the São Paulo-based startup’s total funding in the last 10 months to more than $620 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunley House Capital, VMG Partners, Alkeon and Owl Rock as well as existing backers Accel, Kaszek, Kevin Efrusy, Qualcomm Ventures LLC and ThornTree Capital also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop (also known as Tiendanube in Spanish-speaking countries) aims to give entrepreneurs a way to build and grow online businesses. The company’s platform serves more than 90,000 merchants across Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, ranging from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to more established brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong, Colombraro, Zaira Beauty, Osram, Lolja, Vitabe and StrappyCo. That’s up from 20,000 merchants at the start of 2020 and 80,000 at the time of its last raise in March.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nuvemshop, LatAm&#8217;s answer to Shopify, raises $90M in Accel-led Series D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/nuvemshop-latams-answer-to-shopify-raises-90m-in-accel-led-series-d/embed/#?secret=FyZ8IdnCyb" data-secret="FyZ8IdnCyb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than selling their goods on existing marketplaces (such as Mercado Libre, the Brazilian equivalent of Amazon), many merchants and entrepreneurs are opting to start and grow their own online businesses, according to Nuvemshop co-founder and CEO Santiago Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most merchants have entered the internet by selling on marketplaces but we are hearing from newer generations of merchants and SMBs that they don’t want to be intermediated anymore,” he said. “They want to connect more directly with consumers and convey their own brand, image and voice.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every KPI tripled in the company in 2020 as the world saw a massive transition to online, and Nuvemshop’s platform was home to 14 million transactions last year, according to Sosa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Nuvemshop launched a beta version of its own payments solution platform for merchants that is designed to allow for “faster and more secure” purchases. It also reflects the Latin American consumers&#8217; approach to paying for retail purchases over time. In fact, the company says that 70% of the credit card transactions on its platform happen via installments. The new product will be made broadly available to all merchants over the course of the next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuvemshop says that its logistics capabilities allow merchants to deliver directly to consumers via partnerships and integrations with what would otherwise be a highly fragmented network of carriers. The company plans to keep broadening its set of warehouse and carrier partners with the goal of driving down the click-to-delivery time in most regions — now typically five to six days — to one- or two-day delivery, which is now standard in the U.S.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With 650 million consumers, <span class="xn-location">Latin America</span> is not only a huge market, but it is the fastest growing e-commerce market in the world,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Matt Gatto</span>, managing director at Insight Partners.</p>
<p>Accel Partner Ethan Choi believes the Latin American e-commerce market has the potential to be just as big as the U.S. market in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the rapid adoption of e-commerce, we believe Nuvemshop has the potential to be one of the most important companies in the region, he told TechCrunch. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Looking at Shopify&#8217;s $185 billion market cap gives you a sense of what&#8217;s possible if you&#8217;re the leading e-commerce player in a big market like the U.S.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward growth in Nuvemshop’s existing markets and support expansion into new countries such as Colombia, Chile and Perú. Nuvemshop will also work to expand its capabilities to serve larger merchants by expanding its sales and customer support staff, as well as continuing to invest in resources and support for its app partners and agencies. The company additionally plans to accelerate its payment and logistics capabilities, and will use the fresh capital in part toward some acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has more than 600 employees, with offices in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">InfoSum, a London-based startup that provides a decentralized platform for secure data sharing between organizations, has secured a $65 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chrysalis/">Chrysalis Investments</a>.</p>
<p>The investment comes less than a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/infosum-raises-15-1m-for-its-privacy-first-federated-approach-to-big-data-analytics/">InfoSum closed a $15.1 million Series A round co-led by Upfront Ventures and IA Ventures</a>. Since, the data privacy startup has tripled its revenue, doubled its employee base and secured more than 50 new customers, including AT&amp;T, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a>, Omnicom and Merkle.</p>
<p>Its growth was boosted by businesses that are increasingly focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-privacy/">data privacy</a>, largely as a result of the mass shift to remote working and cloud-based collaboration necessitated by the pandemic. InfoSum’s data collaboration platform uses patented technology to connect customer records between and amongst companies, without moving or sharing data. It helps organizations alleviate security concerns, according to the startup, and is compliant with all current privacy laws, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>The platform was bolstered earlier this year with the launch of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/infosum-outs-an-identity-linking-tool-thats-exciting-marketing-firms-like-experian/"> InfoSum Bridge</a>, a product which it claims significantly expands the customer identity linking capabilities of its platform. It is designed to connect advertising identifiers along with its own &#8220;bunkered&#8221; data sets to better facilitate ad targeting based on first-party data.</p>
<p>“The technology that enables companies to safely and securely compare customer data is thankfully entering a new phase, driven by privacy-conscious consumers and companies focused on value and control. InfoSum is proud to be leading the way,” said Brian Lesser, chairman and CEO of InfoSum. “Companies are looking for solutions to help resolve the existing friction and inefficiencies around data collaboration, and InfoSum is the company to drive this growth forward.”</p>
<p>The company, which says it is poised for &#8220;exponential growth” in 2021 as businesses continue to embrace privacy-focused tools and software, will use the newly raised investment to accelerate hiring across every aspect of its business, expand into new regions and further the development of its platform.</p>
<p>Nick Halstead, who previously founded and led big data startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/datasift/">DataSift</a>, founded InfoSum (then called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/09/cognitivelogic-raises-3m-to-help-enterprises-pool-big-data-while-keeping-privacy-intact/">CognitiveLogic</a>) in 2015 with a vision to connect the world’s data without ever sharing it. The company currently has 80 employees spread across offices in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany.</p>
