										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robots have a hard time improvising, and encountering an unusual surface or obstacle usually means an abrupt stop or hard fall. But researchers at Facebook AI have created a new model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real time to any terrain it encounters, changing its gait on the fly to keep trucking when it hits sand, rocks, stairs, and other sudden changes.</p>
<p>Although robotic movement can be versatile and exact, and robots can &#8220;learn&#8221; to climb steps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/these-humanoid-robots-can-autonomously-navigate-these-cinder-block-mazes-thanks-to-ihmc/">cross broken terrain</a> and so on, these behaviors are more like individual trained skills that the robot switches between. And although robots like Spot famously can spring back from being pushed or kicked, the system is really just working to correct a physical anomaly while pursuing an unchanged policy of walking. There are some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/this-robo-bug-can-improvise-its-walk-like-a-real-insect/">adaptive movement models</a>, but some are very specific (for instance this one based on real insect movements) and others take long enough to work that the robot will certainly have fallen by the time they take effect.</p>
<p>Rapid Motor Adaptation, as the team calls it, came from the idea that humans and other animals are able to quickly, effectively, and unconsciously change the way they walk to fit different circumstances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Say you learn to walk and for the first time you go to the beach. Your foot sinks in, and to pull it out you have to apply more force. It feels weird, but in a few steps you&#8217;ll be walking naturally just as you do on hard ground. What&#8217;s the secret there?&#8221; asked senior researcher Jitendra Malik, who is affiliated with Facebook AI and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&#8217;ve never encountered a beach before, but even later in life when you have, you aren&#8217;t entering some special &#8220;sand mode&#8221; that lets you walk on soft surfaces. The way you change your movement happens automatically and without any real understanding of the external environment.</p>

Of course the robot would not perceive any of this visually. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening is your body responds to the differing physical conditions by sensing the differing consequences of those conditions on the body itself,&#8221; Malik explained — and the RMA system works in similar fashion. &#8220;When we walk in new conditions, in a very short time, half a second or less, we have made enough measurements that we are estimating what these conditions are, and we modify the walking policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The system was trained entirely in simulation, in a virtual version of the real world where the robot&#8217;s small brain (everything runs locally on the on-board limited compute unit) learned to maximize forward motion with minimum energy and avoid falling by immediately observing and responding to data coming in from its (virtual) joints, accelerometers, and other physical sensors.</p>
<p>To punctuate the total internality of the RMA approach, Malik notes that the robot uses no visual input whatsoever. But people and animals with no vision can walk just fine, so why shouldn&#8217;t a robot? But since it&#8217;s impossible to estimate the &#8220;externalities&#8221; such as the exact friction coefficient of the sand or rocks it&#8217;s walking on, it simply keeps a close eye on itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking,&#8221; said co-author Ashish Kumar, also from Berkeley.</p>
<p>Ultimately the system ends up having two parts: a main, always-running algorithm actually controlling the robot&#8217;s gait, and an adaptive algorithm running in parallel that monitors changes to the robot&#8217;s internal readings. When significant changes are detected, it analyzes them — the legs should be doing <em>this</em>, but they&#8217;re doing <em>this</em>, which means the situation is like <em>this</em> — and tells the main model how to adjust itself. From then on the robot only thinks in terms of how to move forward under these new conditions, effectively improvising a specialized gait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175344" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175344" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175344 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif" alt="Footage of the robot not falling as it traverses various tough surfaces." width="800" height="346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175344" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>After training in simulation, it succeeded handsomely in the real world, as the news release describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The robot was able to walk on sand, mud, hiking trails, tall grass and a dirt pile without a single failure in all our trials. The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials. It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Malik gave a nod to the research of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/karen-adolph.html">NYU professor Karen Adolph</a>, whose work has shown how adaptable and freeform the human process of learning how to walk is. The team&#8217;s instinct was that if you want a robot that can handle any situation, it has to learn adaptation from scratch, not have a variety of modes to choose from.</p>
<p>Just as you can&#8217;t build a smarter computer vision system by exhaustively labeling and documenting every object and interaction (there will always be more), you can&#8217;t prepare a robot for a diverse and complex physical world with 10, 100, even thousands of special parameters for walking on gravel, mud, rubble, wet wood, etc. For that matter you may not even want to specify anything at all beyond the general idea of forward motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t pre-program the idea that it has for legs, or anything about the morphology of the robot,&#8221; said Kumar.</p>
<p>This means the basis of the system — not the fully trained one, which ultimately did mold itself to quadrupedal gaits — can potentially be applied not just to other legged robots, but entirely different domains of AI and robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legs of a robot are similar to the fingers of a hand; the way that legs interact with environments, fingers interact with objects,&#8221; noted co-author Deepak Pathak, of Carnegie Mellon University. &#8220;The basic idea can be applied to any robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even further, Malik suggested, the pairing of basic and adaptive algorithms could work for other intelligent systems. Smart homes and municipal systems tend to rely on preexisting policies, but what if they adapted on the fly instead?</p>
<p>For now the team is simply presenting their initial findings in a paper at the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/">Robotics: Science &amp; Systems</a> conference  and acknowledge that there is a great deal of follow-up research to do. For instance building an internal library of the improvised gaits as a sort of &#8220;medium term&#8221; memory, or using vision to predict the necessity of initiating a new style of locomotion. But the RMA approach seems to be a promising new approach for an enduring challenge in robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online grocery startups around the world continue to pull in major investment, underscoring how much they have all grown especially in the last year of pandemic living. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.kurly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurly</a> &#8212; a startup in South Korea that provides next-day grocery delivery services across the country &#8212; has closed $200 million in funding, a Series F valuing the company at $2.2 billion, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>This means the company&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled in the last year. Last April, Kurly closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/korean-grocery-startup-kurly-raises-150m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $150 million</a> at a $780 million valuation.</p>
<p>This latest round is being co-led by Aspex Management, DST Global, Sequoia Capital China and Hillhouse Capital &#8212; all previous backers of the company &#8212; with new investors Millennium Management and CJ Logistics Corporation also participating. CJ Logistics is a strategic backer: it has a deal in place with Kurly to help expand its overnight delivery service to more regions across South Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding comes right on the heels of a significant u-turn for the business in recent days.</p>
<p>Kurly had been planning an IPO in the U.S. later this year; instead it announced this week that it would instead seek to list in its home market instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurly had explored both overseas and domestic IPO options. After reviewing detailed conditions such as its business model and stock market conditions both at home and abroad, Kurly has decided to go ahead with an initial public offering in the Korean stock market,&#8221; it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107080007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korea Economic Daily</a>.</p>
<p>Some have reported that Chinese transport giant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/didi-slumps-after-china-regulators-order-stores-to-remove-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didi&#8217;s rocky start as a public company</a> on the NYSE this month gave Kurly pause on the performance of Asian companies on U.S. exchanges at the moment. Others have reported that the company was <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/special/2021/05/175_308284.html?fl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing issues with some existing private backers</a> wanting to cash out, concerned over the company&#8217;s growth potential &#8212; which might have hastened an IPO while also put more pressure on the company to produce better returns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting too that Coupang, Kurly&#8217;s much bigger rival, is traded in the U.S. market, on the NYSE after going public earlier this year. Its market cap is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CPNG?p=CPNG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently just under $70 billion</a> and so that might also invite unfavorable comparisons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the shift, this latest round is an interesting signal to the market that investors are keen to continue supporting the company on the back of more market potential. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kurly said the funds will be used to build out its tech stack, talent recruitment, and to expand its coverage of its next-day services.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This funding round is a testament to Kurly’s contributions in transforming customer’s everyday habit of conducting grocery shopping at physical stores into a more convenient way of shopping online by offering a superior selection of products through its innovative delivery service,&#8221; said Seul-A Kim, also known as Sophie Kim, the CEO and founder of Kurly, in a statement. &#8220;The Company has also been successful in bringing merchandises to the customers at a reasonable price through service technology empowered by the use of its proprietary data analytics. We are delighted to have new capital which would allow us to further invest in logistics infrastructure, people and technology to continue to innovate mobile grocery market and improve lives of consumers, producers and workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a strong pace, with $845 million in sales in 2020, up 124% over a year ago. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether it is profitable or what its operating margins are, but the theory is that &#8212; as with all e-commerce operations &#8212; as Kurly continues to scale its overnight delivery service, those margins will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to continue to support Market Kurly with our investment,&#8221; said Hermes Li, the founder and portfolio manager of Aspex Management, in a statement. &#8220;Korea is one of the fastest growing and largest e-commerce markets globally, and Kurly has been the leader in e-Commerce innovation. They have built a consumer centric brand focused on superior product quality and user experience. We believe there is significant potential ahead of Kurly from expansion into other consumer categories and new geographies. Aspex is looking forward to many years of growth with Kurly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online grocery delivery services have seen a massive surge of use and subsequent investor attention in the last year, fueled by people turning to e-commerce in the wake of social distancing to help contain the spread of Covid-19. That&#8217;s included a lot of funding for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large grocers</a> similar to Kurly, as well as smaller, &#8220;instant&#8221; essential grocery players targeting urban consumers, who have collectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to scale their operations in what has quickly become a very crowded market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seed investment firm <a href="https://www.hummingbird.vc/">Hummingbird VC</a>, which previously invested in Deliveroo, Peak Games, MarkaVIP, and Kraken has a new Managing Partner. Firat Ileri, previously a Partner &#8211; who at 28 became one of Europe’s youngest VCs when he joined in 2012 &#8211; takes over from Founding Partner Barend Van den Brande, who will now take on a more strategic role at the firm.</p>
<p>Ileri grew up in Cyprus and went on to study electrical engineering, computer science, and operations research at MIT. At Hummingbird he has lead the firm&#8217;s first investments in Latin America and in South East Asia.</p>
<p>Ileri initially introduced the cofounders of Gram Games, led their first investment, and helped exit the company to Zynga for half a billion. He also led the sale process of Peak Games in 2020, which exited at $1.8Bn, making history as Turkey’s largest tech exit to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010, Hummingbird is currently on its fourth fund of $200M, raised in Q4 2020, and says it invests from Europe to India, SEA, LATAM, Turkey and more recently in the US.<br />
 <br />
Firat most recently led Hummingbird’s first investments in engineering biology, investing in Billiontoone, the SF-based precision diagnostics company in the prenatal and liquid biopsy space, which has raised a $55M Series B round. It&#8217;s also invested in Kernal Biologics, an mRNA 2.0 therapeutics company focused on oncology.</p>
<p>Van den Brande said: “From the moment Firat joined us in the very early days of Hummingbird, he hit the ground running. His eye for unique and ambitious founding teams, and unparalleled expertise in Seed investing, persistence and really understanding what Early Stage companies need has made him an invaluable asset to Hummingbird and all of the founders we work with. I&#8217;m only pleased to have Firat take on the role and lead the Hummingbird family and portfolio for years to come.”</p>
<p>Ileri said the firm’s thesis was to invest in stand-out founders: “We&#8217;re spending much more time trying to understand who these people are and what makes them special. In a way, we&#8217;re looking for anomalies in people, and we believe that the best companies are created with nonlinear backgrounds. So, this is the thesis.”</p>
<p>He said the team has expanded to drive this vision: “We used to be a boutique fund, but we have the ambition to be more and especially to look for founders who have an independent mind and huge ambitions. To be able to find more companies we&#8217;ve gone more global, in order to have a better chance of finding these special stories.”</p>

		Uwe Horstmann is co-founder and partner of the Berlin-based venture capital firm <a href="https://www.project-a.com/">Project A Ventures</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The narrative suggests that Germany is lagging behind its European neighbors when it comes to <a href="https://www.kfw.de/KfW-Group/Newsroom/Latest-News/Pressemitteilungen-Details_608832.html">building a globally competitive venture capital market</a>. But I think that the next five years will be huge for the German venture capital sector, and that the signs for the future are very positive.</p>
<p>German startups raised €6.4 billion in 2020. That’s more than France, which came in at €5.7 billion. Another upside is that there is a healthy blend of local and international investment in the early-stage market. German funds dominate investments in German startups at the <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/investment-germany-austria-switzerland-2020/">seed and Series A stages</a>. As companies grow, overseas investment plays a huge part &#8212; <a href="https://www.kfw.de/PDF/Download-Center/Konzernthemen/Research/PDF-Dokumente-Studien-und-Materialien/KfW-Venture-Capital-Studie-2020.pdf">half of the deals exceeding $50 million funding rounds are led entirely by foreign investors</a>, while only 5% are run by German investors and 45% see a mix of foreign and domestic investors at the cap table.</p>
<p>I think this is where the German VC market needs to be right now. Great innovation is being sourced and backed by local funds. As these companies grow and become winners, they attract the best investors from around the globe, enabling the companies to internationalize from a German base, and the early-stage VCs reap the rewards and continue investing in local German talent. As the market matures, I am confident we will see more German VC money invested at the growth stages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And the outlook is favorable. The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The German market is thriving. Even the pandemic did little to impact this fundamentally positive trend for the technology sector.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In addition to the growing level of both local and international investment into German tech, policymakers have created better conditions for startups and VC funds to thrive in Germany.</p>
<p>The German Federal Government launched <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Financial_markets/Articles/2021-03-25-launch-of-the-zukunftsfonds.html">the €10 billion Future Fund</a> and has committed additional funds to the Deep Tech Future Fund. Not only does this immediately inject more capital into the market at the growth stage, but it also indicates that Germany is “open for business.” It sends a clear signal to the rest of the world that Germany understands the link between innovation and tangible improvements in society. It is a powerful and welcome indicator to funds from around the world.</p>
<p>Germany is incredibly attractive to tech talent, in addition to investors. More and more tech workers wish to <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tech-workers-relocate-to-germany/">relocate to Germany</a>, with the welfare state providing a model for the future.</p>
<p>The long term looks good, too. Germany is famous the world over for its manufacturing and engineering sector. Germany is one of the few countries that still generates foreign trade surpluses through local production. Manufacturing and engineering are still yet to experience a massive leap in innovation. Therefore, German startups are extremely well positioned to benefit from the increasing activity in “Industry 4.0” innovation, with talent from Germany’s manufacturing heartland poised to blend with the ever-increasing pool of tech talent in Berlin and Munich.</p>
<h2>Share options and spinoffs are the Achilles’ heel of the German startup scene</h2>
<p>I think German VC and the tech market are due to take off and achieve new heights. However, there are two areas that need to be substantially improved: employee stock options and the regulations around spinoffs.</p>
<p>Germany is choking on its bureaucracy, and that threatens innovation. Tesla’s new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/tesla-german-gigafactory-delay.html">Gigafactory is the latest example</a> of how bureaucratic processes can slow everything down.</p>
<p>For startups in Germany, reforms on employee stock option plans (ESOP) are urgently needed for startup workers to benefit from the success of their companies and for the startup ecosystem to grow on its own.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/die-esop-reform-ist-so-gut-wie-gescheitert/">current bill</a> to offer better tax benefits does not reflect the needs of the industry. For example, tax relief is only available for employees in companies that are younger than 10 years. If an employee changes employers, they must pay tax on company shares beforehand, which poses a significant risk of bankruptcy. Because many startups are still not profitable after 10 years, taxes should only be due when an employee makes an actual profit from their holdings &#8212; when they sell the shares. In the end, startups simply won’t offer new ESOPs to their employees.</p>
<p>Another example: spinoffs. Germany has the <a href="https://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/statistics/2019/statistics/patent-applications.html#tab2">highest number of patent applications in Europe</a>. However, startups often are not able to turn innovative technology into product-market fit. Spinoffs from the leading German research institutes have had a hard time gaining a foothold because they have been imposed with high institutional fixed and license costs when spinning off. Here, Germany needs to be more flexible and give startups the space and funding they need.</p>
<p>Lower the fixed costs and the enormous bureaucracy founders face when spinning off. Investors have to render more operational and organizational support for researchers-turned-founders. Furthermore, VCs must have the courage to invest more in innovative ideas and technologies that may take a bit longer to thrive. BioNTech is the best example of how this pays off in the long run.</p>
<h2>More German unicorns?</h2>
<p>As it stands, 2021 has already seen numerous new unicorns from Germany &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/">Personio</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/mambu-110m-raise-unicorn/">Mambu</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/sennder-latest-european-unicorn/">Sennder</a>, <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gorillas-raises-e245m-unicorn/">Gorillas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">Trade Republic</a> achieving billion-dollar valuations &#8212; and there are almost certainly more to come.</p>
<p>If regulators finally cut through the red tape around stock options and spinoffs, the German tech and VC industry will achieve new heights. I look forward to positive changes and an entire roster of German unicorns being minted in the years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Temasek and an affiliate of Warburg Pincus are investing $500 million in Indian ride-hailing giant Ola, the Bangalore-headquartered startup said in a short statement Friday. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal is also participating in the new investment, the startup said.</p>
<p>This is the first time SoftBank-backed Ola, which leads the market in India, has raised money since its Series J financing round two years ago, according to records on insight platform Tracxn. Ola said in a statement that the investment comes &#8220;ahead of IPO&#8221; &#8212; but didn&#8217;t elaborate. (The startup has since said it hasn&#8217;t finalized the timing of its IPO.)</p>
<p>Ola, Temasek, and Warburg Pincus didn&#8217;t share how the new investment valued the ride-hailing startup, which competes with Uber in India. Ola was valued at under $5 billion in its previous financing round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EV business Ola Electric, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/ola-ev-business-ola-electric-mobility/">span out of Ola in 2019</a>, is also in the market to raise money, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">reported earlier this week</a>. The unicorn startup will soon start the production of its electric scooters, Aggarwal, who also oversees Ola Electric, said recently.</p>
<p>Mobility firms are among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. But in recent months, they have started to pick up pace again as more Indian states relax lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Ola had about 32 million monthly active users on Android in India in June, up from about 26 million in May, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. Uber had about 22 million users in June on Android in India, up from 18 million in May.</p>
<p>“Over the last 12 months we’ve made our ride hailing business more robust, resilient and efficient. With strong recovery post lockdown and a shift in consumer preference away from public transportation, we are well positioned to capitalize on the various urban mobility needs of our customers. I welcome Warburg Pincus and Temasek to Ola and look forward to collaborating with them in our next phase of growth,&#8221; said Aggarwal in a statement.</p>
<p>Ola, which operates in over 100 cities in India and has amassed over a million driver partners on its platform, also expanded to several international markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the UK in the past decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We look forward to collaborating with Bhavish and the team in the next phase of Ola’s growth,” said Vishal Mahadevia, MD and head of India business at Warburg Pincus, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DN Capital, one of Europe’s most active VCs has launched its latest $350 million (£220m, €300m) fund off the back of a pretty stand-out year when the firm saw four of its portfolio companies hit billion-dollar-plus valuations. DN’s &#8216;Fund V&#8217; will invest across Europe, the UK and the US, but with strongly European LPs, DN has garnered a reputation for digging up some of continental Europe’s hottest startups from, North, Western, Central, and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Led by industry veterans Nenad Marovac (based in Europe) and Steve Schlenker (based Stateside), DN led the Series A round in Auto1, which IPO’d on the German Stock Exchange earlier this year at a $10 billion valuation and over 150x their entry price per share.</p>
<p>As Marovac explained: “We spend vast amounts of time with entrepreneurs understanding the market, their team, their product and to get to the heart of what they’re trying to achieve, long before we even talk about money… The launch of our fifth fund gives us further scope to uncover new entrepreneurs with the biggest, brightest global ambitions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schlenker added that he thinks the “full impact of the pandemic on society, work, and behaviors is only just being understood. There are tech founders across the globe right now on critical missions to accelerate this recovery and help address the needs, and solve the biggest problems, of the post-COVID world.”</p>
<p>In July 2021 MrSpex, the Germany-born online eyewear retailer, IPO’d at over $1.0bn. DN Capital also counts unicorns Remitly, Jobandtalent, and GoStudent in its portfolio.</p>
<p>The company, which has a 20-year history, said Fund V was “substantially oversubscribed” and will focus on the funds main specialities in software, fintech, marketplaces and the consumer internet.</p>
<p>Schlenker  said: “Europe has really come into its own now. It is competing very successfully versus the US in terms of returns to investors.”</p>
<p>Were they seeing more US VC in Europe, I asked?</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve done deals with Sequoia with Lightspeed, with Battery. It seems like the competition is very strong in the UK market, because the Americans come over where they can speak the language first. It&#8217;s still more of a competitive landscape with the US players in the series B or C stages when you get to France, Germany, etc.&#8221; said Schlenker.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is changing, but it&#8217;s still mostly them following people like DN in those rounds, whereas at series A-level, which is really our sweet spot, they seem to be more combatative specifically in the UK market. And we do a disproportionate share of our investments on the continent, as opposed to the UK,” said Schlenker.</p>
<p>I put it to Marovac what he thought had attracted LPs back to the fund. “Honestly?” he said, “Performance. We had the auto1 IPO in February which is worth three and a half times Fund III. We just had the Mr Spex IPO last week, which is another one times Fund II. We invested in  GoStudent last June, at a $20 million valuation and they just raised money at $1.4 billion.”</p>
<p>Before some of those events he said fundraising for the fund was going “okay” but it wasn&#8217;t going “gangbusters”. “I think since those things happened &#8211; and  I guess also maybe a difference in investors perceptions or mentality in Q1 this year. But Q1 Q2 Q3 last year were tough. They weren&#8217;t easy for fundraising. But it really came about, maybe, due to changes in the market and then also the performance of the funds. They are now going into our fund three with a 3x, already,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Marovac also outlined how the fund had quickly moved to support its portfolio last year when the pandemic hit: “The first thing we did when the pandemic hit was go through the portfolio and triage, making sure every company was funded for at least till the end of December 2021. Then we said we want to invest in companies that are, firstly, COVID resistant, in the short to medium term, and, secondly, companies that are going to benefit from this digital transformation since COVID accelerated things that were happening already.”</p>
<p>He points to the example of UiPath and software automation &#8211; the most valuable company to ever come out of Europe: “Digital payments: no one wants to touch cash anymore. And also just different forms of FinTech for digital inclusion. Remitly is probably our key example there, which does remittances for people to send money back home to emerging markets.”</p>
<p>Certainly, with this new $350m fund, it’s clear DN Capital is poised to power though the rest of 2021 and well into the next few years of Europe’s startup growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As environmental issues really came of age in the 1990s, certain German automakers were meeting in secret groups to make sure their cars would continue to industriously contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the European Union, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler have been illegally colluding to restrict competition in emission cleaning for new diesel passenger cars, essentially slowing the deployment of cleaner emissions tech. On Thursday, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3581">the EU issued fines of $1 billion</a> (€875 million) to Volkswagen and BMW for their involvement in the emissions cartel.</p>
<p>“The five car manufacturers Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche possessed the technology to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emission standards,&#8221; said executive VP of the EU Commission Margrethe Vestager in a statement. &#8220;But they avoided to compete on using this technology&#8217;s full potential to clean better than what is required by law. So today&#8217;s decision is about how legitimate technical cooperation went wrong. And we do not tolerate it when companies collude. It is illegal under EU Antitrust rules. Competition and innovation on managing car pollution are essential for Europe to meet our ambitious Green Deal objectives. And this decision shows that we will not hesitate to take action against all forms of cartel conduct putting in jeopardy this goal.”</p>
<p>All parties acknowledged their involvement and agreed to settle. Volkswagen, which owns Audi and Porsche, will have to pay around $595 million, and BMW will pay $442 million. Daimler would have had to pay around $861 million, but the company is evading fines by being the whistleblower. So we guess Daimler just gets off scot-free?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bmw-remained-profitable-2020-strong-half-76385265">BMW made a net profit of $4.62 billion last year</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/volkswagen-posts-12-2-billion-profit-in-resilient-pandemic-year">and VW made about $12.2 billion</a> and nearly $23 billion in 2019, so this fine sort of feels like a slap on the wrist. And let us remember, this is not the first time VW has gotten into an emissions scandal.</p>
<p>In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to VW for intentionally adding software into its diesel engines to make it look like it was following emissions controls, when in reality its cars were actually producing far more than the legal amount.</p>
<p>In its action against the companies, the EU specifically homed in on the agreement reached by the companies on the sizes of tanks used for AdBlue, a solution that mixes with diesel car exhaust to neutralize harmful pollutants. The companies agreed not to compete on making cars cleaner even though they had the tech to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/volkswagen-audi-porsche-bmw-und-daimler-unter-kartellverdacht-a-1159052.html">Der Spiegel first broke the news about the cartel in 2017</a>, and the companies set to work greenwashing. In the same year, all of the involved parties, as well as Ford Motor Company,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/03/bmw-daimler-ford-and-volkswagen-team-up-on-high-power-charging-network/"> joined forces to create a high-power charging network for EVs called Ionity</a>. The plan was to build and operate around 400 charging stations across Europe by 2020, but it looks like <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/454268/ionity-300-fast-charging-stations-europe/">Ionity only managed to install 300 across Europe</a>, and it even significantly increased the price of a charge by <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/17/ionity-increases-electric-vehicle-charging-prices-500-percent-january-31/">500% last year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">5G technology has generated a lot of hype for its potential to power driverless cars using a remote operator, but for the past few years that’s all it’s been — hype. Las Vegas-based startup Halo and telecom giant T-Mobile are teaming up to change that, with a driverless electric car service in Las Vegas powered on 5G to launch later this year.</p>
<p>The service, which will start with five vehicles, will work by connecting users to Halo’s pilot fleet of vehicles via an app. After a user has ordered a vehicle, a remote operator will drive it to the waiting customer. Once the car is delivered, the user can get behind the steering wheel and operate the vehicle as normal for the duration of their trip. When the trip is complete, the remote operator takes back over and drives it to the next waiting customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://halo.car/">Halo</a> departs significantly from companies like Waymo or Cruise, which are developing a full self-driving technology stack that aims to completely remove the human — remote or in-car — from the equation. Instead, Halo vehicles will be equipped with nine cameras, radars and ultrasonics as backup (no lidar), and it will connect to remote operators via T-Mobile’s Ultra Capacity midband 5G network.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Halo CEO Anand Nandakumar told TechCrunch that the service can also run on extended range low-band 5G network and on LTE as needed.</p>
<p>Halo said in a press release that its cars will be equipped with an algorithm that “learns in the background while humans control the vehicle, building a unique feedback loop to achieve Level 3 capabilities over time,” suggesting that the company has its sights set on autonomy in the long term. (“Level 3” refers to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ five levels of autonomous driving. L3 indicates features that allow the driver to be out of the loop under very limited conditions.)</p>
<p>“Full autonomy is a massive challenge from both a technical and social-trust perspective that won’t be solved for years to come,” Nandakumar said in the release. “But Halo has been designed to address these challenges by building automation over time starting with a solution that consumers will feel comfortable using today.”</p>
<p>The startup also said its vehicles will be equipped with an advanced safe stop mechanism, which will immediately bring cars to a full stop if a potential safety hazard is detected.</p>
<p>Last year, Halo joined the 5G Open Innovation Lab T-Mobile co-founded, giving the startup access to the telecom’s engineers and midspectrum network. Nandakumar declined to specify if T-Mobile is one of the company’s investors.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 8, 2021. Forget about Hot ___ Summer. It’s Hot <em>IPO</em> Summer in technology land, and today’s news underscores just how inviting the global exit market is proving to be.</p>
<p>But before we get into the TechCrunch Top 3, the good news from the site is that our latest super-deep company teardown, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1/">EC-1</a>, is live. This time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">we looked at NS1</a>, a company that we wrote is building “a strategic node at the core of the modern web delivery tech stack.” The whole series is fire. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3</span></h2>
<p>When we said it was IPO season, we weren’t kidding. Here’s the day’s biggest exit news, which has a theme, as you’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">Instacart hires new CEO as it preps to go public:</a></strong><strong> </strong>Big news from the world of grocery delivery today as longtime Instacart CEO and co-founder Apoorva Mehta promoted himself to chairman of the company’s board. Facebook exec Fidji Simo is taking the helm. Back during my first stint at TechCrunch, Mehta would send me Facebook messages when his company added new Bay Area markets. How times change!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/zomato-ipo/">India’s Zomato sets IPO price range:</a> </strong>The day’s <em>other</em> big news from the world of delivery comes from India’s Zomato, which will price its IPO “shares in the range of 72 Indian rupees (96 cents) to 76 ($1) and is targeting an upper limit valuation of $8.56 billion,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/circle-is-a-good-example-of-why-spacs-can-be-useful/"><strong>Crypto-powered Circle is going public via a SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a crypto-minded person, you’ve heard of Circle. If you aren’t, it’s the company that bought SeedInvest and is helping build stablecoin USDC. It’s going public via a SPAC at a multibillion-dollar valuation. Call it riding the Coinbase wave.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Flipping the script and going back to the earlier stages of startup life, here’s a rundown of news from startup land:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/powerz-raises-8-3-million-for-its-video-game-focused-on-education/"><strong>PowerZ raises $8.3M to fuse gaming and education:</strong></a> The French startup is both a gaming company<em> and </em>edtech startup. The startup thinks that “educational games will become mainstream really quickly,” TechCrunch reports. This makes sense: I have learned more about the Middle Ages from Crusader Kings III than any book I’ve read.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/rootly-nabs-3-2m-seed-to-build-sre-incident-management-solution-inside-slack/">Rootly raises $3.2M to bring SRE tooling into Slack:</a> </strong>Look, we all live inside of Slack or Teams, so why not bring more functionality into the services? Rootly wants to bring “an incident-response solution inside” of the work platform that Salesforce is buying. The round and company are neat, as is the fact that startups are building atop Slack itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/homebrew-leads-z1s-effort-to-bring-digital-banking-to-latin-americas-teens/"><strong>Z1 wants to bring fintech to LatAm zoomers:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Homebrew is putting early-stage money to work in Latin America in hopes that Z1 can mimic what Nubank has managed in the region, namely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">build a fintech titan and raise a zillion dollars</a>. Per TechCrunch, Z1 was a recent Y Combinator grad, which means that Homebrew acquired around 0.8 bips worth of equity in the $2.5 million the transaction. We kid.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/"><strong>Popshop Live raises $20M for modern QVC:</strong></a> Now worth around $100 million, Popshop Live has built a “standalone business that taps into the millennial taste for shopping from smaller and more edgy brands and individuals as much as bigger retailers.” With new capital and retailer momentum, it’s a startup to watch.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/smile-identity-raises-7m-to-build-kyc-and-identity-verification-tools-for-africa/"><strong>Smile Identity raises $7M Series A to verify identities:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Focused on the African market, Smile Identity has put together a lettered round for KYC and ID services on the continent. TechCrunch reports that Costanoa Ventures co-led the deal with CRE Venture Capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out, Natasha <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1413195928651980800">scooped</a> that “Peter Boyce II has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/peter-boyce-stellation-capital/">left General Catalyst to start his own firm</a>, a little over a year after the venture capital firm promoted him to partner.” It’s a busy week for new venture funds, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/acrylic-debut-crypto-fund/">Acrylic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/renegade-partners-rolls-out-its-much-anticipated-debut-fund-with-100-million/">Renegade</a> also making news.</p>
<h2>The NS1 EC-1</h2>
<p>For the latest entry in our series of long-form articles that explore the inner workings of notable startups, we looked at NS1, an internet infrastructure company best known for its software-defined domain name services (DNS).</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">Origin story:</a></strong> How three engineers decided to rebuild the internet&#8217;s core addressing system.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">Product development and roadmap:</a></strong> Experimentation, open-source efforts and expanding beyond DNS.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">Competitive landscape:</a></strong> A look at the broader internet infrastructure market.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-customers/">Customer development:</a></strong> How their top competitor&#8217;s stumble became &#8220;the gift that kept on giving.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how NS1 transformed &#8220;a slumbering and dreary yet reliable aspect of the internet&#8221; into &#8220;a strategic moat and an enterprise win&#8221; in just eight years, read on.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>A few notes from Big Tech before we wrap our news coverage. Enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/dropbox-is-reimagining-the-workplace-with-dropbox-studios/"><strong>Dropbox reinvents work(places):</strong></a> No, not in the product sense, but in terms of how it is approaching offices as COVID slowly wanes. The result? Something that looks more like a fancy, private coffee spot than an office. I demand that all companies mimic this immediately.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/beyond-meat-launches-plant-based-chicken-tenders-at-us-restaurants/"><strong>Tendies from $BYND:</strong></a> Yep, Beyond Meat has launched plant-based “chicken” tenders at some 400 U.S. restaurants. The company, long a public firm and thus befitting of our Big Tech moniker, has had a tumultuous life since it went public. Its shares have traded as high as $239 since it debuted. Today, the company is still worth a healthy $140 per share, far above its original $25 IPO price.</li>

<p>Want to convert twice as many visitors into customers? Follow these copywriting tactics.</p>
<h2>Everything &#8220;above the fold&#8221; must have a purpose</h2>
<p>The section of your homepage that&#8217;s immediately visible to a visitor before they start scrolling is called &#8220;above the fold.” (Think of a print newspaper: Everything above the literal fold in the paper is the most important information.) When a visitor sees the content above the fold, they decide to either keep scrolling or exit your site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In seconds, they&#8217;re trying to figure out what you do and whether you’re a fit for them.</p>
<p>The most common mistake we see startups make? Their “above the fold” is either uninteresting or confusing. This often happens when marketers attempt to squeeze too much content above the fold.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The most common mistake we see startups make? Their “above the fold” is either uninteresting or confusing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The truth is, most of the information on your website is irrelevant to new visitors. So the area above the fold should be used to explain how you can help new visitors solve a specific problem.</p>
<p>For example, you might see a homepage that promotes the newest technical blog post that the company published. But that&#8217;s not useful to a visitor who doesn&#8217;t yet understand what you do.</p>
<p>To further confuse the visitor, many companies add an extensive navigation bar to the top of their site. In theory, this allows your visitors to easily access any part of your website. In practice, it leads to decision fatigue and low conversion rates.</p>
<p>Unless the content directly helps answer what you do and whether you&#8217;re a good fit for that visitor, it should be removed.</p>
<p>There are three things you can do to improve the conversion rate of your homepage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Craft a sharp header.</li>
<li>Use a complementary subheader.</li>
<li>Design with intention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into the tactics of these three areas of improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Write headers that speak to an individual (not a crowd)</h2>
<p>Your header is the largest piece of text on your website. In under 10 words (about the longest we&#8217;d recommend), your header needs to accomplish three things:</p>
<h3>1. Identify how customers get value from your product.</h3>
<p>This is your most important value proposition. If you can&#8217;t explain how someone gets value from your product in fewer than 10 words, it&#8217;ll be a challenge to keep visitors&#8217; attention for much longer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how we uncover your key value proposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>What bad alternative do people resort to when they lack your product?</li>
<li>How is your product better than the bad alternative?</li>
<li>Now turn the last step into an action statement — that&#8217;s your value proposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take Airbnb:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bad alternative is being stuck in a sterile hotel without experiencing any real culture.</li>
<li>Airbnb&#8217;s product is better than the bad alternative because it allows you to stay in a local’s home.</li>
<li>So if we turn the second question into an action statement, we&#8217;d get a value proposition like: Experience new cities like a local.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some more examples from top startups:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175032" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175032" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="823" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png 1702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-1.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175032" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>2. Include an enticing hook that keeps visitors reading.</h3>
<p>Telling your visitors what you do is a good start, but now we need to get them excited about your product.</p>
<p>A huge missed opportunity we see a lot of startups make with their website copy? It&#8217;s not action oriented. In a world where customers can shop 24/7, there&#8217;s very little urgency for your visitors to take action now.</p>
<p>Adding a hook will increase the likelihood that a visitor buys from you on their first visit.</p>
<p>There are two ways we like to write hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a bold claim: something highly specific that triggers the thought, &#8220;Wow, I didn&#8217;t know that was possible.”</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2175034" style="width: 625px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175034" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png" alt="" width="615" height="346" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png 615w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li>Or address common objections: questions or pushback that your visitor is likely already thinking about. Addressing objections right away might seem counterintuitive, but bringing attention to your weaknesses will actually make your visitor trust your brand more. With no direct sales team, your copy is going to need to work hard to answer as many questions as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some value propositions of top startups that incorporate their biggest objections upfront.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175035" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175035" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175035 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="765" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png 1694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=768,574 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=680,508 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=1536,1148 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-3.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175035" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h3>3. Speak directly to your ideal customer persona</h3>
<p>To truly make the message in your header grab the attention of your visitor, rewrite your value proposition to speak directly to your customer personas.</p>
<p>To do so, list your top two to three customer personas. Rewrite your headers to address the part of your product they value most. Use their own language, not industry jargon. The best way to learn what your customers love about your product is through one-on-one customer interviews or reading customer success tickets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ckLIedx1Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/10-lies-youve-been-told-about-marketing/">Demand Curve: 10 lies you’ve been told about marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Demand Curve: 10 lies you’ve been told about marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/10-lies-youve-been-told-about-marketing/embed/#?secret=4ckLIedx1Y" data-secret="4ckLIedx1Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve got headers that speak directly to your ideal customer persona. You can either A/B test which header leads to a higher conversion rate or create custom landing pages using each header to drive traffic from different sources to specific pages.</p>
<p>For example, if you include a link to your website in a guest blog post, send that audience to the page with the most relevant header.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of writing multiple value propositions for the same startup:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175036" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175036" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png" alt="" width="1024" height="721" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png 1704w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=1536,1082 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-4.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175036" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Use a subheader to explain how your header can be possible</h2>
<p>We suggest spending about 50% of your time working on writing the header and 25% of your time on the subheader. Why? Because if your header isn&#8217;t interesting, your visitors won&#8217;t even bother reading the subheader.</p>
<p>Your subheader should be used to expand on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does your product work <em>exactly</em>?</li>
<li>Which of your features make our header&#8217;s bold claim believable?</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use your top two to three features to explain how your header is achieved.</p>
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say Airbnb&#8217;s header is: Experience your getaway vacation like a local. No minimum stays.</p>
<p>To make this statement believable, we need to explain how it&#8217;s possible to vacation like a local and how &#8220;no minimum stays&#8221; is possible.</p>
<p>A subheader could read something like: An online rental marketplace with thousands of short-term rentals in your area.</p>
<p>Do not use industry jargon or technical terms in your subheader or header. Use words that a fifth-grade reader would understand. Use short sentences. Lengthy paragraphs will kill the momentum of your reader.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples of using the subheader to explain the header:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175037" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175037" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175037" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png 1696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=1536,878 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-5.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Make your homepage feel familiar and function as expected</h2>
<p>The last aspect to consider when creating a high-converting homepage is the design. We see a lot of high-tech startups try to use their website to show off their creativity.</p>
<p>From our experience, your website is not the place to try to be original.</p>
<p>A website&#8217;s design should rarely be unique. It&#8217;s your <em>product</em> that should be unique. Your website is just a familiar medium for communicating your product&#8217;s uniqueness.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Using familiar buttons and navigation that other websites have popularized will save your visitor the hassle of having to learn how your website works. For example, we&#8217;ve come to expect there to be a &#8220;home&#8221; button in the top left of the page. Attempting to place the same button in the bottom right for the sake of uniqueness will lead to confusion and possibly a lost customer. Stick with what works.</p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>Consider these goals when adding images to your homepage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove uncertainty by showing your product in action. GIFs or looping videos are a terrific way of demonstrating how it works without taking up any additional space.
<p><div id="attachment_2175038" style="width: 862px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175038" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175038" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-6.gif" alt="" width="852" height="752" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175038" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://judy.co/">Judy</a></p></div></li>
<li>If you sell physical goods, use images to show off various use cases and close-ups of the material and texture. This will help your visitor assess the quality of the product and further validate that the product is right for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2175040" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175040" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175040" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png" alt="" width="1024" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-7.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175040" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/">Allbirds</a></p></div></p>
<h3>Call-to-action buttons</h3>
<p>Your call-to-action buttons (CTA) are where you&#8217;ll convert a visitor of your webpage into an active shopper. Therefore, your CTAs should be a continuation of the magic that you teased in your header copy.</p>
<p>Make the CTA button copy action focused and tell your visitor what will happen once they click it.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of CTA buttons that feel natural because they continue the narrative that began with the header copy:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175041" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png" alt="" width="1024" height="411" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png 1684w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=768,308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=680,273 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=1536,617 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DC-8.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">One of VR&#8217;s prospective revenue streams is ad placement. The thought is that its levels of immersion can engender high engagement with various flavors of display ads. Think billboards in a virtual streetscape or sporting venue. Art imitates life, and all that.</p>
<p>This topic reemerged recently in the wake of Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/blaston-in-game-vr-facebook-advertising-reverse-course/"> experimental ads</a> in Blaston VR. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Lucas Matney<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/"> observed</a>, it didn&#8217;t go too well. The move triggered a resounding backlash, followed by the game publisher, Resolution Games,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/"> backing out</a> of the trial.</p>
<p>This chain of events underscored Facebook&#8217;s headwinds in VR ad monetization, which stem from its broader ad issues. In fairness, this was an experimental move to test the VR advertising waters … which Facebook accomplished, though it didn’t get the result it wanted.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			VR advertising is a bit of a double-edged sword. It could take several years for VR usage to reach requisite levels for meaningful ad monetization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Regardless, we&#8217;ve taken this opportunity to revisit our<a href="https://artillry.co/artillry-intelligence/vr-global-revenue-forecast-2019-2024/"> ongoing analysis</a> and market sizing of VR advertising in general. The short version: There are pros and cons on both qualitative and quantitative levels.</p>
<h2>The pros of VR advertising</h2>
<p>VR advertising&#8217;s opportunity goes back to factors noted above: potentially high ad engagement given inherent levels of immersion. On that measure, VR<a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/study-vr-ads-aid-same-day-recall-for-70-of-users/507755/"> exceeds</a> all other media, which can mean higher-quality impressions, brand recall and other common display-ad metrics.</p>
<p>Historical evidence also suggests that VR could follow a path toward ad monetization. VR shows similar patterns to media that were increasingly ad supported as they matured. These include video, social media, mobile apps and games (just ask Unity).</p>
<p>To put some numbers behind that, <a href="https://arinsider.co/2020/03/06/xr-talks-will-vr-follow-mobiles-monetization-path/">75%</a> of apps in the Apple App Store&#8217;s first year were paid apps &#8212; similar to VR today. That figure declined to 15% in 2014 and hovers around 10% today. Over time, developers learned they could reach scale through free downloads.</p>
<p>Prevalent revenue models today include in-app purchases &#8212; especially in mobile gaming &#8212; and advertising. The question is whether VR will follow a similar path as developers learn that they can reach scale faster through free apps that employ &#8220;back-end monetization&#8221; like ad support.</p>
<p>This trend also follows audience dynamics: Early adopters are more likely to pay for content and experiences. But as a given technology or media matures, its transition to mainstream audiences requires different business models with less upfront commitment and friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, there are only about 18% of applications in VR stores such as Steam and Oculus that are free,&#8221;<a href="https://arinsider.co/2020/03/06/xr-talks-will-vr-follow-mobiles-monetization-path/"> Admix CEO Samuel Huber said</a>. &#8220;This is fine for now because we are still very early in the market and most of these users are early adopters. They are willing to pay for content, just like they were willing to pay for prototype unproven hardware and generally, they have higher purchasing power than the average person.”</p>
<h2>Drawbacks of VR advertising</h2>
<p>Considering the above advantages, VR advertising is a bit of a double-edged sword (or beat saber). Those advantages are counterbalanced by a few practical disadvantages in the medium&#8217;s early stage. Much of this comes down to the requirement for scale.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxaOdI1qcUw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The Gang spends a lot of time these days on the streaming wars, so it seems appropriate that Congress wants to get into it. With Netflix’s success at overturning the structure of Hollywood’s broadcast television production and advertising processes, consumers are taking advantage of a Golden Age of choices. Senator Elizabeth Warren is resuscitating her plan to tax the billionaire class as a way to fund the progressive part of the infrastructure bill through the Democrat-only reconciliation process. As bait, she is using Amazon’s MGM acquisition as the carrot, suggesting the deal would be anti-competitive and dilutive of consumer choice. Coming as streaming passes broadcast as a percentage of the entire television market, it’s not clear just what consumers are going to lose with a smorgasbord of captivating programming choices.</p>
<p>The streaming heavyweights are in the throes of a transition from building audience to locking in paying customers. Netflix has jumped way out in front with an enormous audience fueling an equally gigantic investment in original programming. Apple TV+ has blinked earliest, moving their free trial of a year with a new Apple device purchase to 3 months, barely long enough to get halfway through the second season of their hit The Morning Show. Similar Disney+ deals with Verizon Wireless unlimited broadband upgrades are starting to time out as Disney tries to survive the pandemic’s impact on theme park revenue and steep costs of moving newly acquired properties from theaters to streaming, And then there are the rest of the old studio and network players, trying to build enough scale to compete with the leaders. Comcast consumed NBC and Universal Studios, CBS and Viacom merged to knit together broadcast, cable networks, and Paramount studios, now renamed Paramount +. And reality TV giant Discovery absorbed the remnants of WarnerMedia’s scripted studio and cable operation as AT&amp;T backed away from content to pay for investment in 5G.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ironically, ad-supported networks may turn out to be where the real action is. Although streaming subscribers are running up against a budget cap as they opt out of cable bundles, their antipathy for advertising is finessed by some midtier networks like Hulu and Paramount + mixing some ads with subscriptions at a reduced monthly charge. Comcast is already managing that transition with HBO Max, bundling the new streaming network with basic cable packages that include the HBO premium service. Combining HBO’s pre-pandemic windowed, or delayed from theatrical release feature films with original series programming is one thing: adding a monthly new feature simultaneously with theatrical release for all of 2021 has proven a powerful way of attracting new HBO Max subscribers in the battle for streaming. While the strategy will moderate in 2022 as theaters reopen, movie-goers are learning to appreciate the marriage of smaller titles with the convenience of subscription television.</p>
<p>Although big budget films like F9 are enjoying considerable success theatrically, smaller films like Parasite and other streaming releases are winning Oscars and other awards. Films have been eligible for Oscars and Golden Globes without the requirement of theatrical runs during the pandemic, and will continue for at least one more year. The HBO Max theater/digital gambit angered producers and talent with its bold move made easier during 2020’s lockdown, but WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar was apparently the loser in AT&amp;T’s Discovery/WarnerMedia deal as Discovery’s CEO David Zaslav was picked to run the combined company. But audiences may find more affinity with popcorn at home than the distributors expect as vaccinations take root. Kilar may have bootstrapped a look at what success will mean in the New Normal similar to what companies are saving in travel and facilities costs as we incorporate the strengths of work/play-from-anywhere and the mobile transformation.</p>
<p>The ad streamers bring more to the party than just subscriber discounts. While Netflix has made hay with binge viewing (dumping an entire season of shows at one time) ad streamers are using a hybrid of binge production and broadcast-style staged release as a way of updating the feel of appointment television with Peak TV dynamics. Using the weekly series model a la This Is Us and Gray’s Anatomy, shows like Paramount +‘s The Good Fight are released on a weekly basis with the release night staggered across the key nights of the week. Instead of browsing the TV Guide, you get a notification that the new episode has “dropped.” In effect, the linear tv schedule so beloved by advertisers and marketers is creating a new prime time schedule across the variety of streaming networks. With constant mergers and realignment of studios, cable assets, and streaming models, we already don’t have a clue what network is screening our new shows let alone what the network is called this week, so mobile messaging becomes the point of sale for sharing digital experiences. With cable giants like Comcast deriving more and more broadband customers as cable cutting persists, and set top boxes like AppleTV and Roku smart tvs capturing more scale and competing for a combination of ad-supported and original programming, the built in microphone on their remotes leapfrogs the vanished TV guides with audio commands that require only the name of the show or even the name of the favorite star.</p>
<p>The creator economy is experiencing a surge of services across the social networks. Newsletters, conversational audio sites, and new notification services from Apple are promoting media to support these AI-driven user rankings of the new Hollywood streaming winners. Apple’s notification summary screens in iOS 15 effectively present a way to organize a personalized digest of show notifications, freeing you from interrupting work to track the weekly dropping of favorite shows. It won’t be long before Twitter and other newsletter tools let you broadcast those alerts to special groups you define for watercooler-like conversations about the latest spoilers. Clubhouse and other social audio rooms will invite media analysts, showrunners, and stars to interact with these newly empowered fans, and some of the more proficient will graduate to subscription newsletter recaps and transcribed interviews. Advertisers will sponsor these streams, expanding the impact of the intersection of subscription and ad-supported hybrid services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2013, eight tech companies were accused of funneling their users&#8217; data to the U.S. National Security Agency under the so-called PRISM program, according to highly classified government documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Six months later, the tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/08/tech-companies-outline-more-nsa-reform-demands/">formed a coalition</a> under the name Reform Government Surveillance, which as the name would suggest was to lobby lawmakers for reforms to government surveillance laws.</p>
<p>The idea was simple enough: to call on lawmakers to limit surveillance to targeted threats rather than conduct a dragnet collection of Americans&#8217; private data, provide greater oversight and allow companies to be more transparent about the kinds of secret orders for user data that they receive.</p>
<p>Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo and AOL (to later become Verizon Media, which owns TechCrunch — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">for now</a>) were the founding members of <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/">Reform Government Surveillance</a>, or RGS, and over the years added Amazon, Dropbox, Evernote, Snap and Zoom as members.</p>
<p>But then sometime in June 2019, Evernote quietly disappeared from the RGS website without warning. What&#8217;s even more strange is that nobody noticed for two years, not even Evernote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hadn&#8217;t realized our logo had been removed from the Reform Government Surveillance website,&#8221; said an Evernote spokesperson, when reached for comment by TechCrunch. &#8220;We are still members.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evernote <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/evernote-joins-the-reform-government-surveillance/">joined the coalition</a> in October 2014, a year and a half after PRISM first came to public light, even though the company was never named in the leaked Snowden documents. Still, Evernote was a powerful ally to have onboard, and showed RGS that its support for reforming government surveillance laws was gaining traction outside of the companies named in the leaked NSA files. Evernote cites its membership of RGS in its <a href="https://evernote.com/privacy/transparency-report">most recent transparency report</a> and that it supports efforts to &#8220;reform practices and laws regulating government surveillance of individuals and access to their information&#8221; — which makes its disappearance from the RGS website all the more bizarre.</p>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the other companies in the RGS coalition if they knew why Evernote was removed and all either didn&#8217;t respond, wouldn&#8217;t comment or had no idea. A spokesperson for one of the RGS companies said they weren&#8217;t all that surprised since companies &#8220;drop in and out of trade associations.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175238" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175238 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="789" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg 2212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=1536,1183 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=2048,1578 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/rgs-members.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175238" class="wp-caption-text">The website of the Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which features Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Twitter, Verizon Media and Zoom, but not Evernote, which is also a member. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>While that may be true — companies often sign on to lobbying efforts that ultimately help their businesses; government surveillance is one of those rare thorny issues that got some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley rallying behind the cause. After all, few tech companies have openly and actively advocated for an increase in government surveillance of their users, since it&#8217;s the users themselves who are asking for more privacy baked into the services they use.</p>
<p>In the end, the reason for Evernote&#8217;s removal seems remarkably benign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evernote has been a longtime member — but they were less active over the last couple of years, so we removed them from the website,&#8221; said an email from Monument Advocacy, a Washington, D.C. lobbying firm that represents RGS. &#8220;Your inquiry has helped to prompt new conversations between our organizations and we&#8217;re looking forward to working together more in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monument has been involved with RGS since near the beginning after it was hired by the RGS coalition of companies to lobby for changes to surveillance laws in Congress. Monument has spent $2.2 million in lobbying to date since it began work with RGS in 2014, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/issues?cycle=2018&amp;id=F193676">according to OpenSecrets</a>, specifically on lobbying lawmakers to push for changes to bills under congressional consideration, such as changes to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, albeit with mixed success. RGS <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/statement-of-reform-government-surveillance-on/">supported</a> the USA Freedom Act, a bill designed to curtail some of the NSA&#8217;s collection under the Patriot Act, but was unsuccessful in <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/statement-on-the-fisa-amendments-reauthorization/">its opposition</a> to the reauthorization of Section 702 of FISA, the powers that allow the NSA to collect intelligence on foreigners living outside the United States, which was reauthorized <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/senate-fisa-section-702-cloture-vote-wyden-paul/">for six years</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>RGS has been largely quiet for the past year — issuing just <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/importance-of-transatlantic-data-flows/">one statement</a> on the importance of transatlantic data flows, the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement/">hot-button issue</a> to concern tech companies, fearing that anything other than the legal status quo could see vast swaths of their users in Europe cut off from their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;RGS companies are committed to protecting the privacy of those who use our services, and to safeguard personal data,&#8221; said the statement, which included the logos of Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, Twitter, Verizon Media and Zoom, but not Evernote.</p>
<p>In a coalition that&#8217;s only as strong as its members, the decision to remove Evernote from the website while it&#8217;s still a member hardly sends a resounding message of collective corporate unity — which these days isn&#8217;t something Big Tech can find much of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://twitter.com/badboyboyce">Peter Boyce II</a> has left General Catalyst to start his own firm, a little over a year after the venture capital firm<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/general-catalyst-names-three-partners"> promoted him to partner</a>. His new firm is called Stellation Capital, and filings indicate that he is looking to raise up to $40 million for the debut investment vehicle. Sources say that most, if perhaps not all, of that total has been closed <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001858819-21-000001/">since the initial SEC filing in April.</a></p>
<p>Boyce declined to comment for this story. It’s been a quiet transition for the investor; his LinkedIn and Twitter have not been updated to indicate his new job title, but his personal website indicates the new gig. For an investor to leave a prominent venture capital firm after an eight-year tenure to raise dozens of millions of his own — and somehow do so quietly and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=stellation%20capital&amp;src=typed_query">with minimal coverage</a> — might be a result of the funding frenzy and consequential numbness to yet another filing.</p>
<p>Boyce joined GC in 2013 and led investments in Ro, Macro, towerIQ and Atom. He’s also supported portfolio companies such as Giphy, Jet.com and Circle. Beyond GC, Boyce has experience co-founding and running Rough Draft Ventures, a program that helps incubate startups founded by students and recent graduates, as well as promote entrepreneurship on campuses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Stellation Capital will leverage his work and name into early-stage investments. The name of the firm, per its website, is derived from the Latin root of stella, which means star. The name also describes “the process of extending a polygon in new dimensions to form a new shape … just like we’re extending the potential of a founder into new possibilities.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear what the firm’s check size and cadence will be, but it did say it wants to back successful companies at “their earliest stages” on the website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instacart has appointed Facebook executive <a href="https://twitter.com/fidjissimo">Fidji Simo</a> as its new CEO, just seven months after she joined the grocery delivery company’s board of directors. Simo, formerly the vice president and head of the Facebook app, will replace Instacart founder and current CEO Apoorva Mehta on August 2. Mehta will transition to executive chairman of the board, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instacart-appoints-board-member-fidji-simo-to-chief-executive-officer-and-announces-founder-and-current-ceo-apoorva-mehta-will-serve-as-executive-chairman-of-the-board-301327620.html">per a statement from Instacart.</a></p>
<p>Instacart declined on behalf of Simo for request to provide further comment.</p>
<p>Women of color chief executives at the forefront of billion-dollar businesses are still an unfortunately rare occurrence. Simo is the co-founder of Women in Product, a nonprofit organization that works to empower women in product management, as well as advance and advocate for women’s careers in tech. The transition marks that Facebook has lost one of its few female leaders, and Instacart has a new energy as it plans to increase its head count by 50% in 2021.</p>

<p>The departure of Mehta from his role so close to an expected IPO is as notable as it is rare. Mehta founded Instacart 10 years ago, incubating it through <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/instacart">Y Combinator’s 2012 summer batch</a> to its most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/">recent valuation of $39 billion. </a></p>
<p>The pandemic spotlighted Instacart’s purpose, as millions of people around the world faced quarantines and limited in-person interactions, including trips to the grocery store. The increased consumer spending on for-delivery services led Instacart to hire hundreds of thousands of workers, as well as launch same-day delivery on a variety of products beyond avocados — including electronics, sports equipment and prescription medicine</p>
<p>The growth hasn’t come without controversy. Instacart joined Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Postmates <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon"> as major backers for Proposition 22</a>, a measure that would classify gig workers as independent contractors, limiting the types of benefits that they could receive. Prop 22 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually passed</a>, which could be seen as beneficial to Instacart executives and detrimental to the shoppers who make the deliveries. The event happened after years of protests, class-action lawsuits over wages and tipping debacles in which Instacart was scrutinized for unfair policies toward its shoppers.</p>

<p>Simo obviously has experience working at controversial companies, thanks to her decade at Facebook. Facebook&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg replied to Simo&#8217;s announcement in a comment on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fidji — I&#8217;m immensely grateful for the impact you&#8217;ve had on Facebook over the last 10 years,&#8221; Sandberg wrote. &#8220;You&#8217;ve worn so many hats leading the Facebook App — all while advocating for gender equality in the tech community. I&#8217;m so proud to see where you&#8217;re headed. Cheering you on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instacart describes Simo as a &#8220;core driver of Facebook&#8217;s mobile monetization strategy&#8221; and the leader behind the architecture of Facebook&#8217;s advertising business. The executive helped scale Facebook as it grew from 1,000 to 100,000 employees, and through its transition to the public markets — experience that may mesh well with Instacart&#8217;s ambitions to eventually go public.</p>
<p>Her rise to chief executive comes as the pandemic winds down and parts of the world begin to reopen, which will likely signal a new chapter about how Instacart conducts business and faces new challenges on how the business stays relevant.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Understanding what you will change is most important to achieve a long-lasting and successful robotic process automation transformation. There are three pillars that will be most impacted by the change: people, process and digital workers (also referred to as robots). The interaction of these three pillars executes workflows and tasks, and if integrated cohesively, determines the success of an enterprisewide digital transformation.</p>
<p>Robots are not coming to replace us, they are coming to take over the repetitive, mundane and monotonous tasks that we’ve never been fond of. They are here to transform the work we do by allowing us to focus on innovation and impactful work. RPA ties decisions and actions together. It is the skeletal structure of a digital process that carries information from point A to point B. However, the decision-making capability to understand and decide what comes next will be fueled by RPA’s integration with AI.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			From a strategic standpoint, success measures for automating, optimizing and redesigning work should not be solely centered around metrics like decreasing fully loaded costs or FTE reduction, but should put the people at the center.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We are seeing software vendors adopt vertical technology capabilities and offer a wide range of capabilities to address the three pillars mentioned above. These include powerhouses like UiPath, which recently went public, Microsoft’s Softomotive acquisition, and Celonis, which recently became a unicorn with a $1 billion Series D round. RPA firms call it &#8220;intelligent automation,&#8221; whereas Celonis targets the execution management system. Both are aiming to be a one-stop shop for all things related to process.</p>
<p>We have seen investments in various product categories for each stage in the intelligent automation journey. Process and task mining for process discovery, centralized business process repositories for CoEs, executives to manage the pipeline and measure cost versus benefit, and artificial intelligence solutions for intelligent document processing.</p>
<p>For your transformation journey to be successful, you need to develop a deep understanding of your goals, people and the process.</p>
<h2>Define goals and measurements of success</h2>
<p>From a strategic standpoint, success measures for automating, optimizing and redesigning work should not be solely centered around metrics like decreasing fully loaded costs or FTE reduction, but should put the people at the center. To measure improved customer and employee experiences, give special attention to metrics like decreases in throughput time or rework rate, identify vendors that deliver late, and find missed invoice payments or determine loan requests from individuals that are more likely to be paid back late. These provide more targeted success measures for specific business units.</p>
<p>The returns realized with an automation program are not limited to metrics like time or cost savings. The overall performance of an automation program can be more thoroughly measured with the sum of successes of the improved CX/EX metrics in different business units. For each business process you will be redesigning, optimizing or automating, set a definitive problem statement and try to find the right solution to solve it. Do not try to fit predetermined solutions into the problems. Start with the problem and goal first.</p>
<h2>Understand the people first</h2>
<p>To accomplish enterprise digital transformation via RPA, executives should put people at the heart of their program. Understanding the skill sets and talents of the workforce within the company can yield better knowledge of how well each employee can contribute to the automation economy within the organization. A workforce that is continuously retrained and upskilled learns how to automate and flexibly complete tasks together with robots and is better equipped to achieve transformation at scale.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The term muscle car has always been a euphemism for concessions. Want the most power for the money? Forget about a sports car from Porsche or Lotus. Buy a muscle car and just take corners a bit slower. Today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/auto-giant-stellantis-to-invest-e30b-in-electrification-through-2025/">Dodge announced it&#8217;s making an electric muscle car</a> and it will be available in 2024. The first question that comes to mind: Well, if it&#8217;s a muscle car, what&#8217;s missing?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between a muscle car and a sports car, and Dodge is uniquely suited to know the differences. The brand has long been associated with horsepower and going fast in a straight line. The Dodge Viper. The Dodge Challenger. Even the Dodge Durango, a lumbering SUV, is available with a tricked-out V8 capable of putting out 710 hp — more power than most Porsches, though no one is about to pit a Durango against a 911 on the track.</p>
<p>Part of the draw of electric vehicles revolves around their mechanical simplicity. That was the original sales pitch for the muscle car, too. But, instead of offering a sports car with a tuned chassis and remarkable aerodynamics, which adds significant development cost, American car companies just stuffed larger engines in everyday family cars. Bam. Muscle cars, baby.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume Dodge uses the muscle car mold and makes a low-cost, high-power, straight-line electric racer — think Dodge Challenger rather than Toyota Supra. This mold has several distinct characteristics.</p>
<p>One, burnouts. Muscle cars are known for their burnouts, which themselves are a byproduct of an overabundance of power, lack of chassis refinement and utter disregard for your tires&#8217; tread. Dodge teased this capability in its announcement tweet, showing a vehicle smoking all four tires. Dodge knows its audience.</p>
<p>Muscle car owners expect to be able to tune, tweak and modify their vehicles at home. That&#8217;s one of the main appeals to this type of vehicle. Straight from the factory, muscle cars are capable, but the buyer understands the automaker omitted certain parts to keep the sticker price as low as possible. Want better traction? Swap out the tires. Want better cornering? Add stiffer sway bars. An electric muscle car must be modifiable — something that&#8217;s increasingly rare as performance is more often optimized through software tweaks than mechanical upgrades.</p>
<p>Tesla has long been criticized for its aversion to vehicle modifications and at-home repairs. This is an opportunity for Dodge and others. A large swath of car buyers expect to be able to wrench on their vehicles, and I&#8217;ll wager this demographic is critical to Dodge&#8217;s future growth.</p>
<p>These unique characteristics of muscle cars are what make the segment so appealing for Dodge. The auto brand struggles to keep up with the market with a stable of stale vehicles, and the muscle car&#8217;s low-cost formula could allow for cheaper development costs.</p>
<p>And keeping development costs low is what Dodge needs right now.</p>
<p>Dodge is owned by Stellantis, a new automobile conglomerate formed when FCA, Dodge&#8217;s old owner, merged with the Dutch automaker PSA Group. It gets more confusing when Dodge&#8217;s previous owner is mentioned. Once always mentioned along with the giants of GM and Ford, Chrysler previously owned Dodge but is now just another brand in the Stellantis family. Together, Dodge and Chrysler offer only six vehicles, and none have seen significant updates in years.</p>
<p>An electric muscle car could revitalize the brand in the same way the Bronco is revitalizing Ford.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From electric charging to supply chain management, InMotion Ventures preps Jaguar for a sustainable future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/from-electric-charging-to-supply-chain-management-inmotion-ventures-preps-jaguar-for-a-sustainable-future/embed/#?secret=H2HxutJtS1" data-secret="H2HxutJtS1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Look at Ford. The 2021 Bronco is a hit because it lines up nicely with consumer&#8217;s expectations of a Bronco. People hardly remember the engine and chassis issues that were long associated with the Bronco. Instead, people remember a durable off-roader (and slow car chases), so Ford made a durable off-roader loaded with modern conveniences.</p>
<p>Dodge should do the same with its upcoming electric muscle car. But, of course, calling a vehicle a muscle car sets certain expectations that Dodge would be wise to deliver.</p>
<p>Likewise, Ford is also selling a four-door electric Mustang, and its heavily rumored Chevrolet is preparing a similar electric SUV Corvette. While most people love the electric Mustang (I don&#8217;t), they also concede the Mustang naming muddles the branding.</p>
<p>What is it going to be called? Automakers are increasingly turning to their back catalog for new branding. GM revived the Hummer for its first electric truck, and Ford brought back the Bronco and F-150 Lightning. Dodge has a lot of history with muscle cars. There&#8217;s the legendary Charger Daytona (perfect if the upcoming car is built on the current Charger or Challenger), the low-cost Coronet and its upgraded sibling Coronet Super Bee, the Dodge Stealth or Dodge Polara — though maybe Polara is too close to the EV maker Polestar. Or Dodge could turn to names used by Plymouth, another brand previously owned by Chrysler. So there&#8217;s the Plymouth Roadrunner, Duster, Fury and Barracuda, too.</p>
<p>Last question: How will Dodge make the car sound like a muscle car? Hopefully, they won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m here for feeling performance rather than hearing it — and I drive a big F-150 with a custom exhaust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis, the global automaker born out of a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and French automaker Groupe PSA, will invest €30 billion ($35.5 billion) in electric vehicles and new software over the next four years as part of a major push to transition away from internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>The world’s fourth-largest automaker joins rivals such as General Motors and Volkswagen in earmarking billions toward EV investments through the first part of the decade. Among the company’s plans are manufacturing an electric Dodge muscle car and an electric Ram pickup truck, both by 2024. Stellantis also said it would offer an electric or plug-in model in every vehicle segment under its Jeep brand by 2025.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim, CEO Carlos Tavares said during the company’s inaugural EV Day event on Thursday, is to hit sales targets for low-emission vehicles (including plug-ins) of 70% in Europe and 40% in the U.S. by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stellantis has been slower to electrify than some of its rivals, perhaps due in part to its lineup’s best-sellers skewing toward performance and heavy-duty models. The company designs and manufactures cars across over a dozen brands, including Jeep, Chrysler, Ram Trucks and Dodge. Its major brands in Europe include Peugeot, Vauxhall, Citroen and Fiat.</p>
<p>In order to deliver on its electrification strategy, Stellantis executives said that the company will also manufacture 130 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2025 and around 260 gigawatt hours across five factories in North America and Europe by 2030. The company will use two battery chemistries by 2024, with the goal of developing solid-state battery technology by 2026.</p>

<p>The car giant is also developing a portfolio of four dedicated electric vehicle platforms: Small, for city driving; Medium, for premium vehicles; Large, for performance and muscle models; and Frame, for trucks and heavy-duty vehicles. The platforms will have a range of up to 300 miles for Small and 500 miles for Large and Frame. The aim is to decrease battery costs by 40% by 2024, Stellantis CFO Richard Palmer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Morgan Stanley has joined the growing list of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a> hack victims — more than six months after attackers first breached the vendor’s 20-year-old file-sharing product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The investment banking firm — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-fined-1-million-for-client-data-breach-1465415374">which is no stranger to data breaches</a> — confirmed in a letter this week that attackers stole personal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of its third-party vendor, Guidehouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In a letter sent to those affected, first reported by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/morgan-stanley-reports-data-breach-after-vendor-accellion-hack/">Bleeping Computer</a>, Morgan Stanley admitted that threat actors stole an unknown number of documents containing customers&#8217; addresses and Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>The documents were encrypted, but the letter said that the hackers also obtained the decryption key, though Morgan Stanley said the files did not contain passwords that could be used to access customers&#8217; financial accounts.</p>
<p>“The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very seriously,” a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are in close contact with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients.”</p>
<p>Just days before news of the Morgan Stanley data breach came to light, an <a href="https://www.arhealthwellness.com/about-us.html">Arkansas-based healthcare provider</a> confirmed it had also suffered a data breach as a result of the Accellion attack. Just weeks before that, so did UC Berkeley. While data breaches tend to grow past initially reported figures, the fact that organizations are still coming out as Accellion victims more than six months later shows that the business software provider still hasn’t managed to get a handle on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The cyberattack was first uncovered on December 23, and Accellion initially claimed the FTA vulnerability was patched within 72 hours before it was later forced to explain that new vulnerabilities <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/press-releases/accellion-provides-update-to-recent-fta-security-incident/">were discovered</a>. Accellion’s next (and final) update came in March, when the company claimed that all known FTA vulnerabilities — which authorities say were exploited by the FIN11 and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/ukrainian-police-arrest-multiple-clop-ransomware-gang-suspects/">Clop ransomware gang</a> — have been remediated.</p>
<p>But incident responders said Accellion’s response to the incident wasn’t as smooth as the company let on, claiming the company was slow to raise the alarm in regard to the potential danger to FTA customers.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, for example, raised concerns about the timeliness of alerts it received from Accellion. In a <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2021/05/reserve-bank-taking-action-to-respond-to-data-breach-reports">statement</a>, the bank said it was reliant on Accellion to alert it to any vulnerabilities in the system — but never received any warnings in December or January.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this instance, their notifications to us did not leave their system and hence did not reach the Reserve Bank in advance of the breach. We received no advance warning,&#8221; said RBNZ governor Adrian Orr.</p>

<p>This, according to a discovery made by KPMG International, was due to the fact that the email tool used by Accellion failed to work: &#8220;Software updates to address the issue were released by the vendor in December 2020 soon after it discovered the vulnerability. The email tool used by the vendor, however, failed to send the email notifications and consequently the Bank was not notified until 6 January 2021,&#8221; the KPMG&#8217;s <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/data-breach/kpmg-incident-assessment.pdf">assessment</a> said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have not sighted evidence that the vendor informed the Bank that the System vulnerability was being actively exploited at other customers. This information, if provided in a timely manner is highly likely to have significantly influenced key decisions that were being made by the Bank at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, back when it was <a href="https://www.accellion.com/company/security-updates/mandiant-issues-final-report-regarding-accellion-fta-attack/">releasing updates</a> about the ongoing breach, Accellion was keen to emphasize that it was planning to retire the 20-year-old FTA product in April and that it had been working for three years to transition clients onto its new platform, Kiteworks. A press release from the company in May says 75% of Accellion customers have <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/05/18/2231538/0/en/Accellion-FTA-Customers-Migrate-to-Kiteworks-to-Protect-Their-Most-Sensitive-Data.html">already migrated</a> to Kiteworks, a figure that also highlights the fact that 25% are still clinging to its now-retired FTA product.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This, along with Accellion now taking a more hands-off approach to the incident, means that the list of victims could keep growing. It’s currently unclear how many the attack has claimed so far, though recent tallies put the list at around 300. This list includes Qualys, Bombardier, Shell, Singtel, the University of Colorado, the University of California, Transport for New South Wales, Office of the Washington State Auditor, grocery giant Kroger and law firm Jones Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a patch is issued for software that has been actively exploited, simply patching the software and moving on isn’t the best path,&#8221; Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Since the goal of patch management is protecting systems from compromise, patch management strategies should include reviews for indications of previous compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accellion declined to comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://powerz.tech">PowerZ</a> has raised another $8.3 million (€7 million at today’s exchange rate) including $1.2 million (€1 million) in debt — the rest is a traditional equity round. The company is both an edtech startup and a video game studio with an ambitious goal — it wants to build a game that is as engaging as Minecraft or Fortnite, but with a focus on education.</p>
<p>In February, PowerZ launched the first version of its game on computers. It doesn’t have a lot of content, but the company wanted to start iterating as quickly as possible. Aimed at kids who are six years old and over, PowerZ teleports the player into a fantasy world with cute dragons and magic spells.</p>
<p>“The idea is really to build a sort of Harry Potter,” co-founder and CEO Emmanuel Freund told me. “You have this world that is super nice and very interesting. Like with Hogwarts, you want to come back regularly, and the story will progress over a very long time.”</p>
<p>15,000 children tried out the first chapter. On average, they spent four hours in the game. I asked whether Freund was satisfied with those metrics. He told me he thought his company’s vision was “completely validated.”</p>
<p>Bpifrance Digital Venture, RAISE Ventures and Bayard are investing in today’s round. Existing investors Educapital, Hachette Livres, Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet and Michaël Benabou are also investing once again.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175174" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2175174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png" alt="" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=1536,922 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/devices-background.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PowerZ</p></div></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to add content, expand to other platforms and launch new languages. When it comes to content, the company wants to partner with other game studios. They’re going to create new islands and design games that make you learn new stuff. Zero Games, Opal Games and ArkRep are the first third-party studios to contribute to PowerZ.</p>
<p>When those new chapters are available, kids will be able to practice mental calculation, geometry, vocabulary, foreign languages, sign language, but also astronomy, photography, architecture, sculpture, cooking, wildlife, yoga, etc.</p>
<p>“Basically we want to position ourselves as a publisher,” Freund said. “The only thing we want to keep in-house is the main storyline.”</p>
<p>As for new platforms, PowerZ is launching its game on the iPad this week. The company realized that launching on computers was a mistake. Adults are already using computers or don’t want to leave your kid on the computer. That’s why PowerZ is starting with the iPad and the iPhone will follow suite. In 2022, the company expects to release its game on the Nintendo Switch and potentially other game consoles.</p>
<p>While the game is only available in French for now, the startup is also thinking about launching an English version soon.</p>
<p>“The game is completely free right now. We have an idea to monetize it. We&#8217;ll copy every other games with in-app purchases for visual items,” Freund said.</p>
<p>When you look further down the roadmap, PowerZ has some radically ambitious goals. Freund believes that educational games will become mainstream really quickly. Many companies don’t want to develop this kind of stuff because screens are bad for kids.</p>
<p>“If we just say that screens are bad, we’ll end up with an Amazon product to learn math. I feel a sense of urgency to develop an educational platform for screens that can scale,” Freund told me.</p>
<p>PowerZ wants to reach hundreds of thousands of children as quickly as possible. And just like Fortnite or Minecraft, the company believes its game can act as a platform for other stuff that can evolve over time.</p>
