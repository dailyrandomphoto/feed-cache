										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks, incumbent banks, and all of the many businesses that are making inroads into any kind of banking service all have something in common: when it comes to launching a new product like a credit line or a deposit or current account, these days many of them are opting not to build from the ground up, but are instead using third-party technology to power these services. Today, one of the big players in providing that tech is announcing a large round of funding to expand its business, underscoring the growth in this market.</p>
<p><a href="http://mambu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a>, a Berlin-based startup that describes itself as an SaaS banking platform &#8212; providing, by way of APIs, technology to banks and others to power lending, deposit and other banking products &#8212; has closed a round of €100 million (about $122 million at today&#8217;s rates). The funding gives Mambu a post-money valuation of €1.7 billion (just over $2 billion at today&#8217;s rates), the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eugene Danilkis said it will be using the money to expand deeper in the 50 markets where it is already active, as well as focus more on specific regions like South America and Asia. (And for those keeping tabs on the &#8220;Is the Bay Area dead?&#8221; story, it&#8217;s one of the many tech companies with its US offices established in Miami.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mambu has been seeing 100% growth year-on-year, but notably, Mambu covered 50 markets when it last raised money, <a href="http://www.eu-startups.com/2019/02/mambu-raises-e30million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€30 million in 2019</a>, so you can argue it has some investing and expanding to do on that front.</p>
<p>The round is being led by TCV, with Tiger Global and Arena Holdings, along with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital and Acton Capital Partners, also participating. TCV, known for making big growth round bets (it&#8217;s invested in the likes of Netflix, Facebook and Spotify in the past) has also been carving out a name for itself for backing some of the biggest names in European fintech and e-commerce, with recent investments including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolut</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mollie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relex</a>.</p>
<p>The market that Mambu is courting is the vast opportunity for a new wave of banking and financial services that tap into the growth of smartphone and web usage.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where people have to go into physical banks to take out or deposit money, or fill out loan applications and meet with assessors who ultimately decide whether you or your business will get money or not. In fact, many of those brick-and-mortar locations don&#8217;t even exist anymore. In their place are apps, websites, and on-demand services that live wherever people are spending time and money online.</p>
<p>Mambu&#8217;s platform, according to Danilkis, covers some 7,000 different banking products at the moment. These are roughly split across three primary categories: lending, current accounts and deposit accounts, but the sheer number of products really speaks to just how many ways and forms in which you are offered banking services today. (Take credit for example: you can get it through various kinds of cards, point of sale pay-later products, straight loans, and so on.) Alongside its own products, it also provides links through to <a href="https://www.mambu.com/post/transferwise-for-banks-integrates-with-mambu-cloud-banking-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain third-party financial services like TransferWise</a>, additional services such as security (perhaps a given for a banking platform) and a platform for &#8220;process orchestration&#8221; (its equivalent of providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business process management</a> tools).</p>
<p>Gartner estimates (cited by Mambu) put the banking software market at over $100 billion and growing at double-digits, and Mambu&#8217;s customer list reveals the range of companies that are vying these days for a piece of that action: they include the likes of challenger banks like N26 and OakNorth, but also large incumbent banks like Santander and ABN Amro, and telecoms carriers like Orange, which together cover some 20 million customers and some $12 billion under management, Mambu said.</p>
<p>And indeed, the bigger opportunity has also meant that companies like Mambu have a large and growing list of competitors too: they include newer companies like Rapyd and Unit, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a>, which raised a big round last year; <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a> and Italy’s <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a>. It will be interesting to see how newer entrants in the SaaS banking-platform space disrupt what are, effectively, becoming incumbents in their own right: Mambu is now approaching 10 years old (it was founded in 2011). That could lead to consolidation, too.</p>
<p>Turning back to that customer list, I can understand the logic of a company not really in the business of financial services like a telco, or a neo-bank taking an API-based service to power banking &#8212; it focuses instead on building clever algorithms for running those services, and fast interfaces to make them easy to use &#8212; it was interesting to me to see large banks on that list, too. It turns out that the reason is because banks are up against it in another way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, banks have the functionality and capability, but launching something new is often a case of speed and cost,&#8221; said Danilkis. &#8220;The banks might have a generation-2 system but many will be much older. And  changing how a financial product behaves is very difficult and highly risky because even a small change can create problems. And those systems are not designed to work with APIs, so it is extremely hard if not impossible to connect to other systems, never mind in real time. Certain solutions or offerings become impossible or impractical to build yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Doran, the TCV partner, is joining Mambu&#8217;s board with this round, and while the company may be seen as an incumbent to some, its early mover position has helped it not only gain market share, but to stand out for investors as one of the players with staying power.</p>
<p>“Mambu was one of the first companies to leverage the opportunity to move banking software into the cloud,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;The team has built a highly composable, truly cloud-native product in a multi-billion dollar, rapidly-growing market traditionally dominated by large, slow-moving on-prem vendors. We have been following Mambu’s progress for many years and are truly delighted to be able to partner with Eugene and the entire Mambu team on their journey to expand their offerings to customers worldwide.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital services taxes adopted by India, Italy, and Turkey in the past years discriminate against U.S. companies, the U.S. Trade Representative said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>USTR, which began investigations into the three nation’s digital services taxes in June last year, said it found them to be inconsistent with international tax principles, unreasonable, and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.</p>
<p>In its detailed reports, which the office has <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">made public</a>, USTR studied how these digital taxes affected companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, and Twitter. USTR said it conducted these investigations on the ground of Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India, which has become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">largest market for Silicon Valley giants</a> Google and Facebook, introduced digital taxes in 2016 to target foreign firms. Last year, the world’s second largest internet market expanded the scope of its levy to cover a range of additional categories.</p>
<p>USTR investigation <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Report%20on%20India%E2%80%99s%20Digital%20Services%20Tax.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that New Delhi was taxing “numerous categories of digital services that are not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world” and that the aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year.  It also took issue with India not levying similar taxes on local companies.</p>
<p>Despite the strong findings on three nations’ digital services taxes, USTR said it is not taking any specific actions “at this time” but will “continue to evaluate all available options.”</p>
<p>U.S. tech companies have in the past supported terms brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But OECD, which is currently in the middle of working out technical details for agreements for over a 100 nations, doesn’t expect to finish the work until mid-2021. In the absence of OECD agreements, various countries are moving forward with their own versions of the taxes.</p>
<p>Since June last year, USTR has initiated investigations into digital services tax instituted &#8212; or proposed to be put in place &#8211; by a number of countries including Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and France, which resumed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/">collecting digital services tax from US companies</a> late last year.</p>
<p>In retaliation, USTR had set a January 6 deadline for levying a 25% tariff on a range of French imported goods including cosmetics and handbags.</p>
<p>USTR did not say whether the tariff had been enforced, but in a <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">statement</a> said it expects to announce the progress or completion of additional investigations in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://toogoodtogo.com">Too Good To Go</a>, the startup that lets you buy food right before it goes to waste, is raising a $31.1 million round. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blisce">blisce/</a> is leading the round and investing $15.4 million as part of today’s round. Existing investors and employees are also participating. While the company has been around for a while, this is the first time Too Good To Go is raising money from a VC firm.</p>
<p>The startup has been operating across several European countries for a few years now. It runs a marketplace focused on food waste. On one side, restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries and other food businesses contribute surplus food items. On the other side, consumers can snatch food right before it becomes unsellable.</p>
<p>It’s a win for everybody as businesses can generate a bit of revenue from surplus food, customers can buy food at great prices and it reduces unnecessary waste. Of course, it’s also beneficial for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/too-good-to-go-c930" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="too-good-to-go-c930">Too Good To Go <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the company takes a commission on transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s CEO Mette Lykke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/mette-lykke-on-food-waste-and-building-a-big-startup-on-a-big-idea/">told</a> TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden that one-third of food produced today is either lost or wasted — so there’s a big market opportunity. While the startup has been growing nicely, the pandemic has had a big impact on revenue — many restaurants shut down and many customers prefer to stay at home.</p>
<p>Back in September, Lykke told TechCrunch that Too Good To Go saw a 62% drop in revenue due to Covid-19. But that’s not going to stop the company.</p>
<p>Overall, Too Good To Go is operating in 15 countries and has saved 50 million meals. 65,000 businesses have sold something on Too Good To Go so far. 30 million people signed up to the service.</p>

<p>Too Good To Go is already working on its biggest expansion — the U.S. Just like in Europe, billions of pounds of food go to waste. According to <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">USDA’s Economic Research Service</a>, it represents 30 to 40% of the food supply.</p>
<p>As the startup’s operations are extremely local, Too Good To Go is starting with specific metropolitan areas in the U.S. In September, the company started its operations in the U.S. with New York City and Boston. Too Good To Go has expanded to part of New Jersey since then.</p>
<p>In the U.S. alone, the startup has attracted 150,000 users and is working with 600 businesses. It has sold 50,000 meals. Those numbers are still somewhat small, but it’s been a weird quarter for restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it evolves in the coming months. With today’s new funding round, it should definitely boost usage in the U.S. and make it easier to plan for the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.pennylane.tech">Pennylane</a> has raised $18.4 million (€15 million) for its accounting service that combines automated processes with human accountants. Existing investors Global Founders Capital and Partech are investing once again.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pennylane" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pennylane">Pennylane <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is both a software-as-a-service company that helps you deal with your financial data and an accounting firm. By working with accountants directly, it means that you can talk with your accountant through the company’s platform. It becomes a single source of information for financial data.</p>
<p>The startup wants to improve the experience for both its clients and its accountants. Usually, accounting firms receive data every month or every quarter. They waste a ton of time opening files and entering information in accounting software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, accounting reports are a black box for CEOs and CFOs. They can’t leverage that data for financial projections and visibility. Pennylane wants to change that so that you don’t have to use Excel to predict your company’s P&amp;L.</p>
<p>When you first start working with Pennylane, you connect your account with third-party services that already hold valuable information, such as Stripe, Payfit, Qonto, Zoho, Sellsy, etc. This way, information is always up to date, and not just when you manually export data from all your services.</p>
<p>A year after launch, Pennylane has generated €2 million in revenue ($2.5 million) and attracted 550 customers. There are now 30 accountants working for the company.</p>
<p>Up next, the startup wants to attract more companies, and especially companies that have an in-house accounting team or work with an accounting firm already. You&#8217;ll be able to use Pennylane&#8217;s software-as-a-service with your own accountant.</p>
<p>Pennylane had previously raised a $4.3 million (€4 million) seed round with Global Founders Capital, Partech and Kima Ventures.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s because, argues Arvela, every patent publication can be distilled down to a simpler knowledge graph that &#8220;resonates&#8221; with the way IP professionals think and is infinitely more machine readable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded IPRally in April 2018, after one year of bootstrapping and proof-of-concepting with my co-founder and CTO Juho Kallio,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Before that, I had digested the graph approach myself for about two years and collected the courage to start the venture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arvela says patent search is a hard problem to solve since it involves both deep understanding of technology and the capability to compare different technologies in detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why this has been done almost entirely manually for as long as the patent system has existed. Even the most recent out-of-the-box machine learning models are way too inaccurate to solve the problem. This is why we have developed a specific ML model for the patent domain that reflects the way human professionals approach the search task and make the problem sensible for the computers too&#8221;.</p>
<p>That approach appears to be paying off, with IPRally already being used by customers such as Spotify and ABB, as well as intellectual property offices. Target customers are described as any corporation that actively protects its own R&amp;D with patents and has to navigate the IPR landscape of competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IPRally is not without its own competition. Arvela cites industry giants like Clarivate and Questel that dominate the market with traditional keyword search engines.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a few other AI-based startups, like Amplified and IPScreener. &#8220;IPRally’s graph approach makes the searches much more accurate, allows detail-level computer analysis, and offer a non-black-box solution that is explainable for and controllable by the user,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat locked President Donald Trump’s account after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol</a>. A Snap spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the action was taken on Wednesday and added that the company will monitor the situation closely before re-evaluating its decision.</p>
<p>This is not the first time <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken action against Trump’s account over concerns about dangerous rhetoric from the president. In June, it announced content from Trump’s Snapchat would no longer be promoted in its Discover tab, and would only be visible to users if they subscribe to or search for it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/we-stand-together">blog post</a> published shortly before Snap announced its decision, co-founder and chief executive officer Evan Spiegel said that Snapchat &#8220;simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/">Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/embed/#?secret=CeDEyE2k7l" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike many other social media platforms, Snapchat was created for users to communicate with friends instead of a wider audience, the Snap spokesperson said. It has focused on making it harder to spread misinformation by relying on moderated and vetted content. For example, the Discover tab only features content from editorial partners like Reuters and other news organizations.</p>
<p>Twitter also locked Trump out of his account after forcing the removal of three tweets, but that action may <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">last for only twelve hours</a>. Facebook and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">locked Trump out of posting for 24 hours</a> and blocked the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>
<p>Many activists are calling for Twitter and Facebook to make their bans permanent, with ethics organization Accountable Tech <a href="https://twitter.com/accountabletech/status/1346938971172073473">tweeting</a> that &#8220;the violent assault on the Capitol today has been heartbreaking, but not entirely unexpected. Sadly, Twitter and Facebook’s preparedness and response has been wildly inadequate. Simply labeling incitements of violence is not enough.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The State Department ordered diplomats to stop posting on social media after pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/state-dept-social-media-silence/index.html">reports CNN</a>, citing three diplomatic sources. Diplomats overseas were also told by the under secretary for public affairs to remove scheduled content for Facebook, Hootsuite and Twitter until told otherwise, and that planned social media posts from the State Department’s main accounts were also being suspended.</p>
<p>According to CNN, diplomats are usually only told to pause social media posts after a terrorist attack or major natural disaster.</p>
<p>As of late Wednesday evening in the United States, the main <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept">State Department Twitter account </a>had only retweeted a thread by Secretary of State MIchael Pompeo in which he said &#8220;the storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>So far, the official Instagram accounts of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">State Department’s Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">Pompeo</a> and the State Department’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo">YouTube</a> have made no posts after the rioting at the Capitol, while the State Department&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/statedept/posts/10157789477951074">Facebook page</a> has a post repeating Pompeo’s Twitter thread.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has contacted the State Department for comment.</p>
<p>Social media platforms scrambled to react after an extraordinary and terrifying <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html">day of violence that resulted in the deaths of four people</a>. Rioters breached the Capitol early Wednesday afternoon, as electoral votes were being counted, forcing lawmakers to evacuate (the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote">joint session was later reconvened</a>).</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Twitter required the removal of three of President Donald Trump’s tweets and locked his account for twelve hours, before stating that he would be permanently suspended for future violations of its Civic Integrity policy. Facebook and Instagram announced that the president would barred from posting to his accounts for 24 hours and began blocking content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was hard not to feel emotional today, as the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/social-media-allowed-a-shocked-nation-watch-a-coup-attempt-in-real-time/">watched for more than four hours</a> as rioters stormed into and throughout the Capitol building in Washington to disrupt the certification of the election win of incoming U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden. They&#8217;d been encouraged earlier in the afternoon by outgoing President Donald Trump to head to the building and protest what he falsely claimed yet again was a stolen election, a lie he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ESXL7J6DY">began to spread</a> the evening of the U.S. election in November.</p>
<p>While members of Congress called on Trump to make a statement rebuking the rioters&#8217; actions from their undisclosed locations, he instead encouraged his supporters over Twitter, writing of the &#8220;sacred landslide election victory&#8221; that was &#8220;so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots&#8221; and later posting a video in which repeated his lies about a &#8220;landslide election that was stolen from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/mayhem-erupts-in-the-u-s-capitol-as-congress-certifies-electoral-votes">first time in American history</a> that supporters of the losing presidential candidate forcibly disrupted the official counting of electoral votes, as noted earlier in the evening by PBS. And while Trump&#8217;s tweets were <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/twittersafety/status/1346970430062485505">later deleted</a> by Twitter for &#8220;repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,&#8221; the move was viewed by many as <a href="https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/1346971654484680707?s=20">too little and too late</a>, including by Silicon Valley investors, a wide number of whom let loose their fury toward the outgoing administration and its enablers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
A lingering question is whether the ignominious day &#8212; one on which a dozen Senate Republicans and dozens more Republican House members had planned to object to the certification of the election results &#8212; will begin to polarize people further or whether, following Trump&#8217;s departure, some of that fury begins to subside instead.</p>
<p>Some investors, at least, say their anger has always had more to do with basic human decency, which seemed frequently to take a backseat during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Deena Shakir of Lux Capital used to work for the Obama administration and is transparent about her political perspective on Twitter. But she says of today&#8217;s events that they &#8220;are not about politics. What we have witnessed is an affront to democracy, an assault on American history, and a gruesome reflection of the divided nation we live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hunter Walk &#8212; who cofounded the venture firm Homebrew and today tweeted, &#8220;don&#8217;t be putting [Trump son-in-law and White House advisor] Jared Kushner on cap tables <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1346923275637571592">when this is all said and done</a>&#8221; &#8212; echoes the sentiment. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to have a strong public voice on issues I consider to be urgent and essential human rights questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether the shock of today might make it harder to fund or partner with a team who supported Trump&#8217;s ascendency, Walk suggests it won&#8217;t, that business is business. &#8220;We fund wonderful entrepreneurs and employ no purity tests on whether they agree with us 100%. I&#8217;m certain we&#8217;ve backed people who sit to our political left and to our political right &#8211; that&#8217;s not an issue for us and not an issue for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the extent that Walk&#8217;s public political stance may turn off some talented founders who &#8220;would just prefer their investors shut up and write checks,&#8221; that&#8217;s &#8220;ok,&#8221; too, says Walk. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe we need to compromise our values in order to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shakir meanwhile suggests that she doesn&#8217;t always have the luxury of tuning out politics entirely. For one thing, she considers those who terrorized the nation&#8217;s capital all afternoon &#8220;angered perpetrators of a jingoistic, supremacist ideology that is not only normalized but actually incited by the highest branch of our government and amplified via social media.&#8221;</p>
<p>More, she notes, &#8220;Given my focus on healthcare, so much of my own thesis development and so many of my conversations have inevitably been informed by the pandemic, which—for better or worse—has become politicized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try as she might to bifurcate politics from work, it&#8217;s futile right now, Shakir says. &#8220;These events and policies inform our present and our future, affect the markets that value our companies, and contribute to trends and white spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, she adds, they also &#8220;reflect our values as a nation and as human beings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eat Just, a food startup from San Francisco making chicken-less eggs, has ambitions to crack the Chinese market where consumer appetite for plant-based food is growing and other Western vegan substitute brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">Beyond became available</a> in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The startup said this week it will be suppling to fast-food chain Dicos, a local rival to McDonald&#8217;s and KFC in China. The agreement will see Eat Just add its plant-based eggs to the restaurant&#8217;s breakfast items across more than 500 locations. The eggs are derived from a legume called mung beans, which have long been a popular ingredient for soup, noodles and dessert in China.</p>
<p>At Dicos in major Chinese cities, consumers will find Eat Just eggs in breakfast burgers, bagel sandwiches and Western-style breakfast plates. That diversifies the Dicos plant-based menu which already includes <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006329/dicos%2C-chinas-rival-to-kfc%2C-unveils-imitation-chicken-burgers">a vegan chicken burger</a> supplied by local startup Starfield. Dicos also offers a gateway into China&#8217;s low-tier cities where it has built a stronghold and can potentially help evangelize plant-based proteins in communities beyond China&#8217;s urban yuppies. The chain operates a total of 2,600 stores in China and serves 600 million customers a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eat Just first entered China in 2019 and currently generates less than 5% of its revenue from the country, Andrew Noyes, head of global communications at Eat Just, told TechCrunch. But over time, the company expects China to account for more than half of its revenue. Ten of its 160 employees are based in China.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been intentional about starting small, going slow and hiring people who know the market and understand how to build a sustainable business there. We&#8217;ve also been focused on finding the right partners to work with on downstream manufacturing, sales and distribution, and that work continues,&#8221; said Noyes.</p>
<p>The partnership with Dicos arrived on the heels of Eat Just&#8217;s announcement to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/eat-just-partners-with-proterra-to-launch-a-new-subsidiary-in-asia/"> set up an Asia subsidiary</a>. The nine-year-old company, formerly Hampton Creek, has raised over $300 million from prominent investors including Li Ka-Shing, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures. It was last valued at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Before its tie-up with Dicos, Eat Just had already been selling online in China through Alibaba and JD.com among other retail channels. Its China business is currently growing by 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no shortage of strong competition in the plant-based food race in China, Eat Just claims it&#8217;s taken a unique angle by zeroing in on eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based meat companies offer products that pair deliciously with Just Egg,&#8221; the brand name of the startup&#8217;s main product, Noyes noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based foods are increasing in popularity among Chinese consumers and more sustainable eating is becoming part of a national dialogue about the feeding of the country in the future. China produces about 435 billion eggs per year and demand for protein is increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Euromonitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">predicted</a> that China, the world&#8217;s largest meat-consuming country, would see its &#8220;free from meat&#8221; market size grow to $12 billion by 2023, compared to $10 billion in 2018.</p>

<p>Both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Instagram also announced that the president would be locked out of posting to his accounts for 24 hours, escalating the consequences for his role in sowing Wednesday&#8217;s violent chaos considerably.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook says that the group of people who rushed into the Capitol Wednesday now fall under the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations">company&#8217;s policies on &#8220;dangerous individuals and organizations&#8221;</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> — a designation it uses to enforce rules against terrorists, mass murderers and violent hate groups. Last June, the company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-boogaloo-ban/">added the anti-government &#8220;boogaloo&#8221; movement</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which encourages its adherents to take up arms and prepare for or incite a civil war, to the same list.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram have both begun blocking content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag. Facebook says that it is in the process of removing any content praising the Trump supporters who infiltrated the U.S. Capitol as well as any other &#8220;incitement or encouragement&#8221; of Wednesday&#8217;s events, including photos and videos from the individuals&#8217; perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point they represent promotion of criminal activity which violates our policies,&#8221; Facebook VP of Integrity Guy Rosen and VP of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/">wrote in a blog post</a>. Rosen and Bickert called Wednesday&#8217;s events an &#8220;emergency&#8221; for the platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let us speak for the leadership team in saying what so many of us are feeling. We are appalled by the violence at the Capitol today. We are treating these events as an emergency. Our Elections Operations Center has already been active in anticipation of the Georgia elections and the vote by Congress to certify the election, and we are monitoring activity on our platform in real time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company will also crack down on anyone organizing any kind of protest that violates Washington D.C.&#8217;s newly implemented curfew, even peaceful gatherings. Any &#8220;attempts to restage violence&#8221; will also be removed.</p>

<p>Facebook says that it is also scouring the platform for any posts calling for people to bring weapons to a location &#8220;not just in Washington but anywhere in the US — including protests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook also made a few tweaks to &#8220;emergency measures&#8221; it put in place for the U.S. election, including requiring additional admin review for group posts and auto-disabling comments on group posts that attract a &#8220;high rate&#8221; of hate speech or encouragement of violence.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s blog post also mentions previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">crackdowns on militias</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off/">the Proud Boys</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/">&#8220;violence-inducing&#8221; QAnon conspiracy</a>. Each group connected and grew on Facebook before eventually eventually being booted from the platform and all three had a presence at Wednesday&#8217;s violent attempt to overthrow the U.S. election results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">historic and terrifying coup attempt</a> by pro-Trump extremists in Washington, D.C. played out live the same way it was fomented — on social media. Once again Twitter, streaming sites and other user-generated media were the only place to learn what was happening in the nation&#8217;s capital — and the best place to be misled by misinformation and propaganda.</p>
<p>In the morning, official streams and posts portended what people expected of the day: a drawn-out elector certification process in Congress while a Trump-led rally turned to general protests. But when extremists gathered at the steps of the U.S. Capitol building, the country watched isolated flare-ups between them and police turn into a full-blown violent invasion of several federal buildings, including where Congress was holding a joint session.</p>

<p>Network news and mainstream sources struggled to keep up as people on both sides documented the chaos that followed. As extremists pushed into the outlying buildings, then the rotunda, then the House and Senate chambers, everyone from White House press pool reporters to political aides and elected officials from both parties live-tweeted and streamed the events as they happened.</p>
<p>Videos of outnumbered security guards retreating from mobs or trading blows were seen by millions, who no doubt could barely believe it was really occurring. Meanwhile, reports propagated from around the country as smaller invasions of government buildings took place.</p>

<p>On one hand, it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/18/for-seattles-cop-free-protest-zone-tech-is-both-a-revolutionary-asset-and-disastrous-liability/"> further demonstrated the power of social media</a> to serve as a distributed, real-time aggregator of important information. It is hard to overstate the importance of receiving information directly from the source, such as when people inside the Senate chamber posted images of the rioters attempting to break through a barricaded door while security inside pointed their guns through broken windows.</p>
<p>Representatives, aides and reporters posted live as they were evacuated from their offices, told to lie on the ground to avoid being shot or given gas masks in case tear gas or pepper spray was deployed. What might have seemed an abstraction when reported by a talking head on the National Mall was rendered shockingly visceral as these people expressed fear for their lives. The people to whom we have been trained to alert of such things, our elected officials, were the very ones being threatened.</p>
<p>However, social media also allowed for the amplification and normalization of these historic crimes as rioters streamed as they went and posted images to fringe sites like Parler and Trump-themed Reddit clones. It wasn&#8217;t hard to spot rioters apparently &#8220;doing it for the &#8216;gram&#8221; despite those images and videos comprising what amounts to a confession of a federal crime.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Meanwhile Trump and his allies downplayed the violence, blaming Democrats for using &#8220;malicious rhetoric&#8221; and repeating unfounded claims regarding the election.</p>
<p>Years of &#8220;we take this very seriously&#8221; by the likes of Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg have done little to curb the activity by the likes of white supremacists, self-styled &#8220;militias&#8221; like the Proud Boys, and misinformation aggregators like &#8220;Stop the steal&#8221; groups. Despite constant assurances that AI and a crack team of moderators are on the job, it is still on these platforms that we find misleading and false information about topics such as COVID-19 and election security.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/tech-leaders-speak-out-about-platforms-roles-in-us-capitol-riots/">Tech leaders today voiced, not for the first time</a>, their frustration with these companies, and while deplatforming has proven effective in some ways, it is not a complete solution. As the cost and difficulty of launching, say, a streaming site, continues to decrease, it is only to be expected that when a YouTuber gets kicked off that platform, they will land softly on another and their audience will follow.</p>

<p>The promise and the danger of social media were both on display today at their absolute maximum. One can hardly imagine such an event playing out in the future without the intimate details to which we were treated from the sides of both government and insurrectionists.</p>
<p>While Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-and-youtube-remove-trump-video-calling-extremists-special/">taken varying actions</a>, of varying seriousness and permanence, it seems clear that whether or not they want to crack down on the worst of it, they may no longer be able to, either because they lack the tools, or the offenders have built a Twitter, Facebook and YouTube of their own.</p>

<p>After Trump released a video calling the extremists &#8220;very special&#8221; and telling them to go home, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Twitter have taken down the content. Twitter has locked Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">Twitter account for at least 12 hours</a>, warning that &#8220;any future violations&#8221; of Twitter rules will result in permanent suspension of the account.</p>
<p>The riot triggered the platforms, after long scrutiny, to finally react to Trump&#8217;s incendiary tweets and messaging. As the situation continues to play out, some prominent tech figures see the root of the riots as the platforms that ignored and amplified misinformation surrounding the election, allowing violent rhetoric to spin out of control in the final days of the Trump presidency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tech platforms have repeatedly come under fire for failing to address the rise of misinformation and groups coalescing around conspiracy theories. Twitter’s latest response has been the introduction of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/"> tags to flag potential misinformation.</a></p>
<p>Ellen Pao, tech investor and the former CEO of Reddit, argues today&#8217;s chaos is directly linked to Dorsey&#8217;s inaction. <a href=" https://ekp.medium.com/were-embarrassed-that-it-s-gotten-to-the-point-where-we-have-to-explicitly-write-this-c422f7120e27">In November</a>, Pao and Laura Gómez, a former tech founder and CEO, called on Dorsey to limit Trump’s influence on Twitter, explicitly accusing Trump of using Twitter to incite &#8220;a coup.&#8221;</p>

<p>A recent video from Trump, where he calls the rioters “special people” and urges them to go home, has recently been taken down from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity at Facebook, tweeted that the events are an “emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump&#8217;s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/">released an official statement as well.</a></p>
<p>With Inauguration Day just two weeks out, platforms will continue to play an intense role in safeguarding a peaceful transfer of power. Today’s events feel like a tipping point. The terrorism has pushed Silicon Valley tech figures to criticize some of the industry’s most powerful leaders and implore them to act before further violence takes place.</p>
<p>“Let me say in no uncertain terms @jack @vijaya @kayvz: If you do not suspend Donald Trump’s Twitter account for the next day at least, this mob attack on Congress is also on you.

<p>Color of Change and other activist organizations have said that major tech and financial service companies are complicit in the insurrection in Washington, D.C. and called for social media to take action. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter </a>has locked the president of the United States’ Twitter account and forced the removal of three offending tweets, but the social media platform has not removed him from the platform altogether.

<p>The organization also launched a petition that people can use to make a direct appeal to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The petition reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear CEO Jack Dorsey,</p>
<p>Donald Trump has historically violated your terms of service with impunity and now, as a result of his promotion and facilitation of today&#8217;s chaos, insurrectionists have stormed our Senate building leaving Senators, staffers, and building employees fearing for their lives. Trump’s tweets have endangered the lives of millions of Americans, from his rants cheering on white supremacists to now advocating for the National Guard to use deadly force against Americans who are protesting against police killings. There is no excuse for allowing this dangerous user to exploit your platform It’s time to #KickTrumpOffTwitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous other activist organizations, business groups and tech leaders have used social media to condemn the events Wednesday. <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech</a>, an ethics organization, tweeted Wednesday that the violent assault has been heartbreaking, but not expected. &#8220;Sadly, Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s preparedness and response has been wildly inadequate. Simply labeling incitements of violence is not enough.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Other organizations such as the U.S. Travel Association, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and Business Round Table offered their own condemnations of the events, but didn&#8217;t directly criticize social media for its involvement.</p>
<p>Business Roundtable, whose members are chief executive officers of major United States corporations, focused efforts on Trump and called for an end to the chaos and a peaceful transition of power. Others such as the National Association of Manufacturers used stronger language, noting that the protesters supporting Trump was an act of &#8220;sedition&#8221; and &#8220;mob rule&#8221; and urged Vice President Mike Pence to &#8220;seriously consider&#8221; invoking the 25th amendment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The service has long contended that tweets from a prominent figure like Trump were in the public interest, in spite of breaking its stated terms of service. According to Twitter guidelines,</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable. With this in mind, there are certain cases where it may be in the public’s interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>The removed tweets include content that was early flagged by the service, &#8220;due to a risk of violence,&#8221; all arriving in the wake of a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png 1453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The trio includes a pre-recorded video that pleaded with rioters to &#8220;go home,&#8221; before adding, &#8220;We love you; you&#8217;re very special.&#8221; Following the earlier action, Twitter told TechCrunch, “In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rule. Let us be clear: Threats of and calls to violence have no place on Twitter, and we will enforce our policies accordingly.”</p>
<p>Calls for the President&#8217;s twitter account to be deleted have intensified during today&#8217;s events. It has largely been assumed that Trump would be allowed to continue tweeting at least through the end of his presidency, but what unfolded at the Capitol today &#8212; and his responding tweets &#8212; appear to have caused the service to accelerate those punitive actions.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s action certainly doesn&#8217;t bode well for the fate of Trump&#8217;s account after returning to civilian life. The White House is also still in control of the @Potus account, through the transition on January 20.</p>

<p>A great deal of video and content from the chaotic scene in Washington, D.C. can be found on social media, but Trump&#8217;s commentary was spare. His posts suggested the rioters &#8220;remain peaceful,&#8221; well after they had broken into the Capitol buildings and Congress had been evacuated.</p>
<p>At about 5 PM Eastern time, Trump posted a video in which he reiterated that the election was &#8220;stolen&#8221; but that &#8220;you have to go home now. Go home, we love you. You&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this was soon restricted, with a large warning that &#8220;this Tweet can&#8217;t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity at Facebook, wrote on Twitter that &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">this is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump&#8217;s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At Facebook there is some precedent for one of Trump&#8217;s posts being removed. In August, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/facebook-trump-false-covid-claim-fox-news/">company took down a video</a> in which Trump stated that children were &#8220;almost immune&#8221; to COVID-19, a dangerous and false claim not supported by science.</p>
<p>As Twitter and Facebook crafted bespoke policies to address threats to the election leading into November, YouTube mostly remained quiet. In early December, a month after the election, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">the company announced</a> that it would begin removing content that made false claims that the U.S. election was affected by &#8220;widespread fraud or errors.&#8221; YouTube&#8217;s decision to remove the president&#8217;s video on Wednesday aligned with that policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We removed a video posted this afternoon to Donald Trump’s channel that violated our policies regarding content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Election,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson told TechCrunch, noting that the video is allowed if accompanied by proper context for &#8220;educational&#8221; value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol while the president encouraged them on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and &#8230; well, it feels extremely hard to care about anything else right now.</p>
<p>That said, there was a whole other news cycle before then, and I know you read The Daily Crunch for tech headlines. So I&#8217;ll do my best to carry on and squeeze everything in.</p>
<p>This is your Daily Crunch for January 6, 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>The big story: Trump tweets approvingly as rioters storm US Capitol</strong></p>
<p>As you almost certainly know already, a pro-Trump mob <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">entered the U.S. Capitol today</a>, forcing the Senate and House to flee as they were in the process of debating and certifying Joe Biden&#8217;s election as president.</p>
<p>These Trump supporters were chanting slogans like &#8220;stop the steal,&#8221; which grew out of online conspiracy theories that have spread on social media. At least one gunshot victim has been reported, and an explosive device was also detonated safely outside the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Trump continued to tweet his unfounded and unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and even posted a video telling the rioters, &#8220;Go home, we love you.&#8221; Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">posted warnings</a> but there are calls for the platform to go further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As chaos and violence have erupted in Washington, D.C., social media platforms are grappling with the fallout. A spokesperson for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reddit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reddit">Reddit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reddit’s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed.

<p>The site reportedly hasn’t seen a major change in user activity leading up to today’s  storming of the U.S. Capitol building &#8212; apparently owing in part to the banning of a number of subreddits, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">The_Donald</a>, over violations earlier this year.</p>
<p>The statement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">similar wording from Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems clear that much of the current reaction to the situation is in flux as this unprecedented and dark moment continues to unfold in Washington, D.C. For now, much of Reddit&#8217;s content control lies in the hands of site moderators.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s new message to his mob of angry supporters came in video form, following an earlier tweet encouraging the crowd to be &#8220;peaceful.&#8221; In the video, Trump both affirmed his supporters&#8217; conspiracy-rooted grievances and gently encouraged them to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your pain. I know you&#8217;re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;Go home, we love you. You&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A crowd of agitated Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Wednesday, storming into congressional chambers and even invading the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The effort, connected to the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement which Trump has regularly encouraged, happened as Congress was meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s electoral win.</p>

<p>Twitter has previously hidden the president&#8217;s rule-breaking tweets, affixed them with small warning labels and limited their engagement, but the large pop-up is a tool we hadn&#8217;t yet seen the company use. Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346926980437061633">said today</a> that it would &#8220;[explore] other escalated enforcement actions&#8221; in light of the situation unfolding at the Capitol. It&#8217;s not clear if the pop-up is appearing for all users and we&#8217;ve asked the company if this was one of the escalated measures it referred to.</p>
<p>&#8220;In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;Let us be clear: Threats of and calls to violence have no place on Twitter, and we will enforce our policies accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Shortly after restricting the video, Twitter restricted another tweet by Trump complaining of a &#8220;sacred landslide election&#8221; being &#8220;stripped away from great patriots.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A chaotic scene unfolded in Washington D.C. on Wednesday as a large crowd of pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol Building.</p>
<p>The Trump supporters flooded into the nation&#8217;s capital to attend a rally held earlier by President Trump outside the White House. The rally was timed to protest lawmakers gathering Wednesday to certify President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s electoral win.</p>
<p>At his own event, Trump encouraged his supporters to continue demonstrating against Congress, claiming incorrectly that Vice President Mike Pence holds the power to overturn the election results. While the situation is still unfolding, protesters penetrated the Capitol building and injuries have been confirmed, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/1346911986810961921">at least one gunshot victim</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As Trump supporters flooded up the Capitol steps with &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; hats and &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; banners, the president encouraged his supporters with more conspiratorial talk. &#8220;Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346900434540240897">wrote</a> in a tweet. &#8220;USA demands the truth!&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> appended a warning label calling Trump&#8217;s election fraud claims &#8220;disputed&#8221; to the tweet. After his supporters already made their way into the Capitol building, the president seemed to walk back his calls to action, calling for supporters to remain peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Twitter has limited retweets and other forms of engagement on Trump&#8217;s tweet, but is not hiding it behind a warning screen at this time. The company says it is &#8220;exploring other escalated enforcement actions&#8221; though declined to elaborate on what those steps were.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">Stop the Steal movement</a> grew out of online conspiracies boosting Trump&#8217;s unfounded claims that Democrats had in some way rigged the presidential election. In reality, U.S. electoral results were decisively in favor of Biden, though votes trickled in over an extended period of time, as expected, due to a massive expansion of pandemic-related mail-in voting.</p>

<p>Facebook made efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">rein in Stop the Spread groups</a> soon after the election, blocking the hashtag for violating its rules around election misinformation. &#8220;The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group,&#8221; Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said at the time.</p>
<p>Stop the Steal supporters also found a foothold on many other platforms, including Reddit, Twitter and alternative <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">social networks like Gab and Parler</a>, which have attracted far-right users with policies much friendlier to extremist content. The crowd at the capitol also shares <a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1346920710438936576">considerable overlap with QAnon</a>, a constellation of conspiracy theories that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/"> exploded on Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/youtube-bans-videos-promoting-conspiracy-theories-like-qanon-that-target-individuals/">YouTube</a> and other online platforms over the last few years.</p>
<p>In a live address Wednesday, President-elect Joe Biden said the events unfolding on Capitol Hill &#8220;bordered on sedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At their best, the words of a president can inspire,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;At their worst, they can incite.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Revenue-based investing (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rbi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rbi">RBI), <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also known as revenue-based financing, or revenue-share investing,<sup id="fnref1">1</sup> is a natural next step for the private equity and early-stage venture investment industry. However, due to RBI being a relatively new model, publicly available data is limited.</p>
<p>To address this foundational gap in market information, we have developed a proprietary data set of 32 RBI investment firms, 57 distinct funds and 134 companies that have secured revenue-based investing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Bootstrapp developed this extensive analysis on revenue-based investing for the purpose of accelerating the shift toward greater transparency and standardization within the industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Upon thoroughly analyzing the data, we’ve been able to identify the total number of investment firms and amount of capital that comprise the RBI industry, the specific verticals and business models that are most actively leveraging RBI, and the typical profile of companies that access this form of capital.</p>
<p>These findings are summarized below; a full industry-spanning report that defines the overall revenue-based investing market as it stands today is <a href="https://www.bootstrapp.co/2020-state-of-the-industry-revenue-based-investing/">available to download here</a>.</p>
<p>As context, the financial structures used by VCs haven&#8217;t evolved much since they first emerged in 1957. Today, the model is almost precisely the same, with only incremental changes such as more efficient capital markets and industry standards for structuring deals, pricing companies and more.</p>
<p>More recently, we have seen numerous new investment models and financing instruments, including <a href="https://earnestcapital.com/shared-earnings-agreement/">shared earnings agreements</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/capital">point-of-sale capital</a>. One of the most prominent and popular new models for investors is revenue-based investing (RBI).</p>
<p>However, because the model is new, there is a lack of publicly available data, industry standards have not yet been fully established, and similarly to the equity investment market, there is little transparency into the cost of capital that investees truly pay in exchange for taking on a revenue-based investment.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there have been some notable efforts to drive transparency in the RBI market. For example, Bigfoot Capital open-sourced its RBI model, <a href="https://www.bigfootcap.com/blog/revenue-based-financing">outlining it in a blog post</a> and sharing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hovkZNDw8nBugtWt3ZqW3VEuJRm_PY_Y4M93KZygjGM/edit?usp=sharing">their RBI financial model</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-KJRoOHSvDy7Z3yQbv-MMlF9PoQHbiN/view?usp=sharing">anonymized term sheet</a>, but a thorough, quantitative, industry-wide analysis has not been conducted until now.</p>
<p>In order to raise RBI, the company must normally be generating revenue, but is not necessarily required to be profitable, although profitability, or at least a near-term path to profitability, is often an important criteria for many investors. &#8220;For startups with revenue, RBI may be a good option because, even though the startup may not be profitable, it can reduce dilution &#8212; especially for founders,&#8221; said Emily Campbell of The Campbell Firm PLLC, a law firm that represents serial entrepreneurs and venture-backed businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking in some smart equity or convertible debt and balancing that money with other financing can be a good strategy for a startup,&#8221; she said. Profitability decreases the risk of default and assures that the investee has the ability to service the debt.</p>
<p>In regards to the applications that are best suited to RBI, B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies rise to the top of the list primarily because one is able to — in essence — securitize the revenue being generated by a company and then lend capital against that theoretical security. In addition to SaaS companies, RBI is being used quite frequently in the impact investing community as it solves the problem of a lack of normal M&amp;A or IPO exit paths for impact-driven companies and are sometimes marketed as a nonextractive form of investment structure.</p>
<p>Beyond B2B SaaS and impact investing, many other verticals are adopting the model as well, including e-commerce/D2C, consumer software, food and beverage, and more. It ought to be noted, however, that regardless of the specific business model a company employs, the investee is typically required to have repeatable sales and a track record that demonstrates a strong revenue stream, and therefore a clear ability to return the capital to the investors.</p>
<h2>The U.S. RBI landscape</h2>
<p>We have identified 32 U.S.-based firms actively investing via a revenue-based investing instrument, with those firms managing 57 distinct funds representing an estimated $4.31 billion in capital. Through our analysis of those firms, funds and investees, we found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of firms and the amount of capital committed to RBI is increasing, and we forecast that this trend will continue.</li>
<li>B2B software was not surprisingly the largest consumer of RBI,</li>
<li>There was a surprising amount of activity across industries that are not yet typically associated with revenue-based investing such as food and beverage, consumer products, fashion, and healthcare.</li>
</ol>
<p>Firms were included in the data set (and by extension, determined to be actively making revenue-based investments) if they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invest in companies using an instrument where the return is generated from the principal plus a flat fee that is paid back via a fixed percentage of revenue.</li>
<li>Payments to investors are made on a monthly (or longer) basis.</li>
<li>The payback period is expected to be longer than 12 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>The specific number of firms we believe to be quite accurate, representing only active, U.S.-based revenue-based investing firms. The number of funds, however, may be underestimated. This is due to the fact that, although each firm is associated with at least one fund, we did not include additional funds beyond that unless they were confirmed through other sources, such as the firms’ public communications, their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-d.asp">SEC Form D</a> or other sources as outlined in the methodology section at the conclusion of the full report.</p>
<p>The total amount of RBI capital that has already been allocated to companies across all firms and all years is $2.1 billion. However, it should be noted that this includes the outliers in our dataset, namely Kapitus, Clearbanc, Braavo and United Capital Source. Once we remove those firms, the remaining 28 firms, representing 51 funds, have allocated $592.8 million.</p>
<p>This figure of $592.8 million is almost certainly an underestimate due to the fact that only 19 of 32 firms had a known “amount of allocated capital,” whereas the remaining 13 firms have unknown values (i.e., zeros) for the amount of capital they have allocated thus far. Therefore, if all 32 firms had a valid and confirmed amount of allocated capital, we can logically conclude that the number would rise dramatically from the current figure of $592.8 million.</p>
<h2>Increasing popularity of RBI</h2>
<p>New RBI firms have been founded every year since 2013. In 2010, five firms were founded and in 2015 four additional firms were founded, then from 2014-2019, two or more firms were founded each year.</p>

<p>Clearly, there has been a major uptick in RBI firms being founded since 2005, with a relatively consistent number of new firms being founded over the 15 years since then. In the last 10 years alone, 25 RBI firms have been founded.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
