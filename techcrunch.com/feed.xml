										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here. </em></a><em>This is Part 1 of the Best Books gift guide. Part 2 with even more selections will be posted shortly.</em></p>
<p>2020 was a tough year for all of us, but a strong one for books (how often do you get to say that?). Sales are up, driven by lockdowns, boredom, and the need for escape. Yet, 2020 also felt like a watershed year for media in general, a time when we started to deeply question the value of real-time communications driven by fear.</p>
<p>Books are no guaranteed antidote to the daily grind of the information economy, but they do provide room for readers and authors to breathe, to take stock of where we are and where we are going. Not in the moment, but of the moment. Whether that means escaping into the lives of fictional characters on another planet, or understanding the lives of others on our very own, books provide the material that can help us rethink all that’s going on and what happens next.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So I’m delighted to share nine book recommendations from my fellow TechCrunch writers as well as a few VCs on what to read in 2020. Some books are a few weeks old, others a few years, but they all made an impact on the lives of their reviewers this year as we confronted one of the most challenging times in recent memory.</p>

<p><i>Dark Mirror</i> tells the story of how its author, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barton Gellman, became embroiled in reporting one of the biggest leaks of highly classified documents in a generation, thanks to former NSA contractor turned whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>
<p>Gellman was one of only a handful of people given a copy of the cache of “top secret” documents swiped by Snowden in 2013. The documents revealed the enormous scale of the U.S. government’s surveillance capabilities — and those of its allies. The book is written largely in first-person, and it shines a brand new light on the Snowden disclosures and published stories that followed, the mistakes that were made, as well as new revelations that were never previously told.</p>
<p>You learn more about Snowden, his character and temperament, how he collected thousands of classified documents from right under the NSA’s nose, how he came to “meet” Gellman for the first time, and what motives led the whistleblower to go public.</p>
<p>You also follow how Gellman sourced, vetted, and fact-checked some of the most significant findings from the documents — with help from researchers Ashkan Soltani and Julie Tate — from revealing the PRISM slides, to the jaw-dropping moment that Gellman recounted telling a Google engineer how the NSA was secretly siphoning off data from its private datacenter links. Gellman spares no detail of his years-long journey in covering the documents, and isn’t one to shy away from revealing his own struggles — not least trying to protect the cache from spies both at home and abroad, and fearing that he too could become a target.</p>
<p>Gellman brings a fresh perspective and hindsight on the narrative you might have followed in the aftermath of the scandal, and fills in the blanks during a period of time that had the world in turmoil. And yet seven years after the first of many stories broke, <i>Dark Mirror</i> continues to spill details never known before in every chapter. His storytelling is exquisite, even if you’ll never want to use the internet again after reading it.</p>

<p>Anyone who manages money, invests in others’ livelihoods or lives in America should read <i>The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap</i> by Mehrsa Baradaran, an associate dean and professor at the University of California-Irvine and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute.</p>
<p>Baradaran’s 2017 book explores the past efforts to create economic inclusion in the United States, how they have not succeeded and how any real attempts to improve the wealth gap would need to improve access to capital, among other solutions.</p>
<p>The book digs into financial institutions and policies that are responsible for creating and maintaining racial inequalities in the United States. Baradaran covers the racial wealth gap and its relation to banking as well as the history, political theories, policies and people who maintained the long-standing racist institutions with access to capital and therefore wealth. The book also addresses the idea that wealth is not the same as equality.</p>
<p>A median white family in America has 13 times more wealth than that of a median Black family. <i>The Color of Money</i> explains why that wealth gap continues, and why it tripled between 1984 and 2009, through history and an examination of government policies such as redlining and GI Bills as well as discriminatory behaviors.</p>
<p>Baradaran teaches the reader about the long history of financial institutions such as community banking, Black banks, mortgage lending and government programs (e.g. CDFI, CRA, GSE, OMBE and FDIC) that have played a role in these systems. She also investigates the limitations of capitalism due to segregation and exploitation during the Reconstruction era, the Great Migration, the New Deal era, Jim Crow, and throughout the neoliberal, trickle-down, small government, and war on drugs policies of the 1970s, 80s, 90s and beyond.</p>
<p>The book introduces the philosophies of many leaders, from Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King Jr., and Presidents Nixon and Reagan who argued that financial prosperity through Black capitalism (banking, ownership, boot straps and entrepreneurship) was the answer to equality. The author argues these ideas are not magic bullets to fix centuries of poverty and abysmal economic opportunity due to discriminatory government, banking policies and generally resource-poor communities. The book breaks down the stereotypes of self-help dogma that tout “save more, don’t spend so much or pull yourself up” and rejects the idea that those who are not wealthy just need more financial literacy or mentorship. “Self-help microfinance cannot overcome macro inequality and systemic racism.”</p>
<p>Deploying capital and creating economic opportunity in VC and in startups means it’s important to understand the racial wealth gap and the history of banking, credit and capital in the United States. As a society, we should constantly be learning from our past mistakes to ensure we are making better and equitable decisions for the future. <i>The Color of Money</i> is a necessary work that pushes us to correct those past wrongs.</p>

<p>The internet has completely upended the production of art (often labeled as “content” in the capitalist jargon du jour). When it first came to wide attention, the internet seemed like an invention of infinite promise for creatives — a medium of open expression and a network of new human connections that offered faster and broader access to the most brilliant minds of the world. Old barriers crumbled, and cyberspace would be the new basis for an ambitious era of art.</p>
<p>Along the way, the internet also decimated the economic foundations of the modern art world, and despite the media’s obsession with platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon, and Substack, has done almost nothing to underwrite the old middle-class careers that were once available to artists.</p>
<p>William Deresiewicz, the famed essayist of <a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/">The Disadvantages of an Elite Education</a> and a book on how colleges produce <a href="https://billderesiewicz.com/books/excellent-sheep/">Excellent Sheep</a>, turns his attention to the creator market and the economics of art. He’s both an observer and a participant, having left his decade-long teaching stint at Yale to go full freelancer. For the book, he interviewed about 150 creators across a range of fields, from painting and sculpture to writers and illustrators, and what he finds is, perhaps unsurprisingly, depressing.</p>
<p>In short, the economics of art today are terrifying. Platforms like Spotify pay a pittance for art, and the so-called “mid-list” works of artists are increasingly valueless. The internet may have millions of creators bopping around, but few of those people are getting paid, and an extremely small number are getting paid well. Like in so many other knowledge fields, there is an extreme superstar effect on the internet where a handful of artists can have all while almost all other artists have none.</p>
<p>While the descriptions of the salaries and lack of benefits offers some of the emotional heft of the book, Deresiewicz’ goes on to explore the history of the funding of the arts, from Renaissance patrons to the modern world of grant and foundation money, attempting to place our current predicament into context. He manages to critique everyone, from artists who refuse to adapt to the capitalistic structures of today to the art schools that profit off the indebtedness of their students. I was expecting a polemic, and got a reasonable slice of analysis instead.</p>
<p>It’s an eye-opening book, but necessarily incomplete. For the reality is, there are too many humans who want to produce art, and too few consumers who want to pay to observe and enjoy it. That supply and demand mismatch isn’t going away anytime soon. While the author has some interesting ideas about copyright and intellectual property commons and what not, the reality is that the plight of the artist is most definitely not a problem that has been solved by Silicon Valley technologists.</p>
<p>Most of the book isn’t revolutionary, but in many ways, few economics are for art. <i>The Death of the Artist</i> reminds us that the consumer choices we make do influence the kind of art we get — and the future prognosis isn’t good.</p>

<p>When you look back at World War II, you no doubt have heard about the male leaders and generals on all sides of the conflict. These are the people history typically remembers, but you don’t usually hear about the unsung heroes, who operated in the shadows doing the hard work that wins wars.</p>
<p>One such person is a woman named Virginia Hall.</p>
<p>Author Sonia Purnell tells her remarkable story in the ironically titled <i>A Woman of No Importance</i>. As it turns out, Hall was incredibly important, and she single-handedly helped organize the resistance in Nazi-occupied France, moving stealthily around the country, constantly on the run from the Gestapo and French authorities, while somehow maintaining contact and passing valuable information to England.</p>
<p>She did all this not only as a woman in a world that didn’t take women seriously, remarkably, she also accomplished this with only one leg. Hall lost one of her legs in a hunting accident and used a wooden prosthetic, making her even more conspicuous for the authorities who were constantly on her trail.</p>
<p>Hall, who grew up in Baltimore, traveled overseas as a girl and developed a fondness for France. Even after the hunting accident, she drove an ambulance in France when the Germans attacked in 1940, simply wanting to help. Later after returning to London, she somehow talked her way into a new spy network that was being formed by the English government. They lacked personnel who knew France and had contacts, so they took a chance on her. She rewarded them richly with a body of work that would help change the war. Later, she would work for the precursor to the CIA, the Office of Strategic Services, when America joined the war.</p>
<p>Among her accomplishments were building a network of spies, safe houses and supply routes. She quietly helped organize French resistance and once in place, made sure they had money, weapons, food and training. She once engineered a daring escape of her colleagues, who were being held captive by Nazi authorities in a well-guarded prison camp. She climbed over the rugged Pyrenees mountains through deep snow to safety in Spain when she had to escape the country.</p>
<p>In spite of these accomplishments and many more, she of course had to deal with overt sexism along the way, and Purnell tells how she was often required to report to men who were inferior in every sense. Often she just went her own way, bypassing the system and simply getting the job done.</p>
<p>While there were awards and accolades after the war, she mostly ignored them and seemed content to be a person who operated in the background. She later worked for the CIA, where again she had to deal with sexism and a general lack of respect for her accomplishments.</p>
<p>Hall should be a figure who is remembered and revered by history — a role model for all, a woman whose dogged persistence, intelligence and savvy helped win the war. I couldn’t put this book down, constantly astonished by her feats of daring and bravery, and by the fact that such an amazing person could have been lost to history if not for this impeccably researched book.</p>

<p>I was a competitive sprinter for many years. It’s how I cleared my head and maintained equilibrium, so the book I recommend to founders is <i>Shoe Dog</i>, Phil Knight’s story of how he started his career selling low-cost running shoes and turned it into a $160 billion empire.</p>
<p>I remember reading <i>Shoe Dog</i> for the first time shortly after it was published, under the arches at the Knight Management Center at Stanford, where I had just finished my degree while also working on my own startup. That building was named after Phil Knight, who received his MBA from Stanford and had <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/newsroom/school-news/nike-founder-phil-knight-give-105-million-stanford-gsb">donated $105 million</a> to the university.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about this book is that Knight was one of the first to discover the power of influencer marketing — most famously Nike’s connection with Michael Jordan in the 1980s. The deal was a partnership of equals between an up-and-coming company and a rising superstar, and it completely transformed the worlds of both sports shoes and celebrity endorsements.</p>
<p>Knight’s account of that partnership taught me to never take my own partnerships for granted. I consider myself lucky to work with influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Lady Gaga on Lightspeed portfolio companies Goop and Haus Laboratories respectively. By treating these as true partnerships of value and respect, we can aspire to achieve what Nike and Jordan did with theirs.</p>
<p><i>Shoe Dog</i> also drove home for me the incredible importance of word-of-mouth marketing. Knight writes about what happened when his first full-time employee, Jeff Johnson, walked around in a pair of Blue Ribbon Tigers: “People kept stopping him and pointing at his feet and asking where they could buy some neat shoes like those.”</p>
<p>When we analyzed Calm and Cameo to join our portfolio, we looked closely at their potential for generating word of mouth and were impressed with both. As in the early days of Nike, word of mouth is still one of the leading indicators of a brand with staying power.</p>
<p>Knight’s book also teaches us about the power of thinking globally. Back in 1980, Knight was already plotting to use Nike’s foothold in Japan to expand into China. Today, many strong U.S. brands still underperform in other countries. One of the key reasons Lightspeed has opened offices in China, India, Israel, and London is to offer insights and advice for companies that seek a more global footprint.</p>
<p>Finally, <i>Shoe Dog</i> has made me grateful for all the funding options we have today for startups. Back in the early 1970s, when Knight was trying to build Nike into a global brand, IPOs weren’t necessarily a celebration. They were often the only way organizations could raise the capital they needed to reach the next level. “If we didn’t go public, we risked losing everything,” Knight writes. He didn’t want to do an IPO, but it was his only option to scale the company.</p>
<p>That’s a different universe <a href="https://marker.medium.com/the-counterintuitive-case-for-companies-to-stay-private-b929ab5cfbce">than the one we live in now</a>, with all the different investment rounds and funds available to startups today, which allow companies to take as long as they need before filing for a public offering, assuming they decide to take that path.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons why I would recommend <i>Shoe Dog</i>. It perfectly captures the entrepreneurial spirit I see in the people and companies I work with each day and inspires me to help them follow in Knight’s footsteps.</p>

<p>Information — what it is, when’s it true, and what’s it for — has been one of the most persistent themes in tech the past few years. There are now dozens of works on misinformation, algorithmic propaganda, and “fake news” trying to help us wade through the epistemology of the modern world. Yet, this isn’t the first time that humans have gone through an information revolution, nor is it likely to be the last.</p>
<p>James Gleick wrote <i>The Information</i> almost a decade ago, but the book feels more relevant than ever. In it, he provides a full historical overview of what we mean by information, how it gets organized, and how it gets transmitted from person to person. It’s an absolutely fascinating lens to view history by, and represents one of the best examples of the power of synthesis to redefine our perspective on the world.</p>
<p>What’s all here? The invention of the alphabet and the dictionary. The use of drums and flares to signal danger and communicate over distances. The telegraph and the telephone. The development of mathematics and particularly the mathematics of information theory. Quantum and classical computing. All wrapped up into an overarching narrative about the human need for more knowledge and understanding of the universe. You also get to meet a cast of luminaries along the way including some of the most brilliant minds in physics, mathematics and computer science.</p>
<p>Gleick focuses mostly on the theory and the invention of the technologies themselves, with occasional digressions into the social ramifications of these communications technologies. I would have liked more of the latter, as one pattern you notice with each wave of communications technology is that there are distinct short-, medium-, and long-term changes that each induces. Given how much acceleration around information we have had the past decade or two, it’s quite palpable to observe just how much more change is to come that’s already been set in motion.</p>
<p>In short, <i>The Information</i> is a deeply-researched and enticing historical journey, one that encourages us to contextualize the overwhelming changes happening in our world.</p>

<p>David Sinclair, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, dedicated his life to the research of aging. The central idea of <i>Lifespan</i>, his latest book, is that humans aren’t actually programmed by nature to age and die. Instead, Sinclair argues that heart disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer and other major causes of death are all manifestations of one single disease — aging. He then explains how cutting-edge science in coming decades will help substantially slow down, and eventually reverse aging, enabling people to live to 150 years old and beyond.</p>
<p>The book contains a fascinating mix of Sinclair’s research, practical advice on anti-aging, implications for healthcare and medicine, philosophy of anti-aging and mind-bending societal implications of substantially longer lifespan</p>

<p>I’ve had a copy of <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i> on my shelf for years, but I never felt motivated enough to start the (literally) thousand-page tome until its author, Susanna Clarke, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/14/susanna-clarkes-fantasy-world-of-interiors">was profiled a few months ago in The New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>Boy, do I feel dumb for waiting. The novel is an absolute pleasure from beginning to end, and as soon I’d started it, I found myself trying to steal free time to read another 10 pages (or 50, or 100 …)</p>
<p>The novel takes place in an alternate England where magic is real — or so we’re told. By 1806, when the story opens, faeries have disappeared, and the only magicians are “theoretical,” spending their time researching magical history rather than casting real spells.</p>
<p>Gilbert Norrell, a rather stodgy and reclusive scholar of the magical arts, changes all that. When challenged by The Learned Society of York Magicians, Mr. Norrell reveals his powers by bringing an entire cathedral’s work of statues to life. He then proceeds to London, where he hopes to revive the practice of English magic. Eventually, he trains an equally talented magician named Jonathan Strange — Strange is younger, more dashing, and more impulsive, and the pair’s friendship soon turns into a rivalry.</p>
<p>That’s just the barest outline of the story, which encompasses everything from the Napoleonic wars, the cost of bringing your loved ones back from the dead, and the history of a mysterious figure known as the Raven King. <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i> fully justifies its length — if anything, it packs an entire trilogy’s worth of plot into a fast-paced single volume.</p>
<p>Beyond the pleasure of finding out what happens next, I luxuriated in the opportunity to spend time with the characters and world that Clarke created. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell seem like real people, while its alternate history (often revealed in playful footnotes) feel like real history.</p>
<p>And, more than any novel I can recall, <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i> makes magic seem like something indescribably strange — not just a writerly trick or trope, but a hidden layer of reality that only a talented magician (or talented writer) can reveal.</p>

<p>We ran an experimental book club on the short story collection <i>Exhalation</i>, which explores a variety of themes about connection, humanity, and a nice bit of time warp. Chiang has a preternatural ability to devise interesting plot devices and extend them into beautiful fractals of thinking and reflection.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/discovery-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="discovery-inc">Discovery <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest media company to launch a standalone streaming service — and the latest to adopt the simple naming strategy of just adding a plus sign — with discovery+, set to launch in the United States on January 4, 2021.</p>
<p>While Discovery doesn&#8217;t have the name recognition of (say) Disney/Disney+, it&#8217;s pitching the service as &#8220;the definitive streaming service for the best real life entertainment in the world,&#8221; with 55,000 episodes at launch drawn from Discovery networks like HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, OWN, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet. It&#8217;s also struck a deal with A&amp;E Networks to feature content from A&amp;E, The History Channel and Lifetime.</p>
<p>And of course there will be original programming, including several &#8220;90 Day Fiancé&#8221; spinoffs, the U.S. premiere of the BBC series &#8220;A Perfect Planet,&#8221; a topiary competition series (with Martha Stewart as lead judge) called &#8220;Clipped,&#8221; a Kevin Hart travel show with the working title &#8220;Route 66&#8221; and much more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discovery+ also has a first look deal with Magnolia Network, a joint venture with &#8220;Fixer Upper&#8221; stars Chip and Johanna Gaines. And it will feature original content from Discovery-backed digital media company Group Nine, whose brands include The Dodo, NowThis and Thrillist.</p>
<p>While the big U.S. launch isn&#8217;t happening until January, discovery+ actually launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland through a deal with Sky last month, and the company plans to launch across 21 markets in 2021. For European viewers, the service will be the streaming home of the Olympics, starting with next year&#8217;s event in Tokyo.</p>
<p>In the U.S., discovery+ will cost $4.99 per month, or $6.99 per month to go ad-free. Discovery is also announcing a partnership with Verizon to offer up to 12 months (depending on the plan) of free discovery+ access to select wireless and home internet subscribers. (Verizon owns TechCrunch.)</p>
<p>In a statement, Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been working methodically the past two years to bring all of our strategic advantages to the launch of discovery+, including distribution and advertising partnerships around the world, a world-class offering of quality brands, authentic personalities and the largest content library at launch, as well as a broad slate of exclusive programming. With discovery+, we are seizing the global opportunity to be the world’s definitive product for unscripted storytelling, providing households and mobile consumers a distinct, clear and differentiated offering across valuable and enduring lifestyle, and real life verticals.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For much of its existence, <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> was a cloud service on its own with its own cloud resources available for its customers, but as the company and cloud computing in general has evolved, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has moved some of its workloads to other clouds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/salesforce-aws-expand-partnership-with-direct-data-integration-between-platforms/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/salesforce-announces-its-moving-marketing-cloud-to-microsoft-azure/">Azure</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/salesforce-and-google-are-the-latest-pals-in-the-cloud/">Google</a>. Now, it wants to allow customers to do the same.</p>
<p>To help facilitate that, the company announced Hyperforce today at its Dreamforce customer conference, a new architecture designed from the ground up to help customers deliver workloads to the public cloud of choice.</p>
<p>The idea behind Hyperforce is to enable customers to take all of the data in what Salesforce calls Customer 360 &#8212; that&#8217;s the company&#8217;s detailed view of the customer across channels, Salesforce products and even other systems outside the Salesforce family &#8212; and be able to store that in whichever public cloud you want in whatever region you happen to operate. For now, they are in India and Germany, but there are plans to add support for 10 additional countries over the next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company president and COO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> introduced the new approach. &#8220;We call this new capability Hyperforce. Simply put, we&#8217;ve been working to enable us to deliver Salesforce on public cloud infrastructure all around the world,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>

<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the underlying architecture running the Salesforce system is long overdue for an overhaul. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">over 20 years old</a>, it&#8217;s been around a long time now, but Mueller says that it&#8217;s about more than modernizing. &#8220;The pandemic requires SaaS vendors to move their offerings from their own data centers to [public cloud] data centers, so they can offer both architectural and commercial elasticity to their customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mueller added that by bringing Salesforce data into the public cloud, besides the obvious data sovereignty issues it solves, it brings all of the advantages of using public cloud resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce can now offer both architectural and commercial elasticity to their customers. Commercial elasticity matters a lot to CIOs and CTOs these days because when your business slows down, you pay less, and when your business accelerates, then you can afford to pay more,&#8221; he said. He says that Salesforce is bringing an early generation SaaS product and pulling it into the modern age, something that is imperative at this point in the company&#8217;s evolution.</p>
<p>But while moving forward, Taylor was careful to point out that they rebuilt the system in such a way as to be fully backward compatible, so you don&#8217;t have to throw out all of the applications and investment you&#8217;ve made over the years, something that most companies couldn&#8217;t afford to do.&#8221;For you developers out there, This is the most remarkable thing. It is 100% backward compatible, your apps will work with no changes and you can benefit from all of this automatically,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company will be rolling out Hyperforce over the next year and beyond as it opens in more regions.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When a friend forwarded <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1320309428323835905">this tweet from Paul Graham</a>, it hit close to home:</p>
<blockquote><p>Startups are subject to something like infant mortality: before they’re established, one thing going wrong can kill the company. Hardware companies seem to be subject to infant mortality their whole lives.<br />
I think the reason is that the evolution of the product is so discontinuous. The company has to keep shipping, and customers to keep buying, new products. Which in practice is like relaunching the company each time.<br />
I don’t know if there is an answer to this, but if there were a way for hardware companies to evolve more the way software companies do, they’d be a lot more resilient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking back on our startup journey at Minut, I remember several moments when we could have died. However, surviving several near misses we learned to tackle these challenges and have become more resilient over time. While there will never be one fully exhaustive answer, here are some of the lessons we learned over the years:</p>
<h2>Subscription revenue is the only revenue that counts</h2>
<p>While you can sell hardware with a margin and make important early revenue, it’s not a sustainable business model for a company that requires both software and hardware. You can’t cover an indefinite commitment with a finite amount of money.</p>
<p>Many hardware companies don’t consider subscriptions early enough. While it can be hard to command a subscription from the start (if you can, you might have waited too long to launch), it needs to be in the plan from the beginning. Look for markets where paying subscriptions is the norm rather than markets that operate on a one-time sale model.</p>
<h2>Set high margins and earn them over time</h2>
<p>It’s tempting to set low prices for hardware to attract customers, but in the beginning you should do the opposite. Margins allow for mistakes to be rectified. A missed deadline might mean you have to opt for freight by air rather than boat. You might have to scrap components or buy them expensively in a supply crunch. Surprises are seldom positive, and you don’t want to use your venture capital to pay for them.</p>
<p>Healthy margins can also be used to cover marketing costs while you learn what kind of messaging works and what channels you can sell through. If that wasn’t enough reason, starting with relatively high prices will help you avoid another common mistake, selling too much at launch.</p>
<p>This might seem counterintuitive — why wouldn’t you want great success out of the gate? The reason is that you will inevitably make mistakes with your early launches, and the bigger the launch, the bigger the blow. There are plenty of companies who achieved amazing crowdfunding success and then failed to deliver even the first units. Startups tend to chase growth at all costs, but for hardware startups in the first few years there is such a thing as too much of a good thing.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid the pandemic, workplace cultures have been turned on their heads. Meanwhile investment and growth haven&#8217;t slowed for many tech companies, requiring them to still onboard new engineering managers even while best practices for remote management are far from codified.</p>
<p>Because of remote work habit shifts, plenty of new tools have popped up to help engineers be more productive, or quickly help managers interface with direct-reports more often. <a href="https://www.okayhq.com/">Okay</a> is taking a more observatory route, aiming to give managers dashboards that quantify the performance of their teams so that they can get a picture of where they have room to improve.</p>
<p>The startup, which launched out of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earlier this year, tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $2.2 million in funding led by Sequoia and are launching the open beta of their service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founders Antoine Boulanger and Tomas Barreto met while working at Box &#8212; Boulanger as a senior director of engineering and Barreto as a VP of engineering. They told TechCrunch that in the process of building out a suite of in-house tools designed to help managers at Box understand their teams better, they realized the opportunity for a subscription toolset that could help managers across companies. For the most part, Boulanger says that today <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/okay-274b" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="okay-274b">Okay <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is largely replacing tools built in-house as well.</p>
<p>Getting a picture of an engineering team&#8217;s productivity means plugging into these toolsets and gathering data into a digestible feed. Okay can be integrated with a number of toolsets, including software like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pagerduty" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pagerduty">PagerDuty, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CircleCI and Google Calendar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the problem for managers is that there are so many tools, so how do you get signal from the noise?&#8221; Barreto tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A large part of Okay&#8217;s sell seems to be ensuring that managers can keep an active eye on the common pitfalls of rapid scaling and keep them in check so they can keep direct-reports satisfied. On the individual basis, managers can quickly see stats related to how much of an individual manager&#8217;s time is being spent in meetings compared to uninterrupted &#8220;maker time&#8221; where they actually have the ability to get work done.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t like to be micromanaged and the idea that everything you do is feeding into a pie chart that judges whether you&#8217;re a good employee isn&#8217;t the most savory sell for engineers. Okay&#8217;s founders hope they can strike a balance and give managers data that they&#8217;re not tempted to over-rely on, instead defaulting to team-level insights when they can so that managers are dialed into general trends like how long projects are taking on average or how long it takes for pull requests to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Investors have been bankrolling remote work tools at a heightened pace for the last several months and things have been especially fortunate for young companies that were ahead of the trend. Barreto, for his part, has served as a scout at Sequoia since 2018 according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>The team says their product, as it stands today, is best fit for companies with 50-200 engineers that are high growth and perhaps going through some of those growing pains. The company&#8217;s early customers include teams at Brex, Plaid and Split.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the attention that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/">pays to Y Combinator&#8217;s Demo Days</a>, we also try to keep tabs on the same startups as they scale and raise more capital. Yesterday we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">covered YC Winter 2020 participant BuildBuddy</a>, for example. Today we&#8217;re taking a look at <a href="https://somosheru.com/#/home">Heru</a>, a startup based in Mexico City that is announcing a $1.7 million raise after taking part in YC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/12841">Summer 2019</a> session.</p>
<p>The pre-seed round was led by <a href="https://www.mountainnazca.com/">Mountain Nazca</a>, and participated in by <a href="https://www.magmapartners.com/">Magma Partners</a>, <a href="https://x-vp.com/">Xtraordinary Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://flourishventures.com/">Flourish Ventures</a>, YC itself and a handful of angels. The investment was raised in two pieces: a $500,000 check in February and the other $1.2 million closing a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/heru" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="heru">Heru <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to provide software-based services for gig workers in Mexico, and eventually other countries. Its founders, Mateo Jaramillo and Stiven Rodríguez Sánchez, are both ex-Uber employees, which is how they wound up in Mexico from their native Colombia.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Heru didn&#8217;t have a straightforward path to existence. The founding duo told TechCrunch their original idea, something similar to OYO, was what they went through <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and initially raised money for. But after finding OYO already in their target market, the company took three months to rethink and, keeping investors on board, pivoted to Heru.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3dgXMkcoVQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/">Our 11 favorite companies from Y Combinator’s S20 Demo Day: Part 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Our 11 favorite companies from Y Combinator’s S20 Demo Day: Part 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/our-11-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-s20-demo-day-part-i/embed/#?secret=3dgXMkcoVQ" data-secret="3dgXMkcoVQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Heru is a package of software products aimed at delivery drivers and the like, helping provide insurance, credit and tax preparation support. The tax element is key, as the company&#8217;s founders explained to TechCrunch that Mexico now expects independent workers to file taxes on a monthly basis. Folks need help with that, so Heru built them a tool to do so.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s competition to that element of its product, Heru said, noting that there are accountants in the market that will do the work for $25 to $30. Heru&#8217;s tax service, in contrast, costs a smaller $5 each month (100 pesos). Insurance is another $5 each month for accident-related coverage. The startup worked with an insurance provider to build what it describes as a &#8220;tailor-made&#8221; policy for gig workers who need low-cost coverage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081993" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081993" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2081993 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="257" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?resize=768,657 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Heru-Cofounders-Mateto-and-Stiven-2.jpeg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081993" class="wp-caption-text">The founding duo, via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>Heru is not only targeting Uber drivers and their like, however. The company noted that it also wants to support freelancers more broadly, a population that is much larger than the three million gig workers it counts in the Mexican market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s app has been soft-launched in the market for a few weeks, with the startup now making more noise about its existence. According to its founders, around 1,200 users were accepted during its test period. Another 20,000 are in line.</p>
<p>Among its early user base, customers are buying on average 1.2 Heru products, a number that I&#8217;ll track as the startup scales.</p>
<p>Heru&#8217;s app is neat, its market large and the need it is serving material. But in the background of the software story is a brick-and-mortar tale. The startup, in addition to building its app, put together a number of so-called &#8220;Heru Casas,&#8221; places where gig workers can recharge their phones and use a bathroom. You need the app to enter a Heru Casa, helping the startup find early users.</p>
<p>Currently all Heru Casas are located in Mexico City. The startup is not sure about expanding that part of its efforts to more cities where its app may attract users. Why? It&#8217;s hard to scale physical build-outs, it told TechCrunch. Software is much better for quick expansion, and as that&#8217;s the name of the startup game, holding off on more physical locations could make good sense until the company can raise more capital.</p>
<p>Heru has big plans to double-down its product work, and eventually add more countries to its roster. The Latin American market is a ripe place for startups to shake things up. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Heru can make its mark.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/">Fylamynt</a>, a new service that helps businesses automate their cloud workflows, today announced both the official launch of its platform as well as a $6.5 million seed round. The funding round was led by Google&#8217;s AI-focused Gradient Ventures fund. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mangocapital/">Mango Capital</a> and <a href="https://p72.vc/">Point72 Ventures</a> also participated.</p>
<p>At first glance, the idea behind Fylamynt may sound familiar. Workflow automation has become a pretty competitive space, after all, and the service helps developers connect their various cloud tools to create repeatable workflows. We&#8217;re not talking about your standard IFTTT- or <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zapier" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zapier">Zapier <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-like integrations between SaaS products, though. The focus of Fylamynt is squarely on building infrastructure workflows. While that may sound familiar, too, with tools like Ansible and Terraform automating a lot of that already, Fylamynt sits on top of those and integrates with them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081864" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fylamynt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081864" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081864" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fylamynt.gif" alt="" width="800" height="420" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fylamynt</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Some time ago, we used to do Bash and scripting &#8212; and then [ … ] came Chef and Puppet in 2006, 2007. SaltStack, as well. Then Terraform and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ansible-b2fe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ansible-b2fe">Ansible,&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Fylamynt co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppadala/">Pradeep Padala</a> told me. &#8220;They have all done an extremely good job of making it easier to simplify infrastructure operations so you don&#8217;t have to write low-level code. You can write a slightly higher-level language. We are not replacing that. What we are doing is connecting that code.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if you have a Terraform template, an Ansible playbook and maybe a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/python" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="python">Python <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> script, you can now use Fylamynt to connect those. In the end, Fylamynt becomes the orchestration engine to run all of your infrastructure code &#8212; and then allows you to connect all of that to the likes of DataDog, Splunk, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pagerduty" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pagerduty">PagerDuty <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Slack and ServiceNow.</p>

<p>The service currently connects to Terraform, Ansible, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/datadog" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="datadog">Datadog, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Jira, Slack, Instance, CloudWatch, CloudFormation and your Kubernetes clusters. The company notes that some of the standard <a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/use-cases">use cases</a> for its service are automated remediation, governance and compliance, as well as cost and performance management.</p>
<p>The company is already working with a number of design partners, including Snowflake.</p>
<p>Fylamynt CEO Padala has quite a bit of experience in the infrastructure space. He co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/containerxs-container-management-platform-caters-to-both-linux-and-windows-shops/">ContainerX</a>, an early container-management platform, which later sold to Cisco. Before starting ContainerX, he was at VMWare and DOCOMO Labs. His co-founders, VP of Engineering Xiaoyun Zhu and CTO David Lee, also have deep expertise in building out cloud infrastructure and operating it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at any company &#8212; any company building a product &#8212; let&#8217;s say a SaaS product, and they want to run their operations, infrastructure operations very efficiently,&#8221; Padala said. &#8220;But there are always challenges. You need a lot of people, it takes time. So what is the bottleneck? If you ask that question and dig deeper, you&#8217;ll find that there is one bottleneck for automation: that&#8217;s code. Someone has to write code to automate. Everything revolves around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fylamynt aims to take the effort out of that by allowing developers to either write Python and JSON to automate their workflows (think &#8220;infrastructure as code&#8221; but for workflows) or to use Fylamynt&#8217;s visual no-code drag-and-drop tool. As Padala noted, this gives developers a lot of flexibility in how they want to use the service. If you never want to see the Fylamynt UI, you can go about your merry coding ways, but chances are the UI will allow you to get everything done as well.</p>
<p>One area the team is currently focusing on &#8212; and will use the new funding for &#8212; is building out its <a href="https://www.fylamynt.com/product/analyze">analytics capabilities</a> that can help developers debug their workflows. The service already provides log and audit trails, but the plan is to expand its AI capabilities to also recommend the right workflows based on the alerts you are getting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eventual goal is to help people automate any service and connect any code. That&#8217;s the holy grail. And AI is an enabler in that,&#8221; Padala said.</p>

<p>The team, which now includes about 20 employees, plans to use the new round of funding, which closed in September, to focus on its R&amp;D, build out its product and expand its go-to-market team. On the product side, that specifically means building more connectors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E features a giant touchscreen, and at the bottom is a sizable knob for volume control. I love it. There, stuck on a touchscreen, is a physical knob. Twist it! Spin it! There&#8217;s even a resounding click as it twists. The knob works so much better than a touchscreen slider bar, and I implore other automakers to follow Ford&#8217;s lead. This knob is a surprisingly simple solution.</p>
<p>Under the knob are tiny strips that interact with the touchscreen as if it was touched by a finger. When the knob is twisted, these strips drag across the screen, tricking the system into thinking a human is controlling it. As far as I can tell, the knob itself is nothing more than a few pieces of plastic glued onto the screen.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s system in the Mustang Mach-E is a happy compromise between massive touchscreens and good user interfaces. The user gets the benefits of a spinning knob, while Ford doesn&#8217;t have to build and install additional physical components to maintain standards. From my experience with the volume control, there&#8217;s no discernible lag, and it works very well. Spin it to change the volume or press the center to mute the audio. As with any great design, it works exactly like one would expect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Audio volume should always be controlled by a rotating knob, dial, or wheel. There&#8217;s no debate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2081917" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ford-mustang-mach-e.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>Automakers have long played with alternative volume control schemes, and I&#8217;ve yet to find one that works better than a simple knob.</p>
<p>BMW offers in-car gesture controls: Hover your hand over the center stack, stick one finger out and draw a circle in the air. It works okay. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/bmws-magical-gesture-control-finally-makes-sense-as-touchscreens-take-over-cars/">I like the gesture control for somethings</a>, but it feels silly, spinning a finger to change the volume.</p>
<p>Other car makers like Cadillac looked to touch-sensitive slider bars for controlling volume. Most have since abandoned this design for several reasons. The control strips are often built flush with the rest of the dashboard and do not provide the user with any feedback. The systems are often slow to respond, too, making the experience frustrating and underwhelming.</p>
<p>Thankfully, most modern cars have steering wheel controls in addition to the main volume knob. Some are spinning wheels, others are buttons, and I&#8217;m clearly on team spinning wheel.</p>
<p>As touchscreens started infiltrated cars, more automakers looked to offload volume controls to the screen with onscreen slider bars. It&#8217;s often less expensive to use a touchscreen than a physical button, but the experience is never superior. At this point, most automakers put interactive content on a screen and install a twisting knob for volume and mute elsewhere on the dashboard.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it like to drive the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E? I can&#8217;t tell you for a few days.</p>
<p>Also note, this post consumed my monthly allotment of the word knob. There are 14 instances in this post and I&#8217;m very sorry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/european-union" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="european-union">European Union <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said today that it wants to work with US counterparts on a common approach to tech governance &#8212; including pushing to standardize rules for applications of technologies like AI and pushing big tech to be more responsible for what their platforms amplify.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are anticipating rebooted transatlantic relations under the incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The Commission has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">published a new </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/joint-communication-new-eu-us-agenda-global-change_en">EU-US agenda</a> with the aim of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">encouraging what it bills as &#8220;global cooperation &#8212; based on our common values, interests and global influence&#8221; in a number of areas, from tackling the coronavirus pandemic to addressing climate change and furthering a Western geopolitical agenda. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trade and tech policy is another major priority for the hoped for reboot of transatlantic relations, starting with<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an EU-US Summit in the first half of 2021.</span></p>
<p>Relations have of course been strained during the Trump era as the sitting US president has threatened the bloc with trade tariffs, berated European nations for not spending enough on defence to fulfil their Nato commitments and heavily implied he&#8217;d be a lot happier if the EU didn&#8217;t exist at all (including loudly supporting brexit).</p>
<p>The Commission agenda conveys a clear message that the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers are hopeful of a lot more joint working &#8212; toward common goals and interests &#8212; once the Biden administration takes office early next year.</p>
<h2>Global AI standards?</h2>
<p>On the tech front the Commission&#8217;s push is for alignment on governance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU and the US need to join forces as tech-allies to shape technologies, their use and their regulatory environment,&#8221; the Commission writes in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/joint-communication-eu-us-agenda_en.pdf">agenda</a>. &#8220;Using our combined influence, a transatlantic technology space should form the backbone of a wider coalition of like-minded democracies with a shared vision on tech governance and a shared commitment to defend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the proposals it&#8217;s floating is a &#8220;Transatlantic AI Agreement&#8221; &#8212; which it envisages as setting &#8220;a blueprint for regional and global standards aligned with our values&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the EU is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">working</a> on a pan-EU framework to set rules for the use of &#8220;high risk&#8221; AIs, some US cities and states have already moved to ban the use of specific applications of artificial intelligence &#8212; such as facial recognition. So there&#8217;s potential to align on some high level principles or standards.</p>
<p>(Or, as the EU puts it: &#8220;We need to start acting together on AI &#8212; based on our shared belief in a human-centric approach and dealing with issues such as facial recognition.&#8221;)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="puiEFgjGnY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">Portland passes expansive city ban on facial recognition tech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Portland passes expansive city ban on facial recognition tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/embed/#?secret=puiEFgjGnY" data-secret="puiEFgjGnY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our shared values of human dignity, individual rights and democratic principles make us natural partners to harness rapid technological change and face the challenges of rival systems of digital governance. This gives us an unprecedented window of opportunity to set a joint EU-US tech agenda,&#8221; the Commission also writes, suggesting there&#8217;s a growing convergence of views on tech governance.</p>
<h2>Talks on tackling big tech</h2>
<p>Here it also sees opportunity for the EU and the US to align on tackling big tech &#8212; saying it wants to open discussions on setting rules to tackle the societal and market impacts of platform giants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing consensus on both sides of the Atlantic that online platforms and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/big-tech" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="big-tech">Big Tech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> raise issues which threaten our societies and democracies, notably through harmful market behaviours, illegal content or algorithm-fuelled propagation of hate speech and disinformation,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The need for global cooperation on technology goes beyond the hardware or software. It is also about our values, our societies and our democracies,&#8221; the Commission adds. &#8220;In this spirit, the EU will propose a new transatlantic dialogue on the responsibility of online platforms, which would set the blueprint for other democracies facing the same challenges. We should also work closer together to further strengthen cooperation between competent authorities for antitrust enforcement in digital markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission is on the cusp of unveiling its own blueprint for regulating big tech &#8212; with a Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act due to be presented later this month.</p>
<p>Commissioners have said the legislative packages will set clear conditions on digital players, such as for the handling and reporting of illegal content, as well as setting binding transparency and fairness requirements.</p>
<p>They will also introduce a new regime of ex ante rules for so-called gatekeeper platforms that wield significant market power (aka big tech) &#8212; with such players set to be subject to a list of dos and don&#8217;ts, which could include bans on certain types of self-preferencing and limits on their use of third party data, with the aim of ensuring a level playing field in the future.</p>
<p>The bloc has also been considering beefing up antitrust powers for intervening in digital markets.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe to limit how big tech can push its own services and use third-party data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/embed/#?secret=esaiYsvUTy" data-secret="esaiYsvUTy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Given how advanced EU lawmakers are on proposals to regulate big tech vs US counterparts there&#8217;s arguably only a small window of opportunity for the latter to influence the shape of EU rules on (mostly US) big tech.</p>
<p>But the Commission evidently takes the view that rebooted relations, post-Trump, present an opportunity for it to influence US policy &#8212; by encouraging European-style platform rules to cross the pond.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fond of claiming the EU&#8217;s data protection framework (GDPR) has set a global example that&#8217;s influenced lawmakers around the world. So its intent now looks to be to double down &#8212; and push to export a European approach to regulating big tech back where most of these giants are based (even as the bloc&#8217;s other institutions are still debating and amending the EU proposals).</p>
<h2>Next-gen mobile security</h2>
<p>Another common challenge the document points to is next-gen mobile connectivity. This has been a particular soapbox of Trump&#8217;s in recent years, with the ALL-CAPS loving president frequently taking to Twitter to threaten and bully allies into taking a tough line on allowing Chinese vendors as suppliers for next-gen mobile infrastructure, arguing they pose too great a national security risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are facing common challenges in managing the digital transition of our economies and societies. These include critical infrastructure, such as 5G, 6G or cybersecurity assets, which are essential for our security, sovereignty and prosperity &#8212; but also data, technologies and the role of online platforms,&#8221; the Commission writes, easing into the issue.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers go on to say they will put forward proposals &#8220;for secure 5G infrastructure across the globe and open a dialogue on 6G&#8221; &#8212; as part of what they hope will be &#8220;wider cooperation on digital supply chain security done through objective risk-based assessments&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead of a blanket ban on Huawei as a 5G supplier the Commission opted to endorse a package of &#8220;mitigating measures&#8221; &#8212; via a 5G toolbox &#8212; at the start of this year, which includes requirements for carriers to beef up network security and risk profile assessments of suppliers.</p>
<p>So it looks to be hoping the US can be convinced in the value of a joint approach to standardizing these sorts of security assessments &#8212; aka, &#8216;no more nasty surprises&#8217; &#8212; as a strategy to reduce the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/trumps-huawei-ban-also-causing-tech-shocks-in-europe/">shocks and uncertainty that have hit digital supply chains</a> during Trump&#8217;s presidency.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No pan-EU Huawei ban as Commission endorses 5G risk mitigation plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/no-pan-eu-huawei-ban-as-commission-endorses-5g-risk-mitigation-plan/embed/#?secret=M97cI6pMrY" data-secret="M97cI6pMrY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Increased cooperation around cybersecurity is another area where the EU says it will be pressing US counterparts &#8212; floating the idea of joint EU-US restrictions against attributed attackers from third countries in the future. (A proposal which, should it be taken up, could see coordinated sanctions against Russia, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/russian-cyberops-are-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-rd-intelligence-agencies-warn/">previously been</a> identified by US and European intelligence agencies running malware attacks targeted at COVID-19 vaccine R&amp;D, for example.)</p>
<h2>Easing EU-US data flows</h2>
<p>A trickier area for the tech side of the Commission&#8217;s plan to reboot transatlantic relations is EU-US data flows.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Europe&#8217;s top court torpedoed the Commission&#8217;s US adequacy finding this summer &#8212; stripping the country of a privileged status of &#8216;essential equivalence&#8217; in data protection standards.</p>
<p>Without that there&#8217;s huge legal uncertainty and risk for US businesses that want to take EU citizens&#8217; data out of the region for processing. And recent guidance from EU regulators on how to lawfully secure data transfers makes it clear that in some instances there simply won&#8217;t be any extra measures or contractual caveats which will fix the risk entirely.</p>
<p>The solution may in fact be data localization in the EU. (Something the Commission&#8217;s Data Governance Act proposal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">unveiled last week</a>, appeared to confirm by allowing for Member States to set conditions for reuse of the most sensitive types of data &#8212; such as prohibiting transfers to third countries.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kwGSqsdU0Q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that&#8217;s cold comfort for Facebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/embed/#?secret=kwGSqsdU0Q" data-secret="kwGSqsdU0Q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We must also openly discuss diverging views on data governance and see how these can be overcome constructively,&#8221; the Commission writes on this thorny issue, adding: &#8220;The EU and the US should intensify their cooperation at bilateral and multilateral level to promote regulatory convergence and facilitate free data flow with trust on the basis of high standards and safeguards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commissioners have warned before that there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">no quick fix</a> for the EU-US data transfer issue &#8212; but a longer term solution would be a convergence of standards in the areas of privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>And, again, that&#8217;s an area where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">US states have been taking action</a>. But the Commission&#8217;s agenda pushing for &#8220;regulatory convergence&#8221; to ease data flows sums to trying to convince US counterparts of the economic case for reforming Section 702 of FISA&#8230;</p>

<h2>Digital tax and tech-trade cooperation</h2>
<p>Digital tax reform is also inexorably on the EU agenda since no agreement has been possibly under Trump on this stickiest of tech policy issues.</p>
<p>It writes that both the EU and the US should &#8220;strongly commit to the timely conclusion of discussions on a global solution within the context of OECD and G20&#8221; &#8212; saying this is vital to create &#8220;a fair and modern economy, which provides market-based rewards for the best innovative ideas&#8221;.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Fair taxation in the digital economy requires innovative solutions on both sides of </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the Atlantic,&#8221; it adds. </span></p>
<p>Another proposal the EU is floating is to establish a EU-US Trade and Technology Council &#8212; to &#8220;jointly maximise opportunities for market-driven transatlantic collaboration, strengthen our technological and industrial leadership and expand bilateral trade and investment&#8221;.</p>
<p>It envisages the body focusing on reducing trade barriers; developing compatible standards and regulatory approaches for new technologies; ensuring critical supply chain security; deepening research collaboration and promoting innovation and fair competition &#8212; saying there should also be &#8220;a new common focus on protecting critical technologies&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need closer cooperation on issues such as investment screening, Intellectual Property rights, forced transfers of technology, and export controls,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The Commission announced its own <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2188">Intellectual Property Action Plan</a> last week, alongside the Data Governance Act proposal &#8212; which included support for SMEs to file patents. It also said it will consider whether reform the framework for filing standards essential patents, encouraging industry to engage in forums aimed at reducing litigation in the meanwhile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today is launching three new features designed to improve its &#8220;Premieres&#8221; experience, including trailers, themes, and live stream &#8220;pre-shows&#8221; that later redirect to the main event. Premieres, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">first arrived in 2018</a>, are designed to give creators the ability to leverage the revenue generation possibilities that come with live videos without having to actually &#8220;go live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Premieres allow creators to promote a scheduled video release by pointing fans to a landing page with a live chat in the sidebar, just like other live videos. This lets creators take advantage of money-making features like <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7288782?hl=en">SuperChat</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9080341">Stickers</a>, ads, and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7636690?hl=en">Channel Memberships</a>.</p>
<p>However, some creators want to engage with fans live ahead of their video premiere. The new &#8220;Live Redirect&#8221; feature will now make it a more seamless experience when they do so, as it allows creators to host a live stream that redirects to the upcoming Premiere just before it starts. This gives creators time to build up their audience ahead of the video&#8217;s release, as they can now not only join the chat to engage fans, but also live stream to their fans directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>YouTube says it tested this feature over the past several months with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/weareone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/weareone&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWcrX18zIK09DkA7O8ofLp1S-MjQ">We Are One Film Festival</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgpAu7kCgadwecKv_oFCyw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgpAu7kCgadwecKv_oFCyw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsxSB-Ay5WqggTrJiRaD_j7l5VNA">New York Comic-Con</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AX3xpWyUAY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6AX3xpWyUAY&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF0J7UEmb9-aCvzL6TDBc5SURKhow">BTS</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ-13kw-D1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DBJ-13kw-D1s&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7cLPfxNJ1w7gSkaPsMvDrDsEE7g">Cardi B</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMTzZ1ZuWs4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DdMTzZ1ZuWs4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFQxy2nRCQ517iJgL4Sp2j8tF-SYg">Justin Bieber</a>, in advance of today&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>Another new feature will allow creators to upload a pre-recorded video that will be featured on the Premiere landing page before the main event. This trailer can range from 15 seconds to 3 minutes in length, and works to create hype for the premiere ahead of its release. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/creators-6232" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="creators-6232">Creators <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> can also encourage their fans to set a reminder so they won&#8217;t miss the video&#8217;s launch.</p>

<p>The video countdown experience that plays just before their Premieres go live can also now be customized A new set of Countdown Themes will include those designed for different vibes or moods, like calm, playful, dramatic or sporty, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081835" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081835" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="360" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Since their launch, Premieres have been used by over 8 million YouTube channels, including big names like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRXZj0DzXIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DvRXZj0DzXIA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_1-KTpCYlfISBY1OupuvUGU7ERw">BLACKPINK</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFYAXsa7pe8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DgFYAXsa7pe8&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrKOVSLFErCQdomZynB6uq6KuJiQ">Tiny Desk</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM-24BPy0xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiM-24BPy0xA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRGplIKMl6YjUgTdS6rZLjY-y5Qg">James Charles</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb1jJzpAJ9I&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Drb1jJzpAJ9I%26t%3D2s&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFrpnmAFC9PlFkuuj5QVB7EK7wSOQ">Supercell</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ5eUJNXrMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DnQ5eUJNXrMw&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606854653029000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFu6TlSDxKMMU2xc4yzZWBuRkqkAQ">Cirque du Soleil</a>, among others. Their adoption significantly grew during the pandemic, the company also notes. Since March 1, 2020, YouTube has seen over 85% growth in daily Premieres, with over 80% of the channels having never before used a Premiere until this year.</p>
<p>The first two features will arrive to creators with at least 1,000 subscribers starting today, but Countdown Themes won&#8217;t be available for a couple of months, YouTube says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus">Walmart+</a>, the retailer&#8217;s lower cost alternative to Amazon Prime offering same-day delivery of groceries and other items, is making its service more appealing with today&#8217;s launch of a new perk. The company says that starting on Friday, December 4, it will remove the $35 shipping minimum on orders from Walmart.com for its members. However, this doesn&#8217;t apply to the same-day orders of groceries or other items fulfilled by Walmart stores, but rather online shopping where orders are placed through Walmart&#8217;s traditional e-commerce channels.</p>
<p>That means there&#8217;s no longer a minimum order requirement on the next-day and two-day shipping that&#8217;s offered on items shipped from Walmart.com, no matter the basket total. The change, arriving only a couple of months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/walmart-plus-launches-sept-15-offering-same-day-delivery-for-98-per-year-plus-gas-discounts-and-cashierless-checkout/">Walmart+&#8217;s launch</a>, positions the new program as more of a true alternative to Amazon Prime, as Prime&#8217;s biggest perk has always been its free fast shipping service that encourages consumers to shop online without worrying about minimum order sizes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Walmart+&#8217;s biggest perk until now had been its same-day delivery service, with a particular focus on groceries &#8212; similar to Instacart or Amazon Fresh. The service didn&#8217;t charge fees on same-day grocery if the orders were at least $35, and this aspect continues today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Walmart+ program itself grew out of Walmart&#8217;s Delivery Unlimited, an earlier version of the service that had also involved having Walmart store staff pick orders which are handed off to delivery partners. In the past, those partners have </span>included<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Postmates (now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">acquired</a> by Uber), DoorDash, Roadie, and Point Pickup, among others. More recently, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/walmart-is-buying-joyrun-assets-to-add-peer-to-peer-product-delivery/">Walmart acquired last-mile delivery operation JoyRun</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, to bring more of its delivery logistics business in-house. </span></p>
<p>Unlike some grocery delivery services, Walmart&#8217;s advantage in same-day is that it could also fulfill orders of other everyday items from its store shelves, not just food and household goods. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/walmart-plus-launches-sept-15-offering-same-day-delivery-for-98-per-year-plus-gas-discounts-and-cashierless-checkout/">Walmart+ launched in mid-September,</a> it promised same-day delivery of over 160,000 items.</p>

<p>The program also includes a small handful of other perks like fuel discounts at nearly 2,000 Walmart, Murphy USA and Murphy Express stations and access to Scan &amp; Go to skip the checkout lines when shopping in-store.</p>
<p>Today, Walmart said it&#8217;s also expanding the fuel savings to over 500 Sam&#8217;s Club gas stations, too.</p>
<p>While Amazon Prime has expanded over the years to include all sorts of benefits, like free music and streaming video, e-books, audiobooks, gaming perks, and more, Walmart+ so far remains focused on its core features &#8212; like shipping benefits and cost savings. And coming in at $98 per year (or $12.95/mo), it&#8217;s cheaper than Prime&#8217;s $119 per year membership, which could appeal to consumers only interested in free delivery.</p>
<p>Walmart, like many large retailers, has benefitted by the acceleration of e-commerce driven by the pandemic. The company, <a href="https://stock.walmart.com/investors/financial-information/quarterly-results/default.aspx">in its third quarter earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/walmart-wmt-q3-2021-earnings-.html">reported</a> U.S. e-commerce sales were up by 79% in the quarter, with earnings of $1.34 a share on revenue that was up 5.2% year-over-year to $134.7 billion.</p>
<p>So far, Walmart has declined to share how many customers have signed up for Walmart+ much to investors&#8217; <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/walmart-earnings-were-impressive-why-its-stock-is-slipping-51605622246">dismay</a>. (One <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/walmart-earnings-preview-as-many-as-19-million-households-may-already-be-walmart-members-11605296888">third-party estimate</a> puts it at 19M members, however). The retailer notes the program is available at over 4,700 stores, including 2,800 stores that offer delivery &#8212; the latter which reaches 70% of the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a pandemic raging across many parts of the world, many companies have customer service agents spread out as well, creating a workforce management nightmare. It wasn&#8217;t easy to manage and route requests when CSAs were in one place, it&#8217;s even harder with many working from home.</p>
<p>To help answer that problem <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> is developing a new product called Service Cloud Workforce Engagement. Bill Patterson, EVP and general manager for CRM Applications at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> points out that with these workforces spread out, it&#8217;s a huge challenge for management to distribute work and keep up with customer volume, especially as customers have moved online during COVID.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Service Cloud Workforce Engagement, Salesforce will arm the contact center with a connected solution — all on one platform so our customers can remain resilient and agile no matter what tomorrow may bring,&#8221; Patterson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9zClwUNz9Z"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-applies-ai-to-workflow-with-einstein-automate/">Salesforce applies AI to workflow with Einstein Automate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce applies AI to workflow with Einstein Automate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-applies-ai-to-workflow-with-einstein-automate/embed/#?secret=9zClwUNz9Z" data-secret="9zClwUNz9Z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like many Salesforce products, this one is made up of several key components to deliver a complete solution. For starters, there is Service Forecast for Customer 360, a tool that helps predict workforce requirements and uses AI to distribute customer service requests in a way that makes sense. This can help in planning at a time with a likely predictable uptick in service requests like Black Friday or Cyber Monday, or even those times when there is an unexpected spike.</p>
<p>Next up is Omnichannel Capacity Planning, which helps managers distribute CSAs across channels such as phone, messaging or email wherever they are needed most based on the demand across a given channel.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a teaching component that helps coach customer service agents to give the correct answer in the correct way for a given situation. &#8220;To increase agent engagement and performance, companies will be able to quickly onboard and continually train agents by delivering bite-size, guided learning paths directly in the agent’s workspace during their shift,&#8221; the company explained.</p>
<p>The company says that Service Cloud Workforce Engagement will be available in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://orbit.love/">Orbit</a>, a startup that is building tools to help organizations build communities around their proprietary and open-source products, today announced that it has raised a $4 million seed funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s Martin Casado. A number of angel investors, including <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Aniszczyk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Warner and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnus Hillestad</span>, as well as the <span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z’s Cultural Leadership Fund,</span> also participated, <span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition to previous backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavybit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison Metal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The company describes its service as a &#8220;community experience platform.&#8221; Currently, Orbit&#8217;s focus is on Developer Relations and Community teams, as well as open-source maintainers. There&#8217;s no reason the company couldn&#8217;t branch out into other verticals as well, though, given that its overall framework is really applicable across all communities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081839" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081839" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2081839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orbit_TeamPicture.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081839" class="wp-caption-text">Orbit team: Patrick Woods, Nicolas Goutay and Josh Dzielak</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Orbit co-founder Patrick Woods told me, community managers have generally had a hard time figuring out who was really contributing to their communities because those contributions can come in lots of forms and often happen across a wide variety of platforms. In addition, the sales and marketing teams also often don&#8217;t understand how a community impacts a company&#8217;s bottom line. Orbit aggregates all of these contributions across platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lack of understanding around the ways in which community impacts go-to-market and business value,&#8221; Woods told me when I asked him about the genesis of the idea. &#8220;There&#8217;s a big gap in terms of the tooling associated with that. Many companies agree that community is important, but if you put $1 in the community machine today, it&#8217;s hard to know where that&#8217;s going to come out &#8212; and is it going to come out in terms of $0.50 or $100? This was a set of challenges that we noticed across companies of all sizes.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081792" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081792" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081792" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png 1217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit_dashboard.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081792" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orbit</p></div></p>
<p>Especially in open-source communities, there will always be community members who create a lot of value but who don&#8217;t have a commercial relationship with a company at all. That makes it even harder for companies to quantify the impact of their communities, even if they agree that community is an important way to grow their business and that, in Orbit&#8217;s words, &#8220;community is the new pre-sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the core of Orbit (the company) is <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">Orbit the open-source community framework</a>. The founding team of Woods (CEO) and Josh Dzielak (CTO) developed this framework to help organizations understand how to best build what the team calls a &#8220;high gravity community&#8221; to attract new members and retain existing ones &#8212; and how to evaluate them. You can read more about the concept <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">here</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081817" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081817" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2081817" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orbit-model-canvas.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081817" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orbit</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to reframe the discussion away from an extractive worldview that says how much value can we generate from this lead? It&#8217;s actually more about how much love can we generate from these community members,&#8221; Woods said. &#8220;Because, if you think about the culture associated with what we&#8217;re trying to do, it&#8217;s fundamentally creative and generative. And our goal is really to help people think less about value extraction and more about value creation.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, no matter the philosophy behind your community-building efforts, there has to be a way to measure ROI and turn some of those community members into paying customers. To do that, Orbit currently pulls in data from sources like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Twitter and Discourse, with support for Slack and other tools coming soon. With that, the service makes it far easier for community managers to keep tabs on what is happening inside their community and who is participating.</p>

<p>In addition to the built-in dashboards, Orbit also provides an API to help integrate all of this data into third-party services as well.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the key understandings that drives the Orbit vision is that a community is not a funnel and building a community is not about conversions, but making connections; cultivating dialog and engagement; being open and giving back; and creating value versus trying to capture it,&#8221; a16z&#8217;s Casado writes. &#8220;The model has proven to be very effective, and now Orbit has built a product around it. We strongly believe Orbit is a must-have product for those building developer-focused companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The company is already working with just under 150 companies and its users include the likes of<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.postman.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://circleci.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CircleCI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apollo GraphQL</span></a>.</p>
<p>The company will use the new round, which closed a few weeks ago, to, among other things, build out its go-to-market efforts and develop more integrations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wellory.com">Wellory</a>, a startup that bills itself as taking an &#8220;anti-diet approach&#8221; to nutrition and wellness, is announcing that it has raised $4.2 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/story-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="story-ventures">Story Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Harlem Capital, Tinder co-founders Sean Rad and Justin Mateen, Ground Up Ventures, NBA player Wayne Ellington, Hannah Bronfman and others.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wellory" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wellory">Wellory <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder and CEO Emily Hochman (who was previously the head of customer success at WayUp) told me that she struggled with dieting in college, to the point where she was risking chronic illness and infertility. As a result, she became determined to gain a better understanding of nutrition and her own health, eventually studying and becoming <a href="https://www.integrativenutrition.com/health-coaching">a certified health coach</a> at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hochman said that through Wellory, she wants to offer that same understanding to others, which she said has created a &#8220;managed marketplace&#8221; matching users with a licensed nutritionist, registered dietitian or certified health coach. Those coaches create a personalized plan for losing weight or achieving other health goals, then continue to provide feedback as users share photos of each meal and additional health data.</p>
<p>For example, she said that a customer who had just given birth and was interested in postpartum weight loss would get matched with a coach who specializes in that area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that is so important is that we build personalized plans,&#8221; she added. &#8220;We don’t have anything that says, &#8216;At Wellory, we do these 10 things and that’s a standard diet.&#8217; We&#8217;re actually going to help you learn how to make smart and healthy decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081825" style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081825" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?w=656" alt="Wellory CEO Emily Hochman" width="656" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=768,796 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=656,680 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EMILY-HOCHMAN-CEO.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081825" class="wp-caption-text">Wellory CEO Emily Hochman (Image Credit: Wellory)</p></div></p>
<p>Wellory officially launched in September, but Hochman said some beta testers have been using the service for nine, 10 or 11 months. She said early customers include people who are interested in weight loss, those who need nutrition advice due to chronic illness and &#8220;optimizers&#8221; who simply want to make sure they&#8217;re eating as healthily as possible.</p>
<p>She also noted that although customers usually sign up with a specific goal in mind, &#8220;once they hit their goal, because of the power of a strong relationship, they say, &#8216;I don’t want to go back to where I was, let’s keep building, let&#8217;s make sure I can sustain this.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>The app is available on iOS and Android and currently costs $59.99 per month. Hochman plans to introduce additional pricing tiers. and she said the funding will allow Wellory to expand the technology and marketing teams, and to explore new partnerships.</p>
<p>“As a data technology investor, we get approached by different types of wearable or diagnostic companies nearly every week,” said Jake Yormak of Story Ventures in a statement. “We love the category but what we saw in Wellory was a way to put a human coach at the center of understanding this health data. With nutrition as the wedge, Wellory has built a trusted relationship with people who affirmatively want to better understand and improve their wellbeing.”</p>

<hr />
<p><i>Late-breaking update: since the time of writing this Dear Sophie column, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White struck down two of the H-1B rules mentioned: increasing the prevailing wage and restricting the definition of &#8220;specialty occupation.&#8221; I&#8217;ll keep you posted on any further developments down the road, but for today, the entire nonimmigrant visa classification program is strengthened. Yay!</i></p>
<p><strong>Dear Sophie:</strong></p>
<p><strong> The startup I am co-founding will be sponsoring my co-founder for a visa in the March 2021 H-1B lottery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve been so focused on building our startup that we haven’t kept up with all the recent changes. What are we supposed to do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Focused in Foster City</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Focused:</p>
<p>You are right on track as the time to start is now. In December, we usually kick off our H-1B planning and prep work with startups, companies, HR and people ops, employees and recruits for the spring lottery. Although there are a lot of recent proposals and changes, please go ahead now and initiate retaining counsel to put any and all potential candidates in the lottery.</p>
<p>Although there are several new rules slated to go into effect in December and early January, these are subject to potential removal by President-elect Biden and may also be the topic of a great deal of litigation, so we should proceed as usual. <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> visas for specialty occupations are still available. In my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/046-get-ready-for-h-1b-fy2022-lottery/">H-1B podcast</a>, I discuss what the 2021 lottery will look like and there’s a <a href="https://witty-author-184.ck.page/321063598c">free H-1B guide</a> for you to download. Same as before, you can also check out the podcast episode on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-09-what-makes-a-strong-h-1b-petition/">What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition</a>.</p>
<p>Looking into my crystal ball, the three new rules that may have the biggest effect on the H-1B process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/dear-sophie/dear-sophie-how-can-employers-hire-comply-with-all-this-new-h-1b-craziness/">new rule</a> by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), which went into effect immediately when it was announced in October. That rule substantially increased the minimum wage that employers are required to pay to H-1B candidates. According to the <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/dol-said-its-h-1b-wage-rule-should-cost-many-employers-0-it-imposed-billions-costs-anyway?queryID=07311c916ee1204167ab505aef4ad0da">Cato Institute</a>, the average H-1B employer will have to increase wage offers to H-1B candidates by more than 30%. It’s not worth being concerned about this potential wage increase now as you don’t have to commit to a proposed wage for your future H-1B hire until your candidate is actually selected in the lottery and you prepare and file the full petition in Q2. And even then, the new wage wouldn’t take effect until the H-1B is approved and the earliest possible start date is October 1, 2021. So don’t let it scare you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another rule proposed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in November seeks to replace the random H-1B selection process — or lottery — with a new selection process that would prioritize the selection of H-1B candidates based solely on the highest wages paid by the employers who sponsor them. It does not consider the experience of the candidate nor whether the candidate is a specialized worker in an in-demand field, such as medicine or research. Once again, we have no idea when and if this will actually go into effect. Although it sounds scary, it might actually be great for funded startups that need more predictability than a random lottery about whether key hires will be able to join the team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/dear-sophie/dear-sophie-how-can-employers-hire-comply-with-all-this-new-h-1b-craziness/">rule proposed </a>by USCIS in October requires an H-1B candidate to have a bachelor’s or higher degree specifically related to the specialty occupation the H-1B candidate is applying for and H-1B employers must show the position is directly related to the education degree. This for sure will be the subject of lots of litigation. If you’re hiring folks for professional or tech roles and you have funding to pay them, this isn’t really an issue, just an annoyance, and you can avoid questioning by doing a very thorough job on the original petition, which my firm specializes in.</li>
</ul>
<p>So tips and tricks: I am recommending that everyone begin preparing based on the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/002-2020-h-1b-lottery-update/">H-1B lottery in 2020</a> and to consult with an immigration lawyer to devise a strategy and discuss options. Your co-founder needs to remain in valid legal status if they are already in the United States. If your startup/co-founder is not selected to apply for an H-1B, check out <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/044-7-of-the-most-startup-friendly-visas-explained/">7 of the Most Startup Friendly Visas Explained</a> for alternative options.</p>
<p>Your startup may want to explore whether it can bypass the H-1B visa altogether by sponsoring your co-founder for either an O-1A extraordinary ability visa, an EB-1A extraordinary ability green card or an EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card. If you would like to learn more, we will be hosting a webinar on Wednesday, December 16 at 11 a.m. PST. We will have a special promotion and a freebie for those who attend. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1816063397370/WN_F2X9Gqv4Q_yEJbj0OagBkQ">Register here!</a></p>
<p>If you proceed with pursuing an H-1B, make sure your startup has the appropriate corporate structure and documentation in place that demonstrates a valid employer-employee relationship exists between your startup and your co-founder. That includes making sure your co-founder will have a true employee relationship with the company and they will be hired, supervised and can be fired. Listen to my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">podcast episode</a> on what startups should know about sponsoring their first H-1B candidate.</p>
<p>Your startup will need to register your co-founder for the H-1B lottery on March 1. The USCIS registration fee is only $10 so it’s easy to do it for everybody who might benefit. The registration process closes on March 20. If your startup is selected to apply for an H-1B on behalf of your co-founder, USCIS will inform your startup by March 31. Your startup will have until June 30 to submit its H-1B petition. Over the next few months, your startup and your co-founder can start assembling documents and evidence so that you’ll be ready if your startup/co-founder is selected to apply for an H-1B. If not selected in March, there may be a second digital lottery at the beginning of Q3 for any remaining H-1B visa slots.</p>
<p>I’ll continue to keep you and the other Dear Sophie readers informed on the latest changes to the H-1B lottery process here in this column, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>You got this — go for it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the same week that Amazon is holding its big AWS confab, Google is also announcing a move to raise its own enterprise game with Google Cloud. Today the company <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/google-enters-agreement-to-acquire-actifio">announced</a> that it is acquiring <a href="http://actifio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actifio</a>, a data management company that helps companies with data continuity to be better prepared in the event of a security breach or other need for disaster recovery. The deal squares Google up as a competitor against the likes of Rubrik, another big player in data continuity.</p>
<p>The terms of the deal were not disclosed in the announcement; we&#8217;re looking and will update as we learn more. Notably, when the company was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/23/actifio-100million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over $1 billion</a> in a funding round back in 2014, it had said it was preparing for an IPO (which never happened). PitchBook data estimated its value at $1.3 billion in 2018, but earlier this year it appeared to be raising money at about a 60% discount to its recent valuation, according to data provided to us by Prime Unicorn Index.</p>
<p>The company was also involved in a patent infringement suit against Rubrik, which it also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/actifio-initiates-patent-infringement-litigation-against-rubrik-301085531.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed earlier this year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It had raised around $461 million, with investors including Andreessen Horowitz, TCV, Tiger, 83 North, and more.</p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/actifio" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="actifio">Actifio, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Google is moving into what is one of the key investment areas for enterprises in recent years. The growth of increasingly sophisticated security breaches, coupled with stronger data protection regulation, has given a new priority to the task of holding and using business data more responsibly, and business continuity is a cornerstone of that.</p>
<p>Google describes the startup as as a &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">leader in backup and disaster recovery&#8221; providing virtual copies of data that can be managed and updated for storage, testing, and more. The fact that it covers data in a number of environments &#8212; including SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, virtual machines (VMs) in VMware, Hyper-V, physical servers, and of course Google Compute Engine &#8212; means that it also gives Google a strong play to work with companies in hybrid and multi-vendor environments rather than just all-Google shops.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We know that customers have many options when it comes to cloud solutions, including backup and DR, and the acquisition of Actifio will help us to better serve enterprises as they deploy and manage business-critical workloads, including in hybrid scenarios,&#8221; writes Brad Calder, VP, engineering, in the blog post. :In addition, we are committed to supporting our backup and DR technology and channel partner ecosystem, providing customers with a variety of options so they can choose the solution that best fits their needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will join Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to join Google Cloud and build on the success we’ve had as partners over the past four years,” said Ash Ashutosh, CEO at Actifio, in a statement. “Backup and recovery is essential to enterprise cloud adoption and, together with Google Cloud, we are well-positioned to serve the needs of data-driven customers across industries.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alphabet&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/project-loon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="project-loon">Loon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been using algorithmic processes to optimize the flight of its stratospheric balloons for years now &#8212; and setting records for time spent aloft as a result. But the company is now deploying a new navigation system that has the potential to be much better, and it&#8217;s using true reinforcement-learning AI to teach itself to optimize navigation better than humans ever could.</p>
<p>Loon developed the new reinforcement-learning system, which it says is the first to be used in an actual product aerospace context, with its Alphabet colleagues at Google AI in Montreal over the past couple of years. Unlike its past algorithmic navigation software, this one is devised entirely by machine &#8212; a machine that&#8217;s able to calculate the optimal navigation path for the balloons much more quickly than the human-made system could, and with much more efficiency, meaning the balloons use much less power to travel the same or greater distances than before.</p>
<p>How does Loon know it&#8217;s better? They actually pitted the new AI navigation against their human algorithm-based prior system directly, with a 39-day test that flew over the Pacific Ocean. The reinforcement learning model kept the Loon balloon aloft over target areas for longer continuous periods, using less energy than the older system, and it even came up with some new navigational moves that the team has never seen or conceived of before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After this and other tests proved such dramatic successes, Loon actually then went ahead and deployed it across its entire production fleet, which is currently deployed across parts of Africa to serve commercial customers in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/alphabets-loon-launches-its-balloon-powered-kenyan-internet-service/">Kenya</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of few real-world examples of an AI system that employs reinforcement learning to actively teach itself to perform better being used in a real-life setting, to control the performance of real hardware operating in a production capacity and serving paying customers. It&#8217;s a remarkable achievement, and definitely one that will be watched closely by others in aerospace and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://agentsync.io/">AgentSync</a>, an insurtech startup focused on agent compliance management, announced a new funding round worth $6.7 million.</p>
<p>The financing event, led by well-known SaaS founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/david-sacks" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="david-sacks">David Sacks&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/">Craft Ventures</a>, included dollars from both <a href="https://operatorcollective.com/">Operator Collective</a> and prior investors.</p>
<p>The new capital will help <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/agentsync" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="agentsync">AgentSync <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> move faster, with co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akaniji/">Niranjan Sabharwal</a> saying that it is pulling into 2020 hires earmarked for next year. He added that this most recent fundraising cycle consumed far less time than the round that preceded it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked what the company is calling this round, which was raised via a SAFE note instead of as a priced equity investment. Sabharwal said that it could be called a seed-extension, which seems reasonable.</p>
<p>The new investment was raised at a cap of around 4x its previous conversion ceiling.</p>
<p>TechCrunch last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">covered AgentSync this August</a>, when the startup announced a $4.4 million funding round. Akin to fellow early-stage startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome,</a> which announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">second 2020 raise earlier today</a>, AgentSync managed to quickly raise again.</p>
<p>In AgentSync&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s not hard to parse why the company was able to: It&#8217;s growing very quickly.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EC24NtYWdv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/">AgentSync raises $4.4M for its insurtech compliance service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AgentSync raises $4.4M for its insurtech compliance service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/agentsync-raises-4-4m-for-its-insurtech-compliance-service/embed/#?secret=EC24NtYWdv" data-secret="EC24NtYWdv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akaniji/">Sabharwal</a>, the company has seen its revenue scale 4x since the start of the pandemic, and 10x in the last year. The time frames around those metrics are slightly relaxed, but the raw growth underscores that AgentSync is on to something.</p>
<p>Sabharwal founded the company with his spouse <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlouiseknight/">Jenn Knight</a> and recently moved the company&#8217;s HQ to Denver from San Francisco.</p>
<p>AgentSync&#8217;s product, born out of a tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/zenefits-makes-licensing-compliance-app-available-for-free-in-the-salesforce-app-exchange/">that Zenefits developed</a> while rebuilding itself, helps insurance companies and other players in the insurance space ensure that agents are compliant (hence its name). And while that conceit might sound like a modest effort, it&#8217;s a complex effort given a multi-stakeholder environment, regulatory conditions and an antiquated market.</p>
<p>The company saw strong initial traction, reporting $1.9 million ARR during its August round. Doing some mental math, if AgentSync was doing around $1 million ARR in March, it would be at around $4 million ARR today. That feels roughly correct, given the 4x-since-March metric, and the $1.9 million ARR data point from mid-Q2 2020.</p>
<p>According to Sabharwal, AgentSync now has more than $10 million in the bank, meaning that the startup is very well capitalized to continue scaling in the coming quarters. New investor Sacks is bullish about how large AgentSync could become, telling TechCrunch in an email that its &#8220;market is huge,&#8221; and that the &#8220;insurtech revolution is [still] in its infancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while AgentSync is growing quickly and has found reasonable product-market fit &#8212; 17% of its net ARR today was driven by what the company descried as net-organic expansion, to pick an example &#8212; it still has the hallmarks of an early-stage startup, like inconsistent sales cycle length, according to several deals that the CEO detailed during an interview. However, the company recently hired a sales team after a period of time when Sabharwal was in charge of selling; the company&#8217;s selling process should accelerate in coming quarters.</p>
<p>The CEO told TechCrunch that until recently he was selling AgentSync solo with no enterprise sales experience. If he could do it, he reasoned, others will be able to, as well. Sabharwal serves as the startup&#8217;s CEO, while Knight is its CTO.</p>
<p>In closing, Insurtech is hot, meaning that AgentSync is growing amidst fertile market ground and investor interest. Another few quarters of similar growth and we could be hearing about its Series A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> News Showcase visitors will soon be able to read select paywalled articles at no extra charge.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of <a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-expands">several announcements</a> that the search giant made today about News Showcase, the program where it pays publishers (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/">with $1 billion committed initially</a>) to license their content for a new format in Google News. So far, Google News Showcase has launched in such countries as Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, France, U.K. and Australia — in several cases, those are markets where it&#8217;s previously faced legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny.</p>
<p>Google says it will be paying participating publishers to provide &#8220;limited access to paywalled content for News Showcase users.&#8221; Those users will, however, still need to register directly with the publishers, which Google says will give them a way to build a relationship. (Facebook has also been experimenting with ways to present paywalled content, in its case by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/facebook-subscription-account-link/">linking Facebook accounts to news subscriptions</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lOhAcxttvE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/facebook-subscription-account-link/">Facebook tests linking your FB account to your news subscriptions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook tests linking your FB account to your news subscriptions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/facebook-subscription-account-link/embed/#?secret=lOhAcxttvE" data-secret="lOhAcxttvE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The main News Showcase format is essentially story panel, and Google says it&#8217;s introducing a new panel allowing publishers to curate a daily selection of their most important stories. Those panels will be shown to users who follow those publishers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081840" style="width: 365px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081840" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081840" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DE_Device.gif?w=355" alt="Google News Showcase" width="355" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081840" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also bringing the News Showcase to new devices and channels. It started out on Google News on Android and is now available on iOS as well, with plans to expand to the news.google.com website and Discover soon. And it says it has doubled the number of partners since the launch in October — the list of nearly 400 publishers participating in the program includes new names like Le Monde, Courrier International, L&#8217;Obs, Le Figaro, Libération and L’Express in France, plus Página12, La Gaceta and El Día in Argentina.</p>
<p>&#8220;As 2020 comes to a close, it is heartening to witness the progress of News Showcase and the enthusiasm from both publishers and readers around the world,&#8221; the company writes. &#8220;We will continue to engage and incorporate feedback as we build out features and grow the product to add to the future sustainability of our news partners.&#8221;</p>
