										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric aviation startup Wisk Aero’s request for a preliminary injunction against rival Archer Aviation was denied by a federal judge Thursday, the latest in an ongoing legal battle over whether Archer stole trade secrets in developing its flagship Maker aircraft.</p>
<p>A full written opinion has not yet been published. In a tentative ruling filed earlier this week, Judge William Orrick said Wisk’s “evidence of misappropriation is too equivocal to warrant a preliminary injunction.” Wisk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">filed for the injunction in May</a>; if it had been approved, it would have effectively put an immediate halt to Archer’s operations.</p>
<p>Wisk submitted to the court 52 trade secrets it alleges were stolen and used by Archer, and the injunction would have prevented Archer from using any of them until a final decision was issued in the suit. It’s an extraordinary request and it makes sense that Orrick would need to see more certain evidence of misappropriation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There are some arguable indications of misappropriation, but given how equivocal the evidence is, Wisk is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of an injunction,” Orrick said in the tentative ruling. “Because the merits are so uncertain, Wisk has also not adequately shown irreparable injury based on misappropriation. And the balance of hardships favors Archer because, without solid evidence of misappropriation, an injunction would gravely threaten its business.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wisk Aero sues Archer Aviation for alleged patent infringement, trade secret theft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/wisk-aero-sues-archer-aviation-for-alleged-patent-infringement-trade-secret-theft/embed/#?secret=JSxuCoGxSi" data-secret="JSxuCoGxSi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wisk says the judge’s decision on the injunction has no bearing on the outcome of the case “and does not exonerate Archer in the least.”</p>
<p>“We brought this lawsuit based on strong indications of theft and use of Wisk’s IP, and the initial limited evidence gathered through the court process to date only confirms our belief that Archer’s misappropriation of Wisk’s trade secrets is widespread and pervades Archer’s aircraft development,” Wisk continued. “Following today’s ruling, Wisk will be allowed to begin collecting evidence in earnest.”</p>
<p>Wisk was established in 2019 as a joint venture between Kitty Hawk and Boeing, but its history with electric aviation stretches back much further. The company was originally founded in 2010 as Levt, which eventually merged with sister company Kitty Hawk. Wisk says it (as Kitty Hawk) zeroed in on a fixed-wing, 12-rotor design in 2016. It’s this design that’s the centerpiece of its debut aircraft, Cora.</p>
<p>Archer, by contrast, is newer to the field. Much of Wisk’s original complaint, filed in April, is predicated on the speed with which Archer is bringing its air taxi service to market. Archer also recruited many former Wisk engineers &#8212; including former employee Jing Xue, whom Wisk says downloaded nearly 5,000 files before his departure from the company, which it alleges he handed over to Archer.</p>
<p>When he was cross-examined, Xue pled the Fifth Amendment, invoking his right to not self-incriminate, citing an ongoing federal investigation.</p>
<p>Archer says Wisk has not brought forward any substantive evidence of the central claim of the lawsuit: that Archer received and used Wisk trade secrets. Wisk’s allegations are based on “conspiracy theories and outright misrepresentations,” Archer’s Deputy General Counsel Eric Lentell said.</p>
<p>“It is clear to us from Wisk’s actions in this case that after recognizing Archer&#8217;s momentum and pace of innovation, Wisk began abusing the judicial and criminal justice system in an attempt to slow us down to compensate for its own lack of success,” Archer co-founders Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein said.</p>
<p>The court will hold a scheduling conference on August 11, where the judge will outline next steps for the case. A date for the trial has not been set.</p>
<p>The case is filed in the California Northern District Court under case no. 3:2021cv02450.</p>

The company says it plans to replace defective batteries, but until it can do so it&#8217;s advising Bolt customers to limit their charging up to 90 percent, and not to go below 70 miles of range. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">reiterating a recommendation from last week</a> against parking indoors and leaving the car&#8217;s to charge overnight unattended. This latest recall follows a similar one from last November, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">GM recalled more than 68,000 Bolts</a>.</p>
<p>The company also suggests that Bolt customers visit their nearest Chevy EV dealer to get the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-battery-recall-software-195939173.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">advanced diagnostics software</a>, which should alert them ahead of any future battery issues. Hyundai, which also sources batteries from LG Chem like GM, ended up replacing more than 75,000 batteries for its Kona EV.</p>
<p>While it may sound alarming — GM&#8217;s recalls were triggered by five Bolt fires between 2017 and 2019 — it&#8217;s worth noting that gas cars typically cause around 150 fires a day, <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/v19i2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">according to a FEMA report</a>. Still, EV makers need to prove they can responsibly deal with potential issues before they can hurt more people (and before it leads to more negative sentiment towards electric vehicles).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve started using Snapchat more regularly this year, you&#8217;re not alone. At yesterday&#8217;s Q2 earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel announced that the platform grew both revenue and daily active users at the highest rates it has achieved in the last four years. Snapchat now has 293 million daily active users, growing 23% since last year.</p>
<p>Snap went public in 2017 with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/snap-values-itself-at-nearly-24b-with-its-ipo-pricing/?_ga=2.25886137.566122237.1626654100-1532633466.1621860309">$24 billion valuation</a>, but not long before then, the ephemeral photo sharing app experienced a massive hiccup: Instagram cloned their then-unique Stories feature. After Instagram Stories launched, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/slowchat/">growth slowed</a> by 82%. Then, when Snapchat redesigned its app&#8217;s interface, Kylie Jenner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/snap-stock-sinks-as-kylie-jenner-says-she-doesnt-use-snapchat-anymore/">tweeted</a> that she didn&#8217;t use the app anymore, causing the company&#8217;s valuation to <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html">drop by $1.2 billion</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me&#8230; ugh this is so sad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) <a href="https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/966429897118728192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But Snapchat held on and made a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/snap-shares-explode-after-blowing-past-earnings-expectations/"> comeback</a>. Its revenue reached an all-time high of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204006019/en/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results">$911 million</a> in Q4 of 2020, then went down to <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1%E2%80%9921-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf">$770 million</a> the following quarter. Now, Snapchat&#8217;s revenue in Q2 of 2021 surpasses its previous high to reach <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210722005939/en/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results">$982 million</a>.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Q2 growth could be attributed to the return of advertisers who scaled back their spending during the height of the pandemic, as well as the retention of users that flocked to the app while in lockdown. Like many social media platforms, Snapchat <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/snap-grows-revenue-and-users-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/">grew its revenue and user base</a> during the pandemic, but this isn&#8217;t just a matter of re-engaging users with an app that they grew out of. As TikTok exploded on the scene and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/">creator economy</a> boomed, Snapchat kept up by creating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>, a TikTok clone, and investing in the applications of augmented reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made significant progress with our augmented reality platform this quarter,&#8221; Spiegel said. &#8220;More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Snapchat went viral for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Cartoon 3D Style Lens</a>, which makes you look like a character in a Pixar movie. Spiegel specifically mentioned this lens as a feature that &#8220;highlighted the power of Lenses to go viral both inside and outside of Snapchat.&#8221; But beyond fun face filters, Snapchat has been using AR to woo e-commerce partners. The app has developed AR experiences for Walt Disney World, Smile Direct Club, Zenni Optical, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren and more. This includes try-on capabilities for watches, jewelry, eyewear, handbags, makeup and even clothing. At its Partner Summit in May, Snapchat revealed an update that lets users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">scan friends&#8217; outfits</a> to find shopping recommendations for similar styles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot more work ahead to build out our technology and increase AR adoption, but we are thrilled with the results that our partners are seeing as we invest in our long-term camera opportunity,&#8221; said Jeremi Gorman, Snap&#8217;s chief business officer. &#8220;We are confident in our long-term opportunity, and are excited to double down on shopping and commerce via augmented reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>In March, Snap acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/">Fit Analytics</a>, a Berlin-based startup that helps shoppers find the right-sized apparel and footwear when shopping online. Combined with Snap&#8217;s investment in AR, could we eventually use AR to see which size of clothing to order? The application of that sort of technology would need to be handled sensitively, especially as the rates of eating disorders in teens are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eating-disorders-surged-among-adolescents-in-pandemic-11624302000">on the rise</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond e-commerce, Snapchat has sought out strategic partnerships with entertainment companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/hbo-max-to-stream-free-episodes-inside-snapchat-for-co-watching-with-friends/">HBO Max</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/snap-makes-a-deal-with-universal-music-group-adding-its-catalog-to-sounds/">Universal Music Group</a> and doubled down on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">Spectacles</a>, glasses that create AR experiences. Of course, Facebook is working on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-ar-glasses-2021/">AR glasses </a>too. But for both companies, Snap&#8217;s recent successes show the rising adoption and value of AR experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.monarchmoney.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a subscription-based platform that aims to help consumers “plan and manage” their financial lives, has raised $4.8 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel led the round, which also included participation from SignalFire, and brings the Mountain View-based yet fully distributed startup’s total funding since its 2019 inception to $5.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO Val Agostino was the first product manager on the original team that built Mint.com. There, he said, he saw firsthand that Americans with a greater understanding of financial matters “needed software solutions that went beyond just tracking and budgeting.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They needed help planning their financial future and understanding the tradeoffs between competing financial priorities,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch aims to help people address those needs with software it says “makes it easy” for people to outline their financial goals and then create a detailed, forward-looking plan toward achieving them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We then help customers track their progress against their plan and automatically course correct as their financial situation changes, which it always does,” Agostino said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch came out of private beta in early 2021 with apps for web, iOS and Android, and is priced at $9.99 per month or $89.99 per year. The startup intentionally opted to not be ad-supported or sell customers’ financial data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These approaches are “misaligned with users’ financial interests,” Agostino said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We felt that a subscription business model would best support that ethos and align our users’ interests with our own,” he added. Since launching publicly, Monarch has been growing its paid subscriber base by about 9% per week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch launched during the pandemic, the uncertainty of which carried over into people’s financial lives, believes Agostino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result, we saw a lot of people make use of Monarch’s forecasting features to compare different ‘what if ‘scenarios such as switching jobs or moving to a different city or state,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported on a company with a similar mission, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/">BodesWell</a>, teaming up with American Express on a financial planning tool for its cardholders. Agostino said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monarch is similar to BodesWell in that both startups help customers map a financial plan and future. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The difference is that Monarch also has a full suite of PFM tools, such as budgeting, reporting and investment analysis,” he said. “The benefit to the consumer is that because Monarch is connected to your entire financial picture, we can help you actually stay on track with your financial plan and/or update the plan in real time if needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel’s Daniel Levine said that until he came across Monarch, he was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">somehow still a Mint customer despite its obsolescence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, the landscape for financial products has expanded dramatically, with more people having brokerage and crypto accounts, for example, Levine said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, Monarch stands out for a couple of reasons. For one, it’s a subscription product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing I always hated about Mint was when it would suggest the objectively wrong credit card for me,” Levine said. “It has all of my transaction data, it should tell me the card with the best rewards for me. Monarch is set up to never compromise what&#8217;s best for the user in favor of advertising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, Monarch’s aim is to serve as the infrastructure for its customers. To do that, it needs to monitor all of someone&#8217;s finances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need to track checking, credit cards, brokerage, real estate and crypto,” he said. “Monarch is committed to doing that. It&#8217;s an incredibly painful problem and even though Monarch is a new entrant in the space, I think they&#8217;ve clearly separated themselves on that dimension.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to control, the Chinese government doesn't mind wiping out a few dozen billion dollars in market cap here and there. That's not a great system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that China&#8217;s government may force domestic tutoring-focused companies to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-23/china-is-said-to-mull-turning-tutoring-firms-into-non-profits">go nonprofit</a> is taking a huge bite out of the value of several technology companies. Bloomberg <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-considers-turning-tutoring-companies-081502751.html">notes that the value of companies</a> like New Oriental Education &amp; Technology Group and TAL Education are tumbling in light of the news, which would constitute merely the latest salvo against tech companies in the autocratic country.</p>
<p>New Oriental&#8217;s Hong Kong-listed shares fell 44.22% in after-hours trading after the nonprofit news broke, while NYSE-shares of TAL are off an even sharper 51.75% in pre-market trading. With Yahoo Finance listing a roughly $13.8 billion market cap for TAL ahead of its impending declines at the market open, billions of equity value are about to get deleted. The list goes on: China Online Education Group is off 39.97% in after-hours trading, for example.</p>

<p>A new decision by China&#8217;s government to exert more control over a sector of its domestic economy should not surprise. And we shouldn&#8217;t be shocked that online tutoring is in the country&#8217;s targets; today&#8217;s news is a follow-up to <a href="https://supchina.com/2021/06/16/china-creates-dedicated-department-to-regulate-private-tutoring-industry/">prior regulatory action</a> in the sector from earlier in the year.</p>

The expected rules change may also hit a host of private, venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>For example, what will happen to Yuanfudao? The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/chinese-live-tutoring-app-yuanfudao-is-now-worth-15-5-billion/">valued at $15.5 billion last year</a>, offering what TechCrunch described as &#8220;live tutoring, an online Q&amp;A arm and a math-problem-checking arm.&#8221; Will the company see its wings clipped?</p>
<p>Or how about Zuoyebang, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/chinese-online-education-app-zuoyebang-raises-1-6-billion-from-investors-including-alibaba/">raised $1.6 billion in a single round last year</a>? TechCrunch wrote that Zuoyebang offers &#8220;online courses, live lessons and homework help for kindergarten to 12th grade students.&#8221; Is it in trouble as well?</p>
<p>All this comes on the same day that shares in Zomato began to float, with the Indian online food delivery company seeing its shares <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">close up nearly 65% in their first day&#8217;s trading</a>. TechCrunch has viewed the Zomato IPO as a possible bellwether for the larger Indian startup market, and the results augur well for other growth-focused, loss-making unicorns in the country.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">COVID-19 cemented e-commerce into everyone&#8217;s daily habits in 2020, and as we look ahead, B2B e-commerce is quickly becoming the next frontier for founders and investors. The pandemic pushed businesses online, and the emergence of B2B marketplaces and e-commerce infrastructure is fueling a new wave of growth that&#8217;s estimated to reach $3.6 trillion in annual GMV by 2024.</p>
<p>But one major component remains missing from the stack: <em>checkout</em>, which has the opportunity to be the ultimate enabler for B2B e-commerce more broadly.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Historically, B2B e-commerce has been held back by deeply entrenched behaviors and a lack of cloud-based infrastructure.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>The challenge of B2B e-commerce</h2>
<p>Historically, B2B e-commerce has been held back by deeply entrenched behaviors and a lack of cloud-based infrastructure. While the market is quickly evolving, there are nuances to B2B purchases that make the path to purchase more complex than in consumer e-commerce. Broadly speaking, these constraints fall into three buckets:</p>
<p><strong>Payments:</strong> PayPal unlocked the early days of consumer e-commerce, and Stripe&#8217;s ease of integrating card payments has powered the last decade. But in B2B, the challenge has always been that sellers don&#8217;t want to pay a 3% surcharge — so much so that they&#8217;d rather suffer through the pain of physical checks and accounts payable. In 2018, 60% of B2B payment flows were conducted via checks, and the persistence of nondigital payments has been a major bottleneck to e-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions:</strong> Most B2B transactions go through contracting and procurement, which requires multiple parties to sign off on each transaction. This creates friction in the path to purchase, as the seller can&#8217;t tell if the buyer is authorized. Rather than being able to hit buy, buyers often need to fill out a form so a salesperson can get in touch. This can slow the transaction from seconds to weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong> The majority of B2B transactions are completed on some form of credit, be it working capital loans, factoring, or in the form of days payable. Credit applications are typically completed on paper forms (or at best <a href="https://www.deere.com/assets/pdfs/region-4/finance/multi-use-account/multiuse-interactive-credit-app.pdf">hosted PDFs</a>) that armies of people at internal credit departments review. For context, there are over 1,000 employees at John Deere with &#8220;credit&#8221; in their job descriptions. This costs a lot and results in sensitive information being shared on paper documents, which further slows the transaction.</p>
<p>The net result of these constraints is the inability to make instant online purchases, like we’re used to as consumers. It’s a combination of fintech problems that require a platform rather than a series of point solutions.</p>
<h2>Why is checkout the answer?</h2>
<p>While the term &#8220;checkout&#8221; may not seem particularly novel, modern checkout is a distinctly new category in fintech combining digital payments, identity, fraud, credit and much more. It creates a powerful network, the type that can not only build trust but enable one-click transactions at scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shareholders approved Friday EV startup Lucid Motors’ merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV, after the companies extended the deadline by one day because not enough retail investors showed up to cast their vote.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The issue is unusual but could become more common as more companies eschew the traditional IPO path to public markets and instead merge with SPACs. </span></p>
<p>The hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger — proposal two, which would revise the company’s charter so that Lucid could receive key financing. That proposal requires a higher number of votes than the others — and it must be approved for the merger to take place — so a lack of votes ended up halting the entire process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The lack of shareholders was blamed on retail investors&#8217; unfamiliarity with the SPAC process and, unbelievably, spam filters gone awry.</p>
<p>Churchill chairman Michael Klein raised the possibility that some of the emails sent to shareholders were accidentally sent to voters’ spam folders. While it may seem incredible that something as low-tech as a Gmail spam filter might interrupt a multibillion dollar business merger, it seems that may have occurred in this case.</p>
<p>“We simply need more votes,” Klein said on an investor call Thursday. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson was also direct: “I need you to vote for proposal two.”</p>
<p>“We recognize that for many of you, this voting process may be new or not standard,” Klein continued. He later thanked the many individual shareholders but urged those “participating from the new platforms, the new apps,” to vote. “They may not necessarily be directing you clearly to the voting service.”</p>
<p>The number of amateur or so-called “retail traders” has exploded since the start of the pandemic, largely thanks to apps like Robinhood, which leverages gamification strategies to encourage users to buy and sell stocks from anywhere. The pinnacle of this phenomenon will likely be remembered by history in the explosive rise in prices of stocks for failing companies like GameStop and AMC entertainment, engineered by an army of retail traders on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets">subreddit r/wallstreetbets</a>. Retail investors account for around 10% of the U.S. equity trading volume, according to a report from Morgan Stanley, down from a high of 15% last September.</p>
<p>But if the rise in the price of meme stocks shows us anything, it’s that retail traders are a powerful force. The Morgan Stanley report notes that “retail investors tend to prefer companies in sectors they are likely to be familiar with as consumers, such as Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Technology.” This could be why the Churchill SPAC was high on many retail investors’ radars.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/iz1u85/new_investors_please_read_shareholder_votes_you/">highly awarded post</a> on the subreddit r/SPACs, a Reddit user urges new retail shareholders to participate in voting: “<em>This is not normal. SPACs have never had to beg shareholders to act in their own best interest before.</em></p>
<p>You MUST vote. A non-vote does NOT count as a YES. A non-vote is just a non-vote.”</p>
<p>While Lucid’s merger hold-up is a very different scenario than that of meme stock trading, it’s yet another reminder that retail investors are continuing to shape markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alphabet’s public-facing history with robotics has, thus far, been a spotty one. Most notably, Google X’s big acquisition push culminated in its selling Boston Dynamics to SoftBank (who eventually flipped it to Hyundai). Alphabet/Google’s subsequent approach has been less flashy and focused on more immediate robotic tasks.</p>
<p>Unveiled today <a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651">through the X blog</a>, Intrinsic certainly fits the bill. In fact, it’s kind of an ideal take for Alphabet. Effectively, the latest branch of the X Development tree is concerned with software for industrial robotics &#8212; those  big, heavy machines that are perhaps not as nimble as many manufacturers would like.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181420" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181420" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181420" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1_ctE__hKyugfxRaoXUQpqmQ.gif" alt="" width="768" height="432" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181420" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intrinsic</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The post is penned by Wendy Tan-White, a VP of Moonshots at Alphabet, who now has the title of Intrinsic CEO. Of the company’s origins, the co-founder of SaaS website builder Moonfruit writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a vibrant community of startups out there looking to augment big, heavy robotics, including the likes of Veo, Symbio and Covariant. Oftentimes, these companies focus on one specific element, like Veo’s safety protocols from human-robotic interactions. Fittingly, Intrinsic appears to be shooting for the moon here, so to speak, with plans to take on a number of different issues at once.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181421" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181421" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181421" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1_z8Ia94QOptz5_siC0_Qg9A.gif" alt="" width="512" height="288" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181421" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Intrinsic</p></div></p>
<p>“We’re developing software tools designed to make industrial robots (which are used to make everything from solar panels to cars) easier to use, less costly and more flexible, so that more people can use them to make new products, businesses and services,” Tan-White writes.</p>
<p>Certainly Alphabet has the capital and ability to attract talent to make some headway there, even if there are a number of competitors who have a head start. Though Intrinsic isn&#8217;t exactly brand new, either. The company has apparently been working in customary X stealth mode for five-and-a-half years, per the post &#8212; it clearly wanted something to show for its efforts before announcing itself to the world.</p>
<p>The news also marks Intrinsic’s debut as an “independent” Alphabet company, leaving the moonshot area behind as it seeks partners in automotive, healthcare and electronics to help prove out its technologies.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>We were a smaller team this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> together with Chris to sort through yet another summer frenzy of a week.</p>
<p>This time around we actually recorded live on Twitter Spaces, which was a first for the podcast. If you missed it, it&#8217;s probably because we didn&#8217;t promote the taping since it was just an experiment. Good news, though, is that it went well, and we&#8217;re going to do some more live tapings of the show with the entire crew on the mics. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">follow the show on the Big Tweet</a> to ensure that you can come hang with us next week. We&#8217;ll also do some Q&amp;A at the end, if we&#8217;re in good moods.</p>
<p>Until then, let&#8217;s live in the present. Here&#8217;s what we got into in today&#8217;s show:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">The blisteringly hot EU startup market</a>: You can raise money anywhere, but you might want to do it in Europe, where VCs are putting acre-feet of capital to work this year. Hours before the taping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/index-ventures-trio-of-new-funds-leads-to-3-billion-and-more-tiktok/">Index Ventures announced a $3 billion trio of funds</a> (and TikTok strategy?), basically solidifying our earlier reporting.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/07/20/bitcoin-exchange-led-by-worlds-richest-crypto-billionaire-raises-record-900-million/?sh=68c754844e33">huge round for crypto trading house FTX</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">OpenSea raising again</a>: Regardless of whether or not you are paying attention to the crypto market today, investors are still firing capital at startups in the space at an eye-catching pace.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">Duolingo&#8217;s first IPO price range</a>: It&#8217;s a good-news week for consumer-focused, edtech startups, since the public markets will finally get a taste of a non-enterprise sector startup. Plus, Duolingo&#8217;s upcoming finance event could lead to them finally bolstering areas <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">like speech, cultural norms and fluency.</a></li>
<li>From the world of funding rounds, we had notes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">on Sololearn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/">Numerade</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/newcampus-wants-to-train-the-first-time-managers-within-southeast-asias-tech-giants/">NewCampus</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/mural-raises-50m-series-c-after-tripling-its-arr-in-the-last-year/#:~:text=This%20morning%20Mural%2C%20a%20startup,at%20more%20than%20%242%20billion.">Mural</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/spreadsheet-com-wants-to-put-apps-in-your-spreadsheet/">Spreadsheet.com</a> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/online-checkout-startup-bolt-valued-at-4-billion?utm_source=ti_app">and Bolt</a>. The conversation ran into some fresh corners, such as how a company raised less than its preceding round but 4x&#8217;d its valuation and if we should bite-size all learning.</li>
<li>And we chatted about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse leaving beta</a>. Live on Twitter spaces. What can you do?</li>

					<description><![CDATA['At each layer of your growth model, you don't want to just be relying on ads or just be relying on SEO or just be relying on email marketing … you really want to have your eggs in multiple baskets.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your startup might rely on clever growth tactics to get off the ground, but you need more than spreadsheets if you want to turn viral spikes into a real business. You need a qualitative growth model to guide the strategy that you can use to tell your story to your team and investors.</p>
<p>Growth marketing expert Susan Su sat down with us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising this month to share pointers for young companies that are trying to raise money after initial market traction. In the presentation below, she <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">maps out a growth strategy from seed through Series A and B rounds and details how your milestones, budgets, investor updates and other measures change as you advance.</span></p>

<p>Formerly a strategic growth adviser to companies at Sound Ventures, a growth marketing lead focused on startups at Stripe, and the first hire and head of growth at Reforge, Su <a href="https://susanfsu.medium.com/why-and-how-im-dedicating-my-career-to-climate-change-210457421b34">just became</a> a partner investing in climate tech for early-stage fund Toba Capital. She also writes a <a href="https://climatemoney.substack.com/p/top-climate-investors">popular newsletter</a> on climate investing and runs a six-week course for other investors on the topic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more about growth, and how to talk about it with investors, from her presentation:</p>
<blockquote><p>So here&#8217;s a sample qualitative growth model that I built for one of our portfolio companies with some modifications for anonymity. At the bottom, we have our linear inputs that form the foundation of awareness &#8212; in other words, traffic or leads that feed into our growth machine.</p>
<p>Once those leads come in, we have our acquisition loops, working to turn that non-repeatable spiky linear traffic (aka TechCrunch traffic, if you get so lucky as to be written up in TechCrunch) into scalable, repeatable acquisition. You cannot repeat the TechCrunch effect.</p>
<p>For this sample business, I happened to spec out five different acquisition loops — I was really ambitious. Many companies will struggle to identify this many. But the key to being able to scale is to have multiple viable acquisition loops, not just one single thing that works.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paystone provides electronic payments and customer engagement technology to businesses, particularly those that provide services.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.paystone.com">Paystone</a>, a payments and integrated software company, secured another strategic investment this year, this time $23.8 million ($30 million CAD) from Crédit Mutuel Equity, the private equity arm of Crédit Mutuel Alliance Fédérale.</p>
<p>The Canada-based company got its start in 2008 as the payment processing company Zomaron, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191107005392/en/Zomaron-Acquires-DataCandy-Rebrands-Paystone-North-American">rebranded itself as Paystone</a> in 2019. Today it provides electronic payments and customer engagement technology to businesses, particularly those that provide services, CEO Tarique Al-Ansari told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Paystone is on a mission to help businesses grow, and we were enthralled by their commitment to that mission and their focus on service-oriented verticals,” said Léa Perge, investor at Crédit Mutuel Equity in Canada, via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While most of the company’s peers focus on product companies, Al-Ansari saw how underserved the service side was: their needs are different, and unlike retail, aren’t looking to sell online. Rather, they need an online presence and digital marketing to engage with customers, but their focus is being findable and having content that tells people why they should do business with them.</p>
<p>Paystone provides the marketing through content, help with reviews and with loyalty and rewards programs. However, rather than reward for spending, Paystone rewards for behavior. Refer a friend, get a reward. Write a review, get a reward. Al-Ansari calls it “payments as a benefit.” Referrals and reviews are how businesses become more findable, and the more content that&#8217;s out there, the more it helps people consider the business trustworthy, he added.</p>
<p>The new funding gives Canada-based Paystone total funds raised in 2021 of $78.8 million in a mix of debt and equity. It raised $54.9 million in January, funds that were barely touched as of yet, Al-Ansari said.</p>
<p>Though he wasn’t actively seeking new funds, Al-Ansari had been speaking with Crédit Mutuel Equity, which used to be CIC Capital Canada, prior to the pandemic, and their deal was put on hold.</p>
<p>Crédit Mutuel Equity came back with similar interest, and taking into account the kind of talent Paystone wanted to go after and its acquisition strategy — the company has already acquired five companies — Al-Ansari decided to take the additional funds. He said it gives the company options to hire more and double down on building the company, as well as enough capital to look for more acquisitions.</p>
<p>This year, Paystone entered the U.S. market for the first time and will do a proper launch later this year. The company has over 30,000 merchant locations on its platform throughout North America, and Al-Ansari expects that to grow by 5,000 this year. The company has 150 employees currently, and another 50 are expected to come on board by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition, Al-Ansari expects growth to accelerate for the rest of the year. The company processes around $6 billion in credit card payments and is on track to bring in $55.7 million in revenue this year. It is cash flow positive, residuals from the company’s origins of being bootstrapped, he said.</p>
<p>“We want to become the go-to destination for service businesses to set up a digital presence to accept payments and provide loyalty and rewards,” Al-Ansari said. “We will do this by solidifying our market position and growing our platform with the tools that customers want.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open-source framework startup <a href="https://serverless-stack.com">Serverless Stack</a> announced Friday that it raised $1 million in seed funding from a group of investors that includes Greylock Partners, SV Angel and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Jay V and Frank Wang in San Francisco, and they were part of Y Combinator’s 2021 winter batch.</p>
<p>Serverless Stack’s technology enables engineers to more easily build full-stack serverless apps. CEO V said he and Wang were working in this space for years with the aim of exposing it to a broader group of people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While tooling around in the space, they determined that the ability to build serverless apps was not getting better, so they joined Y Combinator to hone their idea on how to make the process easier.</p>
<p>Here’s how the technology works: The open-source framework allows developers to test and make changes to their applications by directly connecting their local machines to the cloud. The problem with what V called an “old-school process” is that developers would upload their apps to the cloud, wait for it to run and then make any changes. Instead, Serverless Stack connects directly to the cloud for the ability to debug applications locally, he added.</p>
<p>Since its launch six months ago, Serverless Stack has grown to over 2,000 stars on GitHub and was downloaded more than 60,000 times.</p>
<p>Dalton Caldwell, managing director of YC, met V and Wang at the cohort and said he was “super impressed” because the pair were working in the space for a long time.</p>
<p>“These folks are experts — there are probably just half a dozen people who know as much as they do, as there aren’t that many people working on this technology,” Caldwell told TechCrunch. “The proof is in the pudding, and if they can get people to adopt it, like they did on GitHub so far, and keep that community engagement, that is my strongest signal of staying power.”</p>
<p>V has earmarked the new funding to expand the team, including hiring engineers to support new use cases.</p>
<p>Serverless initially gravitated toward specific use cases — APIs are now allowing its community to chime in and it is using that as a guide, V said. It recently announced more of a full-stack use case for building out APIs with a database and also building out the front end frameworks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, V’s roadmap includes building out more tools with a vision of getting Serverless Stack to the point where a developer can come on with an idea and take it all the way to an IPO using his platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why we want the community to drive the roadmap,&#8221; V told TechCrunch. “We are focused on what they are building and when they are in production, how they are managing it. Eventually, we will build out a dashboard to make it easier for them to manage all of their applications.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s pretty easy for individuals to send money back and forth, and there are lots of cash apps from which to choose. On the commercial side, however, one business trying to send $100,000 the same way is not as easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paystand.com/about">Paystand</a> wants to change that. The Scotts Valley, California-based company is using cloud technology and the Ethereum blockchain as the engine for its Paystand Bank Network that enables business-to-business payments with zero fees.</p>
<p>The company raised $50 million Series C funding led by NewView Capital, with participation from SoftBank’s SB Opportunity Fund and King River Capital. This brings the company’s total funding to $85 million, Paystand co-founder and CEO Jeremy Almond told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During the 2008 economic downturn, Almond’s family lost their home. He decided to go back to graduate school and did his thesis on how commercial banking could be better and how digital transformation would be the answer. Gleaning his company vision from the enterprise side, Almond said what Venmo does for consumers, Paystand does for commercial transactions between mid-market and enterprise customers.</p>
<p>“Revenue is the lifeblood of a business, and money has become software, yet everything is in the cloud except for revenue,” he added.</p>
<p>He estimates that almost half of enterprise payments still involve a paper check, while fintech bets heavily on cards that come with 2% to 3% transaction fees, which Almond said is untenable when a business is routinely sending $100,000 invoices. Paystand is charging a flat monthly rate rather than a fee per transaction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181273" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181273" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2181273" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png" alt="" width="1024" height="891" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=768,668 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=680,592 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Paystand-platform.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181273" class="wp-caption-text">Paystand&#8217;s platform. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paystand</p></div></p>
<p>On the consumer side, companies like Square and Stripe were among the first wave of companies predominantly focused on accounts payable and then building business process software on top of an existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>Paystand’s view of the world is that the accounts receivables side is harder and why there aren’t many competitors. This is why Paystand is surfing the next wave of fintech, driven by blockchain and decentralized finance, to transform the $125 trillion B2B payment industry by offering an autonomous, cashless and feeless payment network that will be an alternative to cards, Almond said.</p>
<p>Customers using Paystand over a three-year period are able to yield average benefits like 50% savings on the cost of receivables and $850,000 savings on transaction fees. The company is seeing a 200% increase in monthly network payment value and customers grew two-fold in the past year.</p>
<p>The company said it will use the new funding to continue to grow the business by investing in open infrastructure. Specifically, Almond would like to reboot digital finance, starting with B2B payments, and reimagine the entire CFO stack.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted something like this to exist for 20 years,” Almond said. “Sometimes it is the unsexy areas that can have the biggest impacts.”</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Jazmin Medina, principal at NewView Capital, will join Paystand’s board. She told TechCrunch that while the venture firm is a generalist, it is rooted in fintech and fintech infrastructure.</p>
<p>She also agrees with Almond that the B2B payments space is lagging in terms of innovation and has “strong conviction” in what Almond is doing to help mid-market companies proactively manage their cash needs.</p>
<p>“There is a wide blue ocean of the payment industry, and all of these companies have to be entirely digital to stay competitive,” Medina added. “There is a glaring hole if your revenue is holding you back because you are not digital. That is why the time is now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.taboola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taboola</a>, the company that operates a popular grid-based advertising and content recommendation network across media properties, today announced an acquisition to expand its reach further into e-commerce, its first big move since going public in June by way of a SPAC: It is paying $800 million in a combination of cash and stock to buy <a href="https://connexity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connexity</a>, a marketing technology company that operates an retail- and e-commerce-focused advertising network. Connexity has been owned by Symphony Technology Partners since 2011.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deal &#8212; coming in the form of $260 million from cash on hand, $300 million from committed debt financing and approximately $240 million through the issuance of ordinary shares to the seller &#8212; will supersize and further diversify Taboola, which currently has a <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TBLA:NASDAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> of about $1.9 billion (that&#8217;s according to Google Finance; Taboola says the share count is off and it&#8217;s actually $2.35 billion) and is in hot competition with another content recommendation network operator, Outbrain: The two were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/taboola-outbrain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to merge</a> operations but eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went their own ways</a>, and Outbrain itself <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/market/article/r1pynrdad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public this month</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taboola said it expects the combined company to have gross profit of over $500 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (ex- traffic acquisition costs, or TAC), with $185 million of adjusted EBITDA for the period, with both figures growing 20% in 2021 versus 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Connexity was originally called Shopzilla before <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/cms/digital-marketing/shopzilla-rebrands-as-connexity-026587.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranding</a>, and it has over the years amassed a number of related businesses, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/04/connexity-become-shopzilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Become.com</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/a-12-year-journey-ends-as-skimlinks-is-acquired-by-retail-marketing-platform-connexity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skimlinks</a> and <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/shopzilla-parent-connexity-acquires-pricegrabber/400812/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PriceGrabber</a>. (Even Connexity itself was an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140219005260/en/Shopzilla-Acquires-Connexity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition made by Shopzilla</a> when it was primarily a shopping search engine.) Together, it has helped the company build out what has become a sizable network focused around the business of e-commerce.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taboola and Outbrain call off their $850M merger&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/embed/#?secret=xP2GBys9nN" data-secret="xP2GBys9nN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">While Taboola focuses on content recommendations and advertising that runs alongside that, and Connexity is more squarely focused on the business of e-commerce, the two have something in common. They both position themselves as viable alternatives to the big players in advertising and discovery, giving publishers and retailers another way of making revenues and finding new customers without selling out data and a cut to the Googles, Facebooks and Amazons of this world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While keeping the landscape competitive and providing viable alternatives to beleaguered publishers sounds like a noble enough effort, there are of course potential drawbacks. Taboola&#8217;s approach has long incurred a lot of criticism for disseminating click-bait and other garbage links, and some might have an issue with the concept of a deeper move into e-commerce and selling merchandise along side that. Some in the media industry (and within the world of journalism in particular) have long aimed to keep commercial and other vested interests at arms&#8217; length from its content, and so it will be worth watching to see how and if that effort shifts as publishers continue to look for profit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adam Singolda, the CEO and co-founder of Taboola, very much understands the challenges that publishers face, and he sees his company as building solutions to address that. He told TechCrunch that when Taboola went public, part of its sell to investors was that it would move into newer &#8220;types&#8221; of recommendations, covering new segments, that would also further scale the bigger operation, and this is a part of that strategy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We believe the future of the open web is e-commerce,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taboola today has 9,000 digital property partners, 13,000 direct advertisers and 500 million daily active users on its platform, where publishers can use the content recommendation format to recirculate their own content as well as that of other publishers and advertisers on the Taboola network.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Connexity&#8217;s part, it covers various activities like affiliate links, influencer marketing, in-stream advertising, shopping search ads and more. Its customers include 1,600 direct merchants, and 6,000 publishers (Walmart, Wayfair, Skechers, Macy’s, eBay and Otto are some of the most high-profile of these). And in total, it says its network has some 40,000 retail-oriented publishers that can select from a pool of 750 million product offers, and an audience of 100 million shoppers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And in a very fragmented e-commerce world rife with challenges in keeping online consumers&#8217; attention, it says its various activities have generated over 800 million shopping leads, and in 2020, more than $2 billion in sales for its customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is still a relatively small part of the pie, though; eMarketer estimates that the e-commerce media market is worth some $35 billion in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Added to that, Taboola&#8217;s bet is that the publishers it already works with are going to be getting deeper into this space as part of their own drive to maximize more revenues per visitor/reader and make their own business models more viable (alongside diversifying into paid content, paywalls, alternative advertising formats like sponsored content, events and so on).</p>

<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Sixty-two percent of U.S. publishers expect e-commerce to be one of their biggest revenue channels,&#8221; Singolda said. &#8220;I strongly believe every publisher&#8217;s leadership these days have e-commerce as a top three thing they want to get into in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connexity is a fairly multichannel offering today &#8212; a byproduct of all the acquisitions it has made into adjacent technologies &#8212; and Taboola plans to keep it all, with &#8220;massive cross sell and upselling opportunities, bringing e-eommerce to every publisher on the open web, driving higher yields, going global with e-commerce, empowering editorial teams what to write about around e-commerce,&#8221; Singolda said.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>Connexity on its own is a substantial business, and the shift to more e-commerce in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic has put a focus on the different tools it has in its armory to capture attention and convert ordinary site visitors into browsers and then into shoppers. It says that in 2019 it generated $151 million of revenue, $63 million of ex-TAC gross profit and $28 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2019, with that figure increasing to $172 million of revenue, $78 million of ex-TAC gross profit and $38 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares in Zomato, a Gurgaon-based food delivery company and first of India’s consumer tech startups to go public, closed up 65% in its debut day of trading in Mumbai, delivering a key insight into the appetite investors have for the world&#8217;s second largest internet market&#8217;s burgeoning startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Zomato’s shares traded all day above the issue price of 76 Indian rupees ($1) and surged as high as 138.9 Indian rupees ($1.87). The 12-year-old firm ended day one of trading on BSE in Mumbai at 125.8 Indian rupees ($1.69), securing a market cap of $13.2 billion, up from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">$5.4 billion valuation</a> it attained in private markets during the startup’s fundraise earlier this year.</p>
<p>The startup’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">$1.3 billion initial public offering</a> was 40 times subscribed last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday&#8217;s milestone of Zomato has equally been significant for the rest of the industry as startup founders and investors closely watched the firm&#8217;s stock performance. India’s Twitter timeline on Friday was flooded with celebratory messages from industry colleagues.</p>

<p>Ashish Dave, India head of Mirae Asset, a backer of Zomato, said the listing and performance of Zomato today have delivered the missing piece of liquidity in Indian startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;This validates that we can generate large IPOs, which then makes our startups more attractive for global LPs. It also gives Indian investors a chance to participate in the India tech journey rather than watching it from sidelines,&#8221; he told TechCrunch, adding that retail investors of this generation will finally find a way to get in on the action with the brands they recognize and have grown up with.</p>

<p>Zomato chief executive Deepinder Goyal was quick to reciprocate. In a blog post, Goyal wrote, “today is a big day for us. A new Day Zero. But we couldn’t have gotten here without the incredible efforts of India’s entire internet ecosystem. Jio’s prolific growth has set all of us up for unprecedented scale. Flipkart, Amazon, Ola, Uber, Paytm – have also over the years, collectively laid the railroads that are enabling companies like ours to build the India of the future.”</p>
<p>“They say it takes a village to raise a child, and we are no exception. Hundreds of people have selflessly played a part in making Zomato what it is today.”</p>
<p>Indian tech startups have raised a record amount of capital this year as some high-profile investors have doubled down in the South Asian market. Swiggy, Zomato&#8217;s chief rival in India, said earlier this week it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">raised $1.25 billion</a> from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Prosus, among others, at a valuation of $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>A handful of other firms are also preparing to publicly list within a few months. Financial services startups Paytm and MobiKwik <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">filed for their initial public offerings</a> earlier this month. Online insurance aggregator Policybazaar is expected to file its paperwork within a few weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know whether we will succeed or fail – we will surely, like always, give it our best. But I hope that the fact that we are here, inspires millions of Indians to dream bigger than we ever have, and build something way more incredible than what we can dream of,&#8221; wrote Goyal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.kitchenful.com">Kitchenful</a>, a new German startup backed by Y Combinator that wants to make it easier to cook at home by taking care of menu ideas and grocery shopping. The service is currently available in early access in Germany, with a focus on Berlin and Munich.</p>
<p>When you sign up to Kitchenful, you first have to set your preferences and goals. You can choose vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free and gluten-free options, but you can also focus on low-carbs recipes, a diet focused on healthy fats, etc.</p>
<p>After that, you get a meal plan for the coming week. You can review and customize each meal. For instance, if you plan to have guests, you can add a couple of persons to your Tuesday dinner. You can also remove vegetables if you usually buy your vegetables at a farmers&#8217; market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once you’re ready to order, a virtual grocery basket is automatically generated for the user. You can review, add something that isn’t on the list, such as household items, and confirm.</p>
<p>Kitchenful then transfers your list of items to a major supermarket near you. The startup doesn’t fulfill orders directly — they rely on partners for that part of the process. That’s why Kitchenful describes itself as a grocery concierge service.</p>
<p>“Our main revenue stream is a concierge fee which we collect directly from our users for creating personalized weekly menus, handling the basket creation process, providing personalized cooking instructions for the recipes as well as leftover ideas. Additionally, we receive a commission from our supermarket partners per generated order,” Kitchenful co-founder and CEO Christian Schiller told me.</p>
<p>This isn’t Schiller’s first experience in food delivery. He previously spent four years as vice president of Product at <a href="https://www.hellofresh.com">HelloFresh</a>, a popular meal-kit company.</p>
<p>Kitchenful is just getting started. It has raised $1 million from Y Combinator, N26 co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf, Souq co-founder Samih Toukan, Highsnobiety’s David Fischer, DurstExpress MD Maik Ludewig and Mendeley co-founder Victor Henning.</p>
<p>The company has established partnerships with REWE in Germany, and Walmart and Kroger in the U.S. By partnering with supermarkets, Kitchenful can offer a greater variety of products at supermarket prices.</p>
<p>It’s a different take on meal kits, with a different approach to logistics, so it’s going to be interesting to see if Kitchenful becomes a popular alternative to both grocery delivery and meal-kit services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is rolling out three major upgrades including automatic lanes changes and towing support to its hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and making it available in six vehicles, including the 2022 all-new GMC Hummer EV pickup truck.</p>
<p>While GM has steadily improved Super Cruise since its introduction in 2017, for years it has been limited to its luxury Cadillac brand. The improvements and additional vehicles mark the automaker&#8217;s willingness — and perhaps readiness — to sell owners of its Chevrolet- and GMC-branded pickup trucks on the technology.</p>
<p>When GM launched Super Cruise, it was only available in one Cadillac model — the full-size CT6 sedan — and restricted to divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand where Super Cruise would be available. Now the system can be activated on more than 200,000 miles of roads in the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And GM is planning to expand even further. By 2023, GM aims to bring Super Cruise to 22 vehicles, including the upcoming EVs Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer SUV.</p>
<p>The company said Friday it is adding automatic lane changes that function without a driver prompt to Super Cruise. This feature in the enhanced Super Cruise will be available in the 2022 Cadillac Escalade, Cadillac CT4, Cadillac CT5, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Hummer EV Pickup and GMC Sierra. GM has also developed and will launch a new feature that will allow drivers to engage the hands-free assistance system while trailering their boat or camper. This trailering feature will be available only in 2022 model year vehicles that have towing capability. Finally, GM has upgraded its in-car navigation to show drivers the highways where Super Cruise can be used.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM CEO Mary Barra wants to sell personal autonomous vehicles using Cruise&#8217;s self-driving tech by 2030&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/gm-ceo-mary-barra-wants-to-sell-personal-autonomous-vehicles-using-cruises-self-driving-tech-by-2030/embed/#?secret=mp5lCoBTnN" data-secret="mp5lCoBTnN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>The automatic lane change feature in Super Cruise will still require the driver to keep their eyes on the road. When the system is engaged, the driver <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/gm-adds-automated-lane-changes-to-its-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system/">no longer needs to engage</a> the turn signal to indicate a desire to change lanes. Instead, the system, if engaged, will make the lane change on its own after alerting the driver. The system will move the vehicle to the other lane to pass a slower vehicle.</p>
<p>The driver-prompted automatic lane change will be the default when the vehicle is towing a boat, camper or trailer.</p>
<p>All of these upgrades are possible thanks to GM&#8217;s newish digital vehicle platform called VIP, or vehicle intelligent platform, which provides more electrical bandwidth and data processing power and enabled engineers to add to Super Cruise&#8217;s capabilities. Vehicles equipped with this VIP electrical architecture can add features Super Cruise via over-the-air software updates. That means certain 2021 models, specifically the Cadillac Escalade, will get these new upgrades.</p>
<p>There are a couple of vehicles, namely the 2022 Chevrolet Bolt EUV, that have a different version of Super Cruise because it is not equipped with VIP. As a result, the Bolt EUV won&#8217;t get these upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey confirmed to investors that bitcoin will be a &#8220;big part&#8221; of the company&#8217;s future, as he sees opportunities to integrate the cryptocurrency into existing Twitter products and services, including commerce, subscriptions and other new additions like the Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a>.</p>
<p>Dorsey has been a staunch bitcoin advocate for years, but how it would be put into action on Twitter&#8217;s platform had not yet been spelled out in detail. However, Dorsey has often publicly touted the cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/jack-dorsey-says-this-is-what-inspires-him-the-most-about-bitcoin.html">saying</a> it reminds him of the &#8220;early days of the internet&#8221; and that there wasn&#8217;t &#8220;anything more important&#8221; in his lifetime for him to work on.</p>
<p>More recently, Dorsey launched a $23.6 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/jack-dorsey-and-jay-z-invest-23-6-million-to-fund-bitcoin-development/">bitcoin fund with Jay Z</a> and announced <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765941904941061">plans</a> to lead his other company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/square-is-building-a-decentralized-finance-business-for-bitcoin.html">Square into the decentralized financial services</a> market by way of bitcoin. Square also this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">acquired</a> a majority stake in Jay-Z&#8217;s TIDAL music service with an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tidal-stake-square/squares-297-million-deal-for-jay-zs-music-service-tidal-may-bring-blockchain-to-masses-idUSKBN2AW1N8">eye toward how blockchain</a> technologies and cryptocurrencies could change the music business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Dorsey also dubbed bitcoin one of three key trends for Twitter&#8217;s future, along with AI and decentralization &#8212; the latter which Twitter is pursuing through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/">its &#8220;Bluesky&#8221; initiative</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter’s decentralized future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/embed/#?secret=t4CBIV0crZ" data-secret="t4CBIV0crZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He touted bitcoin to investors on Twitter&#8217;s second quarter earnings call, saying it could help the company move faster in terms of its product expansions, while explaining that it was the &#8220;best candidate&#8221; to become the &#8220;native currency&#8221; of the internet. (Incidentally, Square&#8217;s $50 million in bitcoin purchased in 2020 was worth <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/squares-50m-bitcoin-buy-is-now-worth-253m">$253 million</a> by February 2021, and it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/square-reports-quarterly-revenue-that-falls-short-of-estimates?sref=gni836kR">purchased $170 million more</a> earlier this year.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh man, Jack Dorsey says he thinks Bitcoin is key to Twitter&#39;s future. Says it will &quot;ensure people and companies can freely trade goods and services anywhere on the planet&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Weprin (@alexweprin) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexweprin/status/1418331237157150722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;If the internet has a native currency, a global currency, we are able to able to move so much faster with products such as Super Follows, Commerce, Subscriptions, Tip Jar, and we can reach every single person on the planet because of that instead of going down a market-by-market-by-market approach,&#8221; Dorsey explained. &#8220;I think this is a big part of our future. I think there is a lot of innovation above just currency to be had, especially as we think about decentralizing social media more and providing more economic incentive. So I think it&#8217;s hugely important to Twitter and to Twitter shareholders that we continue to look at the space and invest aggressively in it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A Twitter rep confirmed this is the first time that Dorsey has spoken publicly about how Twitter could integrate bitcoin into its product lineup.</p>
<p>Dorsey also pointed out Twitter would not be alone in pursuing a crypto strategy, noting that Facebook was backing the digital currency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diem_(digital_currency)">Diem.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an obvious need for this, and appreciation for it. And I think that an open standard that&#8217;s native to the internet is the right way to go, which is why my focus and our focus eventually will be on bitcoin,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Overall, Twitter delivered strong earnings in a pandemic rebound, which saw the company posting its fastest revenue growth since 2014, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/twitter-twtr-earnings-q2-2021.html">according to CNBC</a>, which drove Twitter shares 9% higher in extended trading. The company pulled in Q2 revenue of $1.19 billion versus the $1.07 billion Wall Street expected, a majority ($1.05 billion) from its advertising business. It also saw earnings per share of 20 cents versus the 7 cents expected.</p>
<p>However, monetizable daily active users (mDAUs) &#8212; Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/twitter-is-slowly-perfecting-the-art-of-inventing-nonsensical-performance-metrics/">own invented metric</a> meant to fluff up often flat monthly user growth &#8212; were only at 206 million, an 11% year-over-year increase, while analysts were counting on 206.2 million. The company blamed the decline on a slower news cycle and end of shelter-in-place in many U.S. communities, which may have impacted Twitter usage during the quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arrival, the commercial electric vehicle company that is shaking up the traditional auto production line with AI-run microfactories, has been chosen to build electric buses for the City of Anaheim, California.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/fiscal-year-2019-low-or-no-emission-low-no-bus-program-projects">Federal Transportation Administration awarded Anaheim a $2 million grant</a> in 2019, and on Thursday the city&#8217;s transportation network announced the plan to partner with Arrival to achieve its goal of running California&#8217;s first all-electric bus fleet by 2025.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based company said Anaheim, which operates transit services to and from Disneyland and other local attractions, would be the first customer for its lightweight-battery bus. Arrival will start with five 40-foot buses, but did not respond to requests for more information about when the buses would launch and when to expect more additions to the fleet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The buses for Anaheim will be built in Arrival&#8217;s first U.S. microfactory in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Arrival&#8217;s other microfactory is in Charlotte, North Carolina, but the startup aims to have 31 microfactories all over the country by the end of 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arrival&#8217;s partnership with Anaheim Transportation Network also includes workforce development programs, according to a statement from the EV company. Local community colleges with electrical and mechanical engineering programs will be able to give eligible students internships to gain experience working with zero-emission transportation.</p>
<p>“The Arrival Bus will change the face of public transportation when it hits the roads,” said Mike Ableson, CEO of Arrival Automotive. “Our first order from a U.S. transit operator is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>Arrival, which recently went public via a SPAC merger, already has a number of notable  partnerships. Last year, it signed an agreement with UPS to roll out an initial order of 10,000 electric delivery vehicles through 2024. In May the company partnered with Uber to create a purpose-built EV for ride-hailing, and just last week, the company announced an <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leaseplan-arrival-sign-partnership-bring-060000630.html">initial order of 3,000 EVs from LeasePlan</a>, a Dutch &#8220;car-as-a-service&#8221; company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Tumblr community often refers to itself as the Wild West of the internet, and they&#8217;re not wrong. A <a href="https://threecheersmaka.tumblr.com/post/649025845330067456/tumblr-is-my-favourite-social-media-site-because">text post</a> with over 70,000 notes puts it best: &#8220;Tumblr is my favorite social media site because this place is literally uninhabitable for celebrities. No verification system, no algorithm that boosts their posts, it’s a completely lawless wasteland for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But like any social media company, Tumblr needs to keep itself afloat in order for its users to continue sharing esoteric fan art, incomprehensible shitposts, and overly personal diary entries hidden beneath a &#8220;Read More&#8221; button. Yesterday, Tumblr announced the limited beta test of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">Post+ subscription feature</a>, which &#8212; if all goes as planned &#8212; will eventually let Tumblr users post paywalled content to subscribers that pay them $3.99, $5.99 or $9.99 per month.</p>

<p>Tumblr is far from the first social media platform to seek revenue this way &#8212; Twitter is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">Tip Jar</a> feature, and this week, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">a tipping feature</a> too. Even Instagram is working on its own version of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follows that would let users create &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/">exclusive stories</a>.&#8221; But on a website with a community that prides itself as being a &#8220;completely lawless wasteland&#8221; for anyone with a platform (save for <a href="https://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/">Wil Wheaton</a> and <a href="https://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>, who are simply just vibing), the move toward paywalled content was not welcomed with open arms.</p>

<p>Monetization is a double-edged sword. It&#8217;s not considered uncool for a Tumblr artist to link to a third-party Patreon or Ko-fi site on their blog, where their most enthusiastic followers can access paywalled content or send them tips. So Post+ seems like an obvious way for Tumblr to generate revenue &#8212; instead of directing followers to other websites, they could build a way for fans to support creators on their own platform while taking a 5% cut. This isn&#8217;t unreasonable, considering that Twitter will take 3% revenue from its new monetization tools, while video-centric platforms like YouTube and Twitch take 30% and 50%, respectively. But Tumblr isn&#8217;t Twitter, or YouTube, or Twitch. Unlike other platforms, Tumblr doesn&#8217;t allow you to see other people&#8217;s follower counts, and no accounts are verified. It&#8217;s not as easy to tell whether the person behind a popular post has 100 followers or 100,000 followers, and the users prefer it that way. But Post+ changes that, giving bloggers an icon next to their username that resembles a Twitter blue check.</p>

<p>Tumblr rolled out Post+ this week to a select group of hand-picked creators, including <a href="https://kaijuno.tumblr.com/">Kaijuno</a>, a writer and astrophysicist. The platform announced Post+ on <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/">a new blog</a> specific to this product, rather than its established <a href="http://staff.tumblr.com">staff blog</a>, which users know to check for big announcements. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, as the most public user who was granted access, the 24-year-old blogger was the target of violent backlash from angry Tumblrites who didn&#8217;t want to see their favorite social media site turn into a hypercapitalist hellscape. When Kaijuno received death threats for beta testing Post+, Tumblr&#8217;s staff intervened and condemned harassment against Post+ users.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to hear about what you like, what you love, and what concerns you. Even if it’s not very nice. Tell us. We can take it,&#8221; Tumblr wrote on its <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/657366672276176896/tumblr-earlier-today-we-announced-to-the-press">staff blog</a>. &#8220;What we won’t ever accept is the targeted harassment and threats these creators have endured since this afternoon. [&#8230;] all they’re doing is testing out a feature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before making their post, a representative from Tumblr&#8217;s staff reached out to Kaijuno directly to check in on them regarding the backlash, but there&#8217;s only so much that Tumblr can do after a user has already been threatened for using their product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like the sacrificial lamb, because they didn&#8217;t announce Post+ beforehand and only gave it to a few people, which landed me in the crosshairs of a very pissed-off user base when I&#8217;m just trying to pay off medical bills by giving people the option to pay for content,&#8221; Kaijuno told TechCrunch. &#8220;I knew there&#8217;d be some backlash because users hate any sort of change to Tumblr, but I thought that the brunt of the backlash would be at the staff, and that the beta testers would be spared from most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do Tumblr users perceive monetization as such a threat? It&#8217;s not a question of whether or not it&#8217;s valuable to support creators, but rather, whether Tumblr is capable of hosting such a service. Multiple long-time, avid Tumblr users that spoke to TechCrunch referenced an incident in late 2020 when people&#8217;s blogs were being hacked by spam bots that posted incessant advertisements for a Ray-Ban Summer Sale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tumblr is not the most well-coded website. It&#8217;s easy to break features,&#8221; Kaijuno added. &#8220;I think anything involving trusting Tumblr with your financial information would have gotten backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tumblr users also worried about the implications Post+ could have on privacy &#8212; in the limited beta, Post+ users only have the ability to block people who are subscribed to their blog if they contact Tumblr support. In cases of harassment by a subscriber, this could leave a blogger vulnerable in a potentially dangerous situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahead of our launch to all U.S.-based creators this fall, Post+ will allow creators to block subscribers directly,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Still, the Extremely Online Gen Z-ers who now make up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/?tpcc=ECTW2020">48% of Tumblr</a> know that they can&#8217;t expect the platform to continue existing if it doesn&#8217;t pull in enough money to pay for its staff and server fees. In 2018, Tumblr lost <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-lost-a-third-of-its-users-after-porn-ban">almost one-third</a> of its monthly page views after all NSFW content was banned &#8212; since then, the platform&#8217;s monthly traffic has remained relatively stagnant.</p>

<p>A former Tumblr employee told TechCrunch that the feature that became Post+ started out as a tip jar. But higher-ups at Tumblr &#8212; who do not work directly with the community &#8212; redirected the project to create a paywalled subscription product.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a Tip Jar would be a massive improvement,&#8221; said the creator behind the Tumblr blog <a href="https://normal-horoscopes.tumblr.com/">normal-horoscopes</a>. Through the core audience they developed on Tumblr, they make a living via Patreon, but they don&#8217;t find Post+ compelling for their business. &#8220;External services [like Patreon] have more options, more benefits, better price points, and as a creator I get to choose how I present them to my audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a paywalled subscription service is different in the collective eyes of Tumblr. For a site that thrives on fandom, creators that make fan art and fanfiction worry that placing this derivative work behind a paywall &#8212; which Post+ <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/post/657323537298833408/hi-there-as-you-might-have-noticed-were#notes">encourages</a> them to do &#8212; will land them in legal trouble. Even Archive of Our Own, a major fanfiction site, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072622/fanfic-ao3-free-speech-censorship-fandom">prohibits its users</a> from linking to sites like Patreon or Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Built-in monetization attracts businesses, corporate accounts, people who are generally there to make money first and provide content second,&#8221; said normal-horoscopes. &#8220;It changes the culture of a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Across Tumblr, upset users are rallying for their followers to take Post+&#8217;s <a href="https://tumblr.survey.fm/post-feedback-form">feedback survey</a> to express their frustrations. The staff welcomes this.</p>

<p>&#8220;As with any new product launch, we expect our users to have a healthy discussion about how the feature will change the dynamics of how people use Tumblr,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Not all of this feedback will be positive, and that’s OK. Constructive criticism fuels how we create products and ultimately makes Tumblr a better place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tumblr&#8217;s vocal community has been empowered over the years to question whether it&#8217;s possible for a platform to establish new revenue streams in a way that feels organic. The protectiveness that Tumblr&#8217;s user base feels for the site &#8212; despite their lack of faith in staff &#8212; sets it apart from social media juggernauts like Facebook, which can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">put e-commerce front and center</a> without much scrutiny. But even three years after the catastrophic porn ban, it seems hard for Tumblr to grow without alienating the people that make the social network unique.</p>
<p>Platforms like Reddit and Discord have remained afloat by selling digital goods, like coins to reward top posters, or special emojis. Each company&#8217;s financial needs are different, but Tumblr&#8217;s choice to monetize with Post+<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> highlights the company&#8217;s lack of insight into its own community&#8217;s wishes.</span></p>
