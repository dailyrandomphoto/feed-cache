										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.webiny.com/">Webiny</a>, an early stage startup that launched in 2019 with an open source, serverless CMS, had also developed a framework to help build the CMS, and found that customers were also interested in that to help build their own serverless apps. Today, Webiny announced a $3.5 million seed round to continue developing both pieces.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s venture fund M12 led the round with participation from Samsung Next, Episode 1, Cota Capital and other unnamed investors. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/webiny-announces-347k-seed-to-build-open-source-serverless-cms/">previously raised $348,000</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Webiny founder Sven Al Hamad says that when the company launched, he had an inkling that serverless would be the future and started by building an open source serverless CMS, but then something interesting happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke to more than 300 companies, who had actually approached us and they also believed that the future is going to be built on top of serverless infrastructure. While they were intrigued by the CMS we built, they were more intrigued in terms of how we built it because they had tried serverless and they had a poor experience,&#8221; Al Hamad explained.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Webiny team was spending the vast majority of its time building an underlying serverless framework in order to build the CMS on top of that, and he began to realize that maybe they should be marketing and selling both the framework and the CMS.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was still a lot of interest for the CMS, but a lot of companies wanted both, being able to use the CMS for some of the content platforms, but also being able to build custom APIs on top, custom business logic, all on top of serverless,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Serverless and containers: Two great technologies that work better together&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/serverless-and-containers-two-great-technologies-that-work-great-together/embed/#?secret=0g0gToFPTB" data-secret="0g0gToFPTB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At that point, Al Hamad realized that his startup had two products and that&#8217;s where they stand today as they take on this new capital to help build out the company. While he is still working on on building a community and reports that he hosts a Slack community with close to a 1000 developers, the goal is to use this money to begin building commercial products on top of their open source offerings.</p>
<p>That will involve some sort of enterprise offering with management features for complex environments, single sign-on, better security and so forth.</p>
<p>Serverless is a way of delivering infrastructure in an automated way, so that the developer can concentrate on building the application without worrying about delivering the correct amount of resources. But it requires a very specific way of programming that involves writing functions and triggers. Webiny&#8217;s serverless framework is designed to help developers build these specialized apps and the related bits to make it all work.</p>
<p>The company currently has nine employees with plans to add about six more over the remainder of 2021. He says that diversity is top of mind, but there are challenges in a tight market for technical talent. &#8220;We are thinking openly about diversity, but the overall market in terms of the talent available is making it very very hard for us to find that balance,&#8221; he said. He says that there needs to be an effort across the entire system to train more diverse talent in STEM roles, but he will continue to try look for a diverse staff in spite of the challenges.</p>
<p>He says that his employees are spread out, but when it&#8217;s possible to be back in the office, he intends to make offices available where there are pools of people, while giving them the flexibility to decided when and if to come in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.onefinance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a startup that aims to bring “all-in-one banking” to the middle class, announced today that it has raised $40 million in a Series B round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ive Investment Company (the insurance giant’s investment arm) led the round, which included </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participation from Obvious Ventures, Foundation Capital, Core Innovation Capital and others. The financing brings One’s total raised since its 2019 inception to $66 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since making its product generally available in September of 2020, Northern California-based One has grown to have “hundreds of thousands” of customers, according to CEO and co-founder Brian Hamilton, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who previously co-founded PushPoint (which was </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pushpoint-mobile"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by</span></a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/capital-one"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stretched middle-income households and working families deal with financial stress on a daily basis and are largely unsupported by current offerings,” Hamilton said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can be viewed as a kind of a noisy market, and so this funding has been a good validation of the vision and kind of the products, in that we have been able to stand out in that market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 11 months, the startup has worked to enhance its core product offering, launching overdraft protection, an auto-save feature that rewards automatic savings contributions at 3.00% APY, cash flow-based credit lines and a credit builder product to help its customers build financial health. One claims that it has helped its users automatically save over $2 million collectively since its launch, a number that grows daily, according to Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also trying to change up how people share financial goals and responsibilities with individually configurable “Pockets” that it says can be “easily” shared with others and accessed via virtual and physical cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re doing really is to re-integrate and unify what is otherwise a pretty splintered financial life for middle income households and families that are attempting to manage finances on a daily, weekly and monthly basis,” Hamilton told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, he said, there have been a number of different fintech and bank products that people use to run their life “and they&#8217;re all starting to converge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded on the premise that traditional banking exists &#8220;on a system of fractured accounts and billions of dollars in hidden fees that leave customers living paycheck to paycheck despite steady incomes.&#8221; One says it is built on a “proprietary” technology core that aims to deliver </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saving, spending, sharing, budgeting and borrowing in a single account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody&#8217;s trying to do a piece of everything, but they all started doing one thing,” Hamilton said. “But it&#8217;s really hard to back into the others or to bolt them on afterwards if you didn&#8217;t begin with the end in mind, kind of on an integrated basis. So that is essentially what we set out to build with One, with the idea to reunify credit and debit and savings and reintegrate the sharing of money with other people so it didn&#8217;t have to be done on a one-off transactional basis through Venmo or PayPal or Zelle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s banking services are provided by Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC. The startup emphasizes that it’s a financial technology company, and “not a bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the new funding toward “fueling” customer growth, hiring and expanding its product offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Moldow, Foundation Capital general partner and One investor, said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenger banks such as Chime and Aspiration focus on a debit card offering to subprime customers who are looking for lower bank fees and access to paychecks sooner.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These customers are generally treated poorly by banks and charged a lot of fees because they don’t generate much revenue for banks outside of interchange fees on debit purchases with little disposable income,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real money made by banks, according to Moldow, is against mid-prime customers for both debit and lending.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These customers are harder to acquire because banks hate to lose them due to their large lifetime values,” he said. “One differs from the challenger banks in the market in that they have created a superior mobile banking experience for the 80% of the market that is not super prime or subprime. They have both a debit and credit offering and a vastly better user experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech is able to offer a user experience that is “materially” different from standard large bank offerings in that their back end infrastructure is a “modern” core and One is able to handle core checking, lending, money transfer and savings all on the same back end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means One can fully integrate those experiences (the aforementioned integrated offering “Pockets”).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This differs from traditional banks which have each of these systems on top of different tech stacks which prevents them from providing integrated offerings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, by not having brick and mortar branches, the company is able to offer lower fees, more points and rewards and higher savings rates, Moldow added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to The Exchange. Today we&#8217;re doing something fun with crypto.</p>
<p>Sure, we could write more about how insurtech valuations are under fresh pressure after <a href="https://investors.hippo.com/news/investor-news/news-details/2021/Hippo-Raises-Full-Year-Growth-Outlook-for-Total-Generated-Premium-Q2-Results-Reflect-Strategic-Progress-to-Scale-and-Diversify/default.aspx">Hippo&#8217;s Q2 earnings report</a> &#8212; we spoke to the company&#8217;s president yesterday; more to come &#8212; or the <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/global-equity/chinese-tech-shares-drop-on-new-rules-to-prevent-data-consumer-abuse-15744083">latest stock market movements</a> in China. There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/api-platform-postman-valued-at-5-6-billion-in-225-million-fundraise/">big rounds worth considering as well</a>. Roblox <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx">reported earnings this week</a>. And Monday.com&#8217;s <a href="https://ir.monday.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondaycom-announces-second-quarter-2021-results">earnings</a> pushed its shares sharply higher yesterday. There&#8217;s lots of interesting news to chew on.</p>
<p>But instead of all that, we&#8217;re digging back into crypto. Why? Because there are some rather bullish trends that indicate the world of blockchain is maturing and creating a raft of winning players</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Writing about crypto is always a little risky. Cybersecurity folks will complain that we&#8217;re abusing the phrase <em>crypto, </em>despite the fact that language always evolves. And Bitcoin maximalists aren&#8217;t going to find much below that underscores their core thesis that every coin not mentioned in Satoshi&#8217;s whitepaper is, in fact, a scam. Save your tweets, please.</p>
<p>But if you care more generally about the larger global cryptoeconomy, it&#8217;s time to imbibe some good news. Our goal is to highlight a few recent trends and then talk a little about what we might see coming from startups.</p>

Let&#8217;s get busy.</p>
<h2>Encouraging news from your local distributed ledger</h2>
<p>The Exchange finds rising NFT volumes bullish, and we have a new thesis for what the value proposition is for such digital assets. The rising tide of mega-rounds for crypto exchanges belies not only the worldwide demand for access to crypto, but also sets the stage for a global cohort of stable, well-funded and trustworthy on-ramps to the crypto world &#8212; and, of course, more exchanges imply lower fees over time.</p>
<p>Non-exchange crypto fees are also bullish. And then there&#8217;s a wrinkle to the stablecoin game and what sort of economics things like USDC may command in time. We have notes from an interview with Circle to help us there.</p>
<h2>NFTs and the concept of joy</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone actually understands what the metaverse is. But the possibility that, in time, unique assets on particular chains &#8212; NFTs &#8212; will have a part to play in larger digital worlds seems like a reasonable conjecture. One can easily imagine life, as we all become Increasingly Online, leaning on human desires for scarcity as a method of showing status. NFTs will help meet that demand in certain digital ecosystems. Games, probably, though what we consider a game will also evolve as VR becomes more mainstream.</p>
<p>But that future is not here yet. So, what value are NFTs providing <em>today</em> that makes them potentially worthwhile? Joy.</p>

<p>Holoride’s VR gaming system for passengers caught our attention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">a few years back at CES</a> when we were given a ride in an Audi on a track and had the game react to the movement of the vehicle while we played. Well, the company is back and this time they demoed two games and threw off the shackles of the track for the real world.</p>
<p>We took a ride in an Audi with the Holoride system and again enjoyed video games while someone else drove. The company is currently courting developers to build games via their recently announced SDK and are partnering with automakers to make sure that the data they need from the car to make their games a reality is available. Watch the video above for the full story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Floods are devastating. They rip asunder communities, wipe out neighborhoods, force the evacuation of thousands of people every year, and recovering them can take years — assuming recovery is possible at all. <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/summary-stats">The U.S. government estimates</a> that floods in recent decades (exclusive of hurricanes and tropical storms) have caused an estimated $160 billion in damage and killed hundreds of people.</p>
<p>One would think that we should have a real-time model for where water is and where it is going around the world, what with all of those sensors on the ground and satellites in orbit. But we mostly don’t, instead relying on antiquated models that fail to take into account the possibilities of big data and big compute.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.floodmapp.com">FloodMapp</a>, a Brisbane, Australia-based startup, is aiming to wash out the old approaches to hydrology and predictive analytics and put in place a much more modern approach to help emergency managers and citizens know when the floods are coming — and what to do.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Juliette Murphy has spent a lifetime in the water resources engineering field, and saw first hand the heavy destruction that water can cause. In 2011, she watched as her friend’s home was submerged in the midst of terrible flooding. The “water went right over the peak of her house,” she said. Two years later in Calgary, she saw the same situation again: floods and fear as friends tried to determine whether and how to evacuate.</p>
<p>Those memories and her own professional career led her to think more about how to build better tools for disaster managers. She ultimately synced up with CTO and co-founder Ryan Prosser to build FloodMapp in 2018, raising $1.3 million AUD along with a matching grant.</p>
<p>The company’s premise is simple: we have the tools to build real-time flooding models today, but we just have chosen not to take advantage of them. Water follows gravity, which means that if you know the topology of a place, you can predict where the water will flow to. The challenge has been that calculating second-order differential equations at high resolution remains computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Murphy and Prosser decided to eschew the traditional physics-based approach that has been popular in hydrology for decades for a completely data-based approach that takes advantage of widely available techniques in machine learning to make those calculations much more palatable. “We do top down what used to be bottoms up,” Murphy said. “We have really sort of broken the speed barrier.” That work led to the creation of <a href="https://www.floodmapp.com/dash">DASH</a>, the startup’s real-time flood model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2191072" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191072" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191072" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Brisbane-2011.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="309" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191072" class="wp-caption-text">FloodMapp&#8217;s modeling of the river flooding in Brisbane. Image Credits: FloodMapp</p></div></p>
<p>Unlike typical tech startups though, FloodMapp isn’t looking to be its own independent platform. Instead, it interoperates with existing geographic information systems (GIS) like ESRI’s ArcGIS by offering a data layer that can be combined with other data streams to provide situational awareness to emergency response and recovery personnel. Customers pay a subscription fee for access to FloodMapp’s data layer, and so far, the company is working with the <a href="https://www.floodmapp.com/post/floodmapp-nowcast-provides-flood-modelling-in-real-time">Queensland Fire and Emergency Services</a> in Australia as well as the cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach in Virginia.</p>
<p>But it’s not just emergency services the startup is ultimately hoping to attract. Any company with physical assets, from telcos and power companies to banks and retail chains with physical stores could potentially be a customer of the product. In fact, FloodMapp is betting that the SEC will <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change-disclosures">mandate further climate change financial disclosures</a>, which could lead to a … flood of new business (I get <i>one</i> flood pun, okay, I get one).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2191074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg 3598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FloodMapp-Team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191074" class="wp-caption-text">FloodMapp&#8217;s team has expanded from its original two founders to a whole crop of engineering and sales personnel. Image Credits: FloodMapp</p></div></p>
<p>Murphy notes that “we are still in our early stages” and that the company is likely to raise further financing early next year as it gets through this year’s flood season and onboards several new customers. She hopes that ultimately, FloodMapp will “not only help people, but help our country change and adapt in the face of a changing climate.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/spotify-introduces-a-new-music-and-spoken-word-format-open-to-all-creators/">introduced</a> a new format that combined spoken word commentary with music, allowing creators to reproduce the  radio-like experience of listening to a DJ or music journalist who shared their perspective on the tracks they would then play. Today, the company is making the format, which it calls &#8220;Music + Talk,&#8221; available to global creators through its podcasting software Anchor.</p>
<p>Creators who want to offer this sort of blended audio experience can now do so by using the new &#8220;Music&#8221; tool in Anchor, which provides access to Spotify&#8217;s full catalog of 70 million tracks that they can insert into their spoken-word audio programs. Spotify has said this new type of show will continue to compensate the artist when the track is streamed, the same as it would elsewhere on Spotify&#8217;s platform. In addition, users can also interact with the music content within the shows as they would otherwise &#8212; by liking the song, viewing more information about the track, saving the song, or sharing it, for example.</p>
<p>The shows themselves, meanwhile, will be available to both free and Premium Spotify listeners. Paying subscribers will hear the full tracks when listening to these shows, but free users will only hear a 30-second preview of the songs, due to licensing rights.</p>
<p>The format is somewhat reminiscent of Pandora’s Stories, which was also a combination of music and podcasting,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/pandora-stories-launches-combining-music-and-podcasting-in-a-new-format/"> introduced in 2019</a>. However, in Pandora&#8217;s case, the focus had been on allowing artists to add their own commentary to music &#8212; like talking about the inspiration for a song &#8212; while Spotify is making it possible for anyone to annotate their favorite playlists with audio commentary.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aFhj3NqheJ0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Since launching last year, the product has been tweaked somewhat in response to user feedback, Spotify says. The shows now offer clearer visual distinction between the music and talk segments during an episode, and they include music previews on episode pages. To date, creators have produced &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of shows using the format, Spotify told TechCrunch, but the company isn&#8217;t providing exact numbers at this time.</p>
<p>The ability to create Music + Talk shows was previously available in select markets ahead of this global rollout, including in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the expansion, creators in a number of other major markets are now gaining access, including Japan, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Colombia. Alongside the expansion, Spotify&#8217;s catalog of Music + Talk original programs will also grow today, as new shows from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, India, Japan, and the Philippines will be added.</p>
<p>Spotify will also begin to more heavily market the feature with the launch of its own Spotify Original called &#8220;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0NdI3QfPXutB8oqZENmpJN">Music + Talk: Unlocked</a>,&#8221; which will offer tips and ideas for creators interested in trying out the format.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blumira.com/">Blumira</a> today announced it raised a $10.3 million Series A financing round. The Ann Arbor-based cybersecurity company says the capital will be used to expand its product offering, double its headcount to 80 employees, and grow its partnership program with managed service providers.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2018, seeks to provide enterprise-level security to medium-sized businesses through turn-key, cloud-based solutions. Blumira’s solution upends the traditional security information and event management market with a powerful suite of tools designed specifically for mid-market companies that’s relatively more affordable. According to Blumira, its product deploys quickly and gives these companies the security and threat monitoring ability of tools used by giant corporations.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the firm has raised $12.9 million since its founding in 2018. New investor Mercury led Blumira’s Series A with Managing Director Aziz Gilani joining Blumira’s board as a director. The Series A also included participation from Ten Eleven Ventures, enterprise angles, and existing investors of M25, Array Ventures, and Duo<br />
Security co-founder and angel investor Jon Oberheide.</p>
<p>“Having additional capital behind us accelerates our velocity and ability to execute our vision of democratizing the detection and response market,” said Steve Fuller, co-founder and CEO at Blumira. “We’ve built incredible momentum in just a few short years, and we’re thrilled to have the support of world-class investors as we work to make security operations simple, automated, affordable and accessible to organizations of all sizes.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Its technology automates how distributors and manufacturers create, execute and track rebates.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://enable.com/">Enable</a>, a startup developing a cloud-based software tool for business-to-business rebate management, announced Wednesday a $45 million Series B funding round.</p>
<p>The round is led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from existing investors Menlo Ventures and Sierra Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Including the new round, the company has raised a total of $62 million, which includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/">$13 million Series A</a> raised in 2020.</p>
<p>The company, which started in the U.K. and moved to San Francisco in 2020, was co-founded by Andrew Butt and Denys Shortt in 2015 but launched fully in 2016. Its technology automates how distributors and manufacturers create, execute and track rebates. These types of trading programs are a common industry practice and are relied on by distributors as a way to turn a profit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2nmmX21dgS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/">Enable raises $13M to help distributors, manufacturers and retailers manage rebates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enable raises $13M to help distributors, manufacturers and retailers manage rebates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/enable-raises-13m/embed/#?secret=2nmmX21dgS" data-secret="2nmmX21dgS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since raising its Series A last year, Butt, chief executive officer, moved to the Bay Area, grew its North American operations to 60 people, tripled revenue and more than tripled its customer base, he told TechCrunch. The new funding will be used for product innovation and building sales and go-to-market teams.</p>
<p>“The Series A was proving traction in the U.S. and Canada and gave us the ability to hire a U.S. leadership team,” he added. “When we saw that momentum, the market size was large and the opportunity was now getting bigger and bigger, we started scaling up the business.”</p>
<p>As customer needs changed and incentives were growing in terms of revenue and profitability, Enable saw that they were more critical to manage; the incentives needed to be more dynamic and easy to make targeted and personalized. In a sense, incentives have “gone from being blunt instruments to very sharp in size and volume,” Butt said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reaching the year over year revenue doubling was a milestone for the company, and his immediate next steps are to get a fully ramped team so Enable can continue on that growth trajectory. The market for incentives is big, but “there is no credible competition,” so the company is also working to build that distribution and sales team now, he added.</p>
<p>It was also over the past year that Butt met Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners, who, as part of the investment, joined Enable’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Jacobsohn had noticed Enable and asked for an introduction to the company when it hired Jerry Brooner as its president of global field operations. Jacobsohn was tracking Brooner’s next moves after leaving Scout, a Workday company, and the hire got his attention.</p>
<p>Enable checks all of the boxes Jacobsohn said he looks for in a company: strong CEO, a good team and good customer feedback — many of them were dissatisfied with the legacy software, he said.</p>
<p>“I also love companies going after a big market where there is no credible competition,” Jacobsohn added. “There is a lot of greenfield space here. What’s great about a player like that is they can come in, create a category and be the new generation cloud player. This isn’t something someone can wake up and start. You need deep domain expertise.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rapid Robotics announced a $12 million Series A all the way back in April 2021. Four months later, the Bay Area-based robotic manufacturing firm is back with a $36.7 million Series B, led by Kleiner Perkins and Tiger Global. The round, which also features existing investors NEA, Greycroft, Bee Partners and 468 Capital, brings the company’s total funding up to $54.2 million.</p>
<p>The funding values the startup at $192.5 million &#8212; an impressive figure for a firm that was raising its seed in 2020. The Series B is Rapid’s third (!) in less than a year, no doubt spurred on by the immense interest in robotics and automation being fueled by a seemingly endless global pandemic.</p>
<p>As companies look for alternatives to “non-essential” workers, investments in these technologies have only accelerated. Manufacturing bottlenecks throughout the pandemic have also brought into sharp focus the need for flexible and global production.</p>
<p>Rapid’s value prop is a Rapid Machine Operator (RMO) robot that can be deployed in a manufacturing setting in a matter of hours, without the need for programming and other robotics knowledge. The system is available under the RaaS (robotics as a service) model for $25,000 a year. The system is flexible and can be assigned various tasks &#8212; a nice feature for companies that can’t afford devoted systems.</p>
<p>“We hear a lot about the semiconductor shortage, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Contract manufacturers can’t produce gaskets, vials, labels — you name it,” CEO Jordan Kretchmer said in a release tied to the news. “I’ve seen cases where the inability to produce a single piece of U-shaped black plastic brought an entire auto line to a halt.”</p>
<p>Automotive is a target for Rapid, though the company notes that Bay Area-based health company TruePill is now employing its systems to fill and label prescription bottles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No code platforms have developed into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">a hot market</a>, and <a href="https://www.stackerhq.com/">Stacker</a>, a London-based no-code platform is attempting to bring the concept to a new level. Not only can you create a web application from a spreadsheet, you can pull data from a variety of sources to create a sophisticated business application automatically (although some tweaking may be required).</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $20 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from existing investors Initialized Capital, Y Combinator and Pentech. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $23 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Michael Skelly, CEO and co-founder at Stacker, says that the idea is to take key business data and turn it into a useful app to help someone do their job more efficiently. &#8220;[We enable] people in business to create apps to help them in their working life &#8212; so things like customer portals, internal tools and things that take the data they&#8217;re already using, often to run a process, and turn that into an app,&#8221; Skelly explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really think that in order to actually be useful for business, you need to be hooked into the data that a business cares about. And so we let people bring their spreadsheets, SQL databases, Salesforce data, bring all the data that they use to run their business, and automatically turn it into an app,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Once the company pulls that data in and creates an app, the user can begin to tweak how things look, but Stacker gives them a big head start toward creating something usable from the get-go, Skelly said.</p>
<p>Jennifer Li,  a partner at lead investor Andreessen Horowitz likes the startup&#8217;s approach to no code. &#8220;We’ve been watching the no-code space for a while, and Stacker stands apart from the rest because of its thoughtful product approach, allowing business operators to instantly generate a functional app that perfectly fits existing business processes,&#8221; she said <a href="https://blog.stackerhq.com/p/f41934f3-5795-4e00-9eec-d69d3c52ee8d/">in a blog post</a> announcing the funding round.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=8pkYih1eHz" data-secret="8pkYih1eHz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company currently has 19 employees with plans to put the new capital to work to reach 30-40 by the end of the year. Skelly sees building a diverse company as a key goal and is proactive and thoughtful about finding ways to achieve that. In fact, he has identified three ways to approach diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly is just making sure that we get a diverse pipeline of people. I really think that the ratio of the people you talk to is probably going to be the biggest indicator of the people you hire. Secondly we try to find ways we can hire people who are maybe further down their career profile, but [looking] to grow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and I think this is something that is not talked about enough, there are plenty of people who would like to get into programming roles, and who are under represented, and so we have members of our team who are converting from various non-technical roles to DevOps &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s just like a really great route to add to the overall pool [of diverse candidates],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is remote first with Skelly in London and his co-founder based in Geneva and they intend to stay that way. They founded the company in 2017 and originally created a different product that was much more complex and required a lot of hand holding before eventually concluding that making it simple was the way to go, They released the first version of the current product at the end of 2019.</p>
<p>The company has a big vision to be the software development tool for business units. &#8220;We really think that in the future just like everyone&#8217;s got email, a chat tool, a spreadsheet and a video conferencing tool nowadays, they will also have a software tool, where they write and run the custom software that they run their business on,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">T-Mobile has confirmed that millions of current and former customers had their information stolen in a data breach, following reports of a hack over the weekend.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/additional-information-regarding-2021-cyberattack-investigation">a statement</a>, T-Mobile, which has more than 100 million customers, said its preliminary analysis shows 7.8 million current postpaid T-Mobile customers had information taken in the data breach. The carrier said that some personal data on current and former postpaid was also taken, including customer names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license information for a &#8220;subset&#8221; of current and former postpay customers and prospective T-Mobile customers.</p>
<p>The company also said that 40 million records of former and prospective customers was taken, but that &#8220;no phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the company warned that approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile customer names, phone numbers, and account PINs were in fact compromised, and that customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were exposed. T-Mobile said it&#8217;s reset those customer PINs. T-Mobile said it was &#8220;recommending all postpaid customers&#8221; to proactively change their account PIN, which protects their accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/30/someone-hacked-jack-dorseys-own-twitter-account/">from SIM-swapping attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Vice reported <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million">this weekend</a> that T-Mobile was investigating a possible hack after a seller on a known criminal forum claimed to be in possession of millions of records. The seller told Vice that they had 100 million records on T-Mobile customers, which included customer account names, phone numbers, and the IMEI numbers of phones on the account.</p>
<p>T-Mobile warned that there could be more fallout to come, noting that it confirmed there was &#8220;some additional information from inactive prepaid accounts accessed through prepaid billing files,&#8221; but did not say what, only that it was not financial information.</p>
<p>This is the fifth time that T-Mobile was hacked in recent years, following incidents as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/03/t-mobile-call-records-data-breach/">recently as January</a> and other incidents <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/24/t-mobile-says-hackers-stole-customer-data-in-data-breach/">dating back to 2018</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dublin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/evervault-raises-3-2m-from-sequoia-kleiner-for-an-api-to-build-apps-with-privacy-baked-in/">Evervault</a>, a developer-focused security startup which sells encryption vis API and is backed by a raft of big name investors including the likes of Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins and Index Ventures, is coming out of closed beta today &#8212; announcing open access to its encryption engine.</p>
<p>The startup says some 3,000 developers are on its waitlist to kick the tyres of its encryption engine, which it calls E3.</p>
<p>Among &#8220;dozens&#8221; of companies in its closed preview are drone delivery firm Manna, fintech startup Okra, and healthtech company Vital. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Evervault says it&#8217;s targeting its tools at developers at companies with a core business need to collect and process four types of data: Identity &amp; contact data; Financial &amp; transaction data; </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Health &amp; medical data; and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Intellectual property.</span></p>
<p>The first suite of products it offers on E3 are called Relay and Cages; the former providing a new way for developers to encrypt and decrypt data as it passes in and out of apps; the latter offering a secure method &#8212; using trusted execution environments running on AWS &#8212; to process encrypted data by isolating the code that processes plaintext data from the rest of the developer stack.</p>
<p>Evervault is the first company to get a product deployed on Amazon Web Services&#8217; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/">Nitro Enclaves</a>, per founder Shane Curran.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nitro Enclaves are basically environments where you can run code and prove that the code that&#8217;s running in the data itself is the code that you&#8217;re meant to be running,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We were the first production deployment of a product on AWS Nitro Enclaves &#8212; so in terms of the people actually taking that approach we&#8217;re the only ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be news to anyone to say that data breaches continue to be a serious problem online. And unfortunately it&#8217;s sloppy security practices by app makers &#8212; or even a total lack of attention to securing user data &#8212; that&#8217;s frequently to blame when plaintext data leaks or is improperly accessed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Evervault&#8217;s fix for this unfortunate &#8216;feature&#8217; of the app ecosystem is to make it super simple for developers to bake in encryption via an API &#8212; taking the strain of tasks like managing encryption keys. (&#8220;Integrate Evervault in 5 minutes by changing a DNS record and including our SDK,&#8221; is the developer-enticing pitch on its <a href="https://evervault.com">website</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;At the high level what we&#8217;re doing&#8230; is we&#8217;re really focusing on getting companies from [a position of] not approaching security and privacy from any perspective at all &#8212; up and running with encryption so that they can actually, at the very least, start to implement the controls,&#8221; says Curran.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the biggest problems that companies have these days is they basically collect data and the data sort of gets sprawled across both their implementation and their test sets as well. The benefit of encryption is that  you know exactly when data was accessed and how it was accessed. So it just gives people a platform to see what&#8217;s happening with the data and start implementing those controls themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>With C-Suite executives paying increasing mind to the need to properly secure data &#8212; thanks to years of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/equifax-fine-ftc/">horrific data breach scandals</a> (and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/t-mobile-confirms-it-was-hacked-after-customer-data-posted-online/"> breach déjà vu</a>), and also because of updated data protection laws like Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/eu-hits-amazon-with-record-breaking-887m-gdpr-fine-over-data-misuse/">beefed up penalties</a> for lax security and data misuse &#8212; a growing number of startups are now pitching services that promise to deliver &#8216;data privacy&#8217;, touting tools they claim will protect data while still enabling developers to extract useful intel.</p>
<p>Evervault&#8217;s website also deploys the term &#8220;data privacy&#8221; &#8212; which it tells us it defines to mean that &#8220;no unauthorized party has access to plaintext user/customer data; users/customers and authorized developers have full control over who has access to data (including when and for what purpose); and, plaintext data breaches are ended&#8221;. (So encrypted data could, in theory, still leak &#8212; but the point is the information would remain protected as a result of still being robustly encrypted.)</p>
<p>Among a number of techniques being commercialized by startups in this space is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/duality-cybersecurity-16-million/">homomorphic encryption</a> &#8212; a process that allows for analysis of encrypted data without the need to decrypt the data.</p>
<p>Evervault&#8217;s first offering doesn&#8217;t go that far &#8212; although its &#8216;<a href="https://evervault.com/blog/manifesto">encryption manifesto</a>&#8216; notes that it&#8217;s keeping a close eye on the technique. And Curran confirms it is likely to incorporate the approach in time. But he says its first focus has been to get E3 up and running with an offering that can help a broad swathe of developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fully homomorphic [encryption] is great. The biggest challenge if you&#8217;re targeting software developers who are building normal services it&#8217;s very hard to build general purpose applications on top of it. So we take another approach &#8212; which is basically using trusted execution environments. And we worked with the Amazon Web Services team on being their first production deployment of their new product called Nitro Enclaves,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bigger focus for us is less about the underlying technology itself and it&#8217;s more about taking what the best security practices are for companies that are already investing heavily in this and just making them accessible to average developers who don&#8217;t even know how encryption works,&#8221; Curran continues. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we get the biggest nuance of Evervault vs some of these others privacy and security companies &#8212; we build for developers who don&#8217;t normally think about security when they&#8217;re building things and try to build a great experience around that&#8230; so it&#8217;s really just about bridging the gap between &#8216;the start of art&#8217; and bringing it to average developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time fully homomorphic encryption is probably a no-brainer for us but both in terms of performance and flexibility for your average developer to get up and running it didn&#8217;t really make sense for us to build on it in its current form. But it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re looking into. We&#8217;re really looking at what&#8217;s coming out of academia &#8212; and if we can fit it in there. But in the meantime it&#8217;s all this trusted execution environment,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Curran suggests Evervault&#8217;s main competitor at this point is open source encryption libraries &#8212; so basically developers opting to &#8216;do&#8217; the encryption piece themselves. Hence it&#8217;s zeroing in on the service aspect of its offering; taking on encryption management tasks so developers don&#8217;t have to, while also reducing their security risk by ensuring they don&#8217;t have to touch data in the clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re looking at those sort of developers &#8212; who&#8217;re already starting to think about doing it themselves &#8212; the biggest differentiator with Evervault is, firstly the speed of integration, but more importantly it&#8217;s the management of encrypted data itself,&#8221; Curran suggests. &#8220;With Evervault we manage the keys but we don&#8217;t store any data and our customers store encrypted data but they don&#8217;t store keys. So it means that even if they want to encrypt something with Evervault they never have all the data themselves in plaintext &#8212; whereas with open source encryption they&#8217;ll have to have it at some point before they do the encryption. So that&#8217;s really the base competitor that we see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously there are some other projects out there &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/tim-berners-lees-startup-inrupt-releases-solid-privacy-platform-for-enterprises/">Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s Solid project</a> and so on. But it&#8217;s not clear that there&#8217;s anybody else taking the developer-experience focused approach to encryption specifically. Obviously there&#8217;s a bunch of API security companies&#8230; but encryption through an API is something we haven&#8217;t really come across in the past with customers,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>While Evervault&#8217;s current approach sees app makers&#8217; data hosted in dedicated trusted execution environments running on AWS, the information still exists there as plaintext &#8212; for now. But as encryption continues to evolves it&#8217;s possible to envisage a future where apps aren&#8217;t just encrypted by default (Evervault&#8217;s <a href="https://evervault.com/blog/manifesto">stated mission</a> is to &#8220;encrypt the web&#8221;) but where user data, once ingested and encrypted, never needs to be decrypted &#8212; as all processing can be carried out on ciphertext.</p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption has unsurprisingly been called the &#8216;holy grail&#8217; of security and privacy &#8212; and startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/duality-cybersecurity-16-million/">Duality</a> are busy chasing it. But the reality on the ground, online and in app stores, remains a whole lot more rudimentary. So Evervault sees plenty of value in getting on with trying to raise the encryption bar more generally.</p>
<p>Curran also points out that plenty of developers aren&#8217;t actually doing much processing of the data they gather &#8212; arguing therefore that caging plaintext data inside a trusted execution environment can thus abstract away a large part of the risk related to these sort of data flows anyway. &#8220;The reality is most developers who are building software these days aren&#8217;t necessarily processing data themselves,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;They&#8217;re actually just sort of collecting it from their users and then sharing it with third party APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at a startup building something with Stripe &#8212; the credit card flows through their systems but it always ends up being passed on somewhere else. I think that&#8217;s generally the direction that most startups are going these days. So you can trust the execution &#8212; depending on the security of the silicon in an Amazon data center kind of makes the most sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the regulatory side, the data protection story is a little more nuanced than the typical security startup spin.</p>
<p>While Europe&#8217;s GDPR certainly bakes security requirements into law, the flagship data protection regime <em>also</em> provides citizens with a suite of access rights attached to their personal data &#8212; a key element that&#8217;s often overlooked in developer-first discussions of &#8216;data privacy&#8217;.</p>
<p>Evervault concedes that data access rights haven&#8217;t been front of mind yet, with the team&#8217;s initial focus being squarely on encryption. But Curran tells us it plans &#8212; &#8220;over time&#8221; &#8212; to roll out products that will &#8220;simplify access rights as well&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the future, <span class="il">Evervault</span> will provide the following functionality: Encrypted data tagging (to, for example, time-lock data usage); programmatic role-based access (to, for example, prevent an employee seeing data in plaintext in a UI); and, programmatic compliance (e.g. data localization),&#8221; he further notes on that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco-based Postman, which operates a collaborative platform for developers to help them build, design, test and iterate their APIs, said on Wednesday it has raised $225 million in a new financing round that values it at $5.6 billion, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/api-platform-postman-nabs-150m-series-c-on-2b-valuation/">up from $2 billion a year ago</a>.</p>
<p>The startup’s new financing round &#8212; a Series D &#8212; was led by existing investor New York-headquartered Insight Partners. New investors including Coatue, Battery Ventures, and BOND also participated in the new round, which brings total raise across rounds to over $430 million. Existing investors Nexus Venture Partners and CRV also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>APIs provide a way for developers to connect their applications to other internal and external applications. But it’s a space that until the past decade not many firms have attempted to streamline. (Developers relied &#8212; and many continue to do so &#8212; on open source CLI tools such as curl and HTTPie. That said, <a href="https://www.postman.com">Postman</a> now has a number of competitors including Stoplight, and A16z and Tiger Global-backed Kong.)</p>
<p>Abhinav Asthana, a former intern at Yahoo, faced this frustration first hand and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7615365">built a Chrome extension</a> for himself and friends.</p>
<p>Little did he know just how many developers and firms needed it, too.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup’s product, which began its journey in India, is today used by over 17 million developers and over 500,000 organizations including Microsoft, Salesforce, Stripe, Shopify, Cisco, and PayPal.</p>
<p>The list is big: Postman co-founder and chief executive Asthana told TechCrunch that 98% of the Fortune 500 companies are customers of Postman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are solving a fundamental problem for the technology landscape. Big companies tend to be slower as they have many other things on their plate,” he told me two years ago.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190985" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190985" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190985 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/postman-api-platform.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190985" class="wp-caption-text">Postman API Platform&#8217;s offerings</p></div></p>
<p>“Every company in every industry in the world today uses APIs and needs an API platform. This trend is only growing with the move to cloud and digital experiences,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch Tuesday.</p>
<p>The startup today leads the market. Which would explain the investors’ excitement. Postman declined to share its revenue but its new round was financed at over 100 multiples of that, according to an investor with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Postman’s platform is crucial for developers, but it was only recently that the startup expanded to create a public marketplace for developers and firms to find ready-made APIs to use.</p>
<p>“The Postman Public API Network connects millions of developers around the world and provides them with a space dedicated to discovering, exploring, and sharing of APIs. This was ultimately driven by our creation of public workspaces, which allows users to connect across different organizations,” Asthana said.</p>
<p>“With the emergence of APIs, we believe that this will usher in the next generation of no-code and ‘citizen developers.’ We encourage a world filled with innovation for everyone with different backgrounds and varying levels of technical experience. More and more, we’re seeing people in sales, marketing, and finance become more comfortable with APIs and become the champions of this technology,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs over 425 people, plans to deploy the fresh funding to hire more employees across sales, marketing, product, and engineering divisions.</p>
<p>Postman will also “heavily” invest in broadening its product roadmap. “We are expanding the Postman platform across areas that technical users need along with supporting the needs of business users. At a high level, we are investing in supporting workflows for all kinds of APIs — whether they are private APIs, partner APIs, or public APIs,” he said.</p>
<p>Some upcoming items on the roadmap include a new version of the Postman API, support for protocols like gRPC, ProtoBuf, and more extensive capabilities for GraphQL. “We are also focusing heavily on integrations with other vendors in the software development lifecycle like AWS, Git hosting providers like GitHub and GitLab. We are also releasing our Flow Runner tool, a no-code API composition tool to enable anyone to build API driven programs.”</p>
<p>The startup also plans to invest in supporting students through API literacy programs and contribute toward open source projects.</p>
<p>“APIs have quickly become the fundamental building blocks of software used by developers in every industry, in every country across the globe—and Postman has firmly established itself as the preferred platform for developers,” said Insight Partners Managing Director Jeff Horing in a statement.</p>
<p>“Postman has the opportunity to become a key pillar of how enterprises build, deliver products, and seamlessly enable partnerships across the ecosystem. Their continued, rapid expansion and strong management team point to a future for Postman with virtually unlimited possibilities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency business that counts founder Moxie Marlinspike of the encrypting messaging app Signal as its earliest technical advisor, has raised $66 million in Series B funding from a long list of investors, including Alameda Research, Berggruen Holdings, BlockTower Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, Vy Capital, and earlier backers General Catalyst and Future Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The all-equity round brings the four-year-old, San Francisco-based company&#8217;s total funding to $107 million altogether, including a $30 million round led by Binance Labs back in 2018. According to founder and CEO Joshua Goldbard, the newest round values the outfit at $1.066 billion.</span></p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/mobilecoin-a-cryptocurrency-involving-signal-founder-moxie-marlinspike-just-raised-venture-funding/">reported</a> earlier this year, <span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin is focused on enabling privacy-protecting payments made through “near instantaneous transactions” over one’s phone. Indeed, a month after we published that piece, Signal rolled out support for MobileCoin as a payment feature that its users (only in the UK for now) can use to pay for a service or product while enjoying greater privacy than might be possible otherwise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlinspike <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency">told Wired</a> back in April that because MobileCoin is a so-called <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-privacy-coins-and-how-do-they-differ-from-bitcoin">privacy coin</a> designed to protect users&#8217; identities and the details of their payments on a blockchain, that it&#8217;s an ideal fit for Signal. &#8220;There&#8217;s a palpable difference in the feeling of what it&#8217;s like to communicate over Signal, knowing you&#8217;re not being watched or listened to, versus other communication platforms. I would like to get to a world where not only can you feel that when you talk to your therapist over Signal, but also when you pay your therapist for the session over Signal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>According to Goldbard, MobileCoin is also being used to transact by users of <a href="https://mixin.one/messenger">Mixin Messenger</a>, is a China-based open-source private messenger based on Signal Protocol that enables individuals to send cryptocurrencies to their phone contacts.</p>
<p>MobileCoin&#8217;s actual digital coins have <a href="https://cryptopro.app/price/mobilecoin/">fluctuated wildly</a> in value since they began trading in December of last year on the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, run by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, who also founded the quantitative crypto trading firm Alameda Research (which just invested in MobileCoin).</p>
<p>It is also available to buy and sell on the non-U.S. crypto trading platforms Bitfinex, BigOne, and HotBit. Goldbard says there&#8217;s no reason that U.S. exchanges couldn&#8217;t also list the coin for trade, though that&#8217;s not the case currently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s entirely up to [them] when they list assets, and no one knows ahead of time when your asset will be listed,&#8221; Goldbard offers, dismissing questions about U.S. regulators who&#8217;ve cracked down on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram">similar efforts</a> and pointing instead to MobileCoin&#8217;s relatively newness as its biggest challenge right now. &#8220;Most coins take a long time to list, to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether Goldbard or his early team members have sold some of company&#8217;s coins &#8212; they spiked in price this past spring &#8212; he says that &#8220;management has not sold any coins.&#8221; Asked whether the same is true of Marlinspike, Goldbard says that he &#8220;can&#8217;t speak for Moxie.&#8221; (Marlinspike told Wired in April that neither he nor Signal owned any MobileCoins at the time. We&#8217;ve since asked the company whether Marlinspike has ever owned any MobileCoins and also whether he owns or previously owned shares in MobileCoin as an early advisor to the company and have yet to hear back.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even assuming that MobileCoin is more secure than other options, it is still not foolproof. Among the risks involved in storing cryptocurrency on a phone are potentially losing it if the phone is left unlocked or the radio on the phone is hacked or if, say, iOS itself is hacked. </span></p>
<p>It does offer another advantage, though, argues Goldbard. He says MobileCoin is more environmentally friendly than  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that rely on &#8216;proof of work,&#8217; where individuals on a network compete with computing power to solve cryptographic puzzles and consume<span style="font-weight: 400;"> large amounts of electricity along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MobileCoin instead relies on a mechanism called a &#8220;federated byzantine agreement,&#8221; wherein different validators &#8212;  people who agree to store data, process transactions, and add new blocks to the blockchain to earn more cryptocurrency &#8212; decide which other validators they trust, and when enough circles of trusted validators overlap, consensus is reached. The algorithm requires fewer people and less energy while remaining decentralized, says Goldbard.</span></p>
<p>MobileCoin currently has 40 employees and is &#8220;hiring as fast as possible,&#8221; says Goldbard. Tragically, the company&#8217;s head of engineering, Toby Segaran, who was previously an engineer with both Google and Reddit, passed away unexpectedly last week. Meanwhile, MobileCoin brought aboard is first head of compliance, David Ackerman, last month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fifteen years ago, Aydin Senkut, a former Google exec, was an outsider in venture circles that didn&#8217;t take seriously his ambitions to become a top VC. Now, his firm, <a href="https://www.felicis.com/">Felicis Ventures</a>, is announcing $900 million in capital commitments across two new funds &#8212; a $600 million early stage fund and a $300 million opportunities-type fund to back its fastest-growing winners &#8212; and its limited partners wanted the firm to invest even more.</p>
<p>Yes, a part of that is the current go-go market. Much more, however, ties to Felicis&#8217;s performance, which has been strong from nearly its outset and goes a long way in explaining how a firm that initially launched with $4 million from Senkut&#8217;s own pocket has, in recent years, has been roughly doubling how much it invests with every new fund. (Its seventh and last flagship fund closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/felicis-ventures-wraps-up-its-newest-fund-with-510-in-committed-capital/">$510 million</a> in March of last year. According to Felicis, across all funds, including losses, it has now produced 6x cash-on-cash returns for its investors.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint how Felicis has managed to be right about so many of its investments, which include early bets on Shopify in Canada, Canva in Australia, and Ayden in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Shopify, which went public in 2015, is now a $185 billion company. Canva&#8217;s private market valuation hit <a href="https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/canva-announces-usd-15-billion-valuation-launches-suite-presentations-products-workplace/">$15 billion</a> this spring. Ayden, which went public in 2018, currently boasts a market cap of $85 billion.</p>

<p>While the firm has long been willing to invest in far-flung places &#8212; a differentiator that more firms have begun to copy &#8212; it has also chosen well in the U.S., with bets on Plaid (valued at roughly <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/plaid-stockpiles-funding-with-investments-by-jpmorgan-american-express">$14 billion</a> right now); publicly traded Guardant Health; Credit Karma (acquired by Intuit for roughly $7 billion); and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/recursion-pharmaceuticals-jumps-in-debut-after-436-million-ipo">newly public</a> Recursion Pharmaceuticals (among others).</p>
<p>Asked about its approach, Senkut &#8212; who runs the firm with fellow general partners Wesley Chan, Sundeep Peechu, Victoria Treyger, Niki Pezeshki, and an incoming general partner, Viviana Faga &#8212; says the firm basically makes both safe and more ambitious bets, writing bigger checks to surer things so it can gamble on new ideas, like a company that makes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/has-a-startup-finally-found-one-of-food-sciences-holy-grails-with-its-healthy-sugar-substitute/">sugar substitute</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Has a startup finally found one of food science&#8217;s holy grails with its healthy sugar substitute?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/has-a-startup-finally-found-one-of-food-sciences-holy-grails-with-its-healthy-sugar-substitute/embed/#?secret=7DMtMibZae" data-secret="7DMtMibZae" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The partners also stress the importance to the firm of maintaining a high net promoter score. They treat founders well, and founders treat them well, in turn, is the gist, including giving the firm a glowing reference in a competitive situation.</p>
<p>Says Senkut, &#8220;We want founders to say, &#8216;This person has helped me so much, I would almost do anything to take money from this person or to put them on my board,&#8217; versus the traditional method [wherein the VC says], &#8216;We&#8217;re writing a $50 million check and because we invested that money, we&#8217;ll dictate who&#8217;s on the board and what to do.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Not last, says Peechu, who joined Felicis roughly 11 years ago, Felicis often jumps in when the water is still cold. &#8220;The fund strategy is not always to make the most amount of money,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Sometimes, we&#8217;re investing to 2% or 3% of a company because that 3% could potentially give us an incredible learning that might help us invest the next $30 million to $50 million in that category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peechu points, for example, to an early bet on video game developer Tapulous that led to a bigger bet on game maker Rovio. &#8220;A lot of a lot of people will wait until the first big company is created in a category and they give that company a pool of money,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;But by that time, 10 years might have passed and you&#8217;ve lost a lot of economic opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Felicis tends to &#8220;risk adjust&#8221; instead, he adds. &#8220;We say, &#8216;Hey, I think this interesting category might be emerging,&#8217; Then we go in. Maybe we invest a bit earlier and own a little less, but we pay attention to what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only way you can understand what&#8217;s happening on the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it has far more capital to deploy toward that end. Indeed, its new funds will see Felicis double its investment range from checks that range from $1 million to $25 million to now upwards of $50 million in one slug.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Apeel developed a plant-based layer for the surface of fruits and vegetables, that is tasteless and odorless, and keeps moisture in, while letting oxygen out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://apeelsciences.com/">Apeel Sciences</a>, a food system innovation company, is out to prevent food produced globally from ending up in the landfill, especially as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557">pressures from the global pandemic</a> affect the food supply chain.</p>
<p>The company just added $250 million in Series E funding, giving it a valuation of $2 billion, to speed up the availability of its longer-lasting produce in the U.S. (where <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">approximately 40% of food is wasted</a>), the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>Existing investor Temasek led the round and was joined by a group of new and existing investors, including Mirae Asset Global Investments, GIC, Viking Global Investors, Disruptive, Andreessen Horowitz, Tenere Capital, Sweetwater Private Equity, Tao Capital Partners, K3 Ventures, David Barber of Almanac Insights, Michael Ovitz of Creative Artists Agency, Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe, Susan Wojcicki of YouTube and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Apeel has now raised over $635 million since the company was founded in 2012. Prior to this round, the company brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/preventing-food-waste-nets-apeel-250-million-from-singapores-government-oprah-and-katy-perry/">$250 million in Series D</a> funding in May 2020.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara-based Apeel developed a plant-based layer for the surface of fruits and vegetables that is tasteless and odorless and that keeps moisture in while letting oxygen out. It is those two factors in particular that lead to grocery produce lasting twice as long, James Rogers, CEO of Apeel, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Apeel installs its application at the supplier facilities where the produce is packed into boxes. In addition to that technology, the company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apeel-acquires-imaging-technology-to-unlock-the-insights-in-every-bite-of-fruit-301288845.html">acquired ImpactVision</a> earlier this year to add another layer of quality by integrating imaging systems on individual pieces as they move through the supply chain to optimize routing so more produce that is grown is eaten.</p>
<p>“One in nine people are going hungry, and if three in nine pieces of produce are being thrown away, we can be better stewards of the food we are throwing away,” Rogers said. “This is a solvable problem, we just have to get the pieces to the right place at the right time.”</p>
<p>The company is not alone in tackling food waste. For example, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shelf-engine-raises-41-million-to-transform-the-grocery-supply-chain-quadrupling-retailer-profits-while-reducing-food-waste-by-one-third-301250109.html">Shelf Engine</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imperfect-foods-secures-95mm-series-d-investment-commitment-301212899.html">Imperfect Foods</a>, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200717005006/en/Cambridge-Crops-Rebrands-as-Mori-and-Raises-12-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-to-Combat-Food-Waste">Mori</a> and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-phood-heats-up-2m-seed-to-reduce-food-waste/">Phood Solutions</a> are all working to improve the food supply chain and have attracted venture dollars to go after that mission.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, the amount of food people were eating was growing each year, but that trend is reversed, Rogers explained. Consumers are more aware of the food they eat, they are shopping less frequently, buying more per visit and more online. At the same time, grocery stores are trying to sort through all of that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We can’t create these supply networks alone, we do it in concert with supply and retail partners,” he said. “Grocery stores are looking at the way shoppers want to buy things, while we look at how to partner to empower the supply chain. What started with longer-lasting fruits and vegetables, is becoming how we provide information to empower them to do it without adding to food waste.”</p>
<p>Since 2019, Apeel has prevented 42 million pieces of fruit from going to waste at retail locations; that includes up to 50% reduction in avocado food waste with corresponding sales growth. Those 42 million pieces of saved fruit also helped conserve nearly 4.7 billion liters of water, Rogers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over the past year, Apeel has amassed a presence in eight countries, operating 30 supply networks and  distributing produce to 40 retail partners, which then goes out to tens of thousands of stores around the world.</p>
<p>The new funding will accelerate the rollout of those systems, as well as co-create another 10 supply networks with retail and supply partnerships by the end of the year. Rogers also expects to use the funding to advance Apeel’s data and insights offerings and future acquisitions.</p>
<p>Thomas Park, president and head of alternative investments at Mirae Asset Global Investments, said his firm has been investing in environmental, social and governance-related companies for awhile, targeting companies that “make a huge impact globally and in a way that is easy for us to understand.”</p>
<p>The firm, which is part of Mirae Asset Financial Group, often partners with other investors on venture rounds, and in Apeel’s case with Temasek. It also invested with Temasek in Impossible Foods, leading its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/impossible-foods-gobbles-up-another-200-million/">Series F round</a> last year.</p>
<p>“When we saw them double-down on their investment, it gave us confidence to invest in Apeel and an opportunity to do so,” Park said. “Food waste is a global problem, and after listening to James, we definitely feel like Apeel is the next wave of how to attack these huge problems in an impactful way.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Canada Drives currently operates in British Columbia and Ontario. With the new funds, Canada Drives hopes to expand to Alberta in the next month, according to co-CEO Cody Green.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canada Drives, an online car shopping and delivery platform, announced $79.4 million ($100 million CAD) in Series B funding that it will use to expand its service across Canada. </span></p>
<p>It was founded in 2010 as a car financing company but launched an e-commerce platform for new and used vehicles last year. Canada Drives currently operates in British Columbia and Ontario, two provinces that together comprise about half of Canada&#8217;s entire population, according to Canada&#8217;s 2016 census. With the new funds, Canada Drives hopes to expand to Alberta in the next month, according to co-CEO Cody Green.</p>
<p>The pandemic boosted online shopping in every industry, and car buying is no exception. And now that companies like Canada Drives are beginning to provide a platform to shop and buy, as well as next-day delivery, this market will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>Nobody likes going to the car dealership anyway, and the data support that: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/jd-power-sales-satisfaction-index/">A recent study by consumer intelligence company J.D. Power</a> found people are taking to digital car sales because they want to avoid face-to-face interactions and haggling with salespeople, and they like doing paperwork and financing at home. They&#8217;re also more likely to buy add-ons when they can shop at their leisure rather than experiencing the pressure of a commission-hungry dealer breathing down their necks.</p>
<p>While there are many online car shopping platforms in the U.S. that have grown in popularity over the past couple of years, like Carvana and Vroom, Canada hasn&#8217;t seen the same sort of growth. But with companies like Canada Drives and Clutch, another online car marketplace that recently raised $20 million CAD in seed funding, Canadian entrepreneurs are wising up to the model that&#8217;s already been proven across the border. The global chip shortage is also causing a growing market for used vehicles as it becomes more expensive and difficult to purchase new cars.</p>
<p>In order to meet those needs for Canadian consumers, Canada Drives is going to use its recent funding to keep enhancing the product, grow its inventory in existing and new markets, and hire around 200 people over the next year, particularly in product development, Green told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company owns its entire inventory of vehicles. It certifies, inspects and reconditions the used cars that come its way, stores them throughout its operating zones and delivers them to the customer&#8217;s door when they purchase. Customers get a seven-day trial with their vehicle, and if it&#8217;s not to their standard, they can have it picked up and returned with no questions asked.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Green said he expects to see an increasing amount of hybrid or electric vehicles on the platform, and a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that Teslas and Nissan Leafs are already quite popular. Canada has a goal to ban the sales of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, so it&#8217;s a roll of the dice whether the marketplace will be littered with used ICE or flush with used electric vehicles over the next couple of decades. Currently, around 5% of Canada Drives&#8217; inventory is hybrid or electric, said Green.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Our mission is to be the easiest place to buy or sell your car in Canada, and as consumer preferences change and as countries adopt forward-thinking policies with electric and hybrid, our platform is going to be able to evolve with that,&#8221; Green told TechCrunch. &#8220;As there&#8217;s more and more new electric vehicles, more will become used vehicles, and I think already that is a market that we&#8217;re over-indexed on versus the average dealer in Canada.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>This latest funding round brings Canada Drives&#8217; total funding to about $159 million ($200 million CAD) after a $100 million CAD Series A raised in 2019. The Series B round announced Wednesday was led by<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jeffrey Housenbold’s Honor Ventures with participation from KAR Global and other strategic investors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has entered the financial services and insurance markets of India in recent years. Now it is paving the way to foray into the wealth management category.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce giant has backed Bangalore-based startup Smallcase in a $40 million Series C financing round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Faering Capital and Premji Invest as well as existing investors Sequoia Capital, Blume Ventures, Beenext, DSP Group, Arkam Ventures, WEH Ventures and HDFC Bank also participated in the new round, which brings its total to-date raise to over $65 million.</p>
<p>Founded by three IIT Kharagpur graduates in July 2015, Smallcase offers a platform to help introduce a new generation of investors to the Indian equity markets.</p>
<p>The startup offers an in-house team of licensed professionals who offer over 100 portfolios of stocks and exchange traded funds as well as provides its users access to independent investment managers, brokerages and wealth platforms.</p>
<p>The startup supports a dozen leading stock brokers in India including Tiger Global-backed Upstox, and Zerodha&#8217;s Kite.</p>
<p>Smallcase has amassed over 3 million users, who are transacting about $2.5 billion each year. It says a user can start making their investments in just two clicks after signing up for the service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have created a new, fast-growing category of investment products by developing an ecosystem of 250+ businesses in the capital markets space including India’s largest and fastest growing brokerages, advisors, investment managers and digital wealth platforms,” said Vasanth Kamath, co-founder and chief executive of Smallcase.</p>
<p>“It has been both humbling and inspiring to see smallcases become the primary gateway to stocks &amp; ETFs for millions of new investors. This financing increases our responsibility to continue building simple, transparent and delightful experiences and platforms, while delivering more value to our users and partners. Our true success will lie in developing the core building blocks for every investor’s portfolio and becoming a key part of their toolkit,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs 200 people, said it plans to deploy the fund to broaden its technology platform and win more customers.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Amazon has backed an Indian startup. The e-commerce firm, which has deployed over $6.5 billion in its India business, has invested in ride-hailing firm Shuttl, invoice discounting marketplace exchange for MSMEs M1xchange, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/amazon-backed-indian-d2c-beauty-brand-myglamm-raises-71-million/">direct-to-customer beauty brand MyGlamm</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Amazon also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/amazon-announces-250-million-venture-fund-for-indian-startups/">unveiled a $250 million venture fund</a> to invest in Indian startups and entrepreneurs focused on digitizing small and medium-sized businesses in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson said the company invested in Smallcase through its $250 million venture fund. &#8220;As part of this Fund, we are excited to partner with smallcase in their journey to offer innovative consumer investment products. By increasing product selection and convenience, this will provide an additional channel for consumers to participate in the equity markets,&#8221; the spokesperson added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We sometimes take for granted that most anyone who wishes to become say, an Uber driver, can do so. But that assumption is a narrow view considering there are many people who would love to earn income in that way but can&#8217;t because of lack of car ownership (and all that goes with it) &#8212; especially in countries outside of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to remedy that problem, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-based <a href="https://www.kovi.com.br/">Kovi</a> was founded in 2018 to give those people access to those opportunities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi today is announcing it has raised $104 million in a Series B round of funding co-led by Valor Capital Group and Prosus Ventures. Quona, Broadhaven Ventures, GFC, Monashees, UVC Investimentos, PIPO, Norte and Globo Ventures also participated in the financing, in addition to Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel through his family office. The round takes Kovi’s total equity raised since inception to about $145 million. The company also recently closed on a $20 million debt facility. It is not yet a unicorn, according to execs, who declined to reveal valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two former 99 (Brazil’s </span><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-you-need-to-know-about-brazils-first-tech-unicorn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first tech unicorn</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and also known as Didi) executives, Adhemar Milani Neto and João Costa, started the company, which rents vehicles to on-demand drivers who work for ride-hailing companies such as Uber, Didi and Lyft. It then expanded from on-demand drivers to food delivery workers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi operates its “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all inclusive” car subscription model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">under the premise that more people in Latin America would work for these companies if they could afford to operate the necessary vehicle. In fact, an estimated 75% of Latin Americans cannot own a vehicle because of the high cost of acquisition and maintenance. Cars are </span><a href="https://www.globalfleet.com/en/taxation-and-legislation/latin-america/features/brazils-hurdles-car-ownership-fleet-management?a=DBL10&amp;t%5B0%5D=Localiza&amp;t%5B1%5D=FLeet%20LaTAm&amp;t%5B2%5D=LatAm&amp;t%5B3%5D=Brazil&amp;curl=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly more expensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in countries like Brazil than in the U.S. and the difference is even greater when it comes to the average income of the population. Also, financing is often difficult and expensive to obtain, as credit is difficult to access in most Latin American countries. When applying for loans, 60% of applications are denied by traditional banking institutions, according to Kovi co-founder and CEO Adhemar Milani Neto. And even when approved, customers pay high interest rates that are up to 30% per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi gives drivers who don’t necessarily want, or cannot afford, to own a vehicle “quick access to quality cars” at what it says is “a fair price.” It operates an asset-light model, in that it does not buy vehicles but instead has inked rental agreements with OEMs such as Toyota and Volkswagen to offer vehicles to gig workers, including insurance and maintenance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission is to promote a revolution in this market, making car ownership affordable, less complicated and accessible to an underserved population,” Neto said. “We want to offer a range of options to create a platform for urban mobility and create more possibilities for our customers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the startup saw its number of customers grow by more than 70%, and it now has more than 11,000 users in Brazil and Mexico. The company has 12,000 cars in its fleet and aims to add another 20,000 cars by the end of 2021. The company says its ARR (annual recurring revenue) is now roughly around $45 million, and that it is growing by at least 15% month over month. Kovi is “very close” to breaking even and plans to this year, according to Neto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to make car ownership more inclusive, human and efficient using technology and financial innovation,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets Kovi apart from competitors is that its cars are connected, so it uses data science and analytics to be able to offer “a better user experience and competitive prices,&#8221; believes Kovi co-founder João Costa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also over time has shifted from offering insurance through third parties to offering insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We basically built an insurance company from scratch,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic hit in 2020, Kovi &#8212; as did many other companies &#8212; at first saw its business slow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the company quickly pivoted by changing its model to a pay-per-mile model so that it could act as a “Root Insurance for car owners,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model has worked very well for drivers, he added. The company also enhanced its B2C offering so that drivers can access a car, with “everything included,” from insurance to 24-hour road support and preventive maintenance through Kovi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once things got more back to normal, the on-demand economy scaled really fast,” Neto said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kovi also in the past year broadened its scope from a short-term car subscription to include a long-term option. That has proven successful so far, with that segment of its business growing to 35% of Kovi’s revenue already since launching in October of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also creates more profit for the OEMs Kovi is partnered with, Neto added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide a much better profitability model for them rather than just to sell to rental companies or end consumers. They make recurring revenue for 12-24 months and then resell used cars through their dealerships,” he said. “We’re now taking Kovi to the broader OEM market. We see this as a global business model that extends not only in Brazil and Mexico but across LatAm and to other developing countries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Kovi will use its new capital to expand its service to new cities in Latin America and double down on existing operations in Brazil and Mexico. The money will also go toward technology development, specifically data management and the company’s pay-per-mile capabilities (which its founders say is unprecedented in Latin America). It also, naturally, plans to add to its 700-person team &#8212; including hiring developers, software engineers and data scientists. And, finally, Kovi plans to use some of its fresh capital to launch new financial services and products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the company began the buildout for some of those products earlier this year, launching its aforementioned auto insurance offering, dubbed Kovi Seguro &#8212; a tracked insurance for app drivers. It also plans to launch “to a rent to own&#8221; option, Neto said. So that drivers who want to own a vehicle will have a way to work toward that.</span></p>
<p>Prosus&#8217; Banafsheh Fathieh says that ultimately, Kovi is a financial services company that can offer consumers that may not qualify for credit under traditional models to incrementally work toward owning a car through a subscription plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Kovi owns and manages their fleet during the rental period &#8212; and therefore can control the fleet remotely &#8212; it is able to cater to a severely financially underserved population that’s typically considered higher risk by creditors,&#8221; Fathieh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor co-founder and managing partner </span><a href="https://valorcapitalgroup.com/team/scott-sobel/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Sobel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believes that Kovi is “well positioned” to capture three major tailwinds that have the potential to disrupt the multibillion-dollar car ownership market of Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of those tailwinds is ride-hailing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only in Latin America there are approximately 1.5 million on-demand drivers, and this number is expected to grow by ~2-3x this decade,” he said. “Take Uber as an example: three of its biggest markets are São Paulo, Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second tailwind is car subscription. Less than 0.5% of Brazilian cars are under subscription offerings, and that number is expected to reach ~10-20% in the next five years due to consumer behavioral changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being one of the first movers in LatAm gives Kovi an edge,” Sobel told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third tailwind is auto insurance, which he thinks will be disrupted by more flexible (such as pay as you go, pay per mile, unbundled policies) customer-centric and tech-driven models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These global trends will provide greater access to millions of drivers in the region,” Sobel said. For example, as of now less than 30% of Latin American drivers have an active car insurance policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor, he added, was impressed with Kovi’s traction and the “strong competitive moats” the company has built, including verticalized maintenance centers designed to reduce idle time and costs, a driver’s wallet, IoT systems integrating the entire fleet and “all the data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kovi is a very smart company, obsessed with metrics, tech and product innovation,&#8221; Sobel added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A one-year-old startup that is attempting to build the railroads for e-commerce in Pakistan has just secured a mega round of funding in a major boost to the South Asia nation’s nascent startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.airliftexpress.com">Airlift</a> operates a quick commerce service in eight cities including Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad in Pakistan. Users can order groceries, fresh produce, other essential items including medicines as well as sports goods from Airlift website or app and have it delivered to them in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The startup said on Wednesday that it has raised $85 million in its Series B financing round at a valuation of $275 million. Harry Stebbings of 20VC and Josh Buckley of Buckley Ventures co-led the financing round, which is by far the largest for a Pakistani startup.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, former president of Y Combinator, Biz Stone, co-founder of Twitter and Medium, Steve Pagliuca, co-chairman of Bain Capital, Jeffrey Katzenberg, ex-chief executive of Disney and Quibi, and Taavet Hinrikus, founder and chief executive of TransferWise also participated in the new round, which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $110 million.</p>
<p>Stanley Tang, co-founder of DoorDash, Simon Borrero, founder and chief executive of Rappi, Baastian Lehman, founder and chief executive of Postmates, Quiet Capital and Indus Valley Capital also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Airlift started as a transit business, building a service similar to Uber for air conditioned-buses in Pakistan. The startup quick amassed traction, clocking over 35,000 rides a day. And then the pandemic arrived, disrupting all mobility in the country.</p>
<p>That’s when Usman Gul, the founder and chief executive of Airlift, took the call to pivot to quick commerce, he told TechCrunch in an interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This entire space of quick commerce is on the brink of global transformation. Airlift is in the forefront for leading that transformation in Asia and Africa,” he said. Gul said he plans to expand the service to many international markets in the next few months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2190961" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2190961" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2190961 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/airlift-pakistan.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2190961" class="wp-caption-text">Airlift website</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Airlift’s early traction in Pakistan is a window into the future for how quick commerce will play out in the developing world,&#8221; said Altman in a statement.</p>
<p>Airlift today operates over 30 dark stores and processes hundreds of thousands of orders each month.</p>
<p>Gul said the startup has found that setting up these fulfillment centers is the most efficient way to serve the market. &#8220;The more middlemen you introduce in this chain between the items and the customers, you begin to compromise the experience,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Within the first twelve months of launch, Airlift has been able to reduce its cost of blended customer acquisition to $5 and unit costs to $2.50, it said.</p>
<p>Gul said the startup, which today employs over 100 people, plans to expand to more categories including electronics. &#8220;The idea is to expand to new categories and build the railroads to move consumer goods from manufacturers to consumers,&#8221; said Gul.</p>
<p>He left his job at DoorDash and moved back to Pakistan to start Airlift. “The idea was to create impact at the base of the pyramid and solve problems that would enrich millions of lives &#8212; for whom change is desperately needed. That drove my transition frankly,” he said.</p>
<p>“Transparently, when I first met Usman, I knew this was an entrepreneur who was going to create an industry-defining company. Humble, ambitious and strategic, Usman will be one of the great founders of this generation,&#8221; said Stebbings in a statement.</p>
