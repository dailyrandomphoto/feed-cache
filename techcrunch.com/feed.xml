										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Accounting isn&#8217;t a topic that most people can get excited about &#8212; probably not even most accountants. But if you&#8217;re running any kind of business, there&#8217;s just no way around it. Santa Clara-based <a href="https://docyt.com/">Docyt</a> wants to make the life of small and medium business owners (and their accounting firms) a bit easier by using machine learning to handle a lot of the routine tasks around collecting financial data, digitizing receipts, categorization and &#8212; maybe most importantly &#8212; <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reconciliation.asp">reconciliation</a>.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $1.5 million seed-extension round led by First Rays Venture Partners with participation from Morado Ventures and a group of angel investors. Docyt (pronounced &#8220;docket&#8221;) had previously raised a $2.2 million seed round from Morado Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Westwave Capital, Xplorer Capital, Tuesday and angel investors. The company plans to use the new investment to accelerate its customer growth.</p>

<p>At first glance, it may seem like Docyt competes with the likes of QuickBooks, which is pretty much the de facto standard for small business accounting. But Docyt co-founder and CTO Sugam Pandey tells me that he thinks of the service as a partner to the likes of QuickBooks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117900" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117900" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png 1968w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Docyt-Dashboard.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2117900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Docyt</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Docyt is a product for the small business owners who find accounting very complex, who are very experienced on how to run and grow their business, but not really an expert in accounting. At the same time, businesses who are graduating out of QuickBooks &#8212; small business owners sometimes become midsized enterprises as well &#8212; [ … ] they start growing out of their accounting systems like QuickBooks and looking for more sophisticated systems like NetSuite and Sage. And Docyt fits in in that space as well, extending the life of QuickBooks for such business owners so they don&#8217;t have to change their systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its earliest days, Docyt was a secure document sharing platform with a focus on mobile. Some of this is still in the company&#8217;s DNA, with its focus on being able to pull in financial documents and then reconciling that with a business&#8217; bank transactions. While other systems may put the emphasis on transaction data, Docyt&#8217;s emphasis is on documents. That means you can forward an emailed receipt to the service, for example, and it can automatically attach this to a financial transaction from your credit card or bank statement (the service uses Plaid to pull in this data).</p>

<p>For new transactions, you sometimes have to train the system by entering some of this information by hand, but over time, Docyt should be able to do most of this automatically and then sync your data with QuickBooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Docyt is the first company to apply AI across the entire accounting stack,&#8221; said Amit Sridharan, founding general partner at First Rays Venture Partners. &#8220;Docyt software&#8217;s AI-powered data extraction, auto categorization and auto reconciliation is unparalleled. It&#8217;s an enterprise-level, powerful solution that&#8217;s affordable and accessible to small and medium businesses.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos&#8217; space company Blue Origin published an <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight">updated timeline</a> for the first flight of New Glenn, the orbital rocket it&#8217;s building to complement its existing New Shepard suborbital space launch vehicle. The company is now targeting Q4 2022 – a slippage of roughly a year from the prior stated timeline of sometime towards the end of 2021. The main cause, per Blue Origin? Space Force passing on using New Glenn to launch national security payloads during a recent contract bid process.</p>
<p>Blue Origin said in a blog post that the &#8220;schedule has been refined to match the demand of Blue Origin&#8217;s commercial customers,&#8221; and specifically says it &#8220;follows the recent Space Force decision to not select New Glenn for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Launch Services Procurement (LSP).&#8221; Those awards were announced last August, and the two winners were the United Launch Alliance (ULA) and SpaceX, who prevailed over Blue Origin, and also Northrop Grumman. The launch service contracts that make up the awards begin in 2022, so it makes sense why Blue Origin had been pushing for a first launch of New Glenn by the end of this year in order to meet the needs of Space Force.</p>
<p>While it may not be under the same time pressure without access to those contracts, it&#8217;s still making &#8220;major progress&#8221; towards New Glenn and the facilities at Cape Canaveral in Florida from which it&#8217;ll launch, according to the company. Blue Origin shared tweets showing off some of its progress, including work on the New Glenn rocket factory, testing facility and Launch Complex 36. It also said it&#8217;s put more than $2.5 billion into the facilities and infrastructure that will support its eventual launches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lee.house.gov/">Rep. Barbara Lee</a>, who has represented the East Bay of California since 1998, is one of Congress’s staunchest proponents of diversity in tech. Representing Oakland, Emeryville and other cities nestled around the hills of the East Bay, she knows all too well about the benefits reaped by those in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and beyond.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that Rep. Lee will be joining us for a fireside chat at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a> in just a few days.</p>
<p>By focusing on racial injustice, among the many other issues facing her constituency, Lee has highlighted the ways in which access to tech remains out of reach for people from underserved communities. And this doesn’t just refer to the so-called ‘pipeline problem,’ which is, arguably, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">myth</a>. It is also about the lack of tech education in early grades through high school, as well as a lack of access to computers and reliable broadband, which most of us take for granted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We will speak with Lee about the opportunities that the tech industry has to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers, coders and the like can take part in everything it has to offer. We will also discuss her membership in the Congressional Black Caucus, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, as well as her role as co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/these-5-vcs-have-high-hopes-for-cannabis-in-2021/">burgeoning</a> cannabis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/2020-was-a-defining-year-for-cannabis-what-comes-next/">industry</a> will be a good place to start.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">Head here to secure your seat</a> to TechCrunch Sessions: Justice. In addition to Rep. Lee, you&#8217;ll hear from Backstage Capital&#8217;s Arlan Hamilton <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/hear-from-arlan-hamilton-on-finding-the-next-big-opportunities-in-tech-at-tc-sessions-justice/">on finding the next big opportunities in tech</a>, learn how to creatively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/learn-how-to-creatively-navigate-remote-fundraising-from-top-investors/">navigate remote fundraising from top investors</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/learn-about-the-importance-of-accessible-product-design-at-techcrunch-sessions-justice/">examine the importance of accessible product design</a> and learn how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/battling-algorithmic-bias-at-tc-sessions-justice/">battle algorithmic bias</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?display=true">Register now</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Health and life science specialist investment firm <a href="https://www.foresitecapital.com">Foresite Capital</a> has raised a new fund, its fifth to date, totally $969 million in commitments from LPs. This is the firm&#8217;s largest fund to date, and was oversubscribed relative to its original target according to fund CEO and founder Dr. Jim Tananbaum, who told me that while the fundraising process started out slow in the early months of the pandemic, it gained steam quickly starting around last fall and ultimately exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>This latest fund actually makes up two separate investment vehicles, Foresite Capital Fund V, and Foresite Capital Opportunity Fund V, but Tananbaum says that the money will be used to fuel investments in line with its existing approach, which includes companies ranging from early- to late-stage, and everything in between. Foresite&#8217;s approach is designed to help it be uniquely positioned to shepherd companies from founding (they also have a company-building incubator) all the way to public market exit – and even beyond. Tananbaum said that they&#8217;re also very interested in coming in later to startups they have have missed out on at earlier stages of their growth, however.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117784" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117784" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="671" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg 2078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=2048,1342 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JimTananbaum2018Vertical.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117784" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Foresite Capital</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We can also come into a later situation that&#8217;s competitive with a number of hedge funds, and bring something unique to the table, because we have all these value added resources that we used to start companies,&#8221; Tananbaum said. &#8220;So we have a competitive advantage for later stage deals, and we have a competitive advantage for early stage deals, by virtue of being able to function at a high level in the capital markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Foresite&#8217;s other advantage, according to Tananbaum, is that it has long focused on the intersection of traditional tech business mechanics and biotech. That approach has especially paid off in recent years, he says, since the gap between the two continues to narrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just had this enormous believe that technology, and tools and data science, machine learning, biotechnology, biology, and genetics – they are going to come together,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been an organization out there that really speaks both languages well for entrepreneurs, and knows how to bring that diverse set of people together. So that&#8217;s what we specialized i,n and we have a lot of resources and a lot of cross-lingual resources, so that techies that can talk to biotechies, and biotechies can talk to techies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foresite extended this approach to company formation with the creation of Foresite Labs, an incubation platform that it spun up in October 2019 to leverage this experience at the earliest possible stage of startup founding. It&#8217;s run by Dr. Vik Bajaj, who was previously co-founder and Chief Science Officer of Alphabet&#8217;s Verily health sciences enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on, or last couple decades, is that the innovation cycles are getting faster and faster,&#8221; Tananbaum said. &#8220;So and then at some point, the people that are having the really big wins on the public side are saying, &#8216;Well, these really big wins are being driven by innovation, and by quality science, so let&#8217;s go a little bit more upstream on the quality science.'&#8221;</p>
<p>That has combined with shorter and shorter healthcare product development cycles, he added, aided by general improvements in technology. Tananbaum pointed out that when he began Foresite in 2011, even, the time horizons for returns on healthcare investments were significantly longer, and at the outside edge of the tolerances of venture economics. Now, however, they&#8217;re much closer to those found in the general tech startup ecosystem, even in the case of fundamental scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Basically, you&#8217;re seeing people now really look at biotech in general, in the same kind of way that you would look at a tech company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are these tech metrics that now also apply in biotech, about adoption velocity, other other things that may not exactly equate to immediate revenue, but give you all the core material that usually works over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, Foresite&#8217;s investment thesis focuses on funding companies in three areas – therapeutics at the clinical stage, infrastructure focused on automation and data generation, and what Tananbaum calls &#8220;individualized care.&#8221; All three are part of a continuum in the tech-enabled healthcare end state that he envisions, ultimately resulting &#8220;a world where we&#8217;re able to, at the individual level, help someone understand what their predispositions are to disease development.&#8221; That, Tananbaum suggests, will result in a transformation of this kind of targeted care into an everyday consumer experience – in the same way tech in general has taken previously specialist functions and abilities, and made them generally available to the public at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The executive who built the financial services boutique for Paytm, India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">most valuable startup</a>, from the ground is ready to do something similar all over again.</p>
<p>Pravin Jadhav, the former chief executive of Paytm Money, revealed on Thursday his own startup, <a href="https://www.raiseholding.co">Raise Financial Services</a>.</p>
<p>This time, Jadhav &#8212; under whose leadership, Paytm had amassed over 6 million Money customers &#8212; is focusing on serving a different set of the population.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hundreds of millions of users in India today don’t have access to financial services. They don’t have a credit card, banks don’t lend to them, and they have never purchased an insurance cover or invested in mutual funds or stocks.</p>
<p>Scores of large firms and startups in India today are attempting to reach these users by building an underwriting technology that can use alternative data to determine an applicant’s credit worthiness. It’s a tough and capital intensive business, built on pillars of uncertainties, assumptions and hopes.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Jadhav said Raise Financial Services is aimed at customers living in metro, tier 1 and tier 2 cities (so very much in and around urban cities). “They want financial products, they are literate about these products, but they are not being served the way they should be,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117918" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117918" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2117918 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17XXcBUzzqSe2ojJBYFzLmQ.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117918" class="wp-caption-text">Pravin Jadhav, left, poses with Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Jadhav left Paytm last year.</p></div></p>
<p>He said his new startup will offer products across financial services including investing, financing, insurance, wealth, and payments. “Just not doing the banking part, as I believe that is more of an infrastructure play,” he said.</p>
<p>“The idea is to offer great exceptional products that are not being offered by anyone. Number 2: Focus a lot on tech-driven distribution. And third is that today the quality of customer service experience is bad across the market. So we are trying to solve that,” he said. “Over time, we will try to stitch all of this together.”</p>
<p>Jadhav also announced he has raised a Seed financing round. He did not disclose the amount, but revealed enough high-profile names, including: Kunal Shah (Cred), Kalyan Krishnamurthi (Flipkart), Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar (Udaan), Sameer Nigam and Rahul Chari (PhonePe), Amrish Rau (Pine Labs, Citrus Pay), Sandeep Tandon (Freecharge), Jitendra Gupta (Jupiter), Girish Mathrubootham (Freshworks), Nischal Shetty (WazirX), Kuldeep Dhankar (Clevertap), Sreevatsa Prabhakar (Servify), and Amit Bhor (Walnut).</p>
<p>Jadhav himself is also investing, and venture investor Mirae Asset Venture is leading the round, with participation from Multi-Act Private Equity, Blume Ventures (via its Founder’s Fund) and US based early-stage investor Social Leverage, for which it is the first investment in India.</p>
<p>Ashish Dave, CEO of Mirae Asset Venture&#8217;s India business, told TechCrunch that even though he had known Jadhav, it was listening to him at various Clubhouse sessions that prompted him to reach out to Jadhav.</p>
<p>Jadhav said users can expect the startup’s first product to be live by the end of the year. (TechCrunch understands it’s shipping much sooner. Raise Financial Services&#8217; offerings will have some similarities with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/another-major-fintech-exit-as-sofi-acquires-banking-and-payments-platform-galileo-for-1-2b/">SoFi</a> and Goldman Sachs&#8217; Marcus.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This morning I want to dig more deeply into Coinbase's user numbers, its asset mix, its growing subscription incomes, its competitive landscape and who owns what in the company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Coinbase S-1 is out! And hot <em>damn,</em> did the company have a good fourth quarter.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has a first look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/coinbase-files-to-go-public-in-a-key-listing-for-the-cryptocurrency-category/">the company&#8217;s headline numbers</a>. But in case you&#8217;ve been busy, the key things to understand are that Coinbase was an impressive company in 2019 with more than a half-billion in revenue and a modest net loss. In 2020, the company grew sharply to more than $1.2 billion in revenue, providing it with lots of net income.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The company&#8217;s Q4 2020 was about as big as its entire 2019 in revenue terms, albeit much more profitable because the sum was concentrated in a single quarter instead of spread out over four.</p>
<p>However, beyond the top-level numbers are a host of details to explore. I want to dig more deeply into Coinbase&#8217;s user numbers, its asset mix, its growing subscription incomes, its competitive landscape and who owns what in the company. At the end, we&#8217;ll riff on a chart that discusses the correlation between crypto assets and the stock market, just for fun.</p>
<p>Sound good? You can read along in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm">the S-1 here</a> if you want, and I will provide page numbers as we go.</p>
<h2>Inside Coinbase&#8217;s direct listing</h2>
<p>To make things simpler, we&#8217;ll frame our digging in the form of questions, starting with: <em><strong>How many users did Coinbase need to generate its huge 2020 revenue gains?</strong></em></p>
<p>The answer: not as many as I expected. In 2019, Coinbase generated $533.7 million from what it describes as 1 million &#8220;Monthly Transacting Users&#8221; (page 14). That works out to $533.7 in revenue per MTU for the year.</p>
<p>In 2020, Coinbase generated $1.28 billion in revenue off of 2.8 million MTUs, which works out to around $457 apiece during the year. That&#8217;s a bit lower, but not terribly so. And given that the company&#8217;s transaction margins ranged in the mid-80s percent during much of 2020, each Coinbase active trader was still quite valuable, even at a lower revenue point.</p>
<p>As we noted in our first look at the company&#8217;s economics, Coinbase&#8217;s metrics are highly variable. Its MTU figure is no exception. O<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">bserve the following chart from its S-1 filing (page 95):</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2117802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.37.30-AM.png?w=591" alt="" width="591" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.37.30-AM.png 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.37.30-AM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.37.30-AM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.37.30-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Q1 2018 was nearly as popular in MTU terms as its final quarter of 2020. And from that point in time, the company&#8217;s MTUs fell 70 percent to its Q1 2019 nadir. That&#8217;s a lot of variance.</p>
<p>The company itself notes in its filing that &#8220;MTUs have historically been correlated with both the price of Bitcoin and Crypto Asset Volatility,&#8221; though the company does point out that it expects such correlations to diminish over time.</p>
<p>The answer to our question is that it only takes a few million MTUs for Coinbase to be a huge business. But the other side of that point is that Coinbase has shown twice in two years (2018, 2019) that the number of traders on its platform can decline.</p>
<p><strong><em>What assets do Coinbase users hold? </em></strong>This is a question that I am sure many of you crypto enthusiasts have. But first, what does the Coinbase user asset <em>base </em>look like? Like this, historically (page 96):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2117805" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.42.27-AM.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.42.27-AM.png 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.42.27-AM.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.42.27-AM.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-8.42.27-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /></p>
<p>Holy shit, right? The chart shows two things. First, the rapid appreciation of cryptocurrencies overall, which you can spy in the upward kick of the black line. And then the blue bars show how the assets on Coinbase&#8217;s platform grew from $17 billion at the start of 2020 to $90 billion by year&#8217;s end.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://memmo.me">Memmo.me</a>, a startup allowing users to pay celebrities for personalized video messages, is announcing that it has raised $10 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re really excited about our mission to break down these barriers [and help talent] connect one-to-one instead of one-to-thousands,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Gustav Lundberg Toresson.</p>
<p>He added that celebrities are embracing this as a new source of income. It&#8217;s particularly appealing during the pandemic, but he predicted that celebrities will still be excited about &#8220;making this much money from their living rooms&#8221; after the pandemic ends.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept probably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">reminds you of Cameo</a> (indeed, Carole Baskin of &#8220;Tiger King&#8221; fame has a presence on both platforms), but while Cameo is U.S.-based, Memmo was founded in Stockholm, and Lundberg Toresson said its strategy is both global and localized — the company is currently operating localized marketplaces for Sweden, Germany, Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Canada, as well as a general global market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be the place where you can find everyone from world famous talents like a soccer or basketball star, to the local musician down the road,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about using localization to help you find who&#8217;s most relevant for you, wherever you are.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uaJZJCmRY3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cameo raises $50M to deliver personalized messages from celebrities &#038; influencers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/embed/#?secret=uaJZJCmRY3" data-secret="uaJZJCmRY3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup says it has been used to send more than 100,000 messages globally, and that sales grew 50% every month between July of last year and January 2021.</p>
<p>The round was led by Left Lane Capital, with the firm&#8217;s founder and managing parter Harley Miller joining the Memmo board. Delivery Hero co-founder Lukasz Gadowski, FJ Labs, Depop CEO Maria Raga, Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff, former Groupon operations director Inbal Leshem, Voi Technology co-founder Fredrik Hjelm, former Udemy CEO Dennis Yang and Wolt co-founder Elias Aalto also participated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been impressed with the pace at which Memmo has expanded their offering across markets, where localization is critical to unlocking marketplace liquidity,&#8221; Miller said in a statement. &#8220;The ability to monetize the gap between wealth and fame for talent &amp; celebrities, all the while allowing them to engage deeply with fans, is a trend that was only further underscored by the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Left Lane is based in New York, Lundberg Toresson said he was particularly excited about the firm&#8217;s marketplace expertise, and that its investment does not signal an imminent U.S. launch.</p>
<p>Memmo has now raised a total of $12 million. The new funding will allow the startup to add new features like live videos and to build out its business offerings, where companies can hire celebrities to create promotional videos for external marketing or internal employee motivation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monetizable mood boards might sound like the moonshot idea that no one asked for, but when you think about it, the vision is already informally happening in various corners of the internet. A young generation of users shops with community in mind, whether that’s buying merchandise from your favorite influencers or giving into those <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">Instagram advertisements </a>after spending way too much time on the grid.</p>
<p>As more users think of shopping as a social, digital-first activity, <a href="https://thelanding.app/">The Landing</a>, a seed-stage startup coming out of stealth, is hoping to win over those who have an affinity for designing homes and spaces. On The Landing, users can create, and shop from, room designs to help furnish their homes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117878" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="727" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=768,545 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=1536,1090 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=2048,1454 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pr-workspace.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117878" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> The Landing</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There&#8217;s no contextually rich, visual shopping destination, where you could curate and discover and share and shop all in one place,” co-founder Miri Buckland said. The Landing hopes to be that destination.</p>
<p>Started by Buckland and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellie-buckingham-305817b4"> Ellie Buckingham</a>, The Landing is launching with $2.5 million in financing, in a round led by Aileen Lee at Cowboy Ventures. Lee will be taking a board seat. Other investors include Dara Treseder, the CMO of Peloton, Manish Chandra and Tracy Sun, the founders of Poshmark, Unshackled, Designer Fund, and Progression Fund.</p>
<p>The Landing began as a pandemic pivot. Buckland and Buckingham were always interested in solving the pain point of contextual furnishing for users, but began by physically moving people into apartments and helping them set up different furniture. Then, the pandemic hit and limited the ability to do <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/startups-rethink-what-it-means-to-be-high-touch-during-a-pandemic/">high-touch services</a>. Buckingham says that this was “potentially the best forcing function” to focus on what kind of business The Landing wanted to be.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to be the person moving into your apartment with a couch,” she said. “It was about the importance of empowering creativity and empowering individuals to create digital and physical spaces.” That’s when they dropped the moving service business, and instead used furnishing as a vector to solve the problem of contextual and social e-commerce.</p>
<p>It’s a smart idea that has not gone unnoticed. Houzz, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/sequoia-backed-houzz-scraps-plan-to-create-home-goods-in-house/">a Sequoia-backed home improvement startup</a>, connects users to products from third-party retailers as well as services from architects, designers, or contractors. There’s also Modsy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/modsy-scores-37m-to-virtually-redesign-your-home/">which has raised north of $70 million to date</a>, which helps users virtually redesign their homes.</p>
<p>Buckingham worked for Modsy when she was at business school, where she first started noticing that she disagreed with the startups’ main thesis.</p>
<p>“Their motto was basically a digital rendition of an existing human service,” she said. “And I came away from the experience not super convinced that the service model was the scalable, future answer to consumerization of access to design.” She noticed that the younger generation was looking for a self-serve, customizable answer, instead.</p>

<p>The Landing is launching with creative tooling capabilities, which allow users to build and design spaces within its platform. In the coming months, the team is focused on adding a social layer atop the design tool, with features like profiles, discovery, fede, and commenting.</p>
<p>The Landing’s Slack channel is currently being used to discuss these features and what is most in-demand from early users.</p>
<p>The founders aren’t worried about a lack of demand, or only being a platform for the few times that people furnish their homes throughout their lifespan. As Buckland pointed out, people browse Zillow all the time, and have Reddit channels about dream homes, creating designs, and more. The startup is aiming to serve that population as well &#8212; the dreamers and not just the realists.</p>

<p>The most notable case is Union Square Ventures, the prominent venture firm where Fred Wilson co-led the Series A round into the company back in 2013, <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2013/05/coinbase/">which was the first investment made under the firm’s then newly christened blockchain thesis</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past two years — which is the extent of disclosures that Coinbase includes in its S-1 filing — USV has been rapidly selling off its holdings in the company across multiple transactions, mostly selling to other venture firms around the cap table. Since late 2019, the firm has sold off approximately 28% of its holdings in Coinbase.</p>
<p>USV currently owns about 7.3% of Coinbase’s outstanding shares, or roughly 13.9 million of a total of 191.3 million based on Coinbase’s disclosed share count. As the following table indicates, USV has conducted four separately-dated transactions to sell nearly 5.5 million shares of its holdings in secondary transactions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2117876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=2048,1205 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/coinbase-secondaries.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Fellow early-stage fintech investor Ribbit Capital, which joined USV in the Series A, also conducted a smaller secondary transaction in November 2019, selling a bit less than 5% of its outstanding shares (559,228 of 11,995,949 shares).</p>
<p>What’s interesting is not just that USV in particular is selling a large part of its holdings, but also the price they were willing to sell at. According to Coinbase’s filing, USV sold 3.35 million shares at $23 per share in late 2019, and later sold about 2 million shares at $28.83 per share in mid-2020.</p>
<p>Those prices are well-below Coinbase’s Series E price per share of $36.19, which it received in late 2019. It’s also below the price set by the secondary transactions of Coinbase CEO and co-founder Brian Armstrong and Paradigm founder and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who received $32.57 for their shares in late 2018.</p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of nuances to consider here. The secondary sale of preferred shares will typically convert to common (even if the sale is to another preferred shareholder), which means that the shares sold would hold fewer investor rights and provisions, and therefore, are intrinsically worth less to investors. This was the case with Coinbase as it disclosed in its filing, and that may explain at least some of the gap in the price.</p>
<p>The timing of USV’s investment is also perhaps notable. The bulk of USV’s investment in Coinbase comes from its 2012 vintage fund, which if it follows default industry practice, has a targeted 10-year shelf life. That means that the fund is designed to pay out its returns by 2022 — which was quickly coming up for the firm back in 2019 and 2020. There may have been some pressure to sell at least some of the firm’s stake early to make the firm’s LPs happier.</p>
<p>It’s also useful to note that USV and Ribbit mostly sold to other, existing investors like A16Z and Paradigm, which shows that other investors deeply burrowed on the cap table were quite excited to put more money to work in Coinbase, even at a fairly late stage.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it’s rare for an ambitious fund like USV to sell arguably its single most important investment of all time just a year or two before what may well be one of the largest blockbuster IPOs of 2021. At a valuation of $100 billion let’s say (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">which is what Coinbase priced at a recent private market transaction</a>), USV’s stake would be worth about $7.3 billion. Yet, the shares it sold over the past two years would have been worth several billion at exit, and it sold them for about $140 million in cash.</p>

<p>The mystery here is perhaps solved a bit. Fred Wilson, <a href="https://avc.com/2018/01/taking-money-off-the-table/">in a blog post from early 2018</a>, talked about “taking money off the table” in earlier USV investments like Twitter, where the firm “sold about 30% of our position in those two secondary transactions for about $250mm and returned 2x the entire fund to our investors.” Then referring to crypto, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are sitting on 20x, 50x, 100x your money on a crypto investment, it would not be a mistake to sell 10%, 20% or even 30% of your position. Selling 25% of your position on an investment that is up 50x is booking a 12.5x on the entire investment, while allowing you to keep 75% of it going. I know that many crypto holders think that selling anything is a mistake. And it might be. Or it might not be. You just don’t know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, he took money off the table. It’s a financially-astute, risk-adjusted approach, even if it left billions of returns behind. A16Z and Paradigm are, I am sure, quite pleased to have made the purchase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just ahead of its 2021 virtual investor day on Thursday, Twitter this morning <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIR/status/1364941826872856582">announced</a> its three long-term goals focused on user base and revenue growth, and a faster pace of shipping new features across its platform. The company said it aims to &#8220;at least&#8221; double its total annual revenue from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more in 2023. It also expects to reach at least 315 million mDAUs &#8212; that&#8217;s Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/twitter-is-slowly-perfecting-the-art-of-inventing-nonsensical-performance-metrics/">self-invented metric</a> for &#8220;monetizable&#8221; daily active users &#8212; by the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>That would represent a roughly 20% compound annual growth rate from Twitter&#8217;s base of 152 million mDAUs reported in the fourth quarter of 2019, the company noted in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000119312521055879/d274932d8k.htm">new SEC filing</a>.</p>

<p>Active user growth has been difficult for Twitter &#8212; the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">growth</a> tends to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">slow</a> or even <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/twitter-posts-strong-revenue-result-in-q3-as-user-growth-slows/588093/">flat</a>, at times. Per Twitter&#8217;s most recent earnings, mDAUs in the fourth quarter 2020 had<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/twitter-twtr-q4-2020-earnings.html"> reached 192 million</a> instead of the 193.5 million expected, for instance. Investors are used to Twitter under-delivering on this metric &#8212; or even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18213567/twitter-to-stop-sharing-mau-as-users-decline-q4-2018-earnings">inventing</a> its own user base metric to hide that its monthly user growth sometimes declines.</p>
<p>In any event, Twitter&#8217;s longer-term plans indicate it believes it will finally be able to deliver on user growth &#8212; perhaps aided by its investment in new features.</p>
<p>In its filing, Twitter said it would &#8220;double development velocity by the end of 2023,&#8221; which means doubling the number of features shipped per employee that &#8220;directly drive either mDAU or revenue,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>On this front, Twitter has been fairly active in recent months. Late last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">launched its &#8220;stories&#8221; feature called Fleets</a> to its global audience. It&#8217;s also now testing new features including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">a Clubhouse rival, Twitter Spaces</a>, and a community-led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">misinformation debunking effort known as Birdwatch</a>. And it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquired newsletter platform Revue,</a> which is already now integrated on the Twitter website. The company has made smaller acquisitions, as well, to build out product teams, including with social app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/twitter-acquires-screen-sharing-social-app-squad/">Squad</a>, stories template maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/twitter-chroma-stories/">Chroma Labs</a>, and podcasting app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>.</p>
<p>New features may help to attract increased Twitter usage, but revenue growth will also come from diversification beyond advertising. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/twitter-confirms-plans-to-experiment-with-new-models-like-subscriptions-in-2021/">has spoken several times about its plans</a> to build out a subscription product, which the company said would begin in 2021 but wouldn&#8217;t impact Twitter revenue in the near-term. The company has also said it may investigate other areas of monetization, like tipping and various paid consumer-facing features.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter said publicly it plans to reach the $7.5 billion or more target by &#8220;growing our audience and gaining advertising market share in both brand and direct response.&#8221; But the company did not speak to its plans for subscriptions.</p>
<p>Investors are already responding favorably to Twitter&#8217;s announcements this morning. Twitter stock is up by nearly 7% as of the time of writing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s essential for older companies to recognize changes in the marketplace or face the brutal reality of being left in the dust. <a href="https://www.f5.com/">F5</a> is an old-school company that launched back in the 90s, yet has been able to transform a number of times in its history to avoid major disruption. Over the last two years, the company has continued that process of redefining itself, this time using a trio of acquisitions &#8212; NGINX, Shape Security and Volterra &#8212; totaling $2.2 billion to push in a new direction.</p>
<p>While F5 has been associated with applications management for some time, it recognized that the way companies developed and managed applications was changing in a big way with the shift to Kubernetes, microservices and containerization. At the same time, applications have been increasingly moving to the edge, closer to the user. The company understood that it needed to up its game in these areas if it was going to keep up with customers.</p>
<p>Taken separately, it would be easy to miss that there was a game plan behind the three acquisitions, but together they show a company with a clear opinion of where they want to go next. We spoke to F5 president and CEO François Locoh-Donou to learn why he bought these companies and to figure out the method in his company&#8217;s acquisition spree madness.</p>
<h2>Looking back, looking forward</h2>
<p>F5, which was founded in 1996, has found itself at a number of crossroads in its long history, times where it needed to reassess its position in the market. A few years ago it found itself at one such juncture. The company had successfully navigated the shift from physical appliance to virtual, and from data center to cloud. But it also saw the shift to cloud native on the horizon and it knew it had to be there to survive and thrive long term.</p>
<p>&#8220;We moved from just keeping applications performing to actually keeping them performing and secure. Over the years, we have become an application delivery and security company. And that&#8217;s really how F5 grew over the last 15 years,&#8221; said Locoh-Donou.</p>
<p>Today the company has over 18,000 customers centered in enterprise verticals like financial services, healthcare, government, technology and telecom. He says that the focus of the company has always been on applications and how to deliver and secure them, but as they looked ahead, they wanted to be able to do that in a modern context, and that&#8217;s where the acquisitions came into play.</p>
<p>As F5 saw it, applications were becoming central to their customers&#8217; success and their IT departments were expending too many resources connecting applications to the cloud and keeping them secure. So part of the goal for these three acquisitions was to bring a level of automation to this whole process of managing modern applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is you fast forward five or 10 years, we are going to move to a world where applications will become adaptive, which essentially means that we are going to bring automation to the security and delivery and performance of applications, so that a lot of that stuff gets done in a more native and automated way,&#8221; Locoh-Donou said.</p>
<p>As part of this shift, the company saw customers increasingly using microservices architecture in their applications. This means instead of delivering a large monolithic application, developers were delivering them in smaller pieces inside containers, making it easier to manage, deploy and update.</p>
<p>At the same time, it saw companies needing a new way to secure these applications as they shifted from data center to cloud to the edge. And finally, that shift to the edge would require a new way to manage applications.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While credit cards are commonplace in the United States, they are far less ubiquitous in many other countries, particularly those in Latin America. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mexico in particular, cash remains the dominant method of payment with </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated 86% of all payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being in the form of cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But card usage is growing as more people are shopping online than ever before. According to one </span><a href="https://pattern.com/blog/the-worlds-top-5-fastest-growing-ecommerce-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mexico topped the list of the world’s fastest growing e-commerce markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 37% of Mexicans over 15 years old </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/12/10/mexicans-lack-access-to-credit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have a bank account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to recent World Bank stats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these factors clearly make the country ripe for fintech innovation. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for the founders of Mexico City-based startup </span><a href="http://storicard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stori</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they spell opportunity.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2117858" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2117858" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2117858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="695" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg 2040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=768,521 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=680,461 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1042 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Stori-Team.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2117858" class="wp-caption-text">From left to right, Stori founding team Juan Villaseñor, Marlene Garayzar, Bin Chen, Camila Burne</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stori launched its credit card product in Mexico in January 2020 and has so far had more than 1 million customers apply for a card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the founding team spent years at Capital One honing their skills in underwriting underserved populations while others worked at the likes of Mastercard, Morgan Stanley, GE Money, HSBC and Intel in Mexico and the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the company has raised a $32.5 million Series B round with the goal of “becoming Mexico’s leading credit card issuer for the rising middle class.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightspeed Venture Partners led the company’s financing, which brings Stori&#8217;s total raised since its early 2018 inception to $50 million. According to Lightspeed Partner </span><a href="https://lsvp.com/team/mercedes-bent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercedes Bent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the investment marked her firm’s first large investment in the Latin American region “with more to come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Vision Plus Capital, BAI Capital and Source Code Capital also participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stori provides credit cards with “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 100% mobile app-based experience” to the rising middle income population in Mexico. The team spent its first two years building out the startup&#8217;s infrastructure and platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2021, the fintech&#8217;s monthly new customer growth was 14 times than what it saw in January 2020 and 6 times the company’s monthly average for 2020, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-founder Bin Chen. He declined to reveal its current total of customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Mexican market is so huge (the country has a population of nearly 130 million), Stori is currently only focused on serving the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as in other parts of the world, Stori saw tailwinds in the COVID-19 pandemic in that it fueled customer demand for a way to pay digitally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consumers in Mexico are increasingly using e-commerce and app-based services like ride hailing and delivery and credit cards are the preferred payment methods in those channels,” Chen said. “They’re experiencing more cash flow fluctuation and irregular expenses and need access to flexible credit that can meet short term needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, during pandemic-related lockdowns, more people are turning to digital financial offerings to avoid visiting bank branches in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One commonality among all of Stori’s co-founders, according to Chen, is that each “comes from a modest background.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all experienced the feeling of being excluded from the traditional financial service world. As an international student pursuing my master’s degree in Illinois more than twenty years ago, I was relying solely on teaching assistantship to cover my study and living expenses,” Chen recalled. “I often ran out of money, and had a hard time to make ends meet – I received many rejections before I got my first credit card.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mission in the U.S., Stori’s founders are working to give middle and low-income customers that are “new to the formal financial system” an opportunity to access credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to grow its customer base, boost headcount and invest in product design, technology infrastructure and underwriting, said Chen, who previously worked at Capital One and Mastercard in both U.S. and emerging markets. Today, Stori has 80 employees spread across offices in Mexico, U.S. and China, up from 40 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to become a leading digital bank for the underserved population in the region,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Lightspeed first met the company’s founders over a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were struck by the depth of their experience. They navigated the pitfalls of Covid masterfully &#8212; without the benefit of a US style stimulus &#8212; and showed that their underwriting models were strong and improving,” Bent said. “That is a reflection of the quality of the team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yiran Liu, a partner at China-based </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vision-plus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision Plus Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says the firm led Stori’s Series A round and “continues to be super pro rata in this round.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a structural thesis on digital fintech models and are investing in these models globally, particularly in emerging markets,” Liu said in a written statement. “We are impressed by the team’s execution and excited by the local market opportunity as evidenced by the rapid growth.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every business needs to track fundamental financial information, but the data typically lives in a variety of silos making it a constant challenge to understand a company&#8217;s overall financial health. <a href="https://datajoy.com/">DataJoy</a>, an early stage startup, wants to solve that issue. The company announced a $6 million seed round today led by Foundation Capital with help from Quarry VC, Partech Partners, IGSB, Bow Capital and SVB.</p>
<p>Like many startup founders, CEO Jon Lee has experienced the frustration first hand of trying to gather this financial data, and he decided to start a company to deal with it once and for all. &#8220;The reason why I started this company was that I was really frustrated at Copper, my last company because it was really hard just to find the answers to simple business questions in my data,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>These include basic questions like how the business is doing this quarter, if there are any surprises that could throw the company off track and where are the best places to invest in the business to accelerate more quickly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has decided to concentrate its efforts for starters on SaaS companies and their requirements. &#8220;We basically focus on taking the work out of revenue intelligence, and just give you the insights that successful companies in the SaaS vertical depend on to be the largest and fastest growing in the market,&#8221; Lee explained.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a product with a way to connect to key business systems, pull the data and answer a very specific set of business questions, while using machine learning to provide more proactive advice.</p>
<p>While the company is still in the process of building the product and is pre-revenue, it has begun developing the pieces to ultimately help companies answer these questions. Eventually it will have a set of connectors to various key systems like Salesforce for CRM, HubSpot and Marketo for marketing, Netsuite for ERP, Gainsight for customer experience and Amplitude for product intelligence.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Polytomic announces $2.4M seed to move business data where it&#8217;s needed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/polytomic-announces-2-4m-seed-to-move-business-data-where-its-needed/embed/#?secret=ATt9VwEpn7" data-secret="ATt9VwEpn7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lee says the set of connectors will be as specific as the questions themselves and based on their research with potential customers and what they are using to track this information. Ashu Garg, general partner at lead investor Foundation Capital says that he was attracted to the founding team&#8217;s experience, but also to the fact they were solving a problem he sees all the time sitting on the boards of various SaaS startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spend my life in the board meetings. It&#8217;s what I do, and every CEO, every board is looking for straight answers for what should be obvious questions, but they require this intersection of data,&#8221; Garg said. He says to an extent, it&#8217;s only possible now due to the evolution of technology to pull this all together in a way that simplifies this process.</p>
<p>The company currently has 11 employees with plans to double that by the middle of this year. As a long-time entrepreneur, Lee says that he has found that building a diverse workforce is essential to building a successful company. &#8220;People have found diversity usually [results in a company that is] more productive, more creative and works faster,&#8221; Lee said. He said that that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to focus on diversity from the earliest days of the company, while being proactive to make that happen. For example, ensuring you have a diverse set of candidates to choose from when you are reviewing resumes.</p>
<p>For now, the company is 100% remote. In fact, Lee and his co-founder Chief Product Officer Ken Wong, who was previously ran AI and machine learning at Tableau, have yet to meet in person, but they are hoping that changes soon. The company will eventually have a presence in Vancouver and San Mateo whenever offices start to open.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sales and marketing are often considered a single category on a business plan, but ironically, when it comes to building apps and services to help with them, they usually become separate entities, and so too do the teams that address sales and marketing in organizations. Today, however, a startup called<a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://terminus.com/"> Terminus</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; which is building a platform that views sales and marketing in a more integrated way, through account-based marketing &#8212; is announcing funding and growth, a sign of how its approach is gaining more traction.</span></p>
<p>The startup has closed a Series C of $90 million, at a valuation we understand from sources to be around $400 million. This is a huge jump on Terminus&#8217;s valuation in its last round, which was $96 million post-money in 2018, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/98305-30/company/profile#insights">PitchBook data</a>.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the hike is likely because of the huge focus that digital marketing has had especially in the last year &#8212; a time when, because of the pandemic, a lot of more legacy and traditional channels have ceased to be as visible). Account-based marketing alone was <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/account-based-marketing-market">estimated</a>, in 2018, to be a $458 billion market opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another reason for interest in Terminus specifically is because of its customer record within that. It has around 1,000 enterprise customers, including divisions of IBM, Salesforce, Thomson Reuters, and <a href="https://www.featuredcustomers.com/vendor/terminus/customers">more</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re building the new marketing automation,&#8221; said CEO Tim Kopp in an interview. &#8220;We think account-based marketing is the most important thing to have happened in sales software. Teams are switching from lead-based to account-based approaches, and we&#8217;ve now moved into addressing all points of engagement, a modern B2B marketing cloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>The equity round is being led by Great Hill Partners, with previous investors Atlanta Ventures and Edison Partners, and new backer Hallet Capital also participating. The funding brings the total raised by Terminus &#8212; co-headquartered in Atlanta, GA and Indianapolis, IN &#8212; to about $120 million.</p>
<p>The world of marketing has seen a huge shift in the two decades, with the rise in internet consumption, and the proliferation of digital services, driving a big business in what is now collectively called &#8220;martech&#8221;.</p>
<p>The area that Terminus specifically focuses on within that is account-based marketing. In short, this is a way for B2B sales and marketing teams to conceive of potential targets at a business not as individual entities but collective groups. This means a more joined up effort to work across whole organizations, providing a way to market something to more than one person, increasing the chances of connecting with someone to then make the sale.</p>
<p>Terminus&#8217; platform and approach, CEO Kopp points out, essentially brings the functions of sales and marketing together, instead of needing to hand off work from one to the other (eliminating the admin and cost of working across different software within those groups as part of that).</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We see an overwhelming opportunity in bringing together marketing and sales,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;Marketing is joining in on sales meetings and sales has become a part of the client success, where you are marketing to your own customers. It&#8217;s an area where customers stink because they typically come at it from the sales or marketing side.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Terminus&#8217; platform today consists of a &#8220;data studio&#8221; that brings together sales intelligence, account information, and other data sources to help compile a list of would-be targets. On top of this, it also has been building out a marketing engine that includes the ability to build advertising, email and web campaigns, and chatbot management. Some of this has been built in-house, and some has come to the company by way of acquisitions (for example the chat functionality comes by way of its <a href="https://terminus.com/blog/ramble-acquisition-account-based-chat/">acquisition of Ramble</a> last April).</p>
<p>Terminus is by far not the only company working in this area. Others include Marketo (part of Adobe), 6sense, Sendoso and many others. Terminus&#8217;s approach is to bring different aspects of the marketing and sales process (analytics, orchestration, automation and execution) into one platform.</p>
<p>Fittingly, the startup&#8217;s name was based on an early nickname for Atlanta, and used as a reference to its aim of being the single for its customers&#8217; various marketing and sales activities.</p>
<p>This is one reason why investors have been knocking.</p>
<p>“Terminus continues to redefine how teams go to market, innovating how companies generate revenue in a digital-first environment,” said Derek Schoettle, a growth partner at Great Hill. “We’ve been so impressed with this team, the company’s significant growth over the last year, its continued product innovation, and the huge market opportunity ahead.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lob.com/">Lob</a> is a startup promising to help businesses deliver physical mail more quickly and affordably, and with more personalization.</p>
<p>The company estimates that its platform has been used to deliver mail to one in two U.S. households. And today, it&#8217;s announcing that it has raised $50 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>CEO Leore Avidar told me he founded Lob with Harry Zhang nearly a decade ago to &#8220;allow people to send mail programmatically.&#8221; Over time, the company has become increasingly focused on enterprise clients — its 8,500-plus customers include Twitter, Expedia and Booking.com — although Avidar said it will always offer a product for small businesses as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Avidar explained that in a digital age, there are two main categories of physical mail that Lob continues to support for its customers. First, there&#8217;s mail sent for &#8220;a regulatory purpose, a compliance purpose&#8221; — in other words, mail that businesses are legally required to send in printed form. Second, there&#8217;s direct mail sent as marketing, which Avidar said many companies are rediscovering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marketing as a whole is always trying to find a unique channel in order to make their customer aware of whatever their call to action is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now, social is really expensive, Google AdWords is super expensive, with email you can easily unsubscribe. No one’s been paying attention to direct mail, and the prices don’t scale with supply and demand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lob says that it can reduce the execution time on a direct mail campaign by 95%, from 90 days to less than a day. For the actual printing and delivery, it has built out a network of partners across the country. And other companies like PostPilot and Postalytics are building on top of the Lob platform.</p>
<p>The startup has now raised $80 million in total funding. The new round was led by Y Combinator Continuity Fund — Lob participated in the YC accelerator and the Continuity Fund also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/lob-tries-to-maximize-snail-mail-efficiency-with-another-20m/">led the startup&#8217;s previous funding</a>.</p>
<p>Avidar said the company is planning to triple the amount of physical mail delivered through the platform this year, which means the round will allow it to continue expanding the Print Delivery Network, as well as increasing headcount to more than 260 employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lob is leading the digital transformation of direct mail, a business process used by every company on Earth that has remained virtually untouched by software,” said YC Managing Partner and Lob board member Ali Rowghani in a statement. “Lob&#8217;s platform delivers exceptional value to some of the world&#8217;s largest senders of direct mail by lowering cost and improving deliverability, tracking, reporting, and ROI. Even for the most sophisticated senders of direct mail, Lob&#8217;s API-driven product is vastly superior to legacy approaches.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://morphais.com/">MorphAIs</a> is a new VC out of Berlin, aiming to leverage AI algorithms to boost its investment decisions in early-stage startups. But there&#8217;s a catch: it hasn&#8217;t raised a fund yet.</p>
<p>The firm was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eva-val%C3%A9rie-gfrerer-37905283/?originalSubdomain=de">Eva-Valérie Gfrerer</a> who was previously head of Growth Marketing at FinTech startup OptioPay and her background is in Behavioural Science and Advanced Information Systems.</p>
<p>Gfrerer says she started MorphAIs to be a tech company, using AI to assess venture investments and then selling that as a service. But after a while, she realized the platform could be applied an in-house fund, hence the drive to now raise a fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MorphAIs has already received financing from some serial entrepreneurs, including: Max Laemmle, CEO &amp; Founder Fraugster, previously Better Payment and SumUp; Marc-Alexander Christ, Co-Founder SumUp, previously Groupon (CityDeal) and JP Morgan Chase; Charles Fraenkl, CEO SmartFrog, previously CEO at Gigaset and AOL; Andreas Winiarski, Chairman &amp; Founder awesome capital Group.</p>
<p>She says: “It’s been decades since there has been any meaningful innovation in the processes by which venture capital is allocated. We have built technology to re-invent those processes and push the industry towards more accurate allocation of capital and a less-biased and more inclusive start-up ecosystem.”</p>
<p>She points out that over 80% of early-stage VC funds don’t deliver the minimum expected return rate to their investors. This is true, but admittedly, the VC industry is almost built to throw a lot of money away, in the hope that it will pick the winner that makes up for all the losses.</p>
<p>She now plans to aim for a pre-seed/seed fund, backed by a team consisting of machine learning scientists, mathematicians, and behavioral scientists, and claims that MorphAIs is modeling consistent 16x return rates, after running real-time predictions based on market data.</p>
<p>Her co-founder is Jan Saputra Müller, CTO and Co-Founder, who co-founded and served as CTO for several machine learning companies, including askby.ai.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one problem: Gfrerer’s approach is not unique. For instance, London-based Inreach Ventures has made a big play of using data to hunt down startups. And every other VC in Europe does something similar, more or less.</p>
<p>Will Gfrerer manage to pull off something spectacular? We shall have to wait and find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlanta is coming up in the tech world with several newly minted billion-dollar businesses hailing from the ATL and the city&#8217;s local venture capital community is taking notice.</p>
<p>Even as later stage firms like the newly minted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/launching-panoramic-ventures-atlantas-bip-capital-adds-a-new-partner-and-plans-300-million-new-vc-fund/">BIP Capital rebrand and  with increasingly large funds</a>, earlier stage firms like <a href="https://www.techsquareventures.com/">Tech Square Ventures</a> are staffing up and adding new partners.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s latest hire is Vasant Kamath, a general partner who joins the firm from Primus Capital, a later stage investment vehicle based out of Atlanta. Before that, he was managing investments for the private office of the Cox family.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hICGgFXhYe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/launching-panoramic-ventures-atlantas-bip-capital-adds-a-new-partner-and-plans-300-million-new-vc-fund/">Launching Panoramic Ventures, Atlanta&#8217;s BIP Capital adds a new partner and plans $300 million new VC fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launching Panoramic Ventures, Atlanta&#8217;s BIP Capital adds a new partner and plans $300 million new VC fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/launching-panoramic-ventures-atlantas-bip-capital-adds-a-new-partner-and-plans-300-million-new-vc-fund/embed/#?secret=hICGgFXhYe" data-secret="hICGgFXhYe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Originally from Augusta, Ga. Kamath left the south to attend Harvard and then went out west for a stint at Stanford Business School.</p>
<p>In between his jaunts North and West Kamath spent time in Atlanta as an investment banker with Raymond James in the early 2000s, the beginnings of a lifelong professional career in technology. Before business school, Kamath worked at Summit Equity Partners in Boston investing in later stage technology companies.</p>
<p>Kamath settled in Atlanta in 2010 just as a second wave of technology companies began making their presence felt in the city.</p>
<p>The new Tech Square Village general partner pointed to Atlanta&#8217;s underlying tech infrastructure as one reason for the move to early stage. One pillar of that infrastructure is Georgia Tech itself. The school, whose campus abuts the Tech Square Ventures offices, is one of the top engineering universities in the country and the breadth of talent coming out of that program is impressive, Kamath said.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the companies like Airwatch, MailChimp, Calendly and others that represent the resurgence of Atlanta&#8217;s tech scene, Tech Square Ventures&#8217; newest general partner said.</p>
<p>Not only are young companies reinvesting in the city, but big tech giants and telecom players like T-Mobile, Google, and Microsoft are also establishing major offices, accelerators, and incubators in Atlanta.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;There’s a lot of momentum here in early stage and i think it’s building. It’s the right time for a firm like TSV to take advantage of all of the things,&#8221; Kamath said. </span></p>
<p>Another selling point for making the jump to early stage investing was the relationship that Kamath had established with Tech Square Ventures founder, Blake Patton. A serial entrepreneur who&#8217;s committed to building up Atlanta&#8217;s startup ecosystem, Patton has been the architect of Tech Square Ventures&#8217; growth through two separate initiatives.</p>
<p>In all, the firm has $90 million in assets under management. What began with a small pilot fund, Tech Square Ventures Fund 1, (a $5 million investment vehicle) has expanded to include two larger funds raised in conjunction with major industrial corporate partners like AT&amp;T, Chick-Fil-A, Cox Enterprises, Delta, Georgia-Pacific, Georgia Power, The Home Depot, UPS, Goldman Sachs, and Invesco, under the auspices of a program called <a href="https://www.engage.vc/about/">Engage</a>. Those funds total $54 million in AUM and the firm is halfway toward closing a much larger second flagship fund under the Tech Square Ventures name with a $75 million target.</p>
<p>All this activity has led to a blossoming entrepreneurial community that early stage funds like Tech Square Ventures hopes to tap.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see a fair number of folks from these large corporations spinning out and starting things themselves,&#8221; said Kamath. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a decade plus, you have multiple entrepreneurs doing really well and increasing acceleration in terms of climate and exits.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And more firms from outside of the region are beginning to take notice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that is happening,&#8221; said Kamath. &#8220;You might seen investment from outside the region. At the seed stage it’s harder you do need to have feet on the ground right when they’re starting and building their business. Once they’ve been vetted and had that early round of investment you will definitely see a lot of activity. We’re seeing more investment at the Series A and B from out of town. That’s the strategy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>It all points to a burgeoning startup scene that&#8217;s based in a collaborative approach, which should be good not only for Tech Square Ventures, but the other early stage funds like Atlanta Ventures, Outlander Labs, BLH Ventures, Knoll Ventures and Overline, that working to support the city&#8217;s entrepreneurs, Kamath said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online advertising can be a &#8220;pretty dry topic,&#8221; as Facebook&#8217;s head of brand marketing Andrew Stirk acknowledged, but with a new campaign of its own, the social networking giant is looking to &#8220;bring to life how personalized ads level the playing field&#8221; for small businesses.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/lets-talk-about-why-personalized-ads-matter/">Good Ideas Deserve To Be Found campaign</a> will include TV, radio and digital advertising. Individual businesses will also be able to promote it using a new Instagram sticker and the #DeserveToBeFound hashtag on Facebook.</p>
<p>The campaign will highlight specific small businesses on Facebook, including bag and luggage company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/houseoftakura/">House of Takura</a>, whose founder Annette Njau spoke about the benefits of digital advertising at a press event yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What those platforms allow us to do is, they allow us to tell stories,&#8221; Njau said. &#8220;I can’t tell this story on TV, I can’t tell this story in a huge magazine because it costs money and I don’t know who will see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>These sentiments are similar to a campaign that Facebook launched last year in opposition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature</a>, where apps will have to ask for permission before sharing user data for third-party ad targeting. In response, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">Facebook claimed</a> that it was &#8220;standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere,&#8221; though the social network also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/facebook-q4-earnings-2/">pointed to these changes</a> as one of the &#8220;more significant advertising headwinds&#8221; that it expects to face this year. (Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook, in contrast, has said that these changes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">provide consumers with the control that they&#8217;ve been asking for</a>.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Rd7bbfvu3I"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/">Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Tim Cook warns of adtech fuelling a &#8216;social catastrophe&#8217; as he defends app tracker opt-in&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/apples-tim-cook-warns-of-adtech-fuelling-a-social-catastrophe-as-he-defends-app-tracker-opt-in/embed/#?secret=Rd7bbfvu3I" data-secret="Rd7bbfvu3I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When asked how this fits into the broader dispute with Apple, Stirk said that while Facebook has been publicly opposed to Apple&#8217;s changes, this campaign is part the company&#8217;s longer-term support for small business.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a degree of urgency in the fact that &#8230; small businesses are hurting right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Head of Facebook Business Products Helen Ma added that this is &#8220;very much an extension of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/facebook-and-instagram-ad-new-features-to-help-you-find-and-support-local-businesses/">the work that we did on the product side</a> at the very start of the COVID period,&#8221; which included the launch of the Businesses Nearby section and a #SupportSmallBusiness hashtag.</p>
<p>In addition to launching the campaign today, Facebook is announcing several product changes, including a simplified Ads Manager dashboard, new options for restaurants to provide more information about their dining experiences and more information about personalized ads in Facebook&#8217;s Business Resource hub and Instagram&#8217;s Professional Dashboard.</p>
<p>The company also said it will continue to waive fees on transactions through Checkouts on Shops through June 2021, and will do the same for fees collected on paid online events until August 2021 at the earliest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year or so, voice transcription startup <a href="https://otter.ai/">Otter.ai</a> doubled down on the future of remote work by integrating its product with meeting apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">Zoom</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/a-i-powered-transcription-service-otter-ai-can-now-record-from-google-meet/">Google Meet</a>. With the COVID-19 pandemic having sent so many to work from home, those investments have paid off &#8212; the company has transcribed over 100 million meetings with more than 3 billion minutes, and has seen an 8x increase in revenues during 2020. Now, Otter.ai is announcing its next steps, fueled by a new $50 million Series B round of investment.</p>
<p>The new round was led by <a href="https://www.spectrumequity.com/">Spectrum Equity</a>, with participation from existing investors Horizons Ventures, Draper Associates, GGV Ventures, Draper Dragon Fund, and others. The $50 million figure also includes a $10 million convertible note, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/a-i-powered-voice-transcription-app-otter-raises-10m-including-from-new-strategic-investor-ntt-docomo/">announced last year.</a></p>
<p>Otter.ai&#8217;s service offers an easy way to record meetings, whether in-person through an app on your phone, or online through its integrations with popular web conferencing apps. But it&#8217;s the latter that really came into play over the course of 2020, when suddenly entire workforces were sent home from the office and forced into endless Zoom calls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With convenient timing, Otter.ai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/otter-ais-newest-feature-offers-live-interactive-transcripts-of-your-zoom-meetings/">added Zoom integration</a> back in April 2020 &#8212; the early days of the pandemic. It has now become the most popular platform for Otter.ai&#8217;s web conferencing users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think with the pandemic, we&#8217;ve seen a huge shift in consumer behavior &#8212; especially in meeting behavior and education behavior, which are two key use cases for Otter,&#8221; says Otter.ai CMO Kurt Apen. &#8220;You see a lot of teams that are using Otter in the business and you see a lot of students and universities that are using Otter for accessible. And we think that shift in behavior is going to be permanent,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>Though the company doesn&#8217;t talk user numbers or revenues, specifically, it claims to have &#8220;many millions&#8221; on its standalone product, not counting the users it reaches through Zoom. And as those users discover Otter.ai&#8217;s free service, many later upgrade to its <a href="https://otter.ai/pricing">premium plans</a>, which include the ability to record more minutes and access other business-grade features.</p>
<p>To date, this sort of backdoor entry point to the corporate market &#8212; through individual employees first, not the companies &#8212; has somewhat mirrored the trajectories of other popular business apps, the company believes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, if we look at our growth trajectory in the last few year, it matches pretty well against the growth trajectory of Slack and Zoom,&#8221; said Otter.ai founder and CEO, Sam Liang. &#8220;So we&#8217;re pretty confident that, in the next few year, we&#8217;re continuing to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Otter.ai&#8217;s adoption may have been accelerated by the pandemic, but the larger impacts to business culture that took place in 2020 aren&#8217;t going away even when the pandemic ends. Not everyone will be going back to the office. But for those who do, Otter can work there, too.</p>
<p>The company has found some traction with businesses like professional services, pharmaceutical companies, financial services, and other multinationals where employees work across time zones. Longer-term, Otter.ai aims to better serve its corporate use cases by extending beyond meeting transcripts into an area it likes to call &#8220;conversation intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>That involves leveraging A.I. technology to extract meaning from the transcripts by allowing the system to learn what&#8217;s important based on the time spent on topics, the intonation of voices, and the sentiment of the conversations. It would do this in an automated way, as well, much like it works today.</p>
<p>Otter.ai, however, is not a service meant for highly confidential conversations. The recorded conversation is encrypted in transit and at rest, but is decrypted while processing. The conversations also have to be decrypted to create the index. Plus, Otter.ai transcripts are used as training data to improve its accuracy &#8212; learning from users&#8217; manual corrections, from new accents, and the like.</p>
<p>This could ultimately prove to be a limiting factor to large-scale adoption within more sensitive business contexts. But Otter, nevertheless, remains focused more so on its work-related uses cases for the time being, rather than the numerous other areas where its technology can be used &#8212;  like podcast transcriptions, integrations with social audio apps (like Clubhouse), online events, and more. Otter.ai is serving these markets, but it&#8217;s preparing to staff up in sales to gain more corporate clients.</p>
<p>In addition to sales, where it also expects to hire a VP of Sales, Otter plans to grow its now 25-person team with additions across R&amp;D, marketing, A.I. science, backend and frontend engineering, design, and product management. By year-end, it believes it will triple its headcount with the new hires &#8212; some of which may be remote workers.</p>
<p>Otter.ai will also invest the new funds into raising awareness for its app through channels like social and search, content marketing, organic social and more. And it will work to grow revenues through continued free to paid conversations and develop its technology.</p>
<p>John Connolly, Managing Director at Spectrum Equity, has now joined Otter&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the workplace has evolved and online meetings are the new normal, Otter.ai is at the<br />
forefront leading the transformational shift of the future of work and more effective online<br />
interactions,&#8221; he said, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to be partnering with Sam and the entire team at Otter.ai to support the company’s continued market leadership. We look forward to providing the guidance and strategic resources to drive focused product innovation and operational growth.&#8221;</p>
