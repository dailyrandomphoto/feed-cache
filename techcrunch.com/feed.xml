</div><p id="speakable-summary">Investors and politicians embracing a vision of an all-electric car future believe that path will significantly reduce global carbon dioxide emissions. That’s far from clear.</p>
<p>A growing body of research points to the likelihood that widespread replacement of conventional cars with EVs would likely have a relatively small impact on global emissions. And it’s even possible that the outcome would <i>increase</i> emissions.</p>
<p>The issue is not primarily about the emissions resulting from producing electricity. Instead, it’s what we know and don’t know about what happens before an EV is delivered to a customer, namely, the “embodied” emissions arising from the labyrinthine supply chains to obtain and process all the materials needed to fabricate batteries.</p>
<p>All products entail embodied emissions that are ‘hidden’ upstream in production processes, whether it’s a hamburger, a house, a smartphone, or a battery. To see the implications at the macro level, credit France’s High Climate Council for a <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/frances-imported-emissions-are-70-higher-than-domestic-co2-output-report-finds/">study</a> issued last year. The analysis found that France’s claim of achieving a national decline in carbon dioxide emissions was illusory. Emissions had in fact increased and were some 70% higher than reported once the embodied emissions inherent in the country’s imports were counted.</p>
<p>Embodied emissions can be devilishly difficult to accurately quantify, and nowhere are there more complexities and uncertainties than with EVs. While an EV self-evidently emits nothing while driving, about 80% of its total lifetime emissions arise from the combination of the embodied energy in fabricating the battery and then in &#8216;fabricating&#8217; electricity to power the vehicle. The remaining comes from manufacturing the non-fuel parts of the car. That ratio is inverted for a conventional car where about 80% of lifecycle emissions come directly from fuel burned while driving, and the rest comes from the embodied energy to make the car and fabricate gasoline.</p>
<p>Virtually every feature of the fuel-cycle for conventional cars is well-understood and narrowly bounded, significantly monitored if not tightly regulated, and largely assumption-free. That’s not the case for EVs.</p>
<p>For example, one <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/23/6345">review</a> of fifty academic studies found estimates for embodied emissions to fabricate a <i>single</i> EV battery ranged from a low of about eight tons to as high as 20 tons of CO2. Another recent technical <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">analysis</a> put the range at about four to 14 tons. The high end of those ranges is nearly as much CO2 as is produced by the lifetime of fuel burned by an efficient conventional car. Again, that’s before the EV is delivered to a customer and driven its first mile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The uncertainties come from inherent—and likely unresolvable—variabilities in both the quantity and type of energy used in the battery fuel cycle with factors that depend on geography and process choices, many often proprietary. <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-the-environmental-impact-of-li-ion-batteries-and-the-role-of-key-parameters-a-re.html">Analyses</a> of the embodied energy <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261917305433">show</a> a range from two to six <i>barrels</i> of oil (in energy-equivalent terms) is <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">used</a> to fabricate a battery that can store the energy-equivalent of one <i>gallon</i> of gasoline. Thus, any calculation of embodied emissions for an EV battery is an <i>estimate</i> based on myriad <i>assumptions. </i>The fact is, no one can measure today’s or predict tomorrow’s EV carbon dioxide &#8216;mileage.&#8217;</p>
<p>As more dollars flood into government programs and climate-tech funds — 2021 is on track to blow past <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-new-era-for-climate-focused-venture-capital">record</a> 2020 climate-tech investments, with three firms alone, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-08/blackrock-raises-4-8-billion-to-invest-in-renewable-power?sref=lHqvUqWg">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/general-atlantic-launches-climate-venture-eyes-4b-fund">General Atlantic</a> and TPG, <i>each</i> announcing new $4 to $5 billion cleantech funds — we’re overdue for paying serious attention to embodied emissions of EVs and other presumed technological panaceas for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. As we will see shortly, the attention may not reveal the expected outcomes.</p>
<h2><b>Data (on) mining</b></h2>
<p>The goal for any vehicle is to have the fuel system take as small a share of total weight as possible, leaving room for passengers or cargo. Lithium batteries, as revolutionary and Nobel-prize worthy as they are, still constitute a distant second place in the metric of merit for powering untethered machines: energy density.</p>
<p>The inherent energy density of lithium-class chemicals (i.e., not a battery cell, but the raw chemical) can be theoretically as high as about 700 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). While that’s roughly five-fold greater than the energetics of lead-acid battery chemistry, it’s still a small fraction of the 12,000 Wh/kg available in petroleum.</p>
<p>To achieve the same driving range as 60 pounds of gasoline, an EV battery weighs about 1,000 pounds. Not much of that gap is closed by the lower weight of an electric versus gasoline motor because the former is typically only about 200 pounds lighter than the latter.</p>
<p>Manufacturers offset some of a battery’s weight penalty by lightening the rest of the EV using more aluminum or carbon-fiber instead of steel. Unfortunately, those materials are respectively 300% and 600% more energy intensive per pound to produce than steel. Using a half ton of aluminum, common in many EVs, <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/development-transportation/2017-08-31/aluminum-production-leaves-a-big-carbon-footprint-so-alcoa-is-adapting-with-sustainable-products">adds</a> six tons of CO2 to the non-battery embodied emissions (a factor most analyses <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">ignore</a>.) But it’s with all the other elements, the ones needed to fabricate the battery itself, where the emissions accounting gets messy.</p>

<p>There are many combinations of elements possible for lithium battery chemistries. Choices are dictated by compromises to meet a battery’s mix of performance metrics: safety, density, charge rate, lifespan, etc. Depending on the specific formulation chosen, the embodied energy associated with the key battery chemicals themselves can <a href="https://atoc.colorado.edu/~whan/ATOC4800_5000/Spring_2019/Materials/Paula.pdf">vary</a> by as much as 600%.</p>
<p>Consider the key elements in the widely used nickel-cobalt formulation. A typical 1,000-pound EV battery contains about 30 pounds of lithium, 60 pounds of cobalt, 130 pounds of nickel, 190 pounds of graphite, and 90 pounds of copper.<b> </b>(The balance of the weight is with steel, aluminum, and plastic.)</p>
<p>Uncertainties in the embodied energy begin with the ore grade, or share of rock that contains each target mineral. Ore grades can range from a few percent to as little as 0.1 percent depending on the mineral, the mine, and over time. Using today’s <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/mines-minerals-and-green-energy-reality-check">averages</a>, the quantity of ore mined—necessarily using energy-intensive heavy equipment—for one <i>single</i> EV battery is about: 10 <i>tons</i> of lithium brines to get to the 30 pounds of lithium; 30 tons of ore to get 60 pounds of cobalt; 5 tons for the 130 pounds of nickel; 6 tons for the 90 pounds of copper; and about one ton of ore for the 190 pounds of graphite.</p>

<p>Then, one must add to that tonnage the “over-burden,” the amount of earth that’s first removed in order to access the mineral-bearing ore. That quantity also varies widely, depending on ore type and geology, typically from about three to seven tons excavated to access one ton of ore. Putting all the factors together, fabricating a <i>single</i> half-ton EV battery can entail digging up and moving a total of about 250 tons of earth. After that, an aggregate total of roughly 50 tons of ore are transported and processed to separate out the targeted minerals.</p>
<p>Embodied energy is also impacted by a mine’s location, something that is in theory knowable today but is a guessing-game regarding the future. Remote mining sites typically involve more trucking and depend on more off-grid electricity, the latter commonly supplied by diesel generators. As it stands today, the mineral sector alone accounts for nearly <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1528681/">40%</a> of global industrial energy use. And over one-half of the world’s batteries or the key battery chemicals are produced in Asia with its coal-dominated electric grids. Despite hopes for more factories in Europe and North America, every forecast sees <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/global-lithium-ion-cell-manufacturing-capacity-to-quadruple-to-1.3-twh-by-2030/">Asia</a> utterly dominating that supply chain for a long time.</p>
<h2><b>The wide variability of power grids and batteries</b></h2>
<p>Most analyses of EV emissions don’t ignore the embodied carbon debt in batteries. But that factor is typically, and simplistically, assigned a single value in order to calculate the variabilities arising from using EVs on different electric grids.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/EV-battery-manufacturing-emissions">analysis </a>from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) is usefully illustrative. The ICCT, using a fixed carbon debt for a battery, focused on how the EV carbon footprint varies depending on where it’s driven in Europe. The calculations showed that, compared to a fuel-efficient conventional car, an EV’s lifecycle emissions can range from as much as 60% lower when driven in Norway or France, to about 25% lower when driven in the U.K., to tiny emissions reduction if driven in Germany. (Germany’s grid has roughly the same average carbon emissions per kilowatt-hour as does America’s.)</p>
<p>Their analysis used <i>average</i> grid emissions data that don’t necessarily represent emissions that occur when plugged in. But the specific time, not the average, determines the <i>actual</i> source of electricity used for &#8216;fueling.&#8217; No such ambiguities attend to the location and time of gasoline use; it’s always the same anytime and anywhere on the planet. While the EV time factor has minimal variability in Norway and France where most electricity comes around the clock from hydro and nuclear respectively, it can vary wildly elsewhere from, say, 100% solar to 100% coal depending on the time of day, month and location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192451" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192451" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192451" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg 5363w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1231555537.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192451" class="wp-caption-text">The lignite-fired power station of Boxberg in Germany.

<p>Another recent ICCT <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">analysis</a> also used annualized grid averages and calculated that, compared to an average car, lifecycle emissions reductions range from about 25% for EVs in India to 70% in Europe. But, as with the similar exercise for intra-European comparisons, a single, fixed carbon debt for battery fabrication was <i>assumed</i>, and a low value at that.</p>
<p>There is good reason to consider the implications of the range of embodied battery emissions, rather than a single, low average value, because the IEA (amongst others) reports that <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">most</a> mineral production today entails processes at the higher end of emissions “intensity.” Adjusting the ICCT outcomes for that reality lowers the calculated lifecycle EV emissions savings to about 40% (instead of 60%) driving in Norway, to little or no reduction in the U.K. or the Netherlands, and about a 20% <i>increase</i> for EVs driven in Germany.</p>
<p>That’s not the end of the real-world uncertainties. The ICCT, again typical of many similar <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">analyses</a>, made calculations based on batteries 30% to 60% smaller than the size required to replicate the 300-mile range needed for widespread replacement of conventional cars. The larger batteries are common on high-end EVs today. Doubling the size of the battery leads to a straightforward doubling of its carbon debt which, in turn, dramatically erodes or eliminates lifecycle emissions savings in many, maybe most places.</p>
<p>Similarly problematic, one finds forecasts of future emissions savings often <a href="https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf">explicitly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">assume</a> that the future battery supply chain will be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">located</a> in the country where the EVs operate. One widely cited <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">analysis</a> assumed aluminum demand for U.S. EVs would be met by domestic smelters and powered mainly from hydro dams. While that may be theoretically possible, it doesn’t reflect reality. The United States, for example, produces just <a href="https://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/">6%</a> of global aluminum. If one assumes instead the industrial processes are located in Asia, the calculated lifecycle emissions are <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11027-019-09869-2.pdf">150%</a> higher.</p>
<p>For EV carbon accounting, the problem is that there are no reporting mechanisms or standards even remotely equivalent to the transparency with which petroleum is obtained, refined, and consumed. The challenges in having accurate data are not lost on the <a href="https://www.ivl.se/download/18.14d7b12e16e3c5c36271070/1574923989017/C444.pdf">researchers</a>, even if those concerns don’t percolate up into executive summaries and media claims. In the technical literature one often finds cautionary statements <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7620/ab5e1e%23fnref-ercab5e1ebib8">such</a> as a “greater understanding of the energy required to manufacture Li-ion battery cells is crucial for properly assessing the environmental implications of a rapidly increasing use of Li-ion batteries.” Or in another recent research <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2313-0105/5/2/48">paper</a>: “Unfortunately, industry data for the rest of the battery materials remain meager to nonexistent, forcing LCA [lifecycle analysis] researchers to resort to engineering calculations or approximations to fill the data gaps.”</p>
<p>Those “data gaps” become chasms when it comes to expanding the world’s mineral supply chain to support the production of tens of millions of more EVs.</p>
<h2><b>Turning up the volume</b></h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important wildcard is the expected rise in energy costs associated with obtaining the necessary quantities of “energy transition minerals,” (ETMs) as the International Energy Agency (IEA) terms them.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the agency issued a major <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">report</a> on the challenges of supplying ETMs to build batteries as well as solar and wind machines. The report reinforces what <a href="https://www.manhattan-institute.org/mines-minerals-and-green-energy-reality-check">others</a> have earlier pointed out. Compared to conventional cars, EVs require using, overall, about 500% more critical minerals per vehicle. Thus, the IEA concludes that current plans for EVs, along with plans for wind and solar, will require a 300% to 4,000% increase in global mine output for the necessary suite of key minerals.</p>
<p>The fact that an EV uses, for example, about 300 to 400% more copper than a conventional car has yet to impact global supply chain because EVs still account for less than 1% of the total global auto fleet. Producing EVs at scale, along with plans for grid batteries as well as for wind and solar machines, will push the “clean energy” sector up to consuming over half of all global copper (from today’s 20% level). For nickel and cobalt, to note two other relevant minerals, “transition” aspirations will <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions">push</a> clean energy use of those two metals to 60% and 70%, respectively of global demand, up from a negligible share today.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ultimate scale of demand that EV mandates alone will place on mining, consider that a world with 500 million electric cars—which would still constitute under half of all vehicles—would require mining a quantity of energy minerals sufficient to build batteries for about 3 trillion smartphones. That’s equal to over 2,000 <i>years</i> of mining and production for the latter. For the record, that many EVs would eliminate only about 15% of world oil use.</p>
<p>Set aside the environmental, economic, and geopolitical implications of such a staggering expansion of global mining. The <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/207371500386458722/the-growing-role-of-minerals-and-metals-for-a-low-carbon-future">World Bank</a> cautions about “a new suite of challenges for the sustainable development of minerals and resources.” Such an increase in mining has direct relevance for predictions about the future carbon intensity for minerals because acquiring raw materials already accounts for nearly <a href="https://www.ivl.se/download/18.14d7b12e16e3c5c36271070/1574923989017/C444.pdf">one half</a> of the life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions for EVs.</p>
<p>As the IEA report also observes, ETMs not only have a “high emissions intensity,” but trends show that the energy-use-per-pound mined has been rising because of long-standing declines in ore grades. If mineral demands accelerate, miners will necessarily chase ever lower grade ores, and increasingly in more remote locations. The IEA sees, for example, a 300% to 600% <i>increase</i> in emissions to produce each pound of lithium and nickel respectively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192454" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192454" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192454" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg 3707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=2048,1362 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-500638009.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192454" class="wp-caption-text">Nickel mine, Thio, New Caledonia, French Overseas Collectivity, France.

<p>Trends with copper are illustrative of the challenge. From 1930 to 1970, advances in the post-mining chemical processes led to a 30% drop in energy use to produce a ton of copper even though ore grades slowly declined. But those were one-time gains as optimized processes approached physics limits. Thus, during the four decades after 1970, as ore grade continued to decline, energy use per ton of copper <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/9/4/44/pdf">increased</a>, and returned to the same level as in 1930. That will be the pattern for the near future as ore grades continue to decline for other minerals.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the IEA, like others, uses <i>today’s</i> putative <i>average </i>supply-chain<i> </i>emissions intensity to assert that EVs in the future will reduce emissions. But the data in the IEA’s own report point to rising embodied emissions for ETMs. Add to this the implications of far more solar and wind construction, which the IEA notes require 500% to 700% more minerals compared to building a natural gas power plant, and we’ll see even more pressure on the mining supply chain — which, in the commodity world, points to a dramatic rise in prices.</p>
<p>If the EV share of vehicles rises from today’s less than 1% and begins to approach a 10% share, the resource experts at <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/can-metals-supply-keep-up-with-electric-vehicle-demand/">Wood Mackenzie</a> see untenable material demands: “Unless battery technology can be developed, tested, commercialised, manufactured and integrated into EVs and their supply chains faster than ever before, it will be impossible for many EV targets and ICE (internal combustion engine) bans to be achieved – posing issues for current EV adoption rate projections.”</p>
<p>There’s no evidence of capabilities to accelerate industry-class chemical development and manufacturing, or mining, in the short time-periods common in policy aspirations. Nearly three decades passed after the discovery of lithium battery chemistry before the first Tesla sedan.</p>
<h2><b>Chasing carbon efficiencies in the battery supply chains</b></h2>
<p>There are, of course, ways to ameliorate some of the factors that are dragging the world toward a future with increasing EV supply-chain emissions: better battery chemistry (reducing materials needed per kilowatt-hour of stored energy), more efficient chemical processes, electrifying mining equipment, and recycling. All of these are often offered as “inevitable” or “necessary” solutions. But none can have a significant impact in the time frames contemplated for rapid EV expansion.</p>
<p>Even though popular news stories frequently claim some “breakthrough,” there are no commercially viable alternative battery chemistries that significantly change the order-of-magnitude of the physical materials needed per electric-vehicle-mile. In most cases, changing chemistry formulations merely shifts burdens.</p>
<p>For example, reducing the use of cobalt is generally achieved by increasing nickel content. As for chemistries that eliminate the use of energetic atoms of, say, carbon or nickel, using instead, for example, more prosaic and low-energy-intensity elements like iron (e.g., the lithium-iron-phosphate battery), such formulations have lower energy density. The latter means a bigger, heavier battery is needed to maintain vehicle range. Still, it is reasonable to imagine the eventual discovery of a foundationally superior classes of battery chemistries. But once validated, it then takes many years to safely scale-up industrial chemical systems. Batteries put into cars today, and for the near future, will necessarily use technologies available now and not theoretically available someday.</p>

<p>Then there’s the prospect for improving the efficiency of the various chemical processes used in the mineral refining and conversion processes. Improvements there are inevitable, in no small part because that’s what engineers always do, and in the digital era they will more often find success. But there are no known “step function” changes on the horizon in the well-trod field of physical chemistry where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3575569/">processes</a> already operate near physics limits. Put differently, lithium batteries are now well past the early stages where one sees rapid improvements in process (and cost) efficiencies and have entered the stage of incremental gains.</p>
<p>As for electrifying mining trucks and equipment, Caterpillar, Deere and Case (and others) all have such projects, and even a few production machines for sale. Promising designs are on the horizon for a few specific applications, but batteries are not up to the 24&#215;7 performance demands to power heavy equipment in most uses. Moreover, the turnover rate in mining and industrial equipment is measured in decades. Mines will use a lot of oil-fired equipment for a very long time.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s recycling, commonly proposed to mitigate new demands. Even if all batteries were entirely recycled, it couldn’t come close to meeting the enormous increase in demand that will arise from the proposed (or mandated) growth path for EVs. In any case, there are unresolved technical challenges regarding the efficacy and economics of recycling critical minerals from complex machines, especially batteries. While one might imagine someday having automated recycling capabilities, nothing like that exists now. And given the variety of present and future battery designs, there’s no clear path to such capabilities in the timeframes policymakers and EV proponents have in mind.</p>

<h2><b>Legal chaos and EV emissions credits</b></h2>
<p>The unavoidable fact is that there are so many assumptions, guesses, and ambiguities that any claims of EV emissions reductions will be subject to manipulation if not fraud. Much of the necessary data may never be collectable in any normal regulatory fashion given the technical uncertainties, the variety and opacity of geographic factors, as well as the proprietary nature of many of the processes. Even so, the Securities and Exchange Commission is apparently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-weighs-making-companies-liable-for-climate-disclosures-11627495862">considering</a> such disclosure requirements. The uncertainties in the EV ecosystem could lead to legal havoc if <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-green-disclosure-rules-give-fund-investors-clarityand-confusion-11624626770?mod=article_relatedinline">European</a> and U.S. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-green-disclosure-rules-give-fund-investors-clarityand-confusion-11624626770?mod=article_relatedinline">regulators</a> enshrine “green disclosures” in legally binding ways, or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/socially-responsible-investing-11624288038">enforce</a> “responsible” ESG metrics regarding carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>For policymakers eager to reduce automotive oil use, engineers have already invented an easier and more certain way to achieve that goal while awaiting revolutions in battery chemistry and mining. Commercially viable combustion engines already <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35646974/nissan-50-percent-thermal-efficiency/">exist</a> that can cut fuel use by as much as 50%. Capturing just half that potential by providing incentives for consumers to purchase more efficient engines would be cheaper, faster—and transparently verifiable—than adding 300 million EVs to the world’s roads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Servicing one&#8217;s car </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a time-consuming, expensive and painstaking process. It&#8217;s a cycle that can lead to more expensive repairs and safety issues down the line, and no car owner likes that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Egypt and Dubai-based auto tech startup <a href="https://www.odiggo.ae/">Odiggo</a> is a platform addressing this problem. It allows car owners to get the help they need by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding car services and parts suppliers from providers around them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then for the suppliers, it increases their sales and reaches more customers without </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spending on marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odiggo is part of the current <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/odiggo">YC Summer batch</a> and has secured a $2.2 million seed round before Demo Day. The rosters of existing investors participating in the round are Y Combinator, 500 Startups, and Plug and Play Ventures. Regional VCs like Seedra Ventures, LoftyInc Capital, and Essa Al-Saleh (CEO of Volta-Tucks) also took part.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ao7/">Ahmed Omar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/realahmednasser">Ahmed Nasser</a> launched Odiggo in December 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates a marketplace that connects car owners with service providers who can solve their problems, from servicing and repair to washing and maintenance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A commission-based model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Odiggo charges the car suppliers 20% commission on every transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50,000 car owners across three markets &#8212; Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia &#8212; use Odiggo. The company also works </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with over 300 merchants. It claims merchant numbers have grown 40% month-on-month while its user base has increased 200% since the start of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we are at a watershed moment. It is incredible that since COVID hit, Odiggo has experienced over 10 times growth in the last year,” said co-founder Omar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Omar said with this new round, Odiggo&#8217;s priority will be to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> consistent growth while expanding its team across the UEA, Saudi Arabia and Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2192443" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192443" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2192443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?w=680" alt="Odiggo" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Odiggo-Co-founder-2-jpg.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192443" class="wp-caption-text">L-R: Ahmed Nassir (co-founder) &amp; Ahmed Omar (co-founder and CEO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that since Odiggo taps into a mix of data sources — including car metrics and internal software, it will use that same information to provide more product offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odiggo will use part of the funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to continue developing its tech and dashboard software, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For example, the platform would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be hooked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up to the car owner&#8217;s vehicle and link the vehicle to the marketplace and provide frequent updates of your vehicle condition so you’ll </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be informed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the tires are low, the oil needs changing, or if a service </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is required</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has upended the mobility and logistics sectors, especially in MENA, making players like Odiggo gain much visibility from investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In an industry today worth over $61 billion in the Middle East and Africa alone, Odiggo is looking to become a market leader. It has even more lofty plans to go public in the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are also aiming to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on spending more on our product and technology, as building an ecosystem to monetize requires more capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our target is to go for IPO by 2024 and achieve one billion services booked, and this requires a lot of network effects, infrastructure and technology,&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We aim to be the first $100 billion company coming out of the region,&#8221; added Nasser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its investors, Idris Ayodeji Bello, managing partner at LoftyInc, and Essa Al-Saleh, are onboard with the startup&#8217;s plan despite early days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back Odiggo through our Afropreneurs Funds in its quest to transform the automotive parts market and provide superior service to clients, starting from MENA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leadership team of Omar and Nasser, supported by the rest of the employees, have been a joy to work with and we are on a countdown to the IPO,&#8221; said Bello in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung wasn’t quite ready to declare the Galaxy Note dead. Not just yet. When we put the question to the company again after this month’s Unpacked event, a rep told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Samsung is constantly evaluating its product lineup to ensure we meet the needs of consumers, while introducing technology that enhances users’ mobile experiences. We will not be launching new Galaxy Note devices in 2021. Instead, Samsung plans to continue to expand the Note experience and bring many of its popular productivity and creativity features, including the S Pen, across our Galaxy ecosystem with products like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and including to other categories like tablets and laptops. We will share more details on our future portfolio once we’re ready to announce.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not an answer, exactly, so much as a reiteration of its earlier announcement that there will be no new Note for 2021. Asked whether it was simply a matter of chip shortages, Samsung sent us a similarly non-committal response:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current volatility of the semiconductor market is being felt across the entire technology industry and beyond. At Samsung, we are making our best efforts to mitigate the impact, and will continue to work diligently with our partners to overcome supply challenges.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s too early to declare the Galaxy Fold 3 the heir to the Note’s decade-long phablet throne. What is for certain, however, is that new features introduced for the Galaxy S line and the company’s high-end foldable have rendered the device fairly redundant. What seems most likely, meanwhile, is Samsung’s wait and see approach. A good selling Fold 3 is as compelling an argument for the Note’s redundancy as any. But that continues to be a big &#8220;if.&#8221;</p>
<p>Samsung was smart to position early Folds as exciting experiments. It’s never easy to be among the first to market with a new technology, especially with the sorts of scales Samsung tends to trade in. The original Fold brought with it some major questions, both in terms of reliability and adoption. Without retreading the former too much here (we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-fold/">written</a> plenty about it), let’s just say the company went back to the drawing board a couple of times with that first round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the latter, the company revealed back in 2019 that it sold one million units that first year. It was a surprising — and impressive — figure. Obviously it can’t hold a candle to the sorts of numbers the company puts up with the S and Note Series, but for an unproven $2,000 device a few months after launch, it was certainly a positive sign that — at the very least — early adopters were along for the ride.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188133" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188133" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2188133" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9874.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188133" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The Fold 2 found the company more directly addressing some of the biggest issues that arrived with its predecessor, making for a more robust and well-rounded device. The Fold 3 isn’t a radical departure by any stretch, but there are some key updates and refinements on board here. Top-level, here’s what’s new:</p>
<ul>
<li>S-Pen support</li>
<li>IPX8 water resistance</li>
<li>Slightly larger external display</li>
<li>Under-display camera</li>
<li>Strengthened interior screen protector, frame and front glass</li>
</ul>
<p>So what, precisely, does all of that add up to? For Samsung, the answer is simple: a new flagship. It’s one of those words in the mobile world with a bit of a floating definition. Samsung, after all, previously had two flagships, in the form of the S and Note series. Whether this a tech passing moment for the Note or a declaration of a third flagship for the Galaxy line is dependent on the words written above. What it does signal, however, is Samsung’s stated confidence that this is the moment its high-end foldable goes mainstream.</p>
<p>The first step toward mainstreaming the product is a no brainer. Price. The Fold 3 is still not, by any stretch of the imagination, an affordable device. At $1,800, it’s fittingly still the price of two flagship phones put together. But a $200 drop from its predecessor marks a considerable step in the right direction. One imagines/hopes things will continue to go down as Samsung is able to scale the tech further. Those seeking an “affordable” foldable should be taking a closer look at the new Flip, which actually ducks below the $1,000 price point. More on that in a later review.</p>
<p>There are bound to be issues with any new form factor &#8212; even one from a company with Samsung’s know how. I have this visceral memory of walking around gingerly with the original Fold for fear of breaking the thing. There’s a certain expectation of usage during the review process &#8212; that you’ll effectively treat the device as you would your own, but the earliest Fold didn’t afford that opportunity, leaving me a bit tense throughout that I might inadvertently damage the $2,000 phone.</p>
<p>And, well, I did. And I certainly wasn’t the first. There were enough issues to warrant reinforcing the device before sending it out into the broader world. It was the right move, to be sure. I don’t think anyone was expecting the Fold would be indestructible, but, again, there’s that expectation of standard usage that the earliest unit didn’t live up to.</p>
<p>The primary fix was two-fold: extending the protective film to the edges after the first looked far too similar to the removable screen protectors Samsung (and other) phones ship with, and second, the company added a brush mechanism to the interior of the hinge mechanism that would still allow some debris in, but would sweep it away through the process of opening the product. That would remove it before it had an opportunity to damage the screen.</p>
<p>The second generation upgraded to a more durable foldable glass. The new version extends those protections further. It is, notably, the first version of the Fold that doesn’t greet you with a laundry list of restrictions the moment you open the box. That’s a good sign. As a rule, I’d say users should probably adhere to a similar “normal usage.” And probably invest in one of those cases. It’s an $1,800 phone, after all.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189187" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189187" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189187" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9985.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189187" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The most notable addition on the durability front is the IPX8 rating. That’s water resistance for up to 1.5 meters for as long as 30 minutes. The company’s foldables line was a little slow on the uptake in terms of the sort of waterproofing/water resistance that has become nearly standard for premium phones &#8212; and understandably so, given the complex mechanisms required. The “X” in the rating, however, indicates that there’s no dustproofing here, for the simple reason that the hinge is actually designed to let particles in (as noted above).</p>
<p>The front and back of the device are now covered with Gorilla Glass Victus &#8212; Corning’s latest. Per Corning, “In our lab tests, Gorilla Glass Victus survived drops onto hard, rough surfaces from up to 2 meters. Competitive aluminosilicate glasses, from other manufacturers, typically fail when dropped from 0.8 meters. Additionally, the scratch resistance of Gorilla Glass Victus is up to 4x better than competitive aluminosilicate.” The phone’s body and hinge, meanwhile, are built out of alloy Samsung calls “Armor aluminum, which it claims is “the strongest aluminum used in modern smartphones.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most important of all is the inclusion of a stronger reinforced screen protector that extends further to the sides, making it a lot more difficult and less tempting to try to peel it off. The added protection is necessary both for standard usage (you really don’t want a phone that’s going to get damaged from too much tapping) and opens it up for S Pen functionality. The company now has three lines that utilize its stylus and all of the productivity features contained therein.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192371" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192371" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2192371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9829.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the S Pen Pro, the company introduced a Fold-specific model. The $50 stylus is smaller and features a retractable tip, specifically designed to lessen the pressure on the screen. I played around with both styli and didn’t notice a dramatic difference between the two, and while Samsung doesn’t explicitly warn against using the Pro, I’d go for the Fold Edition out of an abundance of caution. (The system also issues a warning if you attempt to use an older version of the S-Pen.)</p>
<p>The company offered TechCrunch the following statement on stylus compatibility:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only the latest S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Pro are compatible as they are set to a different frequency than standard S Pens. However, S Pen Pro is compatible with other S Pen-enabled devices—such as Samsung Galaxy tablets, Chromebooks, and smartphones. Users can switch the frequency of the S Pen Pro using the switch at the top.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 7.6-inch canvas lends itself well to S-Pen functionality. Of course, the Fold &#8212; like other foldables &#8212; still has a visible crease in the center. That takes some getting used to, compared to the Note. But if you’re a stylus devotee, the functionality fits in well with a growing suite of productivity tools like multiple active windows and app split view. Samsung has compiled quite a productivity workhouse here.</p>
<p>Of course, unlike the Note (and like the S line), the Fold doesn’t feature a built-in slot for the S Pen. It seems likely there may have been some structural integrity issues barring its inclusion &#8212; or, at the very least, it probably would have added even more thickness to what is already a fairly thin device when folded up. Samsung does offer up an S Pen case for those serious about taking their stylus with them &#8212; and are otherwise worried about losing it.</p>
<p>The primary display hasn’t changed much since last year. It’s still 7.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 2208 x 1768 resolution, with support for HDR10+. The 6.2-inch front screen doesn’t have the high dynamic range format, though it has been bumped up to 120Hz from 60Hz. The Fold 2 upgraded the exterior screen size last year, and it makes a big difference. There are plenty of times you just don’t want to deal with unfolding the thing. The aspect ratio is still much to skinny to rely on it most of the time, but App Continuity is a nice feature that lets you seamlessly jump between screens on enabled apps.</p>

<p>The biggest addition on the screen front is more of a subtraction, really. The pinhole camera is gone from the main screen. In its place is an under-display camera &#8212; the first on a Samsung device. The technology has been a longstanding holy grail for companies. Samsung’s not the first to offer the feature &#8212; companies like Oppo and ZTE have sported the feature for a little while now. The Fold uses similar technology, applying a thin layer of pixels above the hole punch. The spot is still visible, particularly when there’s a white image on the screen, but at first blush, it does offer something more contiguous.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192370" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192370" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2192370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="989" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg 1744w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=150,145 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=300,290 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=768,742 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=680,657 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1483 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-6.00.17-PM.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192370" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>If you follow the space at all, you know that the image performance of these cameras have been less than ideal thus far. And Samsung suffers the same fate. The above shots were taken on the front 10-megapixel and under-display four-megapixels cameras respectively. There’s a haze or blur on the under-screen camera &#8212; really not up to the standards we expect from a premium smartphone in 2021.</p>
<p>In an earlier conversation with Samsung, the company was pretty candid about this &#8212; and the reason the Fold is the first of its phones to sport the tech. It’s here because you’ve got the additional option of the front-facing camera for selfies, so you’re not reliant on a, frankly, subpar camera. Certainly I wouldn’t rely on it for shooting photos &#8212; which is already admittedly awkward with the large form factor. I suppose it can work for teleconferencing in a pinch, but even then, you’re probably better off with the front one. File it as something Samsung can improve on in future updates, as the underlying tech improves.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189186" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189186" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_9988.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The main camera system, meanwhile, is largely unchanged since the last version at:</p>
<ul>
<li>12MP Ultra Wide. F2.2, Pixel size: 1.12μm, FOV: 123-degree</li>
<li>12MP Wide-angle. Dual Pixel AF, OIS, F1.8, Pixel size: 1.8μm, FOV: 83-degree</li>
<li>12MP Telephoto. PDAF, F2.4, OIS, Pixel size: 1.0μm, FOV: 45-degree</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a great camera setup that shoots excellent photos, with the added bonus of being able to switch between a 7.6 and 6.2 inch viewfinder (honestly, again, the full screen is kind of awkward for shooting in most scenarios, so I largely stuck with the smaller one).</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2192373,2192378,2192379,2192377,2192376,2192375,2192374,2192372"]</p>
<p>The battery meanwhile, takes a small hit, down from 4,500mAh to 4,400mAh, split between two modules behind the display halves. It’s a step in the wrong direction, if only a small one. A big device like this tends to be power hungry. Depending on your usage, you should be able to get through a day. That’s not going to be huge problem so long as many of us are still largely stuck at home, but probably not something you’re going to sit around and binge videos on all day without plugging it in.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Fold sports the latest Snapdragon &#8212; the 888. That’s coupled with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on the model Samsung sent us. Doubling the storage will bring the price tag up to $1,900.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189168" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189168" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2189168" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CMC_0063.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189168" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s been impressive to watch Samsung take the Fold from troubled early adopter tech to something far more stable in the course of two generations. But while the company is ready to toss around words like mainstream in the context of its foldables, it’s hard to shake the feeling that such goals are still a long ways away.</p>
<p>The price is heading in the right direction, but the product is still prohibitively expensive for most. I certainly can’t answer the question of why you need such a product, though the advantages of a larger screen make themselves known pretty quickly. In many instances, the form factor is still a bit cumbersome.</p>
<p>If the Galaxy Note is suddenly redundant, the fault lays more with the Galaxy S series than the Fold. And if Samsung is looking for a truly mainstream foldable experience, it may want to take a longer look at the Galaxy Z Flip. In terms of size, price, flexibility and good looks, that’s looking like the one to beat. Review coming soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Thanks for reading Startups Weekly. Want the weekly digest in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>When COVID-19 first began to infect the world, my interviews with venture capitalists all somewhat fit into the same mold. Investors would tell me that they’re “triaging” their own portfolio to understand how to help startups rocked by the pandemic. While no one outright said that they would stop investing in new opportunities, many spoke on turning inward, instead of outward, to navigate the uncertain time.</p>
<p>Then the conversation would inevitably turn toward runway, aka the amount of capital that would dictate how many months they could stay in business before shutting down. Every founder was thinking about it, every VC was advising their portfolio companies to be smart about spending, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/as-vcs-pull-back-clearbanc-launches-a-way-for-startups-to-get-runway/">one startup even launched a product</a> to help founders secure money in preparation for a broader pullback from traditional investors. For what it&#8217;s worth, that startup, ClearCo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">is now a unicorn.</a></p>
<p>Fast-forward to over a year later and it’s been months since I’ve heard the word runway. The phrase has all but disappeared as venture capital as an asset class exploded with new check-writers and record-breaking fund closes. As companies raise follow-on financing weeks, instead of years, after prior rounds, I wondered what the new tension was in startupland.</p>
<p>In a conversation this week, NEA partner Ann Bordetsky put it simply: “It’s easy to raise and hard to hire.”</p>
<p>Bordetsky, who joined NEA this year, said that the next six months of advice for founders will be all about hiring. “Figure out your unfair advantage for hiring the best talent,” she said. “Not everyone can hire the best of the best, so hiring is going to make or break a lot of companies.” Put differently, &#8220;how to hire&#8221; is the new &#8220;how to conserve runway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hiring has always been hard for startups, which are more strapped for resources than, say, a Facebook that can offer an engineer a $1 million signing bonus without blinking an eye. Still, founders tell me that hiring is only getting harder as more and more well-capitalized startups are rising up with impressive valuations.</p>
<p>We’ve been covering it for years, but expect the conversation to grow only louder. We are in the Great Resignation, after all.</p>

<h2>Will OnlyFans lose its only fans?</h2>

<p>OnlyFans, a platform in which creators paywall exclusive content for their biggest fans, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">announced this week that it will ban explicit content.</a> While the platform was not built exclusively for porn, the content was largely its most known use case — powering OnlyFans&#8217; lucrative rise over the past year. Thus, the ban came as a shock as many see OnlyFans&#8217; success inextricably tied to porn.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know:</strong> Many saw OnlyFans’ choice to step away from porn as a reaction to not being able to find outside investors, news that broke earlier in the day due to <a href="https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html">leaked financials</a>. As pressure from the banking world allegedly forced OnlyFans to focus on more SFW content, my colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-porn-ban-is-cryptos-opportunity-of-a-lifetime/">Lucas Matney gave his two cents</a>.</p>
<p>From Matney’s op-ed:</p>
<blockquote><p>This shutdown is also the opportunity of a lifetime for the crypto industry, which could capitalize on the shutdown and a recent wave of increasingly consumer-friendly crypto payments infrastructure products to create a platform that won’t crumble under the influence of payment providers.</p>
<p>The real challenge is in making it simple to onboard new users to both a new platform and potentially their first crypto wallet — while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines — at a time when more conventional web payment structures have gotten so streamlined and free adult content is just as prolific as ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>This week on Equity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/men-are-a-niche-demographic/">we discussed a rarity in the world of tech</a>: A women-led company in the women’s health space became a unicorn in a financing led by women. The historic move by Maven, founded by Kate Ryder, shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">how women’s health is anything but a niche market.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know:</strong> With fresh capitalization, Maven’s comprehensive women’s health digital clinic and benefits service could now become a platform play. <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1427696894562631683">My take</a> is that the company wants to quietly show people how women’s health is tied to everyone’s health. We’ll likely see the startup expand its lens of who it serves, and we’ve already seen it expand into family care.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>Creator platform OnlyFans is getting out of the porn business. The company announced this week it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">begin to prohibit any &#8220;sexually explicit&#8221; content</a> starting on October 1, 2021 &#8212; a decision it claimed would ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform. The news angered a number of impacted creators who weren&#8217;t notified ahead of time and who&#8217;ve come to rely on OnlyFans as their main source of income.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, word is that OnlyFans was <a href="https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html">struggling to find</a> outside investors, despite its sizable user base, due to the adult content it hosts. Some VC firms are prohibited from investing in adult content businesses, while others may be concerned over other matters &#8212; like how NSFW content could have limited interest from advertisers and brand partners. They may have also worried about OnlyFans&#8217; ability to successfully restrict minors from using the app, in light of what appears to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">soon-to-come</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">increased</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">regulations</a> for online businesses. Plus, porn companies face a number of other issues, too. They have to continually ensure they&#8217;re not hosting illegal content like child sex abuse material, revenge porn or content from sex trafficking victims &#8212; the latter which has led to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55333403">lawsuits</a> at other large porn companies.</p>
<p>The news followed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/onlyfans-promotes-its-sfw-app-as-it-seeks-funding-at-a-1b-valuation/">big marketing push for OnlyFans&#8217; porn-free (SFW) app, OFTV,</a> which circulated alongside reports that the company was looking to raise funds at a $1 billion+ valuation. OnlyFans may not have technically needed the funding to operate its current business &#8212; it handled more than $2 billion in sales in 2020 and keeps 20%. Rather, the company may have seen there&#8217;s more opportunity to cater to the &#8220;SFW&#8221; creator community, now that it has big <a href="https://www.laweekly.com/celebrity-famous-onlyfans/">names</a> like Bella Thorne, Cardi B, Tyga, Tyler Posey, Blac Chyna, Bhad Bhabie and others on board.</p>

<h3>U.S. lawmakers demand info on TikTok&#8217;s plans for biometric data collection</h3>

<p>U.S. lawmakers are challenging TikTok on its plans to collect biometric data from its users. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">first reported on TikTok&#8217;s updated privacy policy</a> in June, where the company gave itself permission to collect biometric data in the U.S., including users&#8217; &#8220;faceprints and voiceprints.&#8221; When reached for comment, TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users, but said it would ask for consent in the case such data collection practices began.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune (R-SD) sent a letter to TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, which said they were &#8220;alarmed&#8221; by the change, and demanded to know what information TikTok will be collecting and what it plans to do with the data. This wouldn&#8217;t be the first time TikTok got in trouble for excessive data collection. Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tiktok-reaches-92-million-settlement-bipa-lawsuit-022605/">paid out $92 million</a> to settle a class-action lawsuit that claimed TikTok had unlawfully collected users’ biometric data and shared it with third parties.</p>

<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China cited 43 apps, including Tencent&#8217;s WeChat and an e-reader from Alibaba, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/china-ministry-targets-43-apps-including-tencents-wechat-2021-08-18/">for illegally transferring user data</a>.</strong> The regulator said the apps had transferred users location data and contact list and harassed them with pop-up windows.

<h3>Security &amp; Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqyz8/apples-double-agent">A VICE report</a> reveals a fascinating story about a jailbreaking community member who had served as a double agent by spying for Apple&#8217;s security team</b>. Andrey Shumeyko, whose online handles included JVHResearch and YRH04E, would advertise leaked apps, manuals and stolen devices on Twitter and Discord. He would then tell Apple things like which Apple employees were leaking confidential info, which reporters would talk to leakers, who sold stolen iPhone prototypes and more. Shumeyko decided to share his story because he felt Apple took advantage of him and didn&#8217;t compensate him for the work.</li>

<p>3D scanning software maker <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1532482376">Polycam</a> launched a new 3D capture tool, Photo Mode, that allows iPhone and iPad users to capture professional-quality 3D models with just an iPhone. While the app&#8217;s scanner before had required the use of the lidar sensor built into newer devices like the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro models, the new Photo Mode feature uses just an iPhone&#8217;s camera. The resulting 3D assets are ready to use in a variety of applications, including 3D art, gaming, AR/VR and e-commerce. Data export is available in over a dozen file formats, including .obj, .gtlf, .usdz and others. The app is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1532482376">free download on the App Store,</a> with in-app purchases available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hey friends! This week was more than hectic, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Below are more notes on the Brazilian IPO market, more coverage of the Chicago startup scene and a host of numbers from startups concerning their recent growth results. So, if you like early-stage <em>or</em> later-stage startups, international startups <em>or</em> domestic startups, we have just what you want!</p>
<p>Another week, another Twitter conversation about funding rounds. To catch you up, this week saw more folks complaining about the media covering funding rounds over other examples of startup activity. My contention for years has been that we, the scribbling classes, cover funding rounds because they are the rare moment that startups are willing to actually share results of their operations.</p>
<p>That VCs will occasionally complain about this is particularly rich, given that investors would hardly be willing to invest in a company based on a short call with a founder about how they came up with an idea. And yet they tell founders to not tell the media anything at all. Alas.</p>
<p>Regardless, all this shook out to me saying, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1428354793878134785"><em>&#8220;Hey startups, send in your data!&#8221;</em></a> And some folks did! Others sent in notes about stuff that they had announced before, but that we’d missed.</p>
<p>So here’s a digest of startup growth from a number of stages, markets and the like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.copy.ai/"><strong>CopyAI:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The company recently crossed the $2 million ARR threshold. CopyAI is busy building its business in public, which we love, sharing metrics as it goes. And it has raised external capital and grown rapidly while doing so, providing a proof point that you <em>can</em> share information and not have your startup instantly burst into flames.</p>
<p>I asked CEO Paul Yacoubian if growth has kept up with his expectations, and he said that it has. Our next question: How long until the company can double in size yet again? CopyAI reached $1 million ARR <a href="https://twitter.com/paulyacoubian/status/1378023507079143435">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.textnow.com/"><strong>TextNow:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now over the $100 million ARR mark. The company, essentially bootstrapped after raising less than $2 million during its life, also recently hired a CFO. You know what that means &#8212; an IPO is coming. Frankly TextNow is not a company I know well, but thanks to it sharing information, I now want to learn more about it. See!</p>
<p><a href="https://kalendar.ai/"><strong>Kalendar AI:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This company helps folks book sales meetings using AI, it appears. And the model is showing some traction, according to founder and CEO Ravi Vadrevu. He shared a host of metrics with The Exchange, including its bank balance and growth charts. (Hell yeah, data!) The company is generating ARR in the six figures and raised $700,000 in a recent round.</p>
<p>And per its charts, subscriber signups appear to be accelerating. Per a different dataset shared, August is going to be the company’s busiest month yet when it comes to meetings booked, the key non-GAAP metric for its business. That figure is growing at 30% monthly, the startup said.</p>
<p>In Vadrevu’s own phrasing, Kalendar AI wants to “democratize growth for companies like how AWS democratized innovation with virtualization.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.balto.ai/"><strong>Balto:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Balto is a St. Louis-based startup that has raised just over $50 million. The company reached out with some neat data from its recent round, a $37.5 million Series B. Per the company’s COO Chris Kontes, “Jump Capital, OCA Ventures and Sandalphon” took part in the round. Which matters if you read our recent<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/"> dig into the Chicago market</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, Balto said that it grew its customer base by 84% and its revenue by 200% since it raised its Series A in Q3 2020. I asked if the ∆ between the company’s customer and revenue growth was driven by net dollar retention (NDR) or larger customers. Per Kontes, “the answer is a bit of both” with a bias toward NDR. He didn’t share an absolute number, but did say that Balto’s “NDR is north of 150%.” Hot dang.</p>
<p>The company, by the by, built tech to help support agents know what to say during calls. Which, it appears, is big business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hostifi.com/"><strong>HostiFi:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Headquartered near Detroit, HostiFi helps customers “remotely monitor and manage UniFi Network devices.” I do not know what that means, sadly, and don’t have the minutes right now to dig in more deeply.</p>
<p>But in better news, HostiFi’s founder Reilly Chase dropped a grip of metrics into our inbox. His company will reach $1 million in ARR in the “next few weeks,” and wants to hit $10 million ARR in “the next 3 years,” which we dig. The company raised $100,000 from what was previously known as Earnest Capital, a group that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/how-some-founders-are-raising-capital-outside-of-the-vc-world/">we’ve covered</a>. HostiFi has 1,700 customers, it says, and a fully remote team of six.</p>
<p>Fun, yeah? Private companies being more open with their financial performance is good for the world as the activity has a way of making the opaque startup world just a bit more limpid.</p>
<h2>Brazil</h2>
<p>Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">dive into the Brazilian startup market</a> and its impending IPOs was good fun to write. But as we went to press, Brazil’s B3 stock exchange got back to our questions with answers. They just missed our timeline, but we’d be remiss to not share some of their notes here.</p>
<p>Regarding the present state of the Brazilian technology IPO market, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaela-vesterman-araujo-2a31939a?originalSubdomain=br">B3’s Rafaela Vesterman Araujo</a> wrote the following (minor edits for clarity):</p>
<blockquote><p>We are passing through a period of records in the Brazilian Capital Markets. Through the first half of August 2021 we had 44 IPOs (for comparison purposes, in all of 2020 we had 28) and around 30% of these IPOs were technology companies, which is very interesting, considering that before 2020, the technology sector was underrepresented at B3.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is precisely the trend that we were trying to highlight, and note, so it’s nice to see the data back us up.</p>
<p>Next up, how big does a company have to be to list on B3? Here’s Vesterman Araujo (minor edits for clarity):</p>
<blockquote><p>Around 70% of 2020 and 1H21 technology IPOs raised between [$110 million] and [$367 million]. In addition, 70% of these companies had a net income up to [$55 million]. In some of the cases, even with a lower net revenue compared to other sectors, we have noticed that many of them have been raising a greater amount of capital, probably reflecting the growth expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hello, growth premium! That’s great news for local Brazilian startups hoping to get public in their home market. With Nubank and Nuvemshop growing huge while private, where the country’s companies will go public is no small matter.</p>
<h2>Chicago</h2>
<p>We dug into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">the Chicago boom this week</a>, tracking the Windy City’s huge venture capital results from the past few quarters and asking locals precisely what was driving the wave of funding and startup activity. As we got <em>that</em> into WordPress, another set of answers came in that we want you to read.</p>
<p>Techstars’ <a href="https://twitter.com/nealsales">Neal Sáles-Griffin</a>, managing director of its Chicago operations, had this to say about why Chicagoland startups have excelled in attracting capital since late 2020:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a flight to quality. For too long, there’s been a concentration of capital in one hub and VCs following the decentralization of innovation after the COVID [lockdowns]. The pandemic broke old habits and brought investors to mature markets like Chicago. [ … ] For years, Chicago has grown as a national, top-tier destination for startups. The national VC community is finally catching up, exploring our amazing community of founders who are scaling fast in the Midwest.</p></blockquote>
<p>I went to school in Chicago, so am pretty aware of the density of schools in the area. I was curious if that fact was beneficial to local startups. Per Sáles-Griffin, the answer is a hard yes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Absolutely, we’re home to two of the top five MBA programs (UChicago, Northwestern), home to a top-five engineering college (UIUC) and [to] one of the most diverse engineering colleges in the country (UIC). But we’re also home to one of the largest city college districts in the region (City Colleges) and historically Black institutions like Chicago State — both home to several engineering and IT programs, training the next generation of talent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where should we look for the next generation of startups from Chicago? The Techstars denizen listed healthcare and life sciences as a key market, as well as food tech and companies building in the larger transit space.</p>
<h2>So many other things!</h2>
<p>Sadly, we are way over our word count for this newsletter, so we have to stop. But lots of other things out there are worth your attention. Like Indianapolis-based Lessonly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/16/sales-enablement-platform-seismic-acquires-lessonly-nabs-170m/">being acquired by Seismic</a>. Lessonly had raised just under $30 million while operating on its own, helmed by the dynamo-like Max Yoder. And Aspiration Partners &#8212; backed by a number of well-known actors &#8212; is <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/fintech-aspiration-plans-to-go-public-in-merger-with-a-spac-the-deal-will-be-valued-at-2-3-billion-51629242671">going public via a SPAC</a>. The deal will provide hundreds of millions in fresh capital to the company.</p>
<p>More next week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome back to TechCrunch’s China roundup, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">This week, investors&#8217; concerns mount as news came that the Chinese government has taken a stake ByteDance, TikTok&#8217;s parent and one of the world&#8217;s largest private internet firms. Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s crackdown on Chinese sellers continues and is forcing many traders in southern China out of business, and the government passed a sweeping data protection law that will take effect in November.</p>
<h2>A state stake</h2>
<p>The Chinese government&#8217;s grand plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">assert more control over the country&#8217;s internet behemoths</a> continues. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This week, The Information </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/beijing-tightens-grip-on-bytedance-by-quietly-taking-stake-china-board-seat">reported</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that a domestic entity of ByteDance sold a 1% stake to a government affiliate in April. The deal was also recorded on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.tianyancha.com/company/25174642">Tianyancha</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, a database of publicly available corporate information, as well as the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="http://www.gsxt.gov.cn/">official enterprise registration index</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>The move didn&#8217;t come abruptly. Beijing was mulling over small shares in private tech firms as early as 2017. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-pushes-for-a-direct-hand-in-chinas-big-tech-firms-1507758314?st=uo1futmaxwtlyrk&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter">reported</a> at the time that internet regulators discussed taking 1% stakes in companies including WeChat operator Tencent, Twitter-like Weibo and YouTube-like Youku.</p>
<p>In April 2020, WangTouTongDa, a subsidiary of <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">China Internet Investment Fund, which is in turn controlled by China’s top internet watchdog, acquired a 1% stake in Weibo for 10 million yuan, according to Weibo&#8217;s <a href="http://ir.weibo.com/static-files/2987c532-781c-442a-a654-9b7589634838">filing</a> to the U.S. securities regulator. Weibo did not mention WangTouTongDa&#8217;s relationship with the state in its filing.</span></p>
<p>Similarly, ByteDance sold a 1% stake to three entities set up by top regulatory bodies:<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> China Internet Investment Fund; China Media Group, controlled by the Communist Party’s propaganda department; and the Beijing municipal government’s investment arm.</span></p>
<p>In response to Beijing&#8217;s move on ByteDance, Republican senator Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/rubio-wants-biden-block-tiktok-after-chinese-government-takes-stake-2021-08-17/">urged</a> President Joe Biden this week to block TikTok in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Exactly how much power Beijing gains over ByteDance from taking the small stake remains fuzzy, but Weibo&#8217;s disclosure to investors offers some clues.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s critical to note that the government holds stakes in the domestic operating entity of both Weibo and ByteDance. Internet companies in China often set up offshore entities that are entitled to the financial benefits of their mainland Chinese operations through contractual agreements. The framework is called a variable interest entity or VIE. While the structure allows Chinese firms to seek overseas funding due to China&#8217;s restrictions on foreign investments, it has come under increasing scrutiny by Beijing.</p>
<p>Weibo said in the filing that WangTouTongda, its state-owned investor, will be able to appoint a director to the three-member board of its Chinese entity and veto certain matters related to content and future financings.</p>
<p>ByteDance likely has a similar arrangement with its state investor. The government did not obtain a stake in TikTok, which is a subsidiary of a separate offshore entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands, The Information pointed out. This should provide <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">some reassurance to U.S. regulators, though concerns about Beijing&#8217;s sway in Chinese companies abroad probably won&#8217;t go away.</span></p>
<p>Indeed, the Biden administration in June <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/biden-revokes-and-replace-trump-actions-targeting-tiktok-and-wechat-report/">replaced</a> the Trump-era orders to ban ByteDance and WeChat with a more measured policy requiring the Commerce Department to review apps with ties to &#8220;jurisdiction of foreign adversaries&#8221; that may pose national security risks.</p>
<p>TikTok has been fighting accusations that it hands over user data to Beijing. ByteDance is the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2021&amp;id=B13">fourth-largest lobbying spender</a> in the U.S. so far this year, just after Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. Beijing&#8217;s investment is going to cost it more campaign efforts.</p>
<h2>Beleaguered Amazon sellers</h2>
<p>In May, I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/">reported</a> that Amazon shuttered some of its largest sellers from China over violations of platform rules, including using fake reviews and incentives to solicit positive reviews from customers. The crackdown drove China&#8217;s online exporters into a panic, and as it turned out, it wasn&#8217;t a one-off ambush from Amazon but a prolonged war. While the exact number of Chinese stores affected is not disclosed, industry observers such as Marketplace Pulse <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazons-crackdown-on-chinese-sellers">said</a> &#8220;hundreds of&#8221; top Chinese sellers had been suspended as of early July.</p>
<p>Punished accounts are suspended, with their goods withheld and deposits frozen by Amazon. Companies in Shenzhen, home to the majority of the world&#8217;s Amazon sellers, laid off thousands of staff in recent months. The owner of a sizable seller in Shenzhen recently died by suicide due to the debacle, according to an acquaintance of the owner.</p>
<p>To sellers that have survived the crackdown, the attack by Amazon &#8220;would have happened sooner or later.&#8221; Most of the exporters I talked to came to the same conclusion: The Seattle-based titan now wants quality and design over generic products that compete solely on price and manipulation of ranking.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has taken note of the incidents. An official from the Ministry of Commerce compared the wave of store closures as Chinese exporters being &#8220;fish out of water&#8221; during a press conference <a href="http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2021/0722/c1004-32166498.html">in July</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to differences in laws, culture and business practices around the world, [Chinese] companies are facing risks and challenges as they go overseas,&#8221; said Li Xingqian, director of foreign trade at the Commerce Ministry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will help companies improve their risk control and comply with international trade standards.&#8221; Meanwhile, the official called for &#8220;the platform/platforms to cherish the important contribution from various companies and fully respect different trade entities.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Data protection</h2>
<p>And finally, China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passed</a> a sweeping data protection law this week that will strictly limit how tech companies collect user information, but the rules won&#8217;t likely have an impact on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-passes-one-of-the-worlds-strictest-data-privacy-laws-11629429138">state surveillance</a>. The regulation, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">proposed last year</a>, will take effect on November 1.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Software as a service is one of the most important sectors in tech today. While its transformative potential was quite clear before the pandemic, the sudden pivot to distributed workforces caused interest in SaaS products to skyrocket as medium and large enterprises embraced digital and remote sales processes, significantly expanding their utility.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is global, but India in particular has the opportunity to take its SaaS momentum to the next level. The Indian SaaS industry is projected to generate revenue of $50 billion to $70 billion and win 4%-6% of the global SaaS market by 2030, creating as much as $1 trillion in value, according to a report by SaaSBOOMi and McKinsey.</p>

		<blockquote>
			The Indian SaaS industry is projected to generate revenue of $50 billion to $70 billion and win 4%-6% of the global SaaS market by 2030.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are certain important long-term trends that are fueling this expansion.</p>
<h2>The rise of Indian SaaS unicorns</h2>
<p>The Indian SaaS community has seen a flurry of innovation and success. Entrepreneurs in India have founded about a thousand funded SaaS companies in the last few years, doubling the rate from five years ago and creating several unicorns in the process. Together, these companies generate $2 billion to $3 billion in total revenues and represent approximately 1% of the global SaaS market, according to SaaSBOOMi and McKinsey.</p>
<p>These firms are diverse in terms of the clients they serve and the problems they solve, but several garnered global attention during the pandemic by enabling flexibility for newly remote workers. Zoho helped streamline this pivot by providing sales teams with apps for collateral, videos and demos; Freshworks offered businesses a seamless customer experience platform, and Eka extended its cloud platform to unify workflows from procurement to payments for the CFO office.</p>
<p>Other SaaS firms stayed busy in other ways. Over the course of the pandemic, 10 new unicorns emerged: Postman, Zenoti, Innovacer, Highradius, Chargebee and Browserstack, Mindtickle, Byju, UpGrad and Unacademy. There were also several instances of substantial venture funding, including a $150 million deal for Postman, bringing the total amount raised by the Indian SaaS community in 2020 to around $1.5 billion, four times the investment in 2018.</p>
<h2>India’s path to leadership</h2>
<p>While the Indian SaaS community has made admirable progress in recent years, there are several key growth drivers that could lead to as much as $1 trillion in revenue by 2030. They include:</p>
<h3>The global pivot to digital go-to-market</h3>
<p>The number of enterprises that are comfortable with assessing products and making business decisions via Zoom is increasing rapidly. This embrace of digital go-to-market fundamentally levels the playing field for Indian companies in terms of access to customers and end markets.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a late Friday night blow to Uber, Lyft and other gig worker-centered companies, a superior court judge ruled that California’s Proposition 22, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">which was passed in 2020</a> and designed to overrule the state’s controversial <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/">AB-5 law on the employment status of gig workers</a>, violates the state’s constitution.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5aCxPLbCeM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/">Gig worker bill, AB-5, passes California State Senate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gig worker bill, AB-5, passes California State Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/gig-worker-bill-ab-5-passes-in-california/embed/#?secret=5aCxPLbCeM" data-secret="5aCxPLbCeM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Frank Roesch, a superior court judge in Alameda County, which encompasses Oakland, Berkeley and much of the East Bay, ruled that the law would limit “the power of a future legislature” to define the employment status of gig workers. The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article248448155.html">filed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)</a> in January, after a similar lawsuit was rebuffed by the California Supreme Court and referred to a lower court.</p>
<p>The court’s decision will almost certainly be appealed and further legal arguments are to be expected.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling by Judge Roesch striking down Proposition 22 couldn’t be clearer: The gig industry-funded ballot initiative was unconstitutional and is therefore unenforceable,&#8221; said Bob Schoonover, President of SEIU California State Council in a statement. &#8220;For two years, drivers have been saying that democracy cannot be bought. And today’s decision shows they were right.”</p>
<p>The superior court’s decision is just the latest in a long line of victories and defeats in the battle between companies that heavily rely on gig workers like Uber and DoorDash, and unions and advocates representing workers. Much of the debate centers on the legal distinction between a freelancer and an employee, and to what extent companies are responsible for the care and benefits of their workers.</p>
<p>Such a distinction is big business: Uber, Lyft and other companies <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-doordash-lyft-prop-22-spending-200-million-close-polling-2020-10">spent more than $200 million collectively</a> to push Prop 22 to victory last year. California voters passed the proposition roughy 59% to 41% in what was widely perceived as a major victory for gig worker platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Such fights are not limited to merely Silicon Valley’s home state, however. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/technology/uber-uk-drivers-worker-status.html">Earlier this year in the United Kingdom</a>, Uber lost a legal battle over its employment classification decisions and ultimately reclassified tens of thousands of its drivers as workers, a decision which offered them a range of benefits not previously guaranteed.</p>
<p><em>Updated August 20, 2021 to include a statement from SEIU.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 20, 2021. The week is finished, but our work to catch up with the torrent of technology, startup and venture capital news is not. Today we have software companies investing in hotels, profitable scooters, at-home rowing machines and TikTok radio? Oh, and apparently Elon is building a robot. It’s a great group of stories! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/microsoft-backs-indias-oyo-at-9-6-billion-valuation/">Microsoft backs OYO:</a> </strong>A while back TechCrunch broke the news that Microsoft might back Indian hotel upstart OYO. It was a bit of a wild story, as it didn’t seem to make <em>that</em> much sense. Well, the deal happened. Microsoft has invested $5 million into the company at a $9.6 billion valuation. Notably, that is only a slight discount from the company’s old $10 billion valuation. Next up for OYO is an IPO, we presume.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/bird-shows-improving-scooter-economics-long-march-to-profitability/">Bird shows improving scooternomics:</a> </strong>American scooter company Bird is going public via a SPAC &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">more here</a> &#8212; and we got a look at the company’s most recent financial performance. In short, a shake-up of its operating model has improved its economics, even if the company still has a long way to go to turning a real profit.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/"><strong>China shakes up its data privacy rules:</strong></a> For companies, that is, not the state; don’t expect the CCP to start respecting privacy anytime soon. But for companies in the country, a strict new law called the Personal Information Protection Law is coming into effect November 1. Per TechCrunch, the new set of rules will require “app makers to offer users options over how their information is or isn’t used, such as the ability not to be targeted for marketing purposes or to have marketing based on personal characteristics.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/alerzo-raises-10-5m-series-a-to-bring-nigerias-informal-retail-sector-online/">Alerzo raises $10.5M to digitize Nigeria’s economy:</a> </strong>Nigeria’s expanding startup scene got another boost today with Alerzo’s latest round. The “B2B e-commerce retail” startup wants to help bring the country’s informal economy online. According to TechCrunch that part of the Nigerian economy is worth some $100 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/sao-paulos-quintoandar-real-estate-platform-raises-120m-now-valued-at-5-1b/"><strong>São Paulo-based QuintoAndar puts points on the board for Brazil:</strong></a><strong> </strong>What does one do after raising a $300 million round? Well, if you are a Brazilian property technology company, you raise another $120 million. That’s what QuintoAndar just did, at an eye-popping $5.1 billion valuation. The company connects demand and supply in the country’s rental and home markets.</li>
<li>For more on Africa’s startup market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">head here</a>. And if you want more notes on Brazil, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">we’ve got you covered</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/greycroft-leads-3-5m-into-breef-an-online-marketplace-for-ad-agencies/"><strong>Breef wants to connect brands and agencies:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Normally we’d try to make a pun about how we hope that this startup’s life is not, ahem, <em>breef</em>, but we’re more mature than that. Instead, we’ll note that the Greycroft-backed company just raised $3.5 million, and it connects teams at boutique agencies with larger, more long-term contracts with brands than what most freelance platforms offer.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/cardiomatics-bags-3-2m-for-its-ecg-reading-ai/"><strong>Cardiomatics does just what it says on the tin:</strong></a> Yes, Cardiomatics is an electrocardiogram-reading automation company, like you surmised from its name. And it just loaded its accounts with $3.2 million. The company helps “GPs and smaller practices offer ECG analysis to patients without needing to refer them to specialist hospitals,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/rutter-comes-out-of-stealth-with-1-5m-in-funding-for-its-e-commerce-api/"><strong>Rutter is building the Plaid of e-commerce data:</strong></a> API-delivered startups are hot these days. Connecting various services in a particular niche via API is a popular idea as well. And e-commerce is booming. At the intersection of those three trends is Rutter, which just raised $1.5 million and is building a “unified e-commerce API that enables companies to connect with data across any platform.” Very cool.</li>
<li>If you need <em>more</em> startup news, we have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/men-are-a-niche-demographic/">just what you require</a> on this week’s Equity podcast.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4 common mistakes startups make when setting pay for hybrid workers</h2>
<p>In a recent survey, 58% of workers said they plan to quit if they’re not allowed to work remotely.</p>
<p>Startups that don’t offer employees work-from-home flexibility are at a competitive disadvantage, but figuring out how to pay hybrid workers raises a complex set of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should you localize salaries for workers in different areas?</li>
<li>How should you pay workers who have the same job when one is WFH and the other is at their desk?</li>
<li>Are you being transparent with your staff about how their compensation is set?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/pelotons-android-app-hints-at-long-rumored-rowing-machine/">Peloton wants to get into erging:</a> </strong>Do you like the Peloton model, but aren’t interested in stationary biking? Don’t worry, the company is building a rowing machine, it appears. We hope that the machine is a bit safer than the Peloton treadmill turned out to be. Frankly the decision makes sense as erging is popular and healthy and good, and it’s not like folks who row are famous for not having money.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/siriusxm-launches-tiktok-radio-a-music-channel-featuring-viral-hits-hosted-by-tiktok-stars/">Sirius wants to be TikTok cool:</a> </strong>This is the &#8220;How do you do fellow kids?&#8221; meme, but IRL. Sirius, the satellite radio company that is well known in the United States, has launched a radio station that plays songs popular on the social platform hosted by well-known TikTokers. Parents, get ready for rather annoying road trips.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/spotify-to-spend-1b-buying-its-own-stock/">Spotify wants to retire shares:</a> </strong>Spotify is spending another $1 billion buying its own shares back from the public markets. In short, Spotify is wealthy and generates enough cash to power all of its work without dipping into its reserves. So it is spending some of its extra cash buying back its own stock, which has seen its value decline in recent months.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/musk-the-tesla-bot-is-coming/">Elon Musk dressed a dude in a suit and promised a future robot:</a></strong> When are we going to stop falling for Elon vaporware? Around when those solar roofs launch, I reckon. This time Tesla chatted about a future humanoid robot. And the company <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/tesla-s-musk-unveils-humanoid-robot-to-take-over-boring-work">dressed up a human in an unconvincing suit</a> to demonstrate what it will look like? Er, sure. Not that we’re opposed to the tech. We aren’t. But what a weird way to announce a future product.</li>
</ul>

Sergeant leaves no stones unturned, covering the impact on consumers and how marketers can prepare for this. Anna Heim, Extra Crunch daily reporter, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/for-british-agency-ascendant-growth-marketing-is-much-more-than-a-set-of-tactics/">interviewed some team members at Ascendant</a>, a London-based agency, about the methods they use when working with startups, no matter what stage they’re in.</p>

Though down slightly from April (51.1%), the data still suggests Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection will significantly impact email marketers, entire marketing teams and especially consumers.” Sergeant also covers how marketers can prepare for these changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the hasty U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan underway after two decades occupying the country, social media platforms have a complex new set of policy decisions to make.</p>
<p>The Taliban has been<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/18/taliban-social-media-success/"> social-media-savvy for years</a>, but those companies will face new questions as the notoriously brutal, repressive group seeks to present itself as Afghanistan’s legitimate governing body to the rest of the world. Given its ubiquity among political leaders and governments, social media will likely play an even more central role for the Taliban as it seeks to cement control and move toward governing.</p>
<p>Facebook has taken some early precautions to protect its users from potential reprisals as the Taliban seizes power. Through Twitter, Facebook&#8217;s Nathaniel Gleicher announced a set of new measures the platform rolled out over the last week. The company added a “one-click” way for people in Afghanistan to instantly lock their accounts, hiding posts on their timeline and preventing anyone they aren’t friends with from downloading or sharing their profile picture.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/ We’ve launched a one-click tool for people in Afghanistan to quickly lock down their account. When their profile is locked, people who aren’t their friends can’t download or share their profile photo or see posts on their timeline. <a href="https://t.co/pUANh5uBgn">pic.twitter.com/pUANh5uBgn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nathaniel Gleicher (@ngleicher) <a href="https://twitter.com/ngleicher/status/1428474006609399811?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook also removed the ability for users to view and search anyone’s friends list for people located in Afghanistan. On Instagram, pop-up alerts will provide Afghanistan-based users with information on how to quickly lock down their accounts.</p>
<p>The Taliban has long been banned on Facebook under the company’s rules against dangerous organizations. “The Taliban is sanctioned as a terrorist organization under U.S. law … This means we remove accounts maintained by or on behalf of the Taliban and prohibit praise, support and representation of them,” a Facebook spokesperson <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58239786">told the BBC</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Afghan Taliban is actually not designated as a <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/">foreign terrorist organization</a> by the U.S. State Department, but the Taliban operating out of Pakistan has held that designation since 2010. While it doesn’t appear on the list of foreign terrorist organizations, the Afghanistan-based Taliban is defined as a terror group according to <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/06/01/2011-13581/taliban-afghanistan-sanctions-regulations">economic sanctions</a> that the U.S. put in place after 9/11.</p>
<p>While the Taliban is also banned from Facebook-owned WhatsApp, the platform&#8217;s end-to-end encryption makes enforcing those rules on WhatsApp more complex. WhatsApp is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/26/world/asia/afghanistan-whatsapp-taliban.html">ubiquitous</a> in Afghanistan and both the Afghan military and the Taliban have relied on the chat app to communicate in recent years. Though Facebook doesn’t allow the Taliban on its platforms, the group <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/18/taliban-social-media-success/">turned to WhatsApp</a> to communicate its plans to seize control to the Afghan people and discourage resistance in what was a shockingly swift and frictionless sprint to power. The Taliban even set up a WhatsApp number as a sort of help line for Afghans to report violence or crime, but Facebook quickly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/technology/taliban-social-media-bans.html">shut down the account</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Facebook’s VP of content policy Monika Bickert noted that even if the U.S. does ultimately remove the Taliban from its lists of sanctioned terror groups, the platform would reevaluate and make its own decision. “ … We would have to do a policy analysis on whether or not they nevertheless violate our dangerous organizations policy,” Bickert said.</p>
<p>Like Facebook, YouTube maintains that the Taliban is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-youtube-says-bans-accounts-173742117.html">banned from its platform</a>. YouTube&#8217;s own decision also appears to align with sanctions and could be subject to change if the U.S. approach to the Taliban shifts.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube complies with all applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws, including relevant U.S. sanctions,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;As such, if we find an account believed to be owned and operated by the Afghan Taliban, we terminate it. Further, our policies prohibit content that incites violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Twitter, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has <a href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33/status/1427101139481268227">continued to share regular updates</a> about the group&#8217;s activities in Kabul. Another Taliban representative, <a href="https://twitter.com/qyahmadi21?lang=en">Qari Yousaf Ahmadi</a>, also freely posts on the platform. Unlike Facebook and YouTube, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have a blanket ban on the group but will enforce its policies on a post-by-post basis.</p>
<p>If the Taliban expands its social media footprint, other platforms might be facing the same set of decisions. TikTok did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for comment, but previously told NBC that it considers the Taliban a terrorist organization and does not allow content that promotes the group.</p>
<p>The Taliban doesn&#8217;t appear to have a foothold beyond the most mainstream social networks, but it&#8217;s not hard to imagine the former insurgency turning to alternative platforms to remake its image as the world looks on.</p>
<p>While Twitch declined to comment on what it might do if the group were to use the platform, it does have a relevant policy that takes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/twitch-off-platform-harassment-policy/">&#8220;off-service conduct&#8221;</a> into account when banning users. That policy was designed to address reports of abusive behavior and sexual harassment among Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>The new rules also apply to accounts linked to violent extremism, terrorism or other serious threats, whether those actions take place on or off Twitch. That definition would likely preclude the Taliban from establishing a presence on the platform, even if the U.S. lifts sanctions or changes its terrorist designations in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is recalling even more Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles due to possible battery cell defects that could increase the risk of fire. <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/aug/0820-bolt.html">This latest recall</a>, announced by the automaker on Friday, marks the third time GM has issued the consumer notice for the Bolt.</p>
<p>The second recall, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks/">was issued in July</a>, covered 2017 to 2019 Bolt EVs. Now, GM is expanding that recall to include an additional 9,335 2019 model year Bolts, as well as 63,683 2020–2022 Bolt EV and EUV vehicles.</p>
<p>“In rare circumstances, the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects — a torn anode tab and folded separator — present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire,” the company said in a news release. It added that it was working with its cell supplier, South Korea’s LG, regarding the issue.</p>
<p>This recall is expected to cost GM an additional $1 billion — that’s on top of the $800 million the company has already estimated for the prior recalls. Costs associated with fixing defective Bolt batteries made up the lion’s share of GM’s $1.3 billion in warranty expenses last quarter, the automaker said in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/gms-earnings-dragged-down-by-chevy-bolt-recall/">earnings call earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>GM is recommending that included Bolt drivers set vehicle to a 90% state of charge limitation and avoid depleting the battery below a 70 mile range. The automaker also suggests parking the vehicle outside right after charging and not leaving the vehicle charging indoors overnight — likely due to the risk of fire. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/">released its own recommendation</a> to Bolt drivers to park their vehicles away from their homes to reduce fire risk.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, companies have continued to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/hp-outlines-ambitious-diversity-goals/">ambitious pledges</a> to address bias and systemic racism in the hiring process. But the track record of previous corporate diversity efforts is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">shaky at best</a>. Is this time going to be different?</p>
<p>The answer will depend on whether companies are able to look inward to understand and dismantle the long-standing practices that too often keep skilled workers locked out of opportunities. That’s because when it comes to equity and inclusion in hiring, businesses are often standing in their own way.</p>
<p>It’s not that hiring managers and corporate executives don’t want to effect change. Rather, over the past year, well-meaning business and HR leaders invested in short-term, one-time solutions — like hosting events or donating to nonprofits. Make no mistake: Those aren’t necessarily bad ideas. But they’re not systemic and they’re not sustainable. It’s like saying where you’re going on vacation without building the roads you need to get there.</p>

<p>This reliance on tried-and-true solutions is common across nearly every facet of society — hence the popular proverb that military generals “fight the last war, not the next one.” Today’s business leaders are using yesterday’s tactics in an attempt to address tomorrow’s problems. And if companies don’t take a more strategic, data-driven approach to diversity, we’re going to look back a year from now and find that despite the best of intentions, no more progress has been made.</p>
<p>What will it take to make good on our good intentions and put that systemic change into action? Research — and our own experience as corporate leaders — points to a few potential solutions.</p>
<p>First, stop thinking of the college degree as the best proxy for skills. A body of research <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/does-higher-education-still-prepare-people-for-jobs">indicates</a> that the correlation between educational attainment and job performance is weaker than we might think — and that degree requirements systematically <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-disparate-racial-impact-of-requiring-a-college-degree-11593375171">disenfranchise</a> Black and Hispanic candidates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only that, but screening based on a bachelor’s degree automatically leaves out <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=27">60% of American workers</a>, including the more than <a href="https://opportunityatwork.org/stars/">70 million people</a> without four-year degrees who have the skills to succeed in higher-wage jobs (sometimes called STARs, for Skilled Through Alternative Routes).</p>
<p>Companies can take action right away to address this challenge. That could include new strategies that measure skills directly. IBM has long been a pioneer in this space through its commitment to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/former-ibm-ceo-ginni-rometty-hiring-based-on-skills-over-degree.html">skills-based hiring</a>, which enables the company to make hiring decisions based on what candidates can do, not the pedigrees they’ve earned.</p>
<p>It could also include following the lead of companies like <a href="https://www.td.org/magazines/td-magazine/dont-hire-skills-hire-to-skill">Capital One</a>, which hires based on aptitude — and provide internal learning and development and on-the-job training opportunities to help new hires learn the skills they need to succeed on the job. The advantages of these approaches are obvious: Hiring based on skills rather than degrees opens up a much wider talent pool, increases value in terms of wages and can lead to more loyal employees and higher retention rates.</p>
<p>Second, recognize that when it comes to how you invest your budget and effort, training is at least as important as recruiting. As the pace of technological change accelerates and the need for digital talent grows, it’s become increasingly clear that talent poaching is an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/02/making-learning-a-part-of-everyday-work">“expensive zero-sum game”</a> that leaves companies scrambling &#8212; and paying a premium &#8212; for the same small pool of talent.</p>
<p>This challenge is even more acute in the context of diversity and inclusion. If Company X recruits a minority candidate who’s already had a successful career at Company Y, has that really contributed to building a more inclusive workforce in any meaningful way? The net number of workers in the industry is the same — you’re just playing musical chairs with the labor market. That may be appropriate for senior leadership roles, but it will never grow the top of the funnel if the same strategy is applied to entry-level or more junior positions.</p>
<p>The real way to move the needle isn&#8217;t simply to commit to hitting diversity numbers for your organization &#8212; which all too often incentivizes lateral hiring from competitors &#8212; but to provide jobs and career advancement opportunities to those who otherwise are unemployed or underemployed. Investing in training can support these efforts by both expanding the talent pool and giving companies a better return on their investment than traditional recruiting models.</p>
<p>Last but not least, facilitate better communication within the enterprise. No one sets out to build inequitable talent pipelines. But talent-acquisition professionals — like most professionals — have limited time and huge remits. As a result, especially in technology and data-oriented fields, there is a growing disconnect between HR departments that post jobs and the business departments that leverage the talent.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, HR departments aren&#8217;t directly connected to the workflows for specific roles, which often leads to job descriptions that include laundry lists of requirements and look like “buzzword salad.” This ends up turning away the best and the most diverse talent, who often screen themselves out because they don’t meet every single requirement.</p>
<p>Building stronger connections between hiring managers and the rest of the enterprise can help create a clearer understanding of what skills are most important — and keep businesses from screening out qualified candidates before they even get a chance to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Systemic change is never easy. And that’s especially the case in a recovering economy and a tightening labor market, where businesses are under more pressure than ever to fill open roles. But inflection points like this one also create opportunities to think and act differently, rather than falling back on the status quo. From the C-suite to hiring managers and other frontline decision-makers, times of turmoil and transformation may be the best opportunity to translate aspiration into meaningful action.</p>
<p>That’s the challenge that stands before U.S. businesses now: investing in a more systemic approach to equity and inclusion so that we can build a world of work that reflects the values to which we all aspire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D rocket printing company Relativity Space has pushed back the date of the demonstration launch of its lightweight Terran 1 rocket from winter 2021 to early 2022. The company announced the updated schedule on Twitter, while also confirming that the launch will take place out of Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A few updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Terran1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Terran1</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />We&#8217;re excited to share that Stage 2 passed cryo pressure proof + hydro mechanical buckling test on our structural test stand. Up next: S1 structural testing!</p>
<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2705.png" alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Terran 1’s demonstration launch is now set for early 2022 from Cape Canaveral LC-16. <a href="https://t.co/nrv1mUCl2t">pic.twitter.com/nrv1mUCl2t</a></p>
<p>— Relativity Space (@relativityspace) <a href="https://twitter.com/relativityspace/status/1428780883696181254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Relativity also said Stage 2 passed its cryogenic pressure and hydromechanical buckling test. Stage 1 structural testing is to follow.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news of the delay comes just two months after Relativity said (<a href="https://twitter.com/relativityspace/status/1405622796697280513">also on Twitter</a>) that the Terran 1 would launch in winter of this year. The rocket that will perform the orbital demonstration flight will not be carrying any payload, but the company has already scheduled a second launch to take place June 2022. That rocket will carry CubeSats to low-Earth orbit as part of NASA’s Venture Class Launch Services Demonstration 2 (VCLS Demo 2) contract.</p>
<p>A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that there is &#8220;no one single reason&#8221; why the launch date has been pushed back. &#8220;Over the past year, Relativity has … refined Terran 1’s architecture, developed a brand new engine and upgraded its material while COVID slowed a few of its processes down,&#8221; the spokesperson added. &#8220;They updated the demonstration launch to early 2022 so they can better coordinate with partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch will mark the world&#8217;s first of an entirely 3D-printed rocket. Relativity&#8217;s tech has garnered quite a lot of interest from investors &#8212; so much that its valuation vaulted to $4.2 billion after a $650 million funding round this summer. In addition to the Terran 1, the company is also developing a second heavy-lift, fully reusable rocket it&#8217;s calling Terran R. It aims to launch that rocket as early as 2024.</p>

The outlet found various code snippets that mentioned a device codenamed &#8220;Caesar&#8221; and &#8220;Mazu.&#8221; The latter is a reference to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Chinese sea goddess</a>. Like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-living-with-peloton-bike.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">stationary bike</a>, it appears the rowing machine will include a &#8220;scenic rides&#8221; feature that will showcase waterways from around the globe. And if you want to just row, that will be an option too.</p>
<p>Another set of snippets reference the four positions of a proper rowing technique. &#8220;This is the drive position of your stroke,&#8221; the app explains. &#8220;Sit tall on the rower with your arms straight and your back upright. Your knees should be just above the ankles.&#8221; Digging deeper into the updated software, <em>9to5</em> also found code suggesting the app will track metrics like your average and max stroke rates.</p>
<p>A rowing machine is something Peloton has been rumored to be working for a while now, with a <a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2021/07/30/new-job-listing-confirms-peloton-rower-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">recent job listing mentioning the device</a>. We&#8217;ve reached out to Peloton for confirmation, but we&#8217;ll note here what we say with all APK teardowns: the fact there&#8217;s code pointing to a new hardware release doesn&#8217;t mean a company will follow through on that work or that a launch is imminent.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you're a founder who finds yourself in a meeting with a VC, try to remember two things — you're the smartest person in the room, and investors are looking for a reason to say "yes."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re a founder who finds yourself in a meeting with a VC, try to remember two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re the smartest person in the room.</li>
<li>Investors are looking for a reason to say &#8220;yes.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Even so, many entrepreneurs squander this opportunity, often because they direct questions or fail to understand their BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement).</p>
<p>&#8220;As the venture landscape becomes more a meritocratic environment where resumes and institutional affiliations matter less, these strategies can make the difference between a successful fundraise and a fruitless meeting,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/a-vc-shares-5-things-no-one-told-you-about-pitching-vcs/">says Agya Ventures co-founder Kunal Lunawat</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re already in the fundraising process or plan to be in the future, be sure to read &#8220;A crash course on corporate development&#8221; that Venrock VP Todd Graham <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/lets-make-a-deal-a-crash-course-on-corporate-development/">shared with us this week</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re going to get acquired, chances are you’re going to spend a lot of time with corporate development teams,&#8221; says Graham. &#8220;With a hot stock market, mountains of cash and cheap debt floating around, the environment for acquisitions is extremely rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August 24 at 3 p.m. PDT/6 p.m. EDT/11 p.m GMT, Managing Editor Danny Crichton will host a conversation on Twitter Spaces with Eric Dean Wilson, author of &#8220;After Cooling: On Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson&#8217;s book explores the history of freon, a common refrigerant that was later banned due to its devastating impact on the ozone layer. After their discussion, they&#8217;ll take questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Apple iPhone, Apple Mail and Apple iPad account for nearly half of all email opens, but the privacy features included with iOS 15 will allow consumers to block marketers from seeing their physical location, IP address and tracking data like invisible pixels.</p>
<p>Email marketers rely heavily on these and other metrics, which means they should prepare now for the changes to come, advises Litmus CMO Melissa Sargeant.</p>
<p>In a detailed post, she shares several action items that will help marketing teams leverage their email analytics so they can &#8220;continue delivering personalized experiences consumers crave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Venrock Vice President Todd Graham has some frank advice for founders at venture-backed startups: &#8220;It would be wise to generate a return at some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that in mind, he authored a primer on corporate development that lays out the three most common categories of acquisitions, tips for dealing with bankers, and explains why striking a partnership with a big company isn&#8217;t always the best way forward.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you choose, &#8220;you need to take the meeting,&#8221; advises Graham.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the worst-case scenario, you’ll get a few new LinkedIn connections and you’re now a known quantity. The best-case scenario will be a second meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Brazilian Central Bank made a major reform to the way payments are processed that may throw the doors open for e-commerce in South America&#8217;s largest market.</p>
<p>Historically, merchants who accepted credit card payments had two options: Receive the full payment distributed over two to 12 installments, or offer a deep discount to receive a smaller sum up front.</p>
<p>But in June 2021, the BCB created new &#8220;registration entities&#8221; that permit &#8220;any interested receivables buyer/acquirer to make an offer for those receivables, forcing buyers to become more competitive in their discount offers,&#8221; says Leonardo Lanna, head of payment products at Monkey Exchange.</p>
<p>The new framework benefits consumers and sellers, but for the region&#8217;s startups, &#8220;it opens the door to a plethora of opportunities and new business models, from payments to credit.&#8221;</p>

<p>An inflow of VC dollars, notable acquisitions and rising unicorn counts are all features of the Brazilian tech startup market, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm note in The Exchange.</p>
<p>“The IPO market in Brazil is changing,” they write. “TechCrunch noted last year that in the decade leading up to 2020, just two of the 56 IPOs in Brazil were technology companies. More recently, the number of technology companies listed in the country has swelled to at least 16, up from just four in 2019.”</p>

<p>“For good reason, security certifications like the SOC 3 really put you through the wringer,” Waydev CEO Alex Cercei writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>Waydev, a Git analytics tool that helps engineering leaders measure team performance automatically, just attained the SOC 3 certification.</p>
<p>“We learned so much from the process, we felt it was right to share our experience with others that might be daunted by the prospect,” Cercei writes.</p>
<p>“So here’s our advice on how teams can smoothly reach an SOC 3 while simultaneously balancing workloads and minimizing disruption to users.”</p>

<p>Most startups could use an advisory board, but in health tech, it&#8217;s a core requirement.</p>
<p>Founders seeking to innovate in this area have a unique need for mentors who have experience navigating regulations, raising capital and managing R&amp;D, to name just a few areas.</p>
<p>Based on his own experience, Patrick Frank, co-founder and COO of PatientPartner, shared some very specific ideas about who to recruit, where to find them and how to fit them into your cap table.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to leverage these individuals so you are able to focus on the full view of the company to ensure it is something that both the market and investors want at scale,&#8221; says Frank.</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of tech news to analyze, Alex Wilhelm notes, but this week, he took a fresh look at crypto.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>“Because there are some rather bullish trends that indicate the world of blockchain is maturing and creating a raft of winning players,” he writes.</p>

<p>In one recent survey, 58% of workers said they plan to quit if they&#8217;re not allowed to work remotely.</p>
<p>Startups that don&#8217;t offer employees work-from-home flexibility are at a competitive disadvantage, but figuring out how to pay hybrid workers raises a complex set of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should you localize salaries for workers in different areas?</li>
<li>How should you pay workers who have the same job when one is WFH and the other is at their desk?</li>
<li>Are you being transparent with your staff about how their compensation is set?</li>
</ul>

<p>With its TikTok partnership, SiriusXM is looking to capture a younger audience &#8212; on the TikTok app itself, DJ Habibeats (@djhabibeats) and DJ CONST (@erinconstantineofficial) will each go live on TikTok each week while DJing on TikTok Radio. Other creator hosts on TikTok Radio &#8212; like Billy (@8illy), Cat Haley (@itscathaley), HINDZ (@hindzsight), Lamar Dawson (@dirrtykingofpop) and Taylor Cassidy (@taylorcassidyj) &#8212; will deliver &#8220;The TikTok Radio Trending Ten,&#8221; a weekly countdown of songs trending on TikTok. To promote the station during its first week, artists like Ed Sheeran, Lil Nas X and Normani will appear on air.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Music has such a strong footing in TikTok culture that it regularly influences the Billboard charts &#8212; Fleetwood Mac&#8217;s &#8220;Rumours,&#8221; originally released in 1978, appeared in the top 10 Billboard albums again in 2020 after it was featured in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@420doggface208/video/6876424179084709126">viral TikTok</a>. Even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0Uh3OJCx3o">Fortnite-themed parody</a> of Estelle&#8217;s &#8220;American Boy&#8221; &#8212; originally uploaded in 2018 to YouTube &#8212; had a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@khaby.lame/video/6950627842518568197?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">beautiful moment</a> on TikTok. </span></p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so excited to launch TikTok Radio on SiriusXM, which opens up artists and creators like this amazing group of hosts to new audiences,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Ole Obermann</span>, TikTok&#8217;s global head of Music, in a statement. &#8220;Now SiriusXM subscribers will have a new road to discover the latest trends in music and get a first listen to tomorrow&#8217;s musical superstars. The channel captures song-breaking music culture that creates so much joy and entertainment on TikTok through video in an all-audio format.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Though SiriusXM&#8217;s subscriber base continues to expand &#8212; it saw a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/SiriusXM-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">34% year-over-year growth</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from last year to now &#8212; it still dwarfs in comparison to streaming giants like Spotify, which has </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">165 million paid users</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. SiriusXM reported a total of</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/SiriusXM-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx"> 34.5 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> subscribers as of Q2 this year, the most it&#8217;s ever had, but even </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">Apple Music</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">Amazon Music</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> have reported nearly double the subscribers. Pandora has </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/SiriusXM-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">6.5 million</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> paid subscribers. Over the last few years, SiriusXM and Pandora have struck deals with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/music-streaming-pioneer-soundcloud-raises-75m-from-pandora-owner-siriusxm/">SoundCloud</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">Simplecast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">Stitcher</a> to become more competitive in both music and podcast streaming. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, other streaming companies have also shown interest in the market of Gen Z-ers on TikTok who want to listen to full versions of the catchy songs they hear in short videos. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-music-adds-10-new-playlists-aimed-at-gen-z-including-one-with-tiktok-hits/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX2L0iB23Enbq">Spotify</a> both host curated &#8220;viral hits&#8221; playlists. But a full-time satellite music channel is taking the trend a step further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than three months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/quintoandar-raises-300m-at-a-4b-valuation-as-ribbit-capital-makes-a-big-bet-on-the-brazilian-proptech/">$300 million Series E</a>, Brazilian proptech QuintoAndar has raised an additional $120 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Greenoaks Capital and China’s Tencent co-led the round, which included participation from some existing backers as well. São Paulo-based </span><a href="https://www.quintoandar.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuintoAndar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now valued at $5.1 billion, up from $4 billion at the time of its last raise in late May. With the extension, the startup has now raised more than $700 million since its 2013 inception. Ribbit Capital led the first tranche of its Series E.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuintoAndar describes itself as an “end-to-end solution for long-term rentals” that, among other things, connects potential tenants to landlords and vice versa. Last year, it also expanded into connecting home buyers to sellers. Its long-term plan is to ​​evolve into a one-stop real estate shop that also offers mortgage, title insurance and escrow services.</span></p>
<p>To that end, e<span style="font-weight: 400;">arlier this month, the startup acquired Atta Franchising, a 7-year-old São Paulo-based independent real estate mortgage broker. Specifically, acquiring Atta is designed to speed up its ability to offer mortgage services to its users. QuintoAndar also plans to explore the possibility of offering a product to perform standalone transactions outside of its marketplace in partnership with other brokers, according to CEO and co-founder Gabriel Braga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, QuintoAndar expanded operations into 14 new cities in Brazil. Eventually, QuintoAndar plans to enter the Mexican market as its first expansion outside of its home country, but it has not yet set a date for that step. Today, the company has more than 120,000 rentals under management and about 10,000 new rentals per month. Its rental platform is live in 40 cities across Brazil, while its home-buying marketplace is live in four (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre) and seeing more than 10,000 sales in annualized terms.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brazilian proptech startup QuintoAndar lands $300M at a $4B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/quintoandar-raises-300m-at-a-4b-valuation-as-ribbit-capital-makes-a-big-bet-on-the-brazilian-proptech/embed/#?secret=fbaZulpwZR" data-secret="fbaZulpwZR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuintoAndar, he said, is open to acquiring more companies that it believes can either help it accelerate in a particular way or add something it had not yet thought about.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re receptive to the idea but our core strategy is to focus on organic growth and our own innovation and accelerate that,” Braga said.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why raise more money so soon?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series E was oversubscribed with investors who got in and “some who could not join,” according to Braga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks and Tencent, he said, couldn’t participate because of “timing issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We kept talking and they came back to us after the round, and wanted to be involved so we found a way to have them on board,” Braga said. “We did not need the money. But we have been constantly overachieving on the forecast that we shared with our investors. And that’s part of the reason why we had this extension.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks’ long-term time horizon was appealing because the firm’s investment was designed to be “perpetual capital with no predefined time frame,” Braga said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing our best to build an enduring company that will be around for many, many years, so it’s good to have investors who share that vision and are technically aligned,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks partner Neil Shah said his firm believes that what QuintoAndar is building will “fundamentally reshape real estate transactions, enhancing transparency, expanding options for Brazilians seeking housing, dramatically simplifying the experience for landlords and driving increased investment into real estate across the country.” He also believes there is big potential for the company to take its offering to other parts of Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to being partners for decades to come,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent’s experience in China is something QuintoAndar also finds valuable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe we can learn a lot from them and other Chinese companies doing interesting stuff there,” Braga said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuintoAndar isn&#8217;t the only Brazilian proptech firm raising big money: In March, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo digital real estate platform </span><a href="https://www.loft.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it had closed on $425 million in Series D funding led by New York-based D1 Capital Partners. Then, about one month later, it revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/brazils-loft-adds-100m-to-its-accounts-700m-to-its-valuation-in-a-single-month/">a $100 million extension</a> that valued the company at $2.9 billion.</span></p>
