					<description><![CDATA[Just like NYC's flooded subway system, internet infrastructure doesn't attract much attention until there's a notable failure.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Did you see the viral videos of yesterday&#8217;s flooding in New York City subways?</p>
<p>In one, riders waded through brown, waist-deep water; another video showed a cascade rushing down a flight of stairs to a subway platform where passengers waited for a train.</p>
<p>Infrastructure doesn&#8217;t attract much attention until it fails. Domain name services (DNS), the system that directs readers to techcrunch.com when they say or speak it into their web browser, are much the same way.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the latest entry in a series of longform articles that explore the inner workings of notable startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1/">we looked at NS1</a>, an internet infrastructure company best known for its software-defined DNS.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2013, NS1 has raised more than $100 million to build an engineering team and robust product portfolio that&#8217;s expanded to include DDI, which helps companies manage internal networks.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how NS1 transformed &#8220;a slumbering and dreary yet reliable aspect of the internet&#8221; into &#8220;a strategic moat and an enterprise win&#8221; in just eight years, read on.</p>

<p>Part 1: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-origin/">Origin story</a>: how three engineers decided to rebuild the internet&#8217;s core addressing system.</p>
<p>Part 2: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-product/">Product development and roadmap</a>: experimentation, open-source efforts and expanding beyond DNS.</p>
<p>Part 3: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-competition/">Competitive landscape</a>: a look at the broader internet infrastructure market.</p>
<p>Part 4: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/ns1-ec1-customers/">Customer development</a>: how their top competitor&#8217;s stumble became &#8220;the gift that kept on giving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim didn&#8217;t mince words in today&#8217;s Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;The venture capital market is racing ahead, foot on the gas, middle finger out the window, hair on fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s their hot take after analyzing the Q2 data released so far about how much money VCs deployed across the globe between April and the end of June.</p>
<p>Leaning on data from CB Insights, Crunchbase News and FactSet, Alex and Anna walk through the data from the U.S. and a few other regions &#8212; and promise deeper regional dives next week.</p>

<p>If you’re starting a company, choosing a name can feel like a fraught choice. But actually, as long as you follow some basic guidelines, it shouldn’t lead to paralysis.</p>
<p>“The truth is that business names fall on a bell curve — you have a small number of outliers that actively contribute to your success and a small number of outliers that actively impair your ability to succeed,” Drew Beechler, who’s named more than 30 software startups, writes in a guest column. “The vast majority, though, fall somewhere in the middle in their impact on your business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The SPAC parade continued apace this week as Nextdoor announced it would go public via a blank-check company, with the community social network making its pitch based on scale, claiming users in one in three U.S. households.</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm u<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">npacks Nextdoor’s “clear-eyed look into [its] financial performance in both historical terms and in terms of what it might accomplish in the future,” noting that “our usual mockery of SPAC charts mostly doesn’t apply.”</span></p>

<p>So far this year, startups in Pakistan are on track to raise more than in the previous five years combined, according to Mikal Khoso, an early-stage investor at Wavemaker Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even more excitingly, a large portion of this capital is coming from international investors from across Asia, the Middle East and even famed investors from Silicon Valley,&#8221; he notes in a guest post for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s identified three factors that are fueling investor interest: rapidly expanding mobile connectivity, an improved security situation, and critical legal and regulatory changes that are making the country more startup- and VC-friendly.</p>
<p>Drawing a map of Pakistan&#8217;s tech ecosystem, Khoso identifies local companies trying to grab a slice of grocery delivery, e-commerce, ride-hailing and other sectors before examining the challenges still in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The segments in Pakistan that are likely to attract the best entrepreneurs and most investor capital in the years to come will be fintech, e-commerce and edtech,&#8221; says Khoso.</p>

<p>The nonstop news of startups partnering up with SPACs in the United States had Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim wondering if the blank-check boom expanded to other countries.</p>
<p>“Unicorns are hardly unique to the U.S. startup ecosystem,” they write. “Are we seeing similar SPAC interest in Europe?”</p>
<p>Anna and Alex talked to investors to see why &#8212; or why not &#8212; European startups would take the SPAC path to become a public company.</p>

<p>When you’ve invested a lot of time and energy in a project, it can be difficult to decide to shelve it &#8212; or worse, kill it.</p>
<p>But for AI projects, teams should be prepared to fail fast, Sandeep Uttamchandani, the chief data officer of Unravel Data, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“In order to fail fast, AI initiatives should be managed as a conversion funnel analogous to marketing and sales funnels,” he writes. “Projects start at the top of the five-stage funnel and can drop off at any stage, either to be temporarily put on ice or permanently suspended and added to the AI graveyard.”</p>
<p>Uttamchandani walks through the five stages of the funnel and offers suggestions for when to start digging a hole for your project in the graveyard.</p>

<p>Yes, we’re all a bit over-SPAC-ed at this point. It’s just been a nonstop torrent of startups linking up with blank-check companies.</p>
<p>But Circle, a Boston-based technology company that provides API-delivered financial services and a stablecoin, is just “the sort of business that is correct for a SPAC-led debut,” Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>“It could not go public in a traditional manner in its current state of maturity,” he writes.</p>
<p>“But a SPAC can get it a huge slug of cash at a price that it has locked in, allowing it to complete its growth into corporate adulthood while public. A gamble, sure, but one that will be very fun to watch.”</p>

<p>It’s not hard to imagine how advertising could be valuable in VR: billboards on streetscapes, magazine covers on newsstands, cereal boxes in virtual kitchens.</p>
<p>But Facebook’s stab at experimental VR ads didn’t last very long; after an onslaught of negative feedback from players, the test was quickly scuttled.</p>
<p>That said, VR advertising has a ton of untapped potential — but it’s going to take a minute to reach profitable scale.</p>

<p>“Robots are not coming to replace us,” Alp Uguray is quick to note in a guest column about robotic process automation. “They are coming to take over the repetitive, mundane and monotonous tasks that we’ve never been fond of.”</p>
<p>That’s the good news. But RPA is still in the early stages, despite rapid growth through IPOs, acquisitions and funding rounds.</p>
<p>“Adoption of RPA and process mining in your organization will define the operational excellence of your firm,” he writes. “If you are behind in this race, just think of how your enterprise can continue to compete with fully digital peers. Your organization won’t want to be in the back of this race.”</p>

<p>This guest post from three contributors from Next47, MassRobotics and Lux Capital looks at best practices for robotics startups looking to raise cash.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has never been a better time to pursue funding for robotics startups, but you are more likely to succeed if you build a fundraising strategy that is marked by the same sophistication and informed understanding you already bring to many other aspects of your new business,&#8221; the writers say.</p>
<p>Here, they lay out five strategies to ensure robotics startups get the funding they need.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There’s a bias for wanting to use what worked previously, but people forget… your customers and markets are totally different. You can’t just replicate."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doing more with less: This is what marketers get asked for when they join an early-stage startup. British consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/lucy_heskins">Lucy Heskins</a> knows firsthand how overwhelming that can be, which is why her services can both replace and complement early in-house marketing staff. Either way, it often involves educating the founders about the job to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too many people fail to realize that marketing is the process of understanding your customers, building appropriate channels to reach them and ultimately meeting their needs (profitability),&#8221; she wrote on her site, <a href="https://www.ohblimey.com/">Oh, blimey</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.</em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having earned &#8220;scars and stripes&#8221; at various startups, Heskins recently joined &#8220;tech for good&#8221; company Big Lemon as a part-time head of growth, but still offers her services to other teams as a SaaS and early-stage startup marketing consultant. If you are a marketer yourself or thinking of hiring one, read on: She shared some compelling insights with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)</em></p>
<p><strong>How do you collaborate with the startups you work with as a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>Typically I will work with startups in two ways. The first will be project-based. So for example, when they want to explore a potential new customer market or introduce a freemium strategy.</p>
<p>The other way is as a mentor or extension to their marketer. Often I will work with marketers who’ve never worked in a startup and they can bounce ideas or strategies off me. It helps speed up their learning and time to deliver results.</p>
<p><strong>How do your roles as an employee and as a consultant nourish each other?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve experienced the very real pains/challenges/opportunities a startup presents, especially as an early-stage employee. I’ve come in, helped change business models, explored things like freemium and repositioned brands. It’s tough. So as a consultant, I can pass on my learnings (and mistakes). And I get to work with some great startups who are open to trying new things. Plus, having worked in four startups now, I <em>get</em> the pressure they’re facing and can adjust my approach accordingly. There’s a lot of plates spinning, and I get that.</p>
<p><strong>What do early-stage startups typically misunderstand and need to know about startup marketers like you?</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, there are a few mistakes startups often make.</p>
<p>The first is hiring a marketer too soon. I’ve come into startups, thinking I was coming in to set up their in-house function. However, very quickly you realize that they’ve jumped the gun and think they’ve got product-market fit when they are nowhere near it. This can cause conflict because the startup’s expecting one thing (say, revenue) but the marketer is missing a few basics to be effective (value proposition, an idea of how &#8220;painful&#8221; the problem is that they are solving, lack of involvement in areas like pricing).</p>
<p>The next mistake is not trusting their marketer. All too often I hear of marketers who’ve gone into a startup only to learn that their ideas are put on the back burner because the founder(s) &#8212; and this is typically first-time founders &#8212; don’t quite understand marketing and will push them to deliver short-term results (leads).</p>
<p>Lastly and probably the biggest mistake is applying what worked at a previous business. When joining a startup, you’re starting from scratch &#8212; new customers, new markets, go-to-market strategy. There’s a bias for wanting to use what worked previously, but people forget … your customers and markets are totally different. You can’t just replicate.</p>
<p><strong>What should be the main focus of a startup&#8217;s first in-house marketer?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it depends really on the stage of the startup; however, whatever stage you’re at, it needs to be customer research/development. I’d be very wary of a marketer who doesn’t suggest this as one of their first activities.</p>
<p>You need to unlock why customers buy or subscribe to the startup’s product. This will determine your traction channels, your proposition, your pricing model &#8212; everything.</p>
<p><strong>Why should startups consider hiring a freelancer or agency to help with their marketing instead of doing everything in-house?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s a great idea to outsource until the startup understands 1) if there’s an actual problem that needs solving and 2) whether there’s a market big enough to actually turn it into a business.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re in this period, you can’t afford to learn new skills &#8212; even though it may seem attractive/&#8221;cheap&#8221; to do it in-house, it really isn’t. It can actually set you back. Outsource the specifics and focus on what you do best. Once you’ve got a better idea of validation, then you can start to see which skills to bring in-house.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why have you decided to focus on SaaS startups? What makes them different when it comes to marketing?</strong></p>
<p>I love working in SaaS, especially B2B SaaS. What makes it different, for me, is that the role becomes part marketing, part product, part commercial. You get to look at the entire customer experience, and because many SaaS products are trial/subscription-based, your focus needs to be on retention. You’re only as good as your last month, so it forces you to work and think harder.</p>
<p>Plus, B2B SaaS is actually very, very cool now. Just because you work in B2B marketing doesn’t mean you need to be boring!</p>

<p><strong>What are some key takeaways from your <a href="https://www.ohblimey.com/the-early-stage-startup-marketing-playbook">Early-Stage Startup Marketing Playbook</a>?</strong></p>
<p>I created the playbook because I sat in a board meeting and, when an investor was asking about the go-to-market strategy, I realized that there wasn’t a clear toolkit for helping early-stage startups to map out the market, nor think about the steps leading up to launching a product.</p>
<p>There are many takeaways, but I think the main one and the most valuable is providing clarity as to what specific steps go into a go-to-market strategy and how it all works together.</p>
<p>I talk you through how to speak to the customers who’ll actually buy from you &#8212; not those who tell you they love your product but run a mile when it’s time to pay &#8212; and how to determine which market channel is best to reach them.</p>
<p><strong>What is customer-led growth? And how can it help startups adapt post-COVID?</strong></p>
<p>Customer-led growth is a strategy that combines product, marketing and sales. It views your product through the lens of a customer with the aim of working out how value is delivered to them &#8220;whenever, wherever and however they need it.&#8221; It’s something I learned and studied from the co-founders of <a href="https://forgetthefunnel.com/">Forget the Funnel</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that you look at the entire customer journey, from the struggle stage right through to when they’re a customer, and you break each section down to where there’s an opportunity for growth. It’s really helpful for startups &#8212; especially post-COVID because chances are, your customers’ needs have changed.</p>
<p>How your customers derive value from your product changes all the time. This framework gives you a starting point.</p>
<p><strong>How is content marketing best used?</strong></p>
<p>I often say to startups, stop creating content for the sake of it. A lot of content that’s created doesn’t allow for where your customer may be in the buying process. It doesn’t consider what’s motivating them to solve their problem.</p>
<p>As a result, the results you get are skewed. Things take much longer than they should. Customers get confused about what it is your business actually is/does. Everyone starts to lose respect for marketing.</p>
<p>Again, you need to take it back to the customer and their journey and identify what content they need to overcome that particular problem that’s getting in the way of signing up/using your product.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;We throw away 80% of our content ideas, and you should too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/we-throw-away-80-of-our-content-ideas-and-you-should-too/embed/#?secret=RWTL5ZwZCj" data-secret="RWTL5ZwZCj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Why is alignment with sales important, and what does it involve?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve worked in startups that have been sales-led (so complex products, long lead time) and it’s important to understand what sales needs to uncover to help move a customer to the next stage. Likewise, marketing can help sales to really dig into the proposition and understand what channels are best to convert leads.</p>
<p>I think when you work in a startup as a marketer, you have to roll up your sleeves and get involved in sales. It’ll help improve the content, strategy and revenue in the end.</p>
<p>So if you are working with a salesperson whose ultimate aim is to secure a call with a prospect, you can’t just go in and expect a prospect to say yes, immediately. There are a series of steps you and the salesperson need to go through in order to nurture and open up this relationship. It’s all about proving a set of hypotheses about your customer. Do they really hang out on LinkedIn? Are they bombarded with companies offering the same? Which proposition is working enough to get someone to agree to a call? Is that calendar link putting off prospects altogether?</p>
<p>I truly believe people do love to help, but it’s about working out what’s in it for them and how your product will make their life just that little bit easier.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">From the outside looking in, the construction industry appears ripe for tech innovation. The industry represents <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/226361/us-construction-spending-relative-to-gdp/">6.3%</a> of the U.S. GDP. There are close to 1 million general contractors (GCs) in the country, and anywhere between 3 million and 5 million workers on job sites every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s a common (if somewhat justified) belief that construction firms are slow to adopt technology and are behind the digital curve.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Success in construction tech will come down to proving the need for the technology, delivering immediate ROI, and ensuring workers know how to use it on the first try.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But not every construction company is a technology laggard. While GCs are historically slower to adopt new technologies, this doesn’t necessarily make them behind the times. About 60% of construction companies have R&amp;D departments for new technology, and the largest construction firms have substantial R&amp;D budgets. Yet 35.9% of employees are hesitant to try new technology, according to JB Knowledge.</p>
<p>One way to interpret this is that there is a strong interest and need to take advantage of newer construction-centric technologies, but only if they’re easy to use, easy to deploy or access while on a job site, and improve productivity almost immediately.</p>
<p>These factors have made construction tech appealing to investors, who have poured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/16/investor-momentum-builds-for-construction-tech/">at least $3 billion</a> into the sector. Is construction tech the “it” place right now? Is it ripe for disruption, the way VC investors find attractive? If that’s true, what went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/softbank-backed-construction-giant-katerra-said-to-be-shutting-down-after-raising-billions/">wrong at Katerra</a>? Is Procore justified in <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/construction-tech-unicorn-procore-drops-s-1-revealing-sharply-rising-revenue-net-losses/">losing</a> $1 for every $4 in revenue? And why does so little investment go into improving productivity at the job site where GC money is made &#8212; or lost &#8212; compared to back-office operations?</p>
<p>My experience to date says that construction is different from other sectors because of the significant variation among projects that originates in the way projects are financed, how risks are managed and the factors that drive variation among projects. Construction’s differences are not easily mitigated via data processing, as compared to fintech, for example, where all money is data-amenable to software processing. Addressing project variations will be key to succeeding in construction tech beyond the back office. Here are the critical factors to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Project financing makes capital investment more difficult. </strong>While the Commerce Department reported that construction spending in the U.S. reached a record high of $1.459 trillion in November 2020, this doesn’t mean there are unlimited opportunities for construction tech. The reality is that GCs make few capital investments because they must fund investments in technology out of operating cash flow.</p>
<p>Construction projects are typically funded incrementally in phases as the project demonstrates progress. Delays or accidents can have a huge effect on cash flow. Overhead and G&amp;A cost burdens are hated. Asking a GC to license technology as a capital purchase doesn’t always make sense.</p>
<p><strong>GC ownership and business structure also make large capital investment more difficult.</strong> Most GC firms were founded by tradespeople and either started as, or remain, family-owned firms. Borrowing what’s considered the “family’s money” is a much more risk-averse decision compared to the way larger corporations evaluate productivity investments and put assets at risk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re entering a phase in the COVID-19 pandemic where transmission is going to go through the roof because of the Delta variant. But as vaccinations ramp up around the world, the main cost to society now will not be the health services being overwhelmed, but mass disruption to businesses as staff are forced to self isolate by track and trace systems. Thus, biosecurity in the workplace (or any other setting for that matter) is going to matter a lot.</p>
<p>The paragraph you just read above is in fact a paraphrase <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01589-0/fulltext?s=08">of the recent open letter</a> sent by a number of eminent UK scientists to the government about the next phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>So if it’s the case that workplace biosecurity is going to have to be much more efficient, then faster, better forms of testing are going to be needed. Now, a UK startup thinks it may have cracked the problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bio-security company <a href="https://www.knownow.com/">Vatic</a> has come up with its &#8216;KnowNow&#8217; test for CoVID-19 which it claims is more accurate than lateral flow tests, is faster, easier (only a swab from your mouth is needed), allows test data sharing, and even produces a ‘Passport’ QR code to enable someone to access services or workplaces.</p>
<p>Vatic has now raised $6.37 million to deliver its at-home tests, starting with the one tailored to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The seed funding round was led by London-based VCs LocalGlobe and Hoxton Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Vatic has built a saliva-based test that is about generating data in the home. The company says the test takes fewer than 15 minutes and can identify people who are actually infectious at that moment, rather than get a false positive because the body has fought off the infection. Existing antigen tests can have a false positive rate of 1 in 200.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175732" style="width: 943px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175732" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg" alt="Vatic test" width="933" height="1206" class="size-full wp-image-2175732" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg 933w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=768,993 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=526,680 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vatic-1.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175732" class="wp-caption-text">Vatic test</p></div></p>
<p>The company says its test identifies infectious viruses by mimicking the surface of a human cell, effectively redesigning how lateral flow tests are built and “enhancing their accuracy”.</p>
<p>Its KnowNow saliva-only rapid antigen test for COVID-19 is in fact now being used in the UK after receiving CE mark approval. It pairs its saliva test with an app that makes it possible to share at-home test results with health or other platforms instantly. The saliva self-swabbing technique is obviously much easier to do and less uncomfortable than current Lateral Flow Tests that require swabbing the back of the throat and nasal passages. Vatic is also now doing clinical trials in the US to secure Emergency Use Authorisation from the FDA.</p>
<p>Alex Sheppard, co-founder and CEO of Vatic, explained: “One reason for the recent decline in the uptake of rapid Covid-19 tests is the sampling technique – it’s currently very uncomfortable and difficult for people to use. We need to take the pain out of mass testing if we’re to return to normal to minimize the disruption caused by future COVID-19 outbreaks, whether in offices, schools, or hospitality venues. That’s why we’ve built supportive biosecurity technology that sits  alongside the test, allowing users to generate their own unique QR codes to facilitate safe venue entry.”</p>
<p>How does it work? Vatic says its technology searches for the ‘spike’ on the virus as a measure of infectivity, but also says it is immune to potential mutations of the virus, making it able to test for COVID-19 no matter the variant.</p>
<p>Sheppard said the Vatic test is only the first iteration. It can also detect other infectious viruses by mimicking the surface of a human cell.</p>
<p>“We selected the part of the Coronavirus that uses its spike to enter human cells, almost like a hypodermic needle,&#8221; Sheppard told me. &#8220;That&#8217;s the bit that essentially interacts on our test, and so, effectively, we&#8217;re mimicking a human cell on our test, which is completely unique. It&#8217;s got a completely different engine to a normal Lateral Flow Test, because the chemistry that&#8217;s powering it is totally different.”</p>
<p>The other aspect of the Vatic test is that it employs an app linked to the saliva swap test. Once the test is done it produces an encrypted QR code.</p>
<p>“It’s not altogether dissimilar to what we see on the NHS tests,” Sheppard said, “but it&#8217;s a completely trust-based system, so you don&#8217;t have to compromise your health data. You&#8217;re not writing your home address into a government website. Of course, it does synchronize with the government requirements of reporting a notifiable disease, but it&#8217;s designed to ensure that you know you&#8217;re not giving away too much health data. It’s secure.”</p>
<p>Sheppard and his co-founder Mona Omir met at Oxford University, at the accelerator program Entrepreneur First in September 2019 and have gone on to raised money from both London investors and grant support from the Oxford Foundry / University of Oxford and Innovate UK.</p>
<p>Julia Hawkins, partner at LocalGlobe, commented: “Vatic’s technology is the future of testing. It’s fantastic to hear how many top UK organizations are taking the initiative and putting employee testing at the forefront of their business recovery plan. This new round of investment will be key in ensuring the successful roll-out of KnowNow tests across the UK and internationally and getting economies moving again with minimal interruptions.”</p>
<p>Rob Kniaz, partner at Hoxton Ventures, added: “A saliva-only swab is a true breakthrough in the world of uncomfortable and tricky rapid testing and the speed that the Vatic team have got it to market is very impressive. Excitingly for the business, this test is just the start of their journey &#8211; the opportunities to innovate in the at-home testing market are endless.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.theartemisfund.com/">The Artemis Fund</a> is a Houston-based firm built by three women with the goal of encouraging more women-led startups. The company launched in 2019 and has raised a $15 million initial fund, which closed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Diana Murakhovskaya, who launched the firm with Stephanie Campbell and Leslie Goldman, says that the three women met over a mutual interest in investing in startups, one that didn&#8217;t just write a check and walk away, but that was really involved in helping these companies grow and thrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched the fund in 2019, and we were looking to raise a micro VC to invest in about 15 companies, and keep a concentrated portfolio where we can really help these companies,&#8221; she said. The LPs in the fund are split 50/50 between men and women with an equal capital share among them, she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The women recognized that female founders faced an up-hill battle when it came to getting funding. In fact, in 2019 <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/eoy-2019-diversity-report-20-percent-of-newly-funded-startups-in-2019-have-a-female-founder/">Crunchbase research found</a> that just 13% percent of VC money went to startups with at least one female founder with all female founding teams accounting for just 3% of that.</p>

<p>At the same time, as the women came together in the Houston investing scene, they couldn&#8217;t help but notice that it was mostly dominated by older white men. Murakhovskaya, whose background is engineering, connected with Campbell, who has an MBA and they wanted to know why more women weren&#8217;t getting involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Where are all the women?&#8217; [&#8230;] And so we started doing these dinners to bring together women and asking them why they&#8217;re not investing, what they&#8217;re doing and, and these were all corporate women [who had the money to invest].&#8221;</p>
<p>What they found was that either women had never been invited to invest, or like them they were looking to do it, but found angel investing less than satisfying. About this time, they met Goldman, who was a lawyer, and was on the board at the Houston Angel Network. &#8220;She&#8217;s an active angel in about 50 companies and 11 funds and similarly had this thesis of shifting all of her investing to female founders at the time,&#8221; Murakhovskaya said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The three women with distinctly different professional backgrounds decided to come together and the idea for The Artemis Fund began to take shape. &#8220;We thought it was the perfect [mix] &#8212; kind of what happens when an engineer, an MBA and a lawyer get together. So, we find that our backgrounds are unique, and that helps a lot of our portfolio companies in a lot of different ways,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That meant they wanted to be involved with the founders and help them grow the businesses. &#8220;And so that was one thing we wanted to make sure that differentiates us from the other female-focused VCs. We would invest nationally, we would lead or co-lead most of our rounds and really help the companies along the capital stack. And that meant running a much more concentrated portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fund focuses on startups with female founders, who are in large potential markets, but ones that conventional male-dominated VCs might not see the potential in. Among the portfolio companies is UNest, a company that helps families take advantage of tax-exempt college savings accounts to save money for their kids&#8217; college education and Upgrade, a maker of custom wigs and extensions. These businesses checked each of these boxes of being run by a woman in a large market that had been mostly ignored by the traditional investment community.</p>
<p>Murakhovskaya says so far the firm has invested in 11 companies with plans to invest 4-5 more and then raise the next fund. She says while it&#8217;s about helping nurture and build these companies, it&#8217;s also about finding companies that continue to grow into their Series A, B and beyond, while delivering a good return for the company&#8217;s partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a charity or philanthropy. We really believe that women and diverse teams in particular will outperform, on top of bringing together a different set of companies and products and services that are just not being met for the consumers that they&#8217;re trying to serve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration just introduced a sweeping, ambitious plan to forcibly inject competition into some consolidated sectors of the American economy — the tech sector prominent among them — through executive action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today President Biden is taking decisive action to reduce the trend of corporate consolidation, increase competition, and deliver concrete benefits to America’s consumers, workers, farmers, and small businesses,&#8221; a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">White House fact sheet</a> on the forthcoming order states.</p>
<p>The order, which Biden will sign Friday, initiates a comprehensive &#8220;whole-of-government&#8221; approach that loops in more then twelve different agencies at the federal level to regulate monopolies, protect consumers and curtail bad behavior from some of the world&#8217;s biggest corporations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the fact sheet, the White House lays out its plans to take matters to regulate big business into its own hands at the federal level. As far as tech is concerned, that comes largely through emboldening the FTC and the Justice Department — two federal agencies with antitrust enforcement powers.</p>
<p>Most notably for big tech, which is already bracing for regulatory existential threats, the White House explicitly asserts here that those agencies have legal cover to &#8220;challenge prior bad mergers that past Administrations did not previously challenge&#8221; — i.e. unwinding acquisitions that built a handful of tech companies into the behemoths they are today. The order calls on antitrust agencies to enforce antitrust laws &#8220;vigorously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal scrutiny will prioritize &#8220;dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by &#8216;free&#8217; products, and the effect on user privacy.&#8221; Facebook, Google and Amazon are particularly on notice here, though Apple isn&#8217;t likely to escape federal attention either.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past ten years, the largest tech platforms have acquired hundreds of companies—including alleged &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; meant to shut down a potential competitive threat,&#8221; the White House wrote in the fact sheet. &#8220;Too often, federal agencies have not blocked, conditioned, or, in some cases, meaningfully examined these acquisitions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest tech companies have regularly defended their longstanding strategy of buying up the competition by arguing that because those acquisitions went through without friction at the time, they shouldn&#8217;t be viewed as illegal in hindsight. In no uncertain terms, the new executive order makes it clear that the Biden administration isn&#8217;t having any of it.</p>

<p>The White House also specifically singles out internet service providers for scrutiny, ordering the FCC to prioritize consumer choice and institute broadband &#8220;nutrition labels&#8221; that clearly state speed caps and hidden feeds. The FCC began working on the labels in the Obama administration but the work was scrapped after Trump took office.</p>
<p>The order also directly calls on the FCC to restore net neutrality rules, which were stripped in 2017 to the widespread horror of open internet advocates and most of the tech industry outside of the service providers that stood to benefit.</p>

<p>The White House will also tell the FTC to create new privacy rules meant to guard consumers against surveillance and the &#8220;accumulation of extraordinarily amounts of sensitive personal information,&#8221; which free services like Facebook, YouTube and others have leveraged to build their vast empires. The White House also taps the FTC to create rules that protect smaller businesses from being pre-empted by large platforms, which in many cases abuse their market dominance with a different sort of data-based surveillance to out-compete up-and-coming competitors.</p>
<p>Finally, the executive order encourages the FTC to put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/massachusetts-voters-pass-a-right-to-repair-measure-giving-them-unprecedented-access-to-their-car-data/">right to repair rules</a> in place that would free consumers from constraints that discourage DIY and third-party repairs. A new White House Competition Council under the Director of the National Economic Council will coordinate the federal execution of the proposals laid out in the new order.</p>
<p>The antitrust effort from the executive branch mirrors parallel actions in the FTC and Congress. In the FTC, Biden has installed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">fearsome antitrust crusader in Lina Khan</a>, a young legal scholar and fierce Amazon critic who proposes a philosophical overhaul to the way the federal government defines monopolies. Khan now leads the FTC as its chair.</p>
<p>In Congress, a bipartisan flurry of bills intended to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">rein in the tech industry</a> are slowly wending their way toward becoming law, though plenty of hurdles remain. Last month, the House Judiciary Committee debated the six bills, which were crafted separately to help them survive opposing lobbying pushes from the tech industry. These legislative efforts could modernize antitrust laws, which have failed to keep pace with the modern realities of giant, internet-based businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Competition policy needs new energy and approaches so that we can address America’s monopoly problem,&#8221; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a prominent tech antitrust hawk in Congress, said of the executive order. &#8220;That means legislation to update our antitrust laws, but it also means reimagining what the federal government can do to promote competition under our current laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing the acceleration of corporate consolidation in recent decades, the White House argues that a handful of large corporations dominates across industries, including healthcare, agriculture and tech and consumers, workers and smaller competitors pay the price for their outsized success. The administration will focus antitrust enforcement on those corners of the market as well as evaluating the labor market and worker protections on the whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inadequate competition holds back economic growth and innovation&#8230; Economists find that as competition declines, productivity growth slows, business investment and innovation decline, and income, wealth, and racial inequality widen,&#8221; the White House wrote.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We asked several analysts to identify the top problems he will have to address in his new role.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s not easy following a larger-than-life founder and CEO of an iconic company, but that&#8217;s what former AWS CEO Andy Jassy faces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/today-is-day-1-for-andy-jassy-as-former-aws-ceo-moves-to-amazon-corner-office/">this week as he takes over for Jeff Bezos</a>, who moves into the executive chairman role. Jassy must deal with myriad challenges as he becomes the head honcho at the No. 2 company on the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>How he handles these challenges will define his tenure at the helm of the online retail giant. We asked several analysts to identify the top problems he will have to address in his new role.</p>
<h2>Ensure a smooth transition</h2>
<p>Handling that transition smoothly and showing investors and the rest of the world that it&#8217;s business as usual at Amazon is going to be a big priority for Jassy, said Robin Ody, an analyst at Canalys. He said it&#8217;s not unlike what Satya Nadella faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/">when he took over as CEO</a> at Microsoft in 2014.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Handling the transition smoothly and showing investors and the rest of the world that it&#8217;s business as usual at Amazon is going to be a big priority for Jassy.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest task is that you&#8217;re following Jeff Bezos, so his overarching issue is going to be stability and continuity. … The eyes of the world are on that succession. So managing that I think is the overall issue and would be for anyone in the same position,&#8221; Ody said.</p>
<p>Forrester analyst Sucharita Kodali said Jassy&#8217;s biggest job is just to keep the revenue train rolling. &#8220;I think the biggest to-do is to just continue that momentum that the company has had for the last several years. He has to make sure that they don&#8217;t lose that. If he does that, I mean, he will win,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Maintain company growth</h2>
<p>As an online retailer, the company has thrived during COVID, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2021/02/02/amazons-net-profit-soars-84-with-sales-hitting-386-billion/?sh=5af104ba1334">generating $386 billion in revenue in 2020</a>, up more than $100 billion over the prior year. As Jassy takes over and things return to something closer to normal, will he be able to keep the revenue pedal to the metal?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It appears users will eventually have the choice of whether to compress photos and videos to perhaps save on their data allowance, send them in the best available quality or let WhatsApp automatically select the optimal level of compression for files.</p>
<p>The settings are present in an update WhatsApp submitted to the Google Play Beta Program, as spotted by <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-14-16-whats-new/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>WABetaInfo</em></a>. The options will probably arrive in the public Android build of the app, though it&#8217;s not clear when — they&#8217;re currently in development. It&#8217;s likely the additional image quality options will come to iOS as well, since WhatsApp generally maintains the same features across both platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This could come as welcome news for those who don&#8217;t use the stock messaging apps on iOS or Android and often share photos and videos of their loved ones (Apple Messages retains the original image quality most of the time). Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">multi-device support</a> is also on the way to WhatsApp.</p>

Didomi is already doing well in Europe with billions of consent interactions per month — it plans to expand to the U.S. with today’s funding round.</p>
<p>“Jawad, Raphaël and I have co-founded Didomi to make privacy easier for everyone and an obvious choice for companies. This fundraising is a major milestone on our journey to deliver on this mission,” co-founder and CEO Romain Gauthier said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We look forward to helping brands and publishers make customer journeys more transparent and trustworthy through a delightful consent and preferences management experience,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, many regulators have implemented new privacy-focused frameworks. You might think about GDPR in Europe for instance.</p>
<p>And if you live in a country that is affected by those changes, you are now well aware that you’ll get a consent popup or banner whenever you visit a new website or open an app for the first time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that these popups are “delightful” as the best consent popup is the one that doesn’t exist because the site you’re visiting doesn’t collect and share personal data. But that’s not always possible and there are different reasons why you may need to collect data — including on this current site techcrunch dot com.</p>
<p>In that case, a product like Didomi can be really helpful. Taking those consent flows seriously is extremely important as you don’t want to mess up the implementation and get fined. Didomi is a developer-focused consent platform that works across many different devices. You can configure your consent flow for a desktop website, a mobile website, a mobile app or a connected TV.</p>
<p>Having a unified solution also means that you don’t have to ask for permission over and over again. Didomi can store and synchronize preferences across devices. Everything is auditable in case regulators want to see how you’re collecting consent.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to make its product even more developer friendly with open APIs and open-source SDKs. It doesn’t mean that Didomi is for everyone as the company focuses on premium clients in particular. Clients include Rakuten, Orange, Giphy and Weight Watchers International.</p>
<p>The company will also hire more people with local marketing and sales teams for different markets. Didomi plans to open offices in Germany, Spain and the U.S.</p>
<p>At the same time, the landscape is quickly evolving. Web browsers are gradually blocking third-party trackers and Apple now even asks you if an app can track you at the operating system level. It’s going to be interesting to see how Didomi evolves with user expectations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">Ransomware</a> attacks, fueled by COVID-19 pandemic turbulence, have become a major money earner for cybercriminals, with the number of attacks rising in 2020.</p>
<p>These file-encrypting attacks have continued largely unabated this year, too. In the last few months alone we’ve witnessed the attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a> that forced the company to shut down its systems — and the gasoline supply — to much of the eastern seaboard, the hack on meat supplier JBS that abruptly halted its slaughterhouse operations around the world, and just this month a supply chain attack on IT vendor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">Kaseya that saw hundreds of downstream victims locked out</a> of their systems.</p>
<p>However, while ransomware attacks continue to make headlines, it’s nearly impossible to understand their full impact, nor is it known whether taking certain decisions — such as paying the cybercriminals’ ransom demands — make a difference.</p>
<p>Jack Cable, a security architect at Krebs Stamos Group who previously worked for the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), is looking to solve that problem with the launch of a crowdsourced ransom payments tracking website, <a href="https://ransomwhe.re">Ransomwhere</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“I was inspired to start Ransomwhere by Katie Nickels&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/likethecoins/status/1402248769123631104?s=20">tweet</a> that no one really knows the full impact of cybercrime, and especially ransomware,” Cable told TechCrunch. “After seeing that there&#8217;s currently no single place for public data on ransomware payments, and given that it&#8217;s not hard to track bitcoin transactions, I started hacking it together.”</p>
<p>The website keeps a running tally of ransoms paid out to cybercriminals in bitcoin, made possible thanks to the public record-keeping of transactions on the blockchain. As the site is crowdsourced, it incorporates data from self-reported incidents of ransomware attacks, which anyone can submit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> However, i</span>n order to make sure all reports are legitimate, each submission is required to take a screenshot of the ransomware payment demand, and every case is reviewed manually by Cable himself before being made publicly available. If an approved report’s authenticity is later called into question, it will be removed from the database.</p>
<p>The already-burgeoning database, which doesn’t include any personal or victim-identifying information, is available as a free download for the cybersecurity community and law enforcement officials, which Cable hopes will help give some much-needed public transparency about the current state of the problem.</p>
<p>“As we consider policy proposals to change the state of ransomware economics, we will need data to assess whether these actions are successful,&#8221; Cable said. “For law enforcement, as we saw with the Colonial Pipeline hack, law enforcement does have the ability to recover some payments, so it would be great if this can further aid their efforts.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the site is tracking a total of more than $32 million in ransom payments for 2021. The bulk of these payments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">have been made to the REvil</a>, the Russia-linked ransomware gang that took credit for the JBS and Kaseya hacks. The group has racked up more than $11 million in ransom payments this year, according to Ransomwhere, an amount that could increase dramatically if its recent demands for $70 million as part of the Kaseya attack are met.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p>RangarLocker, DarkSide and Egregor round out Ransomwhere’s top five list — for now at least — having amassed sums of $4.6 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Cable says that going forward, he’s exploring ways of partnering with companies in the security and blockchain analysis spaces in order to integrate data that they already have on ransomware actions. He’s also looking at ways to support other traceable cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, as well as at the potential to track downstream bitcoin addresses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It&#8217;ll never be possible to get the full picture — criminals who are using Monero will be nearly impossible to track”, Cable says. &#8220;But I would like to get as complete of a picture as possible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market is racing ahead, foot on the gas, middle finger out the window, hair on fire. That’s our read of the Q2 2021 data released thus far concerning how much money venture capitalists deployed around the world during the second three months of the year.</p>
<p>Startups have never had it this good when it comes to accessing private-market funds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The second quarter of 2021 was the biggest quarter for venture capital activity ever, measured by dollars invested. The wave of funding led to a quarterly record of new unicorns &#8212; startups that reach the $1 billion valuation threshold &#8212; born in the United States, Asia, Europe and Canada, according <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q2-2021">to CB Insights data</a> reviewed by The Exchange.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://insight.factset.com/venture-capital-activity-skyrockets-in-the-first-half-of-2021">from FactSet</a> concerning the quarter agrees. The second quarter was a record-breaker in terms of dollars invested, even if total deal volume eased some from the first quarter’s tally.</p>
<p>The impact of the deluge of capital is what you’d expect: Round values are rising. Deals worth $100 million are setting records. Around the world, technology hubs are enjoying a flurry of high-priced deals that are enriching startups and providing them with capital at earlier stages that used to be reserved for IPOs and other seminal funding events.</p>

Next week, we’ll publish a host of geography-focused notes and reactions from investors and founders in the U.S. startup ecosystem, along with similar entries concerning the Asian and European startup markets.</p>
<p>Chatting with venture capitalists in recent months led us to expect strong second-quarter results; investors have spoken about ever-faster follow-on rounds and the explosion of high-priced, big-dollar deal-making from Tiger. SoftBank’s second vision fund is active. And there are myriad seed, early-stage, late-stage and crossover funds all competing with each other both inside and outside their normal investing stage bands in hopes of either accreting earlier, larger ownership than a bigger investing group might have in years past or working to defend early ownership past where earlier-stage firms used to exit stage left.</p>
<p>But enough words. Let’s get into the numbers. We’ll start with an overview of global results before diving into U.S. and Silicon Valley tallies, Europe and Asia&#8217;s performances, and new data concerning venture capital activity in Africa.</p>
<p>Buckle up.</p>
<h2>A monster quarter</h2>
<p>We’re pulling from a number of sources this morning, but for global data, we’re leaning on CB Insights, Crunchbase News and FactSet.</p>
<p>CB Insights has $156 billion on the books for global venture capital activity in the second quarter, up from $60.7 billion in Q2 2020. That’s a gain of 157% on a year-over-year basis. A FactSet chart indicates around $150 billion was raised in the second quarter, up a similar percentage from its year-ago result as what CB Insights counted.</p>
<p>For the first half of 2021, inclusive of the record second-quarter tally, the data is similarly shocking. Crunchbase News <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/">counts $288 billion invested</a> during the first and second quarters of the year. CB Insights reckons the number of $292.4 billion. FactSet comes to a number that it describes as “over $280 billion.”</p>
<p>Those are all close enough for us, and they say the same thing: Global startups raised either as much, or very nearly as much, in the first two quarters of 2021 as they did in all of 2020.</p>
<p>As a reference point, Crunchbase News notes that the first half of 2021 crushed the second half of 2020 by $110 billion, in terms of global capital raised.</p>
<p>But what about round counts? Was all that capital concentrated in a few investments, or did the money flow freely to more startups than ever? Here, things get a little tricky. CB Insights data states that there were 7,751 startup deals in the second quarter, an all-time high. FactSet counts 5,400, far from its recorded record. At this juncture we’re seeing discrepancies in how different data-focused firms count; Alex was party to similar conversations during his time at Crunchbase and is sympathetic to the difficulty of deciding what to include and not in these types of surveys.</p>
<p>But even FactSet data indicates that the second quarter was the second-best three-month period for venture round counts since the start of 2019. No matter how you count, then, the data indicates lots of deals &#8212; and even more dollars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flashapp.com.br/">Flash</a>, a startup that has developed a flexible benefits platform for Brazilian companies and employees, has raised $22 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</p>
<p>Monashees (which led Flash’s Series A), Global Founders Capital (who backed Flash’s seed round), Citius and Kauffman Fellows also participated in the financing.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by childhood friends Ricardo Salem, Guilherme Lane and Pedro Lane, Flash is out to revamp what it views as an antiquated way of offering benefits to employees in South America’s largest country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The São Paulo-based company has built a flexible benefit management app provided with a Mastercard in an effort to replace what has historically been provided in the form of “outdated, commoditized and mandatory” meal/food and transportation “vouchers.”</p>
<p>“Our first product was a reinvention of the voucher that by Brazilian labor law, was something of a mandatory benefit for all companies to give as part of compensation,” Salem said. “There are four traditional incumbents, owned by the banks, that held 95% of the market with very outdated products and fat margins, and exploitation all over.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, Flash took its offering a step further by giving companies a way to configure their benefits offering so employees can “choose and manage their benefits as they want” via Flash’s app marketplace and card, noted Salem.</p>
<p>The company must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Since its inception, Flash has grown its customer base to 4,000 companies, ranging from startups and SMEs to enterprises.</p>
<p>Last year, Flash grew “10x” by all metrics. It went from 10,000 employees to 100,000 using its platform. So far, this year that number has already swelled to 250,000. While the company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Lane said the growth in customers is reflected in the company’s GMV. Flash has also grown from about 50 to 200 employees over the past 8 months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175395" style="width: 5194px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175395" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175395 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg" alt="" width="5184" height="3456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cartão_mesa_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5184px) 100vw, 5184px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175395" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flash</p></div></p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic when companies were sending employees home and wanting to help them pay bills for electricity and utilities, there wasn’t any instrument to help them do so, Salem said.</p>
<p>“So we built one in our app, which leverages our wallet and it was able to read the bar or QR code of the utility provider,” he added. “It became a very popular benefit.”</p>
<p>Within that same wallet, Flash has built another product &#8212; an incentive and rewards platform..</p>
<p>Even with all its early success, Flash has just a 1% market share so believes “there’s plenty of room to grow.” And, it views itself as “much more of a horizontal play than a geographical play.”</p>
<p>“We’re solving other pain points for companies in Brazil now, and that’s our plan for the short term,” Lane said.</p>
<p>“In the beginning, we saw this as a very cool thing very modern tech companies wanted,” Salem said. “But last year proved that this is not just a midsize tech company product. This is for every employee from tech employees to blue collar workers to CEOs. Everyone has a flexible benefit need and different lifestyles and need a product adapted to all of those.”</p>
<p>Global Founders Capital’s Fabricio Pettena led Flash’s seed round back in 2019. He said he had been searching for disruption in the space for “a long time.”</p>
<p>“Since it is a big market in Brazil due to regulation, the incumbents really rip off restaurants and others,” Pettena told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said he knew immediately he wanted to invest in Flash.</p>
<p>“Flash’s team actually took an active role in the regulation change that allowed for flexible benefits, instead of just playing passive,” he said. “When we first met, within 15 minutes, it was clear that, apart from a couple of details, we already shared a common vision for how this disruption would take place.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.frontier-jobs.com/">Frontier</a>, which bills itself as a “new kind of vertically integrated jobs marketplace” launches today with a $2.8 million investment round led by NFX in the U.S., and backed by London’s firstminute Capital, FJ Labs, Cyan Banister, Ilkka Pannanen, Alex Bouaziz, Liquid 2 and several other funds and angels.</p>
<p>Frontier’s schtick is that it pre-tests applicants, weeds out the best candidates, and then allows them to directly book interviews with the employers, thus saving time and money in the hiring process.</p>
<p>But Frontier isn’t going after complex roles here. It&#8217;s aimed at companies who need a high volume of low-skilled workers. Among its customers so far are Carrol’s (the largest franchisor of Burger King) and Concentrix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Elliot O’Connor, founder and CEO of Frontier said: “We believe the hiring experience is a fragmented workflow for both employer and jobseeker, which dramatically slows down the time-to-fill for positions and leads to rigid labor markets — something the world can’t afford right now. To fix hiring, a platform must own more of the hiring funnel than job platforms currently do, and use that position to redefine the experience.”</p>
<p>Elliot told me over a call that they are not using an algorithm in the AI sense of the word. It also removes unconscious bias by applying skill-based assessments: “We&#8217;re focused on high-volume, low-skilled workers, so for example, customer support or retail or warehouses. So we’re just assessing for things like typing speed, etc. No one&#8217;s going to look at the resume. It&#8217;s a rule-based system so that the company does get to set the rules themselves. There&#8217;s no AI.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We&#8217;ve gone and eaten up a lot of the different pieces of software that are out there and combined them into a single vertically integrated whole. So we&#8217;ve got a screening software that&#8217;s basically modular so every customer gets their own screening, according to their own criteria and the machine does it for them. So at the interviews they&#8217;re going to have qualified candidates.”</p>
<p>Pete Flint, NFX general partner, said: “Frontier is changing the entire talent-sourcing process by providing an on-demand experience that’s already present in so many parts of life. Shortening the window of finding work and making hires is creating substantial benefits across large segments of the labor market. The network effects embedded in Frontier’s product and business model make it completely different to the traditional incumbents.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage robotics fundraising is accelerating, with funding coming from boutiques to deep-pocketed venture capital firms. For founders, getting their idea from concept to company, or developing a minimum viable product, is daunting enough, but seeking an initial fundraising round brings a complexity that can be especially challenging to manage.</p>
<p>So how do robotics startups best approach fundraising and secure the financing to propel their company to the next level? There are five key areas to keep in mind about fundraising for robotics startups that founders must learn and practice.</p>
<h2>Understand the proper fit between your company’s scale and the fund’s scale</h2>
<p>Too often, founders court venture capitalists without understanding that the company they are founding might not be the right fit for VCs. Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.</p>
<p>They are not geared toward backing entrepreneurs looking for an exit under $100 million that will only realize a handful of multiples for the investor. VCs are more likely looking to fund on a much larger scale — think a $1-billion-plus exit valuation — and back a company with the potential to deliver at least a 10x return.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Venture capital firms generally, and ones that invest in robotics specifically, look to invest in startups that have clearly identified potential to scale exponentially.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Usually, robotics companies are capital-intensive and require a robust revenue model compared to pure software startups, and this is not for every VC. In fact, venture capital is likened to “rocket fuel” that is dangerous if put into a car but perfect for a rocket ready to shoot for escape velocity. Smaller-scale ventures often do not interest VCs but might be perfect for angel investors.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Do your homework, manage expectations, and seek funding from investors working at a scale commensurate with your idea and comfortable with the unique needs of robotics companies.</p>
<h2>Consider capital sources that fit different companies and startups at different stages of its growth</h2>
<p>Now is a great time for starting a company, in part because there have never been more sources of financing available. Angel investors and venture capitalists are just a portion of what is available.</p>
<p>There is growing opportunity, especially for robotics and AI startups, in nondilutive capital, including from U.S. government sources such as Department of Energy and Department of Defense grants. There are loaded/nondilutive funding streams, such as convertible debt, available from financial institutions and angels.</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, especially for hardware and robotics companies, have become popular in recent years. Some of these might be a better fit for your company at the current (or future) stage of your organizational growth cycle.</p>
<p>But some sophistication is warranted. Ask yourself what constraints or potential downsides come with the specific funding model you are considering/pursuing. Government grants, for instance, might drive the pace of development or push you toward certain customer-facing directions in ways that could be ill-suited to your company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">And just like that, it’s day two of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>! Yesterday not only flew by in a blur — it was also certifiably off the hook. We hope you came away with new information, actionable advice that you can implement in your business right away and that you connected with your peers and other startup folks for support and opportunities along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Pssst:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy a ticket</a> and tune in to today’s main event (see below).</p>
<p>We also hope you got a good night’s sleep because today is all about the pitch-off! Ten early-stage founders — hand-picked by the TechCrunch crew — will throw down in classic pitch-battle fashion in front of these highly experienced and definitely discerning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/announcing-the-early-stage-pitch-off-judges-2/">VC judges</a>: Ben Sun of Primary Venture Partners, Leah Solivan of Fuel Capital and Index Ventures’ Shardul Shah.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each startup team has only five minutes to pitch their company, business model and creative ideas — followed by a Q&amp;A from our esteemed judges. When the pitch dust settles, one winner will get a feature article on TechCrunch.com, a one-year free subscription to Extra Crunch and a complimentary Founder Pass to TechCrunch Disrupt this fall.</p>
<p>Whether you’re at Disrupt, Early Stage or a TC Session event, if you have a chance to see other founders pitch or watch VCs conduct a pitch deck teardown — take it. It’ll help you refine your own pitch.</p>
<blockquote><p>I walked away with a bunch of notes to reorganize my pitch deck, and I’ve watched the pitch deck teardown videos multiple times, including side by side with my pitch deck. It&#8217;s a lot of work, but it’s very rewarding because now I have a clear path. Disrupt was like an authoritative instruction manual for how to finish my pitch deck. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were on deck this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> on the recording and edit. Natasha will be back with us starting next week. So, it was old times on the show with just two of our team to vamp on the news. And oh <em>boy</em> was there a lot of news to get into. Like, loads.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with Didi?</strong> Didi&#8217;s woes have continued this week, with the company seeing its share price continue to fall. The Equity team&#8217;s view is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/will-didis-regulatory-problems-make-it-harder-for-chinese-startups-to-go-public-in-the-us/">the era of Chinese companies listing in the United States is over</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What&#8217;s going on with facial recognition tech? </strong>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/">AnyVision raising a $235 million round</a>, Danny and Alex tangled over the future of privacy, and what counts as good enough when it comes to keeping ourselves to ourselves.</li>
<li><strong>Nextdoor is going public:</strong> Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">a SPAC, mind</a>, but the transaction had our tongues wagging about its history, growth, and how hard it can be to build a social network.</li>
<li><strong>Dataminr buys WatchKeeper:</strong> In its first-ever acquisition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/dataminr-watchkeeper-acquisition/">Dataminr bought a smaller company</a> to help it better visualize the data it collects. It&#8217;s a neat deal, and especially fun given that Dataminr should go public sooner rather than later.</li>
<li><strong>Planet and Satellogic are going public:</strong> One week, two satellite SPACs. You can read more about Planet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">here</a>, and Satellogic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>FabricNano and Cloverly raise capital:</strong> Satellites had us into the concept of climate change, so we also dug into recent funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/fabricnano-raises-12-5m-to-help-scale-its-cell-free-fossil-fuel-alternative-technology/">rounds from FabricNano</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/cloverly-snags-2-1m-seed-to-continue-developing-api-to-measure-and-offset-carbon-usage/">and Cloverly</a>. It&#8217;s beyond neat to see for-profit companies tackle our warming planet.</li>
<li><strong>Two new venture capital funds:</strong> Acrylic has put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/acrylic-debut-crypto-fund/">together a $55 million fund for moonshot crypto work</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/renegade-partners-rolls-out-its-much-anticipated-debut-fund-with-100-million/">Renegade Partners has a $100 million fund</a> for early-and-mid-stage generalist investments.</li>
<li><strong>Mmhmm is big time:</strong> And then there was mmhmm. Which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/">now has $100 million more</a>, and some big plans. Our question is what will it do with the money. We&#8217;ll have to wait and find out, we suppose.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robots have a hard time improvising, and encountering an unusual surface or obstacle usually means an abrupt stop or hard fall. But researchers have created a new model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real time to any terrain it encounters, changing its gait on the fly to keep trucking when it hits sand, rocks, stairs and other sudden changes.</p>
<p>Although robotic movement can be versatile and exact, and robots can &#8220;learn&#8221; to climb steps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/these-humanoid-robots-can-autonomously-navigate-these-cinder-block-mazes-thanks-to-ihmc/">cross broken terrain</a> and so on, these behaviors are more like individual trained skills that the robot switches between. Although robots like Spot famously can spring back from being pushed or kicked, the system is really just working to correct a physical anomaly while pursuing an unchanged policy of walking. There are some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/09/this-robo-bug-can-improvise-its-walk-like-a-real-insect/">adaptive movement models</a>, but some are very specific (for instance this one based on real insect movements) and others take long enough to work that the robot will certainly have fallen by the time they take effect.</p>
<p>The team, from Facebook AI, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, call it Rapid Motor Adaptation. It came from the fact that humans and other animals are able to quickly, effectively and unconsciously change the way they walk to fit different circumstances.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Say you learn to walk and for the first time you go to the beach. Your foot sinks in, and to pull it out you have to apply more force. It feels weird, but in a few steps you&#8217;ll be walking naturally just as you do on hard ground. What&#8217;s the secret there?&#8221; asked senior researcher Jitendra Malik, who is affiliated with Facebook AI and UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Certainly if you&#8217;ve never encountered a beach before, but even later in life when you have, you aren&#8217;t entering some special &#8220;sand mode&#8221; that lets you walk on soft surfaces. The way you change your movement happens automatically and without any real understanding of the external environment.</p>

Of course the robot would not perceive any of this visually. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening is your body responds to the differing physical conditions by sensing the differing consequences of those conditions on the body itself,&#8221; Malik explained — and the RMA system works in similar fashion. &#8220;When we walk in new conditions, in a very short time, half a second or less, we have made enough measurements that we are estimating what these conditions are, and we modify the walking policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The system was trained entirely in simulation, in a virtual version of the real world where the robot&#8217;s small brain (everything runs locally on the on-board limited compute unit) learned to maximize forward motion with minimum energy and avoid falling by immediately observing and responding to data coming in from its (virtual) joints, accelerometers and other physical sensors.</p>
<p>To punctuate the total internality of the RMA approach, Malik notes that the robot uses no visual input whatsoever. But people and animals with no vision can walk just fine, so why shouldn&#8217;t a robot? But since it&#8217;s impossible to estimate the &#8220;externalities&#8221; such as the exact friction coefficient of the sand or rocks it&#8217;s walking on, it simply keeps a close eye on itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking,&#8221; said co-author Ashish Kumar, also from Berkeley.</p>
<p>Ultimately the system ends up having two parts: a main, always-running algorithm actually controlling the robot&#8217;s gait, and an adaptive algorithm running in parallel that monitors changes to the robot&#8217;s internal readings. When significant changes are detected, it analyzes them — the legs should be doing <em>this</em>, but they&#8217;re doing <em>this</em>, which means the situation is like <em>this</em> — and tells the main model how to adjust itself. From then on the robot only thinks in terms of how to move forward under these new conditions, effectively improvising a specialized gait.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175344" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175344" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2175344 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RMA-examples.gif" alt="Footage of the robot not falling as it traverses various tough surfaces." width="800" height="346" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2175344" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU</p></div></p>
<p>After training in simulation, it succeeded handsomely in the real world, as the news release describes it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The robot was able to walk on sand, mud, hiking trails, tall grass and a dirt pile without a single failure in all our trials. The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials. It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12 kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight.</p></blockquote>

<p>Malik gave a nod to the research of <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/karen-adolph.html">NYU professor Karen Adolph</a>, whose work has shown how adaptable and free-form the human process of learning how to walk is. The team&#8217;s instinct was that if you want a robot that can handle any situation, it has to learn adaptation from scratch, not have a variety of modes to choose from.</p>
<p>Just as you can&#8217;t build a smarter computer-vision system by exhaustively labeling and documenting every object and interaction (there will always be more), you can&#8217;t prepare a robot for a diverse and complex physical world with 10, 100, even thousands of special parameters for walking on gravel, mud, rubble, wet wood, etc. For that matter you may not even want to specify anything at all beyond the general idea of forward motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t pre-program the idea that it has for legs, or anything about the morphology of the robot,&#8221; said Kumar.</p>
<p>This means the basis of the system — not the fully trained one, which ultimately did mold itself to quadrupedal gaits — can potentially be applied not just to other legged robots, but entirely different domains of AI and robotics.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legs of a robot are similar to the fingers of a hand; the way that legs interact with environments, fingers interact with objects,&#8221; noted co-author Deepak Pathak, of Carnegie Mellon University. &#8220;The basic idea can be applied to any robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even further, Malik suggested, the pairing of basic and adaptive algorithms could work for other intelligent systems. Smart homes and municipal systems tend to rely on preexisting policies, but what if they adapted on the fly instead?</p>
<p>For now the team is simply presenting their initial findings in a paper at the <a href="https://roboticsconference.org/">Robotics: Science and Systems</a> conference and acknowledge that there is a great deal of follow-up research to do. For instance building an internal library of the improvised gaits as a sort of &#8220;medium-term&#8221; memory, or using vision to predict the necessity of initiating a new style of locomotion. But the RMA approach seems to be a promising new approach for an enduring challenge in robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new biometrics privacy ordinance has taken effect across New York City, putting new limits on what businesses can do with the biometric data they collect on their customers.</p>
<p>From Friday, businesses that collect biometric information — most commonly in the form of facial recognition and fingerprints — are required to conspicuously post notices and signs to customers at their doors explaining how their data will be collected. The ordinance applies to a wide range of businesses — retailers, stores, restaurants, and theaters, to name a few — which are also barred from selling, sharing, or otherwise profiting from the biometric information that they collect.</p>
<p>The move will give New Yorkers — and its millions of visitors each year — greater protections over how their biometric data is collected and used, while also serving to dissuade businesses from using technology that critics say is discriminatory and often doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Businesses can face stiff penalties for violating the law, but can escape fines if they fix the violation quickly.</p>
<p>The law is by no means perfect, as none of these laws ever are. For one, it doesn&#8217;t apply to government agencies, including the police. Of the businesses that the ordinance does cover, it exempts employees of those businesses, such as those required to clock in and out of work with a fingerprint. And the definition of what counts as a biometric will likely face challenges that could expand or narrow what is covered.</p>
<p>New York is the latest U.S. city to enact a biometric privacy law, after Portland, Oregon passed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">a similar ordinance</a> last year. But the law falls short of stronger biometric privacy laws in effect.</p>
<p>Illinois, which has the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a law that grants residents the right to sue for any use of their biometric data without consent. Facebook this year settled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/facebook-illinois-class-action-bipa/">for $650 million</a> in a class-action suit that Illinois residents filed in 2015 after the social networking giant used facial recognition to tag users in photos without their permission.</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the New York-based Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, said the law is an &#8220;important step&#8221; to learn how New Yorkers are tracked by local businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;A false facial recognition match could mean having the NYPD called on you just for walking into a Rite Aid or Target,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. He also said that New York should go further by outlawing systems like facial recognition altogether, as some cities have done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online grocery startups around the world continue to pull in major investment, underscoring how much they have all grown especially in the last year of pandemic living. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.kurly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurly</a> &#8212; a startup in South Korea that provides next-day grocery delivery services across the country &#8212; has closed $200 million in funding, a Series F valuing the company at $2.2 billion, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>This means the company&#8217;s valuation has more than doubled in the last year. Last April, Kurly closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/korean-grocery-startup-kurly-raises-150m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $150 million</a> at a $780 million valuation.</p>
<p>This latest round is being co-led by Aspex Management, DST Global, Sequoia Capital China and Hillhouse Capital &#8212; all previous backers of the company &#8212; with new investors Millennium Management and CJ Logistics Corporation also participating. CJ Logistics is a strategic backer: it has a deal in place with Kurly to help expand its overnight delivery service to more regions across South Korea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest funding comes right on the heels of a significant u-turn for the business in recent days.</p>
<p>Kurly had been planning an IPO in the U.S. later this year; instead it announced this week that it would instead seek to list in its home market instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurly had explored both overseas and domestic IPO options. After reviewing detailed conditions such as its business model and stock market conditions both at home and abroad, Kurly has decided to go ahead with an initial public offering in the Korean stock market,&#8221; it said in a statement to <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107080007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korea Economic Daily</a>.</p>
<p>Some have reported that Chinese transport giant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/didi-slumps-after-china-regulators-order-stores-to-remove-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Didi&#8217;s rocky start as a public company</a> on the NYSE this month gave Kurly pause on the performance of Asian companies on U.S. exchanges at the moment. Others have reported that the company was <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/special/2021/05/175_308284.html?fl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing issues with some existing private backers</a> wanting to cash out, concerned over the company&#8217;s growth potential &#8212; which might have hastened an IPO while also put more pressure on the company to produce better returns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting too that Coupang, Kurly&#8217;s much bigger rival, is traded in the U.S. market, on the NYSE after going public earlier this year. Its market cap is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CPNG?p=CPNG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently just under $70 billion</a> and so that might also invite unfavorable comparisons.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the shift, this latest round is an interesting signal to the market that investors are keen to continue supporting the company on the back of more market potential. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kurly said the funds will be used to build out its tech stack, talent recruitment, and to expand its coverage of its next-day services.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This funding round is a testament to Kurly’s contributions in transforming customer’s everyday habit of conducting grocery shopping at physical stores into a more convenient way of shopping online by offering a superior selection of products through its innovative delivery service,&#8221; said Seul-A Kim, also known as Sophie Kim, the CEO and founder of Kurly, in a statement. &#8220;The Company has also been successful in bringing merchandises to the customers at a reasonable price through service technology empowered by the use of its proprietary data analytics. We are delighted to have new capital which would allow us to further invest in logistics infrastructure, people and technology to continue to innovate mobile grocery market and improve lives of consumers, producers and workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a strong pace, with $845 million in sales in 2020, up 124% over a year ago. It hasn&#8217;t disclosed whether it is profitable or what its operating margins are, but the theory is that &#8212; as with all e-commerce operations &#8212; as Kurly continues to scale its overnight delivery service, those margins will improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to continue to support Market Kurly with our investment,&#8221; said Hermes Li, the founder and portfolio manager of Aspex Management, in a statement. &#8220;Korea is one of the fastest growing and largest e-commerce markets globally, and Kurly has been the leader in e-Commerce innovation. They have built a consumer centric brand focused on superior product quality and user experience. We believe there is significant potential ahead of Kurly from expansion into other consumer categories and new geographies. Aspex is looking forward to many years of growth with Kurly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online grocery delivery services have seen a massive surge of use and subsequent investor attention in the last year, fueled by people turning to e-commerce in the wake of social distancing to help contain the spread of Covid-19. That&#8217;s included a lot of funding for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large grocers</a> similar to Kurly, as well as smaller, &#8220;instant&#8221; essential grocery players targeting urban consumers, who have collectively raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> to scale their operations in what has quickly become a very crowded market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seed investment firm <a href="https://www.hummingbird.vc/">Hummingbird VC</a>, which previously invested in Deliveroo, Peak Games, MarkaVIP, and Kraken has a new Managing Partner. Firat Ileri, previously a Partner &#8211; who at 28 became one of Europe’s youngest VCs when he joined in 2012 &#8211; takes over from Founding Partner Barend Van den Brande, who will now take on a more strategic role at the firm.</p>
<p>Ileri grew up in Cyprus and went on to study electrical engineering, computer science, and operations research at MIT. At Hummingbird he has lead the firm&#8217;s first investments in Latin America and in South East Asia.</p>
<p>Ileri initially introduced the cofounders of Gram Games, led their first investment, and helped exit the company to Zynga for half a billion. He also led the sale process of Peak Games in 2020, which exited at $1.8Bn, making history as Turkey’s largest tech exit to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2010, Hummingbird is currently on its fourth fund of $200M, raised in Q4 2020, and says it invests from Europe to India, SEA, LATAM, Turkey and more recently in the US.<br />
 <br />
Firat most recently led Hummingbird’s first investments in engineering biology, investing in Billiontoone, the SF-based precision diagnostics company in the prenatal and liquid biopsy space, which has raised a $55M Series B round. It&#8217;s also invested in Kernal Biologics, an mRNA 2.0 therapeutics company focused on oncology.</p>
<p>Van den Brande said: “From the moment Firat joined us in the very early days of Hummingbird, he hit the ground running. His eye for unique and ambitious founding teams, and unparalleled expertise in Seed investing, persistence and really understanding what Early Stage companies need has made him an invaluable asset to Hummingbird and all of the founders we work with. I&#8217;m only pleased to have Firat take on the role and lead the Hummingbird family and portfolio for years to come.”</p>
<p>Ileri said the firm’s thesis was to invest in stand-out founders: “We&#8217;re spending much more time trying to understand who these people are and what makes them special. In a way, we&#8217;re looking for anomalies in people, and we believe that the best companies are created with nonlinear backgrounds. So, this is the thesis.”</p>
<p>He said the team has expanded to drive this vision: “We used to be a boutique fund, but we have the ambition to be more and especially to look for founders who have an independent mind and huge ambitions. To be able to find more companies we&#8217;ve gone more global, in order to have a better chance of finding these special stories.”</p>
