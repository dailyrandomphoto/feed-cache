										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s top market watchdog has begun a probe into Alibaba over alleged anti-competition practices at the e-commerce firm, the latest of Beijing&#8217;s efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/china-literature-alibaba-fined/">curb the country&#8217;s ever-expanding internet titans</a>.</p>
<p>The State Administration for Market Regulation said Thursday in a brief <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201224_324638.html">statement</a> that it is investigating Alibaba over its &#8220;choosing one from two&#8221; policy, in which merchants are forced to sell exclusively on Alibaba and skip rivaling platforms JD.com and Pinduoduo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Alibaba Group has received notification from the State Administration for Market Regulation that an investigation has been initiated into the Company pursuant to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Alibaba will actively cooperate with the regulators on the investigation,&#8221; Alibaba said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Company business operations remain normal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alibaba&#8217;s shares tumbled more than 8% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the same day, state-backed Xinhua <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2020-12/24/c_1126900017.htm">reported</a> that Ant Group, Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate, has been summoned by a group of finance authorities to discuss its &#8220;compliance&#8221; work. Ant, which operates the popular Alipay e-wallet and works as an intermediary for financial services and customers, has pledged to take measures to curb debt risks after Chinese <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">authorities abruptly </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">called off</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> its colossal initial public offering last month.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Ant Group received a meeting notice from regulators. We will seriously study and strictly comply with all regulatory requirements and commit full efforts to fulfill all related work,&#8221; the firm <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nxNILHzQytiglFoKHtB22A">said</a> in a statement.</p>
<p>Some argue that the clampdown is a long time coming for China&#8217;s internet giants, which have been allowed to grow under a relatively loose regulatory environment. The Alibaba case is a &#8220;significant step&#8221; in China&#8217;s anti-monopolistic regulations on the internet industry, said an opinion piece published in the official newspaper of China&#8217;s ruling Communist Party. Assuaging worries that stricter regulations could deal a blow to the industry, the piece said the probe into Alibaba &#8220;is beneficial to restoring orders and promoting long-term, healthy development of the platform economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is currently under fire for apparently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">pushing out a researcher whose work warned of bias in AI</a>, and now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB">a report from Reuters</a> says others doing such work at the company have been asked to &#8220;strike a positive tone&#8221; and undergo additional reviews for research touching on &#8220;sensitive topics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reuters, citing researchers at the company and internal documents, reports that Google has implemented new controls in the last year, including an extra round of inspection for papers on certain topics and seemingly an increase in executive interference at later stages of research.</p>
<p>That certainly appears to have been the case with Dr. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/timnit-gebru" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="timnit-gebru">Timnit Gebru, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an AI researcher at Google whose resignation seems to have been forced under confusing circumstances, following friction between her and management over work that her team was doing. (I&#8217;ve asked Gebru and Google for comment on the story.)</p>
<p>
		<div class="embed breakout" id="vidible_div_0" data-pid="56faf851e4b0d3dcac2e081a" data-bcid="564f313b67b6231408bc51ee" data-video="5bac337dbf4885293903f4f0"></div>
		<span><script type="text/javascript" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/themes/techcrunch-2017/features/shortcodes/vidible-callback-js.php?id=0"></script></span>
		</p>
<p>Among the &#8220;sensitive&#8221; topics, according to an internal webpage seen by Reuters, are: &#8220;the oil industry, China, Iran, Israel, COVID-19, home security, insurance, location data, religion, self-driving vehicles, telecoms and systems that recommend or personalize web content.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that many of these issues are indeed sensitive, though advising researchers to take care when addressing them seems superfluous considering the existence of ethics boards, peer review, and other ordinary controls on research. One researcher who spoke to Reuters warned that this sort of top-down interference from Google could soon get &#8220;into a serious problem of censorship.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is in addition to the fundamental issue of vital research being conducted under the auspices of a company for which it may or may not be in their interest to publish. Naturally large private research institutions have existed for nearly as long as organized scientific endeavor, but companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and others exert an enormous influence over fields like AI and have good reason to avoid criticism of lucrative technologies while shouting their usefulness from every rooftop.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SURPRISE! It's December 23rd. How? Because time doesn't make sense anymore and last week was really a month ago and April was yesterday.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’re here to help! </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>SURPRISE! It&#8217;s December 23rd. How? Because time doesn&#8217;t make sense anymore and last week was really a month ago and April was yesterday.</p>
<p>Last-minute shopping is always pretty dreadful, but this year particularly so. No one should be dropping their social distancing practices just to battle crowds for a twice-returned air fryer. Online retailers, meanwhile, have been warning of shipping delays since before December even started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fortunately, subscription boxes and services exist. They&#8217;re easy to order at the very last minute, easy to give from afar and they&#8217;ll spread the gifting fun out over weeks and months.</p>
<p>Need some ideas? Here&#8217;s some inspiration:</p>
<h2>For the puzzle/escape room fan: Hunt A Killer</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090690" style="width: 514px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090690" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?w=504" alt="" width="504" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png 504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=300,298 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hunt-a-killer.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hunt A Killer</p></div></p>
<p>THERE&#8217;S BEEN A (fictional) MURDER!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been contacted by a detective who needs your help, and your job is to figure out whodunnit through the process of elimination. Each month brings another slice of the story via a box filled with puzzles, newspaper clippings, audio recordings, props and other clues that lead you to the criminal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done a few of these sets with family, and we&#8217;ve very much enjoyed them as a way to lose ourselves in a fictional world for a few hours. It&#8217;s paced in such a way that no single box is a commitment of more than an hour or two, so you can just drop back in whenever you&#8217;ve got the time. You can also expedite the next month&#8217;s box if you don&#8217;t want to wait, which is great.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.huntakiller.com">Varies, but the six-month prepay option gets you one full game for around $165.</a></p>
<h2>For the crafters and scrapbookers: Pipsticks</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090691" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090691" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="279" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=768,315 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=680,279 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pipsticks.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pipsticks</p></div></p>
<p>Got a friend whose childhood love for stickers never faded? Pipsticks will send them a bundle of (really, really nice!) stickers each month. They&#8217;ve got a &#8220;Kids Club&#8221; plan meant specifically for the little ones, or a &#8220;Pro Club&#8221; pack for anyone looking to buff up their journaling/scrapbooking/crafting sticker collection.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.pipsticks.com">Starts at $12 per month</a></p>
<h2>For the dog owners: Barkbox</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090692" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090692" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="386" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg 766w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/barkbox.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Barkbox</p></div></p>
<p>Spoiling dogs is fun. Barkbox brings &#8217;em a constant rotation of treats and toys, all tailored around each month&#8217;s theme, like &#8220;Dogsgiving&#8221; in November or &#8220;Lick or Treat&#8221; back in October. Boxes are tailored to the size of the dog, and they&#8217;ve got a slightly pricier &#8220;Super Chewer&#8221; box with ultra-durable picks for dogs that chomp right through anything you put in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.barkbox.com">Starts at $23 per month</a></p>
<h2>For the highly caffeinated: Coffee subscriptions</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2003668" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2003668" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2003668" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-450769547.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2003668" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tetra Images <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole world of coffee to explore out there, but it&#8217;s way too easy to pick up whatever bag looks pretty and stick with that brand until the end of time. Got a friend that&#8217;s been buying the same red plastic tub of grounds for 10 years? Encourage them to branch out a bit!</p>
<p>There are so, <em>so</em> many options for coffee subscriptions, but a few that our team has tried and can vouch for are: <a href="https://www.yesplz.coffee">YesPlz</a>, <a href="https://www.drinktrade.com">Trade Coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.mistobox.com">Mistobox</a>, <a href="https://www.redbaycoffee.com">Red Bay Coffee</a> and <a href="https://angelscup.com/pages/subscribe">Angel&#8217;s Cup</a></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies</p>
<h2>For the one who wants to read more: Book of the Month</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090694" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090694" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090694" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BOTM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090694" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Book of the Month</p></div></p>
<p>They vet the books, you read them. Each month you pick from one of five genre-spanning options and it&#8217;s dropped at your door. Running short on time and haven&#8217;t finished last month&#8217;s pick, or just not into this month&#8217;s selections? You can skip a month quite easily.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong> <a href="https://www.bookofthemonth.com">Starts at $50 for three months of books</a></p>
<h2>For the new human (and their parents): Lovevery Play Kits</h2>

<p>Got a friend with a newborn and have no idea what to get them? Lovevery takes the subscription box concept and breaks it down month-by-month for the first stretch of a kid&#8217;s life. The newborn box, for example, focuses on high contrast items and things that&#8217;ll make tummy time a little more fun, whereas later boxes bring in toys that help with finer motor skills like stacking and grasping. They also offer boxes for toddlers, introducing concepts like rhyming, matching and counting. The boxes are a bit pricey, but the company makes huge efforts to keep things sustainable and baby safe.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong><a href="https://gifting.lovevery.com/home">Around $80 per box</a></p>

<p>My handwriting is a joke, but I still absolutely love a good pen. One of my favorite stores to just wander around — back when that was a thing we could do — is Maido. Owned by the Japanese bookstore chain Kinokuniya, Maido offers up a carefully curated collection of pens and stationary in a way that&#8217;s exhaustive but not overwhelming.</p>
<p>With the pandemic greatly limiting aimless retail store exploration, Maido has started producing monthly themed boxes where they bring their best goods to you. I&#8217;ve ordered a few of these so far, and each box has been just wonderful. If you&#8217;ve got a friend that has ever spent 20 minutes talking about their favorite pen, this one&#8217;s for them.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://usa.kinokuniya.com/featured-stationery-maido-in-a-box">$35</a></p>
<h2>For the would-be green thumb: Succulent Studios</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090699" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090699" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090699" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="277" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg 691w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=300,122 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=680,277 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/succulent.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090699" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Succulent Studios</p></div></p>
<p>I love plants! Sadly, I also tend to kill plants pretty much immediately. I was very proud this year to grow a whole FOUR grape tomatoes before my tomato plant fell over and died. What the hell am I supposed to do with four grape tomatoes?</p>
<p>As a result, our house and yard are filled with all of the succulents we can find — they&#8217;re super pretty and, thankfully, incredibly hard to kill. A lot of ours came from Succulent Studio, a service that does a wonderful job of finding new plants (with fun names like Lime Sparkler and Superbum) and delivering them safely to your door. If one does happen get beat up en route, they&#8217;ll teach you how to revive it&#8230; or, failing that, they&#8217;ll replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://succulent.studio">$16.50 for two plants a month</a></p>
<h2>For the folks who like wine: MORE WINE</h2>

<p>As with coffee, there are SO many different wines to try and so many different services that want to help you try them all. It&#8217;s tough to narrow it down, but there are plenty of services with proven track records. <a href="https://www.winc.com">Winc</a> has you take a quiz that aims to analyze your tastes and pair accordingly. <a href="https://www.cellarswineclub.com">Cellars Wine Club</a> lets you pick a theme (Imports? Sweet? Sparkling? Reds only?) <a href="https://www.getvinebox.com">Vinebox</a> sends wine by the glass in cute little test tube lookin&#8217; vials so you don&#8217;t have to commit to a whole bottle. TechCrunch&#8217;s own Darrell Etherington likes <a href="https://gargoylewineclub.com/products/wine-club">Gargoyle Wine Club</a>, with the caveat that it only ships to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Varies, but generally around $60-80 per box.</p>
<h2>For the traveler who can&#8217;t travel right now: Try the World</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2090701" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090701" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090701" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="295" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg?resize=680,295 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/try-the-world.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090701" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Try the World</p></div></p>
<p>One of my favorite parts about traveling is wandering into a local grocery store and trying all of the regional staples — all of the snacks, candies and other goodies I&#8217;ve never seen at home. That sort of exploration isn&#8217;t super feasible in 2020, a year when many of us haven&#8217;t even left our own state.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, Try the World brings all of those goodies from around the globe straight to your doorstep. I&#8217;ve had boxes contain regional-favorite hot sauces, teas, spices, mustards and more. The only catch? If you find something you love, finding where to buy more can be tough.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> <a href="https://www.trytheworld.com">Starts at $40 a month</a></p>
<h2>For the snazzy dresser: Gentleman&#8217;s Box</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2090708" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg 797w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gentlemans-box.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>As written by our Editorial Director Henry Pickavet, who I can confirm is often dressed much more nicely than me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I consider myself to be a fairly decent dresser. I tend to lean on ties, tie bars, pocket squares and the like to spruce up a button-down or a gray jacket.</p>
<p>But the choices! The sheer number of accessories, color schemes and levels of fancy can be overwhelming. Which is why I was pretty excited when I came across Gentleman’s Box.</p>
<p>Each month, I receive a small box that includes five to six items: a tie and a pair of socks, as well as a combination of a random mix of a number of other things that alternate from month to month, such as a tie bar, cuff links, a lapel pin and a pocket square. I’ve also received a few watches, a few pairs of sunglasses, a wallet, a tray for odds and ends and money clip. Fancy, right?</p>
<p>Each box also comes with an editorially curated booklet that includes details about how the selections of the month fit together, as well as pictures from customers showing their wares in the wild. I look forward to the end of the pandemic for a number of reasons, and on that list is to be able to go out again and get my dapper on.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, <a href="https://gentlemansbox.com/">ranges from $35 to $100+ per box</a></p>

<p>Why give &#8217;em just one game when you can give them access to <em>tons</em> of games? A lot of the big names in gaming all have Netflix-style on-demand games services now, and they&#8217;re actually pretty dang solid. Sony has PS Now (check out Horizon Zero Dawn, Hollow Knight and the God of War series if you haven&#8217;t already), and Microsoft has Xbox Game Pass (Gears 5! MotoGP 20! Celeste!). Even Apple is getting in on the fun with Apple Arcade — if you dive in there, be sure to check out Beyond a Steel Sky, one of our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/gift-guide-techcrunchs-favorite-things-of-2020/">favorite things of 2020.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following through on his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">previous threat</a>, President Trump has vetoed the $740 million National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a major bill that allocates military funds each year.</p>
<p>In tweets early this month, Trump said he would sink the NDAA if it wasn&#8217;t altered to include language &#8220;terminating&#8221; Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, an essential and previously obscure internet law that the president has had in his crosshairs for the better part of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone knowing what we are doing at every step,&#8221; Trump said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/presidential-veto-message-house-representatives-h-r-6395/">statement</a> on the veto. It&#8217;s not clear what the president meant, or what he was referring to in criticizing the military funding bill as a &#8221; &#8216;gift&#8217; to China and Russia.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it &#8211; corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security &amp; Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe &amp; secure if we allow it to stand&#8230;..</p>
<p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1333965375193624578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The president cited &#8220;bipartisan calls&#8221; for a Section 230 repeal in his decision, in spite of the NDAA&#8217;s overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and the fact that Section 230 reform was never seriously considered in the unrelated military spending bill. Trump also claimed that Section 230 &#8220;facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online,&#8221; a threat that the president, who frequently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">spreads dangerous misinformation online</a>, has historically expressed little concern for.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump&#8217;s odd new attack on Section 230 is probably doomed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/embed/#?secret=cBnMFUPl62" data-secret="cBnMFUPl62" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Section 230 became a hot topic in 2020 as lawmakers, states and the federal government made major moves to rein in the tech industry&#8217;s biggest, most powerful companies. The law protects internet companies from liability for the content they host and is widely credited with opening the doors for internet companies big and small to grow their online business over the years.</p>
<p>Looking for leverage over tech platforms that policed his content, Trump zeroed in on Section 230 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">and Twitter in particular</a> — early this year. In May, the president signed an unusual but largely toothless <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-social-media-executive-order/">executive order</a> attacking tech&#8217;s liability shield. &#8220;The choices Twitter makes when it chooses to edit, blacklist, shadowban are editorial decisions, pure and simple,” Trump said when he signed the order.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s position on Section 230 and the NDAA was never particularly tenable. While the NDAA is a massive piece of legislation, the kind that rolls up many disparate things, altering it to somehow repeal Section 230 was never on the table. It&#8217;s also hard to overstate the unpopularity of the position the president has staked out here. The NDAA funds many parts of the military beyond combat and this year&#8217;s bill includes pay raises for the troops and additional health support for Vietnam veterans.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s views on Section 230 are similarly extreme, even relative to many other members of his party. While there is support for changing Section 230 on both sides of the aisle, Congress is far from a consensus on what needs to change and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/section-230-hearing-big-tech/">complex bipartisan reform effort</a> is ongoing. Throwing Section 230 out altogether is very unlikely to be the end result of whatever kind of reform Congress comes up with in the coming year.</p>
<p>The House plans to convene on Monday to override the president&#8217;s exercise of veto powers, an effort that would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. The House approved the NDAA earlier this month with a veto-proof 355-78 vote, including broad support from the vast majority of House Republicans. The Senate passed the legislation along to the president with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/11/senate-passes-defense-bill-444579">similarly strong bipartisan 84-13 vote</a> in favor of the bill on December 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The value of one of the world&#8217;s most valuable cryptocurrencies is crashing and a recently filed SEC complaint is at the root of the free fall. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the XRP token&#8217;s value has declined more than 42% in the past 24 hours and is down more than 63% from its 30-day high of $0.76. It now sits at just $0.27.</p>
<p>XRP&#8217;s price volatility has rivaled the most capricious of cryptocurrencies. Since reaching an all-time-high of $3.84 back in January of 2018, the coin has spent much of the past two years drifting closer and closer to pennies. In the past month, on the back of major rallies from other cryptocurrencies, XRP has seen its biggest rally in years, but those gains were all erased this week by the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ripple-labs">Ripple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Brad Garlinghouse&#8217;s admission that the SEC was planning to file a sweeping lawsuit against the company during the current administration&#8217;s final days.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2020/comp-pr2020-338.pdf">fundamental argument</a> is that XRP has always been a security and that it should have been registered with the commission from the beginning more than seven years ago. The SEC claims that the defendants in the case &#8212; namely the company Ripple, CEO Bran Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen &#8212; generated more than $1.38 billion from sales of the XRP token.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ripple was recently valued at $10 billion following a $200 million funding round. Ripple and the XRP token are technically separate, but Ripple maintains a significant total of the currency&#8217;s market cap and at one point the XRP token itself was referred to as &#8220;ripple&#8221; and shared a logo with the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KxC6K6W1qZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/ripple-raises-200-million-to-improve-global-payments/">Ripple raises $200 million to improve global payments</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ripple raises $200 million to improve global payments&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/ripple-raises-200-million-to-improve-global-payments/embed/#?secret=KxC6K6W1qZ" data-secret="KxC6K6W1qZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s line has been that XRP is not a security but is, in fact, a tool for financial institutions, though the coin&#8217;s volatility has discouraged banks from actually adopting the token. Meanwhile, XRP is present on a number of cryptocurrency exchanges, a fact which could expand the scope of this legal complaint and affect more players in the space.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ripple.com/insights/the-secs-attack-on-crypto-in-the-united-states/">blog post</a> published yesterday that went live shortly after the SEC&#8217;s suit was filed, Garlinghouse wrote that the SEC&#8217;s claims were &#8220;completely wrong on the facts and law'&#8221; and that the company was &#8220;confident&#8221; they would &#8220;ultimately prevail before a neutral fact-finder.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous delivery startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nuro-2">Nuro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is allowed to launch commercial driverless services on public roads in California — the first company to clear this hurdle — after receiving a permit from the state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro, which was founded in June 2016 by Google alums <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dave-ferguson-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dave-ferguson-3">Dave Ferguson <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Jiajun Zhu, plans to start commercial delivery operations early next year. The so-called Autonomous Vehicle Deployment permit will allow Nuro to operate commercial services — meaning it can charge for delivery — in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. The intention is to start with its autonomous Toyota Prius vehicles in one city and one partner in the early part of 2021, Nuro&#8217;s chief legal and policy officer David Estrada said. The company will eventually transition to its purpose-built R2 delivery bots for its commercial service as well as add more partners and expand geographically.</p>
<p>While Nuro wouldn&#8217;t name the partner or city, it&#8217;s worth noting that the company is headquartered in Mountain View and has previously expressed a desire to start operations close to its main office.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Issuing the first deployment permit is a significant milestone in the evolution of autonomous vehicles in California,” DMV Director Steve Gordon said in a press release issued Wednesday. “We will continue to keep the safety of the motoring public in mind as this technology develops.”</p>
<p>The deployment permit grants Nuro permission to use a fleet of light-duty driverless vehicles for a commercial delivery service on surface streets within designated parts of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, which includes the cities of Atherton, East Palo Alto, Los Altos Hills, Los Altos, Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale and Woodside, according to the DMV. The vehicles have a maximum speed of 25 mph and are only approved to operate in fair weather conditions on streets with a speed limit of no more than 35 mph.</p>
<p>The announcement caps a milestone year for Nuro, which earlier Wednesday announced it had acquired self-driving trucks startup Ike. Nuro also raised another $500 million, which pushed its post-money valuation to $5 billion, and secured some key state and federal regulatory victories.</p>

<p>Nuro has followed a long and winding path to secure the deployment permit. In 2017, the California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, issued Nuro an AV testing permit that required the company to have a human back-up driver behind the wheel. Initially, the company used modified Toyota Prius sedans for testing as well as for pilot grocery deliveries in Arizona and Texas.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/nuro-deploys-autonomous-delivery-cars-without-safety-drivers/">transitioned in December 2018</a> to the R1, the first step toward a vehicle designed exclusively for packages. Its second-generation vehicle, called the R2, was introduced in February 2020. The R2, which was designed and assembled in the U.S. in partnership with Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, is equipped with lidar, radar and cameras to give the “driver” a 360-degree view of its surroundings. Importantly, Nuro received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/nuros-new-delivery-r2-bot-gets-the-first-driverless-vehicle-exemption-from-feds/">driverless exemption</a> from NHTSA for its R2 vehicle. The exemption allows the vehicle to operate even though it doesn’t have side-view mirrors, a windshield and a rear-view camera that shuts off when driving forward.</p>
<p>Nuro received in April 2020 a permit from the CA DMV to test driverless vehicles, which meant it could finally put its R2 delivery bots on public roads. While dozens of companies have an active permit with the CA DMV to test autonomous vehicles with a human safety driver, AutoX, Cruise, Nuro, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/waymo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="waymo">Waymo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zoox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zoox">Zoox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/driverlesstestingpermits">only companies allowed</a> to test driverless vehicles on California’s public roads.</p>
<p>Still, Nuro wasn&#8217;t able to charge for delivery until it received the deployment permit that was issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nuro has a slightly cleaner path to commercial operations than autonomous vehicle companies aiming to shuttle people in robotaxi-type operations. Commercial ridesharing services using driverless vehicles also have to secure permits from the California Public Utilities Commission to be able to shuttle passengers. Another additional permit by the CPUC is required to charge for rides.</p>

<p>Getting permission to charge for rides wasn&#8217;t even possible until last month. The CPUC approved in November two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles. The automated vehicle technology industry had lobbied the CPUC for months to consider the rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles. While the decision was widely cheered, some in the industry have warned that the approval process could further delay commercial robotaxi operations.</p>
<p>Potential robotaxi operators have to receive the proper permits from the CPUC and the California DMV as well as meet several reporting requirements. Participating companies also have to submit a safety plan and quarterly reports to the CPUC with aggregated and anonymized information about the pickup and drop-off locations for individual trips, the availability and volume of wheelchair accessible rides, service levels to disadvantaged communities and supply data such as the fuel type used by the vehicles, miles traveled and passenger miles traveled.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new mobile app called <a href="https://honk.me/">Honk</a> aims to make messaging with friends a more interactive, real-time experience. Instead of sending texts off into the void and hoping for a response, friends on Honk communicate via messages that are shown live as you type, with no saved chat history and no send button. The end result is a feeling of being more present in a conversation, as Honk will notify users the moment someone leaves a chat. And if you really want to get someone&#8217;s attention, you can send them a &#8220;Honk&#8221; &#8212; a hard-to-miss notification to join your chat.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s even more urgent, you can even spam the Honk button by pressing it repeatedly. This sends notifications to a friend&#8217;s phone if they&#8217;re off the app, or a flood of colorful emoji if they have the app open.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f5e3.png" alt="🗣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Need to get someone&#39;s attention fast? Honk them! They&#39;ll get a notification to come to the chat. If it&#39;s super important, you can spam the Honk button — that&#39;s hard to miss. <a href="https://t.co/VqcinmeeT2">pic.twitter.com/VqcinmeeT2</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Honk (@usehonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341497424959795200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After setting up an account by customizing your profile pic, selecting a username and adding friends, you can then tap on a friend&#8217;s name in your list to send them a message.</p>
<p>When you enter a chat in Honk, you&#8217;ll be presented with two large conversation bubbles. The gray one on the top is where your friend&#8217;s messages are shown, while you type in the blue one. (You can change the colors and theme, if you choose.)</p>
<p>As you type, the other person will see the text you&#8217;re entering into this box in real-time &#8212; including the pauses and typos that would normally be missed. This &#8220;live typing&#8221; experience is reminiscent of older communication technology, like the early instant messaging app ICQ, or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-drips-with-ambition-can-it-fulfill-googles-grand-web-vision/">innovative collaboration tool Google Wave</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In Honk, you&#8217;re given 160 characters to type out your thoughts, and this is counted down on the right side of screen below the conversation bubbles. But you don&#8217;t tap a &#8220;Send&#8221; button to share the message &#8212; the recipient saw the text as it was entered, after all. Instead, you just tap the double arrow &#8220;refresh&#8221; button to clear the screen and type something new.</p>
<p>There are also buttons for sending emoji, snapping a photo or accessing photos from your Camera Roll to share in the chat. The emoji here work more like iMessage&#8217;s &#8220;Send with Echo&#8221; screen effect, as you&#8217;re not just sending a single emoji when you use this feature &#8212; you&#8217;re sending several huge emoji that temporarily fill the screen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> With Magic Words, you can assign any emoji to any word or phrase, which automatically trigger effects as you type. It&#39;s the best way to personalize your chats and bring them to life. Set up to 50 unique Magic Words per chat! <a href="https://t.co/2BYUyNrEzz">pic.twitter.com/2BYUyNrEzz</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Honk (@usehonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341581571116056576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>You can also optionally assign emoji to any word or phrase within an individual chat, using a &#8220;Magic Words&#8221; feature that will trigger effects as you type (see above). Plus, you can customize chat themes on a per-conversation basis or turn off notifications from an individual user, if you don&#8217;t want to hear from them as much.</p>
<p>None of the conversations are stored and there&#8217;s no history to look back on. This is similar to messaging apps like Snapchat or<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/facebooks-snapchat-like-vanish-mode-feature-arrives-on-messenger-and-instagram/"> Messenger&#8217;s Vanish Mode</a>, for instance. (Honk hasn&#8217;t clarified its position on security, however, so proceed with caution before getting into riskier content.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lpCyDPlc4G"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/facebooks-snapchat-like-vanish-mode-feature-arrives-on-messenger-and-instagram/">Facebook&#8217;s Snapchat-like &#8216;Vanish Mode&#8217; feature arrives on Messenger and Instagram</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s Snapchat-like &#8216;Vanish Mode&#8217; feature arrives on Messenger and Instagram&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/facebooks-snapchat-like-vanish-mode-feature-arrives-on-messenger-and-instagram/embed/#?secret=lpCyDPlc4G" data-secret="lpCyDPlc4G" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, of course, if you need to get someone&#8217;s attention, you can tap &#8220;Honk&#8221; to flood them with notifications.</p>
<p>If this all seems somewhat silly, then you&#8217;re probably not the target market for the Honk messaging experience.</p>
<p>The app is clearly aiming for a young crowd of largely teenage users. When Honk asks for your age during setup, in fact, you can select an exact number from the list that appears &#8212; unless you&#8217;re &#8220;old,&#8221; that is. The last option on the list of ages is &#8220;21+&#8221; &#8212; the &#8220;older folks&#8221; age bracket, which may sting a bit for the millennial crowd who often still think of themselves as the online trendsetters.</p>
<p>But Honk is aiming to grab Gen Z&#8217;s interest, it seems. It&#8217;s even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@usehonk">marketing to them on TikTok</a>, where it&#8217;s already generated some 140K+ &#8220;Likes,&#8221; as of the time of writing, despite having only uploaded its first video yesterday. Honk founder Benji Taylor also noted on Twitter the app has seen 550,000 &#8220;Honks&#8221; sent so far, as of Wednesday, December 23, 2020, shortly after noon Eastern.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@usehonk/video/6909182677660847365" data-video-id="6909182677660847365">

</blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Per its website, Honk is the flagship product from software company and app publisher <a href="https://lfe.org/about">Los Feliz Engineering (LFE)</a>, which is backed by investors including Naval Ravikant, Elad Gil, Brian Norgard, David Tisch, Jeff Fagnan, Ryan Hoover, Sarah Downey, Josh Hannah, Sahil Lavingia and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exceptionally well designed,&#8221; said Product Hunt founder and Weekend Fund investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ryan-hoover" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ryan-hoover">Ryan Hoover, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> about Honk. &#8220;[Honk founder] Benji [Taylor] and team labored over the small details, from the animations to the sounds. They&#8217;re also super focused on speed,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Taylor declined a full interview when TechCrunch reached out, noting the team was focused on building the product for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been working on Honk for a while now. Our goal is to make messaging fun, and empower people to communicate in new, creative ways that take relationships deeper,&#8221; Taylor told TechCrunch. &#8220;Ultimately though, we’re a small team building this for ourselves and our friends. If other people like it, all the better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Honk, we should note, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341490665083924480">struggling</a> under the load of new signups at launch and high usage. Honk users report the app will sometimes say they&#8217;re offline when they&#8217;re not, for example, among other <a href="https://twitter.com/mitch_troy/status/1341588518976573441">bugs</a>. Honk <a href="https://twitter.com/usehonk/status/1341531287471837184">acknowledged</a> the issues on its Twitter and says it&#8217;s been working to resolve them.</p>
<p>The app is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honk/id1458452703">a free download on iOS.</a> It does not include in-app purchases or have any obvious business model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’re probably investing in an email newsletter these days, whether you’re an international brand, a nonprofit or a local news publisher.</p>
<p>Maybe email is even your focus now, because you got burned by Facebook, Google or other closed platforms during the past decade. The problem is that the tools you have available are probably too generic, or are built specifically for marketers. What if you want to make money from the newsletter content itself?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/">Letterhead</a> is slicing through the vast market of existing email SaaS products, betting that a cross-section of revenue and collaboration needs are not being met properly for newsletter creators of all types. Instead, it puts all ad sales, paid subscriptions and newsletter content management into a single, streamlined product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its viewpoints on the future of newsletters — and its customer base so far — are intriguingly different from your typical SaaS startup in Silicon Valley. And there’s a reason for that. Letterhead is actually a product spinout of a community publisher in Miami called <a href="https://www.whereby.us/">WhereBy.Us</a> that began life in 2014 by launching a local media site, <a href="https://thenewtropic.com/">The New Tropic</a>. The publication became a rare success in online local news, once it focused on the email newsletter format.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/letterhead-herogif01-large.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="511" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.tryletterhead.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letterhead <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“Initially, our goal was to create a local media product that would help people learn about the city, get more involved and serve a new generation of local news users,” co-founder and CEO Chris Sopher tells me by video chat. “Our ideas had included opening a bar, events and all kinds of other stuff. We quickly pared that back to the things that were working, and email was at the top of the list.”</p>
<p>Advertising inventory in these emails was in high demand, so the company built out a self-service payment system for advertisers, which allowed its newsletter writers to easily publish the correct ads in the correct place.</p>
<p>With this business model and technology as a foundation, it launched or acquired newsletters in <a href="https://theevergrey.com/">Seattle</a>, <a href="https://bridgeliner.com/">Portland</a>, <a href="https://pulp.town/">Orlando</a> and <a href="https://theincline.com/">Pittsburgh</a>. Through this process, it has continued to improve the tool itself.</p>
<p>It also discovered the broader demand.</p>
<p>“People would reach out to us and say ‘I love this newsletter, what tools do you use?’ because it was such a pain to produce emails with all of the different tools out there,” Sopher explains.</p>
<p>(Those tools, in this author’s experience, generally include a combination of Mailchimp, Constant Contact or Sailthru, together with your main web publishing CMS like WordPress, your separate subscription software like Piano and however you are managing ads.)</p>
<p>“We’d tell people that we used our own internal tools and they’d say ‘oh, can we use those, too? And we’d say ‘no, that’s not what we’re doing.’ Eventually, we said no enough that we looked at each other and said, ‘we should figure out how to get to yes on this.’ And that’s where Letterhead came from.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090557" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090557" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2090557 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="881" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png 2482w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=150,129 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=300,258 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=768,661 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=680,585 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=1536,1322 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=2048,1763 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-23-at-10.18.55-AM.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090557" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Letterhead</p></div></p>
<p>Today, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whereby-us-the-new-tropic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whereby-us-the-new-tropic">WhereBy.Us <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is one of the few success stories from a catastrophic decade in local news. Sopher says that its five city newsletters are comfortably profitable via ads overall — having recovered from a pandemic dip earlier this year — and are continuing to grow.</p>
<p>But the new focus is on Letterhead’s tools, including the ad system, a new paid subscription feature that lets you do things like add paywalled subsections of emails, easy-to-use text editing and template formatting, and soon, analytics.</p>
<p>“Sponsorships and ads were [needs] we heard about most, so that’s where we started,” co-founder and COO Rebekah Monson said by email. “The bigger vision is to create a set of tools and services that feed into each other in one easy place, and help all of those revenue streams grow, eventually branching out from email. We&#8217;re seeing demand for that not just from traditional media publishers, but also from marketers, nonprofits, universities, professional associations — all these folks who have engaged communities and want to deepen those relationships and bring in revenue through that engagement.”</p>
<p>On the spectrum of email newsletter products, Letterhead’s focus on revenues and team collaboration places it adjacent to Substack’s focus on the individual writer, and to other products like Lede designed specifically around subscription news organizations.</p>
<p>Letterhead is explicitly a hosted software solution that you pay for your organization to use, not an open-source project like Ghost. Like how Shopify provides a suite of white-label e-commerce features for anyone who wants to run an online business, it wants to be the engine humming away under the hood of your newsletter.</p>
<p>On the much broader spectrum of all email solutions in the SaaS world, Letterhead is betting that its understanding of the market and its product design can beat out the brutally competitive world of SaaS email products.</p>

<p>Since soft-launching earlier this year, Sopher says it has already been signing up a broad range of customers. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples he cited include startups (</span><a href="https://www.shootmytravel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoot My Travel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), nonprofits (</span><a href="https://www.vidaysalud.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vida y Salud </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.refreshmiami.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refresh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and political groups (</span><a href="https://odaction.com/newsletters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OD Action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as customers, as well as local news publishers, of course (</span><a href="https://vtdigger.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VTDigger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.choose954.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choose954</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://santacruzlocal.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santa Cruz Local</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span> Letterhead is also a partner in <a href="https://newspack.pub/">WordPress’ News Pack program</a>, which is a collection of plug-ins for publishers on that CMS.</p>
<p>“We’re always going to have an affinity to media publishing… but there is a broader need than just that industry,” he explains. “And we’re also seeing this moment where a lot of other organizations are participating in [publishing]. You name a topic, there will be professional reporters out there doing great work. But it’s also pretty likely that there is a brand, an agency, a nonprofit or some other organization creating interesting and useful content, and building a community around it — that would not raise its hand and say that it is part of the news industry.”</p>
<p>Sopher also notes that the product is designed to be modular, so that companies can just use parts of it and integrate its features with other email service providers and most any tech stack.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing is that smaller customers are coming on for the simplicity of having it all in one place without sacrificing monetization,” he adds, “but larger customers are choosing us as one part of their stack as they build a multifaceted business or grow out of tools geared more to individual or independent creators.”</p>
<p>With the revenue options in place, Sopher says analytics and additional ESP options are coming next.</p>
<p>Over the course of its history, WhereBy.Us has raised $5 million from across tech and media. Backers include the Knight Foundation, Jason Calacanis&#8217; LAUNCH fund, Band of Angels, McClatchy, hundreds of smaller investors via Republic and SeedInvest and, most recently, a round led by Brick Capital.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m in people ops and our team is trying to plan ahead for immigration in the new year and beyond. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s ahead for U.S. visas and green cards?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Ready in Redwood City</strong></p>
<p>Dear Ready:</p>
<p>Ha! I love it. Well, although I don’t have a crystal ball (yet), there’s a lot of opportunity, predictability and security that we can anticipate for immigration ahead.</p>
<p>Our U.S. immigration policy will experience a tremendous growth spurt in the coming months as Trump completes his regulatory agenda, litigation culminates and Biden takes office on January 20. The changes I’m tracking will incentivize U.S. companies to hire and retain top global talent and will make it easier for them to do so. There are also going to be increased opportunities for families and founders, strengthening the U.S. and Silicon Valley tech startup communities.</p>
<p>We can anticipate that the first 100 days of President-elect Biden’s term will focus on undoing many Trump-era immigration changes. Some of this will happen by executive order (although probably not tweets!) and some of it will be required to follow the procedures set forth in law through the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.</p>
<p>Following procedures to rescind or amend rules already put into place — even on an expedited basis — takes time to allow for adequate review and public comments. We can anticipate that due process will unfold to effectuate these changes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/deepmind" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="deepmind">DeepMind <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has made it a mission to show that not only can an AI truly become proficient at a game, it can do so without even being told the rules. Its newest AI agent, called <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/Mastering-Atari-Go-Chess-and-Shogi-by-Planning-with-a-Learned-Model">MuZero</a>, accomplishes this not just with visually simple games with complex strategies, like Go, Chess and Shogi, but with visually complex <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/atari" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="atari">Atari <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> games.</p>
<p>The success of DeepMind&#8217;s earlier AIs was at least partly due to a very efficient navigation of the immense decision trees that represent the possible actions in a game. In Go or Chess these trees are governed by very specific rules, like where pieces can move, what happens when this piece does that, and so on.</p>
<p>The AI that beat world champions at Go, AlphaGo, knew these rules and kept them in mind (or perhaps in RAM) while studying games between and against human players, forming a set of best practices and strategies. The sequel, AlphaGo Zero, did this without human data, playing only against itself. AlphaZero did the same with Go, Chess and Shogi in 2018, creating a single AI model that could play all these games proficiently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But in all these cases the AI was presented with a set of immutable, known rules for the games, creating a framework around which it could build its strategies. Think about it: If you&#8217;re told a pawn can become a queen, you plan for it from the beginning, but if you have to find out, you may develop entirely different strategies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090576" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090576" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2090576 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1102" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg 1722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=768,827 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=1427,1536 1427w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/muzero-diagram.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2090576" class="wp-caption-text">This helpful diagram shows what different models have achieved with different starting knowledge. Image: DeepMind</p></div></p>
<p>As the company explains in a <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">blog post</a> about their new research, if AIs are told the rules ahead of time, &#8220;this makes it difficult to apply them to messy real world problems which are typically complex and hard to distill into simple rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest advance, then, is MuZero, which plays not only the aforementioned games but a variety of Atari games, and it does so without being provided with a rulebook at all. The final model learned to play all of these games not just from experimenting on its own (no human data) but without being told even the most basic rules.</p>
<p>Instead of using the rules to find the best-case scenario (because it can&#8217;t), MuZero learns to take into account every aspect of the game environment, observing for itself whether it&#8217;s important or not. Over millions of games it learns not just the rules, but the general value of a position, general policies for getting ahead and a way of evaluating its own actions in hindsight.</p>
<p>This latter ability helps it learn from its own mistakes, rewinding and redoing games to try different approaches that further hone the position and policy values.</p>
<p>You may remember Agent57, another DeepMind creation that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/deepminds-agent57-ai-agent-can-best-human-players-across-a-suite-of-57-atari-games/">excelled at a set of 57 Atari games</a>. MuZero takes the best of that AI and combines it with the best of AlphaZero. MuZero differs from the former in that it does not model the entire game environment, but focuses on the parts that affect its decision-making, and from the latter in that it bases its model of the rules purely on its own experimentation and firsthand knowledge.</p>

<p>Understanding the game world lets MuZero effectively plan its actions even when the game world is, like many Atari games, partly randomized and visually complex. That pushes it closer to an AI that can safely and intelligently interact with the real world, learning to understand the world around it without the need to be told every detail (though it&#8217;s likely that a few, like &#8220;don&#8217;t crush humans,&#8221; will be etched in stone). As one of the researchers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55403473">told the BBC</a>, the team is already experimenting with seeing how MuZero could improve video compression — obviously a very different problem than Ms. Pac-Man.</p>
<p>The details of MuZero were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03051-4">published today in the journal Nature</a>.</p>

Other investors in this round include The Syndicate, LAUNCH, Mana Ventures, Noveus VC, Flight.VC, Insta VC, UpVentures, Firebrand Ventures, Cultivation Capital, Spero Ventures and Lofty Ventures.</p>
<p>In many ways, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fluent-forever" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fluent-forever">Fluent Forever <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a direct competitor to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/duolingo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="duolingo">Duolingo, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Babbel and similar online language learning services. What sets it apart is a focus on a personalized learning system that emphasizes ear training, visual aids and something akin to spaced-repetition for helping you memorize new words and phrases. It&#8217;s a paid service (after a 14-day free trial) with subscriptions starting at $10 per month for a monthly subscription and the usual discounts for longer-term commitments.</p>
<p>To teach himself his first languages, the company&#8217;s founder and CEO Gabriel Wyner used the popular flashcard service <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, <a href="https://fluent-forever.com/app/get-the-book.html">wrote a book</a> about his approach, and taught workshops on language learning using his system with Anki. But as he noted, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/anki" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="anki">Anki <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a serious tool, and simply learning how to get the most out of it takes a lot of time and energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2090549" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090549" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2090549" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg" alt="" width="350" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6C284C47-A4D1-4217-8471-03FD82D9C152-576x1024-1.jpeg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2090549" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fluent Forever</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve watched everyone else fail at language learning,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;And the first thought is, okay, well, if you just learn how to do it right, then that&#8217;s a fixable thing. That&#8217;s exciting. And then once you have a solution for people and they&#8217;re all excited about it &#8212; but then you watch them fail because of IT reasons. That&#8217;s extra frustrating.&#8221;</p>
<p>In many ways then, Fluent Forever uses Wyner&#8217;s flashcard approach &#8212; because building those flashcards by hand is at the core of his learning system &#8212; and turns it into a far-easier-to-use application.</p>
<p>What people want, Wyner acknowledged, is a tool where you just press some buttons and learn something. But that doesn&#8217;t work. &#8220;I had to have a really strong reaction to this &#8212; a really strong answer &#8212; and say, &#8216;absolutely not. That is the one thing that teaches you is building it.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Wyner is not afraid to <a href="https://blog.fluent-forever.com/not-progressing-with-duolingo-heres-why/">compare his approach to Duolingo&#8217;s</a> and argues that its focus on translation exercises doesn&#8217;t translate to real language skills in the long run. At the same time, he freely acknowledges that the Duolingo user experience and gamification are far better than Fluent Forever. But he also believes that learners see far better results with his system.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ask [our users]: &#8216;Why are you with us? Why would you pay for us when you could just get Duolingo for free?&#8221; What they come back with is, &#8216;yeah, your product is rough around the edges. I wish you would fix this, this and that, but you had me thinking in Spanish in two weeks,&#8221; Wyner said.</p>
<p>Fluent Forever currently supports nine languages: Japanese, French, Russian, Mexican and Spanish Spanish, Italian, Korean, German and Brazilian Portuguese, with Dutch being the next language the team is tackling.</p>
<p>As Wyner told me, the company had trouble raising in 2019, in part because the service was seeing pretty flat growth at the time. &#8220;People are very skeptical about language learning &#8212; that is not a sexy field. People don&#8217;t like it. The idea of jumping and trying to be competitive with Duolingo was just not appealing to anyone,&#8221; he told me. Come 2020, though, growth picked up, even before the COVID pandemic. At the same time, Fluent Forever also participated in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jason-calacanis" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jason-calacanis">Jason Calacanis&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Launch Accelerator.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Wyner tells me that Fluent Forever is looking at ways to bring live tutors into the loop. Live tutoring online has been done before, of course, and there are some companies like <a href="https://preply.com/">Preply</a> that specialize in it already, but what Fluent Forever wants to do is combine the online language learning service with short live sessions and then use the online component to go back to that conversation over the course of a week or so. One advantage here is that these users &#8212; who will likely pay a premium for the live service &#8212; will also use their time with live tutors to create their own personalized sentences in the Fluent Forever system, which could then over time become content that&#8217;s available to all users, too.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government is failing us with regard to fintech and blockchain regulation.</p>
<p>Devoid of any regulatory framework in the past four years we’ve been operating in limbo when it comes to the development and advancement of crypto products. Innovators in the fintech and blockchain industries have the ability and vision to build products that solve real problems for everyone from individuals to large banks to governments, but without a clear path forward, these products are unable to grow and scale to their full potential.</p>
<p>Regulation shouldn’t be a guessing game. Since 2019, when the Securities and Exchange Commission declared that neither Bitcoin (BTC) nor Ethereum (ETH) are securities, the industry’s been at a standstill. Without clarity, blockchain innovation will be limited to just two coins &#8212; the industry is much larger than this. A lack of regulation stifles the immense potential that crypto and blockchain provide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			If we know the rules of the game we’re playing, we can keep doing what we do best: innovating. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A new administration presents a new opportunity for elected officials across the political spectrum to develop clear policies and regulations enabling banks, fintechs and corporations to custody and use crypto to improve efficiencies and to provide a better customer experience.</p>
<p>We can learn a lesson from recent history here. In 1991, we saw the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act (HPCCA), a bipartisan effort led by Senator Al Gore and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.</p>
<p>This legislation paved the way for companies like Amazon, eBay, Yahoo, Google and others to boom and made the U.S. an early internet leader. By 1993 we saw the introduction of web browsers, and shortly after, the start of the dot-com era in 1994 that cemented the U.S. as a symbol of innovation.</p>
<p>The browser changed everything. It’s created new jobs, new economic opportunities and new categories in technology that we couldn’t have predicted 30 years ago. In looking at the top 100 Fortune 500 companies in 1991, technology was barely a blip on the radar with IBM standing as the lone tech company. By 2020, it’s a drastically different picture, with the list completely dominated by technology giants like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Salesforce.</p>
<p>Technology companies in the top 100 have contributed close to three million jobs, with many leading in market value. Despite an unconventional year, we’ve continued to see successful technology IPOs like DoorDash, Snowflake, Asana and Palantir.</p>
<p>Products and services that we take for granted now like Google, the iPhone, Uber, Salesforce, Spotify, Postmates and more were made possible by the HPCCA. We now have another chance to create a bipartisan effort focused on crypto innovation, one with public and private sector support to ensure clear regulatory frameworks. Regulation will make it easier for innovators to create new products that keep the United States competitive with other countries and attract more investment.</p>
<p>There’s no disputing that the adoption of crypto and blockchain is on the rise. Major companies including PayPal, Square and Robinhood are leaning in to crypto and pushing it to the mainstream. With the validation from these brands, interest in the utility of cryptocurrencies and the ability of crypto to better serve businesses and their customers, continues to grow.</p>
<p>Leading crypto companies such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ripple-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ripple-labs">Ripple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Coinbase, Gemini, DCG and Chainalysis are currently based in the United States. However, unclear regulation will keep new entrepreneurs from innovating in the United States. While other countries move forward with defined regulatory frameworks, it’s possible that we will see new entrepreneurs and companies forgo setting up shop in the U.S. in favor of jurisdictions where the rules are clear.</p>
<p>If we know the rules of the game we’re playing, we can keep doing what we do best: innovating. We are only at the beginning — developers can build on open-source technologies, entrepreneurs can launch new companies and develop new products, and investors can invest in those companies.</p>
<p>We want the most innovative crypto and blockchain companies to be built and to grow here in the U.S., where they can create value and opportunities for U.S. citizens. Similar to the early days of the internet, we don’t know what the industry will look like in 5-10 years, but with flexible frameworks the opportunity is massive.</p>
<p>There’s a big opportunity for the Biden administration to influence new policies and new legislation and provide clear guidance that will accelerate innovation in fintech and crypto for many generations to come. The administration can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a national digital banking licensing charter (similar to <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/Banking/digital-bank-licence">Singapore’s Digital Banking Charter</a>), to streamline the process for fintechs to apply for crypto, lending and payments licensing. Today companies in the U.S. are left to apply state-by-state for licensing, which costs millions of dollars in legal fees and years to accomplish.</li>
<li>Define clear classifications for digital assets, derivatives (created via smart contracts) and stablecoins.</li>
<li>Create a bipartisan public and private sector group led by tech-savvy thought leaders such as Andrew Yang, to collaborate on landmark legislation that will do for fintech what the HPCCA did for internet companies.</li>
<li>Appoint an SEC chair that understands how to truly advance innovation while protecting consumers and the markets. The pro-innovation lip service we have been getting from this SEC is just that — lip service. Every crypto project this SEC has touched has ended up fleeing the U.S., in bankruptcy or left holding worthless tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how policymakers and regulators decide to approach the issues that our industry faces, we need to continue to work alongside the government to ensure that the rapidly growing number of people who use fintech and blockchain products continue to get the best-in-class solutions with appropriate consumer and market protections in place.</p>
<p>It’s clear that this technology is here to stay, and I hope that elected leaders will recognize the power that it has to effect massive financial industry progress. Similar to the HPCAA, smart regulation can both protect our consumers and markets while allowing proud U.S. companies to create life-changing innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous delivery company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nuro-2">Nuro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has acquired Ike, a startup founded by veterans of Apple, Google and Uber Advanced Technologies Group that aimed to commercialize self-driving trucks.</p>
<p>The deal, the latest in a busy season of acquisitions and consolidation in the autonomous vehicle industry, brings together two companies that have deep ties and shared technology. And while the two pursued different applications of autonomous vehicle technology — Nuro with local delivery and Ike on long-haul freight — their founders say there is a shared vision around logistics.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nuro is the giant in this relationship, with a $5 billion valuation and more than 600 employees. Ike employs about 60 people, and as of last year had a post-money valuation of around $250 million, according to sources. However, the companies&#8217; founders don&#8217;t describe this as the classic Silicon Valley acqui-hire. More than 55 Ike employees as well as its three founders will go over to Nuro, according to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/alden-woodrow" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="alden-woodrow">Alden Woodrow, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ike&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Jur van den Berg and Nancy Sun.</p>
<p>It was a clear opportunity to fulfill some of the principles that we founded the company for, Woodrow said, who also announced the acquisition Wednesday in a <a href="https://medium.com/ike-blog/our-next-chapter-1ebf9f5d88a0">blog post on Medium</a>.</p>
<p>Woodrow told TechCrunch that Ike still had runway, meaning it had the capital it needed to continue independently. Still, scaling an autonomous vehicle company into a commercial enterprise requires a pool of capital that extends beyond $52 million, as well as partnerships. Ike did reach agreements this fall with DHL, Ryder and NFI to provide its technology to their respective fleets, but those were still in the early stages.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s pretty clear just how incredible Ike&#8217;s team is and the quality of the tech that they built,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dave-ferguson-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dave-ferguson-3">Dave Ferguson, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Nuro&#8217;s co-founder and president told TechCrunch. &#8220;What is particularly compelling for Nuro is because Ike licensed Nuro&#8217;s tech stack a couple years ago, all of the tech that they&#8217;ve built is on top of that stack, there&#8217;s a shared DNA. The tech that they built is also something that we can very readily transfer over and almost plug and play into our system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nuro is able to leverage the technology that Ike built and pull that in to its own local delivery application as well as use it for potential future applications, Ferguson added.</p>
<p>What those future applications are is an unanswered question. Patent filings from Nuro show an array of ideas, from delivering piping hot pizzas and lattes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/23/how-nuro-plans-to-spend-softbanks-money/">smaller robots</a>. With Ike&#8217;s team on board it&#8217;s possible that Nuro will expand beyond local delivery into other kinds of logistics applications, like middle-mile delivery, an area in which startup Gatik AI has gained attention, or other trucking use cases. Ferguson was quick to note that Nuro&#8217;s local delivery bot called R2 is its first and primary product.</p>

<p>While Nuro might seem like the best home for Ike, sources told TechCrunch that the self-driving trucks startup had talked to at least one other autonomous vehicle company about a deal. The two sources added these weren&#8217;t advanced talks.</p>
<h2>Founding story</h2>
<p>The founders of the two companies don&#8217;t like to describe Ike as a spinout of Nuro. That might technically be correct, but their roots are intertwined.</p>
<p>Nuro was founded in June 2016 by former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google </a>engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu. The startup was initially bootstrapped by Ferguson and Zhu, but by June 2017, the pair quickly raised a $92 million A funding round with investments from Greylock and Banyan, and gave NetEase founder Ding Lei (aka William Ding) a seat on Nuro’s board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, van den Berg and Sun were both working at Apple’s special projects group when they left to join Otto, an autonomous trucking startup that was acquired by Uber in 2016. Woodrow, who was product lead of Google X’s Makani project, would also end up at Uber ATG by February 2017 as group product manager of its self-driving truck program.</p>
<p>By 2018, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/otto-founded-by-ex-googlers-is-bringing-self-driving-technology-to-trucks/">last of Otto’s founders</a> had left Uber and the self-driving trucks program was in free fall. Sun, Woodrow and van den Berg left Uber by spring 2018. A few months later, Uber shuttered its self-driving trucks unit to focus on autonomous cars.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Otto, founded by ex-Googlers, is bringing self-driving technology to trucks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/otto-founded-by-ex-googlers-is-bringing-self-driving-technology-to-trucks/embed/#?secret=P2suyMxpBm" data-secret="P2suyMxpBm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The three initially worked out of Nuro&#8217;s office space, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">which was too small to accommodate the delivery bots and growing team. Sun&#8217;s VW camper van acted as Ike&#8217;s conference room in those early days. Sun, van den Berg and Woodrow collaborated with Nuro&#8217;s team closely for months before officially incorporating Ike in July, </span>California and Delaware business records show. The company&#8217;s name Ike is a nod to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the U.S. interstate system he helped create when he signed the Federal Aid Highway Act.</p>
<p>The point of that initial collaboration was to figure out how to take what Nuro had built and apply it to a new use case in trucking. &#8220;This was an opportunity for us to head off in our own direction, and really focus on that while they continued to push forward on local delivery,&#8221; Woodrow said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Ike would license Nuro&#8217;s technology, specifically the hardware designs, autonomous software as well as data logging, maps and simulation. In return, Nuro took a minority stake in Ike.</p>
<p>When Ike came out of stealth mode in October 2018, Nuro <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/ike-hits-the-road-fec294de7a5c">characterized its relationship</a> with the new company as a partnership, where “we gave Ike a copy of our autonomy and infrastructure software and, in exchange, Nuro got an equity stake in Ike.”</p>
<p>Ike started small and took an understated approach to the task ahead. By February of 2019, Ike employed about 30 people and finally the capital to hire more following $52 million in a seed and Series A funding round led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bain-capital-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bain-capital-ventures">Bain Capital Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Redpoint Ventures, Fontinalis Partners, Basis Set Ventures and Neo also participated in the round. Bain Capital Ventures partner <a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/team/ajay/">Ajay Agarwal</a> has joined Ike’s board.</p>
<p>Unlike others pursuing autonomous trucks, Ike&#8217;s founders said in a <a href="https://medium.com/ike-robotics/the-journey-ahead-for-self-driving-trucks-c2309e288dc1">blog post</a> at the time that they weren&#8217;t pushing to have the first self-driving trucks on the road. Ike did garner a positive reputation in the industry for its systems engineering approach, motion planning and its simulation tool, according to several sources in the AV trucking world.</p>
<p>As Ike worked quietly, Nuro gained a higher profile thanks to a $940 million investment made by the SoftBank Vision Fund in February 2019. Nuro expanded its team to more than 600 employees and snagged a partnership in 2018 with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kroger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="kroger">Kroger </a>to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/16/nuro-and-kroger-are-deploying-self-driving-cars-for-grocery-delivery-in-arizona-today/">pilot a delivery service</a> in Arizona. The pilot, which initially used Toyota Prius vehicles, transitioned to its R1 delivery bot. Nuro has also partnered with companies like CVS, Domino’s and Walmart. The company developed a second-generation vehicle, known as the R2, which is designed for local delivery service for restaurants, grocery stores and other businesses. The R2 received an exemption from the federal government earlier this year that allows it to operate as a driverless vehicle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Autonomous delivery startup Nuro hits $5 billion valuation on fresh funding of $500 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-hits-5-billion-valuation-on-fresh-funding-of-500-million/embed/#?secret=B86TnRRCbQ" data-secret="B86TnRRCbQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investors weren&#8217;t done with Nuro. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the plans of many Silicon Valley startups. But there have been bright spots, including the potential for local delivery. Nuro raised another $500 million in November with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-hits-5-billion-valuation-on-fresh-funding-of-500-million/">post-money valuation of $5 billion</a>. The Series C round was led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price  Associates, Inc., with participation from new investors including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company and Baillie Gifford. The round also includes existing investors such as SoftBank Vision Fund 1 and Greylock.</p>
<h2>What happens next</h2>
<p>The two companies will begin integrating with a number of Ike engineers taking on more senior roles at Nuro. Woodrow will no longer be CEO and it&#8217;s unclear exactly what his new title will be. His job will likely focus on product development based on his experience.</p>
<p>With Nuro focused on local delivery, Ike&#8217;s mission of commercializing trucks has been shelved, for now. That decision to turn toward local delivery seems counter to the public comments Ike&#8217;s founders have made on numerous occasions about their passion for trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything we eat, touch or have in our homes has probably been on a truck at some point in its life,&#8221; Sun said back in October at the TC Sessions: Mobility event. &#8220;You don&#8217;t really appreciate the immensity of the impact on our daily lives like trucking actually has.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Woodrow said for him and his co-founders it&#8217;s really about getting a product into the world and &#8220;fulfilling the promise of automation that many of us have worked on at a bunch of different companies for a number of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, what this came down to was, we think Nuro is in an incredibly unique and really compelling position to fulfill that promise and to do it soon, and to do it at a very large scale,&#8221; Woodrow said. &#8220;And so that was really the driver of deciding to take their offer and move forward in this way.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So, onto 2021 we go. Let's see if the bulls are right again.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last 12 months have provided us with shocking lows and surprising highs. In startup land, great expectations in January and February were followed by dashed hopes in March.</p>
<p>Those woes were followed by April despair, surprised optimism from May through June, and, finally, a straight shot all the way to the moon through December.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It&#8217;s been a lot. But it&#8217;s all behind us. We don&#8217;t need to spend more time thinking about 2020 for now. We need to look ahead.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;ve compiled notes on what&#8217;s coming. We have notes from <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hanstung?lang=en">Hans Tung</a> on the 2021 IPO market, <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphires&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/beezer232?lang=en">Beezer Clarkson</a> on what fundraising will look like for VCs next year, and a prediction from the <a href="https://pitchbook.com/media/press-releases/pitchbook-publishes-2021-us-venture-capital-outlook-predicting-record-nontraditional-investor-participatio">PitchBook analyst crew</a> that caught my eye.</p>
<p>This is the last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">Exchange column</a> for 2020. Thanks for reading so I could keep having fun every day at my job. Now, to work!</p>
<h2>2021</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll start with the 2021 IPO market, only because so many of you cared so very much about it this year.</p>
<p>Hans Tung, an investor at GGV and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/ggvs-jeff-richards-there-is-a-level-of-resiliency-in-silicon-valley-that-we-did-not-have-10-years-ago/">recent Extra Crunch Live guest</a>, is an investor with an international perspective and a good read on global startup liquidity. So, when I got on the phone with him last week to catch up, I wanted to know his read on the 2021 IPO market.</p>
<p>Given that we&#8217;ve seen a number of blockbuster IPOs this year, I was expecting him to forecast an active start to the year. Correct.</p>
<p>But Tung added that while Q1 could be very busy, Q2 could present a lull. Why? Tung expects IPOs that failed to finish the job in Q4 2020 to slip into the first quarter of next year. That explains why the first quarter is busy. But why the slowdown in the following three months?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Markets, the parent company of Nanoracks. Nanoracks has provided commercial space services for years now, and most recently provided the Bishop Airlock that was installed on the International Space Station. Bishop is the first dedicated commercial permanent airlock on the ISS, and will provide a major increase in capabilities in terms of providing access to the orbital platform for private small satellites and research.</p>
<p>This is Voyager&#8217;s third major acquisition this year, after it picked up a majority stake in The Launch Company, a launch support company that provides services and hardware to facilitate launches, and that works with companies including Relativity, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/firefly-aerospace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="firefly-aerospace">Firefly Aerospace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Virgin Orbit. Voyager also picked up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/more-new-space-consolidation-as-voyager-space-holdings-acquires-pioneer-astronautics/">Pioneer Astronautics</a> (an R&amp;D company that works on propulsion, fuels, rapid prototyping and much more) in 2020, as well as Altius Space Machines in 2019. Altius is a startup that works on technology for on-orbit satellite servicing.</p>

<p>Nanoracks is probably its highest-profile acquisition, as the company has been involved in more than 1,000 ISS projects, spanning on-station research and small satellite launches from the platform, as well as other orbital and deep space missions. Nanoracks created a commercial space testing platform outside the ISS, and will be demonstrating a technology on a SpaceX mission next year that could eventually be used to convert spent upper stages from launch vehicles into orbital commercial mini space stations.</p>

<p>Voyager Space Holdings continues its strategic acquisition of new space companies, building out a portfolio that can offer clients significantly more &#8220;full-service&#8221; solutions than any of these individual companies taken together. Commercial details of these arrangements aren&#8217;t shared, but they increasingly represent one path to exit for smaller companies addressing elements of the larger commercial space sector in fairly specialized ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">undoing</a> of Nikola continues. Today, the company announced the termination of its contract with Republic Services for 2,500 garbage trucks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/nikola-stock-surges-on-order-for-2500-electric-garbage-trucks/">Announced back in August</a>, the deal had Nikola building garbage trucks in 2023 with on-road testing scheduled for 2024. This is the latest deal to unravel for Nikola as it tries to patch up following recent devastating reports.</p>
<p>According to Nikola, the separation of the two companies was mutual, though it&#8217;s hard to picture Nikola&#8217;s SEC troubles didn&#8217;t weigh heavily upon Republic Services.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the right decision for both companies given the resources and investments required,&#8221; Nikola CEO Mark Russell said in a released statement. &#8220;We support and respect Republic Services&#8217; commitment to achieving environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions for their customers. Nikola remains laser-focused on delivering on our battery-electric and fuel-cell electric commercial truck programs, and the energy infrastructure to support them.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>News of this deal is sending Nikola&#8217;s stock down 10% in pre-market trading. If this level holds upon the stock market&#8217;s open, Nikola will be trading at its lowest levels following its monumental rise over the summer months.</p>

<p>The deal with Republic Services was originally a victory banner for the once high-flying electric vehicle startup. Signaled as mainstream acceptance of the company, Republic Services&#8217; contract came before a mega $2 billion investment from General Motors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/nikla-shares-drop-as-gm-pulls-plug-on-investment-deal/">That deal is also cancelled</a> following several key revelations about the company that lead to an SEC investigation and the company&#8217;s chairman stepping down.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nikola says deliveries of Nikola Tre battery-electric semi-trucks will begin in the U.S. in 2021, and the company expects to break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in 2021. And then in 2023, the company expects to produce its fuel-cell-electric semi-trucks at its Coolidge, Arizona facility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we examine any year in enterprise M&amp;A, it&#8217;s tempting to highlight the biggest, gaudiest deals &#8212; and there were plenty of those in 2020. I&#8217;ve written about 34 acquisitions so far this year. Of those, 15 were worth $1 billion or more, 12 were small enough to not require that the companies disclose the price and the remainder fell somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Four deals involving chip companies coming together totaled over $100 billion on their own. While nobody does eye-popping M&amp;A quite like the chip industry, other sectors also offered their own eyebrow-raising deals, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buying Slack</a> earlier this month for $27.7 billion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			We are likely to see more industries consolidate the way chips did in 2020, albeit probably not quite as dramatically or expensively.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet in spite of the drama of these larger numbers, the most interesting targets to me were the pandemic-driven smaller deals that started popping up in May. Those small acquisitions are the ones that are so insignificant that the company doesn&#8217;t have to share the purchase price publicly. They usually involve early-stage companies being absorbed by cash-rich concerns looking for some combination of missing technology or engineering talent in a particular area like security or artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It was certainly an active year in M&amp;A, and we still might not have seen the last of it. Let&#8217;s have a look at why those minor deals were so interesting and how they compared with larger ones, while looking ahead to what 2021 M&amp;A might look like.</p>
<h2>Early-stage blues</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s always hard to know exactly why an early-stage startup would give up its independence by selling to a larger entity, but we can certainly speculate on some of the reasons why this year&#8217;s rapid-fire dealing started in May. While we can never know for certain why these companies decided to exit via acquisition, we know that in April, the pandemic hit full force in the United States and the economy began to shut down.</p>
<p>Some startups were particularly vulnerable, especially companies low on cash in the April timeframe. Obviously companies fail when they run out of funding, and we started seeing early-stage startups being scooped up the following month.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know for sure of course if there is a direct correlation between April&#8217;s economic woes and the flurry of deals that started in May, but we can reasonably speculate that there was. For some percentage of them, I&#8217;m guessing it was a fire sale or at least a deal made under less than ideal terms. For others, maybe they simply didn&#8217;t have the wherewithal to keep going under such adverse economic conditions or the partnerships were just too good to pass up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that I didn&#8217;t cover any deals in April.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the turning of the New Year, many people are wishing they could do something about the environment. Now, a U.K. startup hopes to make our environmental impact more personal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yayzy.com/">Yayzy</a> has now launched an iOS app (Android is coming) which literally links to your bank account to work out the environmental impact of what you buy. It uses payment data via Open Banking standards to automatically calculate the carbon footprint of each purchase a user makes, giving them a picture of their total monthly carbon emissions. This makes the carbon footprint calculated more accurate and bespoke to the individual, allowing them to immediately connect their spending to its impact on the planet.</p>
<p>Yayzy has secured £900,000 in backing from Antler Venture Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/seedrs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="seedrs">Seedrs <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (a crowdfunding round) and the CoreAngels Impact Fund. As the user sees what the carbon footprint is of their purchase, they can choose to offset it right then and there on the app via the carbon offsetter <a href="https://ecosphere.plus/">Ecosphere Plus</a>. In the app, users can also find tips to reduce their carbon footprint, eco-friendly retailers near them or insights into lifestyle choices that have the highest environmental impact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their competitors are people like <a href="https://cogo.co/">CoGo</a>, a real-time Carbon Footprint tracker, and <a href="https://doconomy.com/">Doconomy</a> and the soon to launch <a href="https://www.tred.earth/">Tred</a>.</p>
<p>But Yayzy is taking a different approach. It brings together all of a user’s spending and shows them item by item as they spend what the carbon footprint of that spend is. So far &#8212; it claims &#8212; its competitors don’t do that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090442" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090442" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2090442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png" alt="" width="567" height="402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png 567w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-698@2x.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090442" class="wp-caption-text">Yayzy app. Image Credits: Yayzy</p></div></p>
<p>This can be done ad hoc, item by item, or by signing up to a monthly subscription to either carbon offsetting projects or the user&#8217;s own unique climate portfolio. This portfolio would bundle multiple projects for a more &#8220;holistic&#8221; impact. Yayzy says all of these projects have been carefully selected based on strict criteria, and also advance the UN Sustainable development goals.</p>
<p>For its underlying carbon data, Yayzy is using <a href="https://www.vitalmetricsgroup.com/">Vital Metrics</a>, as used by Google, Microsoft and both the U.K. and U.S. governments, among others.</p>
<p>Mankaran Ahluwalia, co-founder and CEO of Yayzy, said in a statement: &#8220;While emissions have gradually risen as lockdown eases, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yayzy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yayzy">YAYZY <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to put us all in the driver’s seat to control our own environmental impact… It is clear from a plethora of surveys that the majority of people want to address climate change before it is too late, but that a huge intention/action gap blocks much of it. Our solution with Yayzy is to make environmental impact ‘up close and personal’ and the action to tackle it super easy, all via your phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ahluwalia, was a technology analyst with Infosys and built a lending platform for alternate credit. Co-founder Cristian Dan, CTO, previously built a discounts platform and co-founder Pedro Cabrero, CFO was in equity sales and trading for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ubs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ubs">UBS <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/citigroup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="citigroup">Citigroup, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and co-founded a leading online pharmacy in Mexico.</p>
