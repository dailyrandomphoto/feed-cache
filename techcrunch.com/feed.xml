										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.axlepayments.com">Axle</a> recently announced it raised $10m in Series A financing after a stellar year of growth. The round was led by Crosslink Capital with participation from FJ Labs, Flexport, Tribeca Early Stage Partners, and others including existing investors Anthemis Group, Techstars, and Plug and Play Ventures.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company points to the past 12 months of operations where it saw volume grow 850% on its payments and financing platform designed specifically for freight brokers and carriers. The company’s services allows incumbent operators to quickly modernize and compete against new startups. Axle says its solutions also automates carrier payments, involving, and collections, which allows operators to connect all aspects of their fright operations.</p>
<p>Axle anticipates using the new capital to expand operations, develop new services, and strength the company’s payment and financing platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founders Bharath Krishnamoorthy and Shawn Vo founded the company in 2019. The company raised a $1.4 million pre-seed round from Trucks VC in 2020, followed by a $2.7m seed round from Techstars and Anthemis Group and a $27.7 million debt and equity round later that year.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder, Bharath Krishnamoorthy, says in a released statement “Axle’s proprietary technology levels the playing field, so our customers can compete in a highly competitive market. With our financial platform, we’re empowering freight intermediaries to rapidly grow and differentiate their businesses in a cutthroat industry. We’re excited to partner with Crosslink to transform the freight and logistics industry.”</p>
<p>Crosslink Capital partner David Silverman says Krishnamoorthy and Vo established themselves as an industry leader in freight factoring and payment processing, and points to the company’s previous 12 month as being impressive. “We look forward to helping them scale operations,” he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">APIs make the world go round in tech, but that also makes them a very key target for bad actors: as doorways into huge data troves and services, malicious hackers spent a lot of time looking for ways to pick their locks or just force them open when they&#8217;re closed, in order to access that information. And a lot of recent security breaches stemming from API vulnerabilities (see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-use-google-analytics-to-steal-credit-cards-bypass-csp/?mid=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for just a few) show just how real and current the problem is.</p>
<p>Today, a company that&#8217;s building a network of services to help those using and producing APIs to identify and eradicate those risks is announcing a round of funding to meet a growing demand for its services. <a href="https://salt.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salt Security</a>, which provides AI-based technology to identify issues and stop attacks across the whole of your API library, has closed $70 million in funding, money that it will be using both to meet current demand but also continue building out its technology for a wider set of services and use cases for API management.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Advent International, by way of Advent Tech, with Alkeon Capital, DFJ Growth and previous backers Sequoia Capital, Tenaya Capital, S Capital VC, and Y Combinator all also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Salt, founded in Israel and now active globally, is not disclosing valuation but I understand from a reliable source it that it is in the region of $600-700 million.</p>
<p>As with many of the funding rounds that seem to be getting announced these days, this one is coming on the heels of both another recent round, as well as strong growth. Salt has raised $131 million since 2016, but nearly all of that &#8212; $120 million, to be exact &#8212; has been raised in the last year.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is Salt&#8217;s performance: in the last 12 months, it&#8217;s seen revenue grow 400% &#8212; with customers including a range of Fortune 500 and other large businesses in the financial services, retail and SaaS sectors like Equinix, Finastra, TripActions, Armis, and DeinDeal; headcount grow 160%; and, perhaps most importantly, API traffic on its network grow 380%.</p>
<p>That growth in API traffic underscores the issue that Salt is tackling. Companies these days use a variety of APIs &#8212; some private, some public &#8212; in their tech stack as a way to interface with other businesses and run their services. APIs are a huge part of how the Internet and digital services operate, with Akamai estimating that as much as 83% of all IP traffic is API traffic.</p>
<p>The problem, Roey Eliyahu, CEO and co-founder of Salt Security told me, is that this usage has outpaced how well many manage those APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;How APIs have evolved is very different to how developers used APIs years ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Before, there were very few, and you could say they were more manageable, and they contained less sensitive data, and there were very few changes and updates made to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today with the pace of development, not only are they always getting updated, but you have thousands of them now touching crown jewels of the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has made them a prime target for malicious hackers. Eliyahu notes Gartner stats that predict that by 2022, APIs will make up the largest attack vector in cybercrime.</p>
<p>Salt&#8217;s approach starts with taking stock of a whole network and doing a kind of spring clean to find all the APIs that might be used or abused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies don&#8217;t know how many APIs they even have,&#8221; Eliyahu said, noting that there some 40%-80% of the APIs in existence for a typical company&#8217;s data are not even in active operation, lying there as &#8220;shadow APIs&#8221; for someone to pick up and misuse.</p>
<p>It then looks at what vulnerabilities might inadvertently be contained in this mix and makes suggestions for how to alter them to fix that. After this, it also monitors how they are used in order to stop attacks as they happen. The third of these also involves remediation &#8220;insights&#8221;, but carrying out the remediation is done by third parties at the moment, Eliyahu said. All of this is done through Salt&#8217;s automated, AI-based, flagship Salt Security API Protection Platform.</p>
<p>There are a number of competitors in the same space as Salt, including Ping, and newer players like Imvision and 42Crunch (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/api-security-startup-42crunch-raises-17m-series-a-led-by-energy-impact-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised funding</a> earlier this month), and the list is likely to grow as not just other API management companies get deeper into this huge space, but cyber security companies do, too.</p>
<p>“The rapid proliferation of APIs has dramatically altered the attack surface of applications, creating a major challenge for large enterprises since existing security mechanisms cannot protect against this new threat,” said Bryan Taylor, managing partner and head of Advent’s technology team, in a statement. “We continue to see API security incidents make the news headlines and cause significant reputational risk for companies. As we investigated the API security market, Salt stood out for its multi-year technical lead, significant customer traction and references, and talented team. We look forward to drawing on our deep experience in this sector to partner with Salt in this exciting new chapter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a> announced that it closed a new, $30 million funding round and secured a $50 million revolving debt facility.</p>
<p>The startup, which provides corporate cards to Mexican companies, raised funds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">earlier this year</a> when it was busy launching its product. Since then, growth has proven rapid for the Mexico City-based company.</p>
<p>TechCrunch learned that the company is valued around $130 million after this latest investment, according to sources familiar with its latest fundraising. The round added DST and monashees to Clara&#8217;s cap table; prior investor General Catalyst also contributed funds to the deal.</p>
<p>We spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/ggiaco?lang=en">Gerry Giacomán Colyer</a>, a co-founder at the startup and its CEO, about why Clara raised more capital so quickly after it last closed a financing round. The short gist is that the company&#8217;s growth, and market, allowed it to raise easily. And that the startup has pretty big plans, so having more capital with which to hire is welcome.</p>
<p>Per Giacomán Colyer, since he last spoke to this publication the transaction volume (GTV) that Clara supports has grown by 100x. His company is managing 2x week-over-week growth at times, which is super rapid. That&#8217;s precisely the sort of usage growth that venture capitalists covet; and as Clara makes revenue from interchange fees that stem from transaction volume, the startup is likely seeing its revenue advance at roughly the same rate as its GTV.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WQdDokGuWD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">How Brex more than doubled its valuation in a year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Brex more than doubled its valuation in a year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/embed/#?secret=WQdDokGuWD" data-secret="WQdDokGuWD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That Clara was able to raise more capital is unsurprising. Not only is it growing quickly in its home market with designs on Brazil in the future, a U.S.-based player in the same space recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">sold for north of $2 billion</a>. Divvy&#8217;s sale was likely a shot in the arm for not only Clara, but also Brex and Ramp, two other well-known players in the larger corporate spend world.</p>
<p>Clara&#8217;s success in Mexico makes it likely that related startups also targeting markets that lack a modern corporate spend solution will see strong venture capital interest; I would not be surprised if we heard from a number of other companies attacking geographies with favorable interchange economics with a similar model, as it has proven to be so lucrative.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Giacomán Colyer about who his company is targeting in terms of customers; Brex famously got its start working with high-growth startups before moving to work with a broader array of companies. Clara is working with startups in the Mexican market, the company said, but also with larger firms as well. Its CEO said that its underwriting model is set up to support more traditional cash-flow modeling.</p>
<p>So far Clara has largely attracted customers via word-of-mouth, and is working to bolster its referral system. But now that it has lots more capital, it will be interesting to see if the startup builds out a more aggressive go-to-market motion.</p>
<p>And more than just equity capital, the debt that Clara also secured as part of its recent funding round will help it underwrite customers without having to work off of its own balance sheet. Giacomán Colyer said that even after the capital costs associated with the facility, Clara&#8217;s economics are still good. Interchange is a flexible beast, it seems.</p>
<p>To that end, TechCrunch asked Giacomán Colyer if his company intends to charge for software in time, or merely eat off of interchange. In the United States, Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">now in camp one</a>, along <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">with Airbase</a>, while Ramp is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">sticking to camp two</a>. Divvy proved that you can get to nine-figures in top line without charging for software, though having some ARR in the mix along with interchange incomes could provide a margin-boost to interchange top line. Regardless, Clara appears happy to keep to interchange for the time being.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how quickly Clara can keep scaling. We&#8217;ll check back with the company in a few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A decade before investing outside of San Francisco and New York became trendy, entrepreneurs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jewelburks">Jewel Burks</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justindawkins/"> Justin Dawkins </a>and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrygivens/">Barry Givens</a> were betting on Atlanta. Each experienced first-hand the biases that disproportionately hurts Black founders &#8211; while also being living proof of the wave of Black innovation and opportunity in their city.</p>
<p>Last year, the trio saw opportunity in that disconnect and launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">Collab Capital</a>, a firm designed to invest explicitly in Black founders. It debuted with $2 million in capital and a massive end target: $50 million. Today, the firm announced that it has met that goal, with backers such as Apple, Goldman Sachs, Google, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Mailchimp, and PayPal, making it one of the largest funds closed from an entirely Black-led firm solely committed to Black founders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Collab Capital launches with a $50 million target and a mission to help Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/embed/#?secret=wEi24X2W07" data-secret="wEi24X2W07" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We really wanted to build a fund that was appropriate for the opportunity that we see [in Black founders],” Burks said. “And honestly I would say, it’s a small fund out there relative to the number of Black-led companies out there that are looking and seeking funding.”</p>
<p>With the new fund, Collab Capital plans to invest in 50 companies over a three-to-five-year period with check sizes between $500,000 and $750,000. The firm has also reserved up to $2 million per investment for follow-on bets. It is targeting ownership between 10% to 15% in each deal. To date, Collab Capital has backed six companies in the healthcare, edtech, and future of work spaces, including Music Tech Works and Hairbrella.</p>
<p>Internally, the team plans to stay based in Atlanta. Burks, who founded Atlanta-based PartPic, a TC Battlefield company that sold to Amazon, said that reinvesting in the community has always been a part of Collab Capital’s intention. Case in point? The firm’s first three deals were in Atlanta. As Zoom investing became more popular in the wake of the coronavirus, the team invested in startups from Kansas City, Washington, D.C., and Miami, as well.</p>

<p>“We’re excited to be able to support founders anywhere in the United States, but we’re really focused on cities that have a high concentration of Black innovators and a lower concentration of capital,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>The world before June</strong></h2>
<p>While part of Collab’s focus is avoiding coastal cities, network matters. The firm’s ability to secure heavyweight investors such as Apple and PayPal gives it a key signal that validates its bet on Black founders.</p>
<p>Burks thinks part of the reason that investors might be more intentional about backing firms such as hers is the result of the racial injustice that was highlighted in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black people at the hands of police.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ix7vU7SFB1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/embed/#?secret=ix7vU7SFB1" data-secret="ix7vU7SFB1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After Floyd and Taylor were murdered, there was a global movement spearheaded by Black Lives Matter in response to police brutality and racism in the United States. Burks says that Collab Capital had only raised a few million at that time, but then witnessed “a shift in the hearts and minds of capital allocators.”</p>
<p>Burks noted that when Collab Capital was first raising its fund, potential investors told them to have a “wider perspective” on what kinds of entrepreneurs to back. Some thought they should create a fund around underrepresented founders or multicultural founders. With general VC volatility in the early months of the pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">Collab Capital saw some of its LPs pull back</a> or delay commitments.</p>
<p>“We were very adamant that the most important thing we wanted to solve was the funding gap for Black founders, so we were not willing to broaden the spectrum there because we saw that there were so many firms out there for diverse founders, and even in some of those, Black founders were still marginalized.”</p>
<p>While the majority of venture dollars are still managed by white men, Black-led venture capital firms are having quite the year. Collab Capital’s news is preceded by Harlem Capital, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/harlem-capital-fund-ii/">closed a $134 million seed fund </a>earlier this year, Cleo Capital, which set a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/cleo-capital-is-targeting-20-million-for-fund-ii/'"> $20 million target for Fund II</a>, and MaC VC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/closing-on-103-million-mac-venture-capital-is-changing-the-face-of-venture-capital/">landing $103 million for its inaugural fund. </a></p>
<p>Beyond a broader understanding of the importance of diversity in tech, Burks pointed to Zoom as a value unlock.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;d asked me a year ago [if] I think we&#8217;d be successful in raising $50 million over Zoom meetings, I would have said absolutely not,” she said. “But you can build meaningful relationships with people and not even have to be in person. That’s a big surprise &#8212; and, oh, the realization that you don’t have to travel so much.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The high stakes game of chess (or, well, consolidation chicken) that is on-demand food delivery rolls on today with a little more territorial swapping in Europe: Barcelona-based Glovo has agreed to buy three of Berlin-based Delivery Hero&#8217;s food delivery brands in Central and Eastern Europe &#8212; with deals that it said are worth a total value of €170 million (~$208M).</p>
<p>Specifically, it&#8217;s picking up Delivery Hero&#8217;s foodpanda brand in Romania and Bulgaria; the Donesi brand in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Pauza in Croatia.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some notable symmetry here: Last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/delivery-hero-picks-up-glovos-latam-ops-for-272m-in-latest-food-delivery-consolidation/">Delivery Hero shelled out $272M for a bunch of Glovo&#8217;s LatAm brands</a>, as the latter gave up on a region it had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/glovo-exits-the-middle-east-and-drops-two-latam-markets-in-latest-food-delivery-crunch/">started withdrawing from</a> in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/">quest for profitability</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Glovo said then that it would be focusing on &#8220;key markets where we can build a long-term sustainable business and continue to provide our unique multi-category offering to our customers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the Barcelona-based &#8216;deliver anything&#8217; app also announced it was picking up Ehrana, a local delivery company in Slovenia. So it&#8217;s been on quite the (local) shopping spree of late.</p>
<p>Its existing operational footprint covers markets in South West Europe, Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. So its attention here, on the Balkans, suggests it sees a chance to eke out profitable potential in more of Central Europe too.</p>
<p>Glovo said the transactions in Bosnia Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia are expected to close &#8220;within the next few weeks&#8221;, subject to fulfilment of closing conditions and relevant regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>While it said Romania will be completed following approval from the competition authority &#8212; but gave no timeline for that.</p>
<p>Its splurge on Central and Eastern European rival food delivery brands follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">$528M Series F funding round in April</a> &#8212; so it&#8217;s evidently not short of VC cash to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">burn</span> spend.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Oscar Pierre, CEO and co-founder, said: “It’s always been central to our long-term strategy to focus on markets where we see clear opportunities to lead and where we can build a sustainable business. Central and Eastern Europe is a very important part of that plan. The region has really embraced on-demand delivery platforms and we’re very excited to be strengthening our presence and increasing our footprint in countries that continue to show enormous potential for growth.” <b></b></p>
<p dir="ltr">In another supporting statement Delivery Hero made it clear it has bigger fish to fry (than can be served up to hungry customers in the Balkans) right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Delivery Hero has built a clear leading business in the Balkan region in the last couple of years. However, with a lot of operational priorities on our plate, we believe <span class="il">Glovo</span> would be better positioned to continue building an amazing experience for our customers in this region,&#8221; said Niklas Östberg, its CEO and co-founder.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A relevant, recent development for <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-to-launch-operations-in-berlin/">Delivery Hero</a>&#8216;s business is the decision to re-enter its home market of Germany &#8212; Europe&#8217;s biggest economy &#8212; under its foodpanda brand, starting in its home city of Berlin this summer (but with a national expansion planned to follow).</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is notable because back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/21/takeaway-delivery-hero-gobble-gobble/">2018</a> it sold its German operations to another on-demand food delivery rival, the Dutch giant Takeaway.com &#8212; in a $1.1BN deal which included the Lieferheld, Pizza.de and foodora brands <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8212; temporarily stepping out of the competitive fray.</span> (<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Meanwhile Takeaway.com has since merged with the UK&#8217;s Just Eat to become&#8230; </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/">Just Eat Takeaway</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> so, uh, keep up.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Delivery Hero is returning to Germany now because it can, and because the market is huge. A two-year non-compete clause between it and Just Eat Takeaway recently expired &#8212; allowing for reheating (rehashing?) of the competitive food delivery mix in German cities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6b52561c-63a9-4393-928b-c05a03ae6404">FT</a> back in May about this market return, Östberg suggested Delivery Hero has girded itself (and its investors) for a long fight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We don’t see necessarily that we are going to go in and win the market in the next year or so. This is a 10-year game,&#8221; he said. “Of course we will definitely make sure we put in enough money to be the clear number two, the clear challenger [to Just Eat Takeaway.com].”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Winning at food delivery is certainly a(n expensive) marathon, not a sprint.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are also of course multiple races being run in markets around the world, depending on local conditions and competitive mix &#8212; with the chance that the winner of the biggest and most lucrative races will reach such a position of VC-sponsored glory that it can buy up the top competitors from the smaller races and consolidate everything &#8212; maximizing economies of scale and gaining the ability to squeeze out fresh competition to grab a juicy profit for themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or, well, that&#8217;s the theory. Competition regulators are likely to take increasing interest in this space, for one thing. Rising awareness of gig economy workers rights is also putting pressure on the model.</p>
<p>For now, the thin-margin food delivery business needs the right base conditions to survive. The model only functions in cities and ideally in highly dense urban environments. Most of the players in this space also do not employ the armies of riders that are needed to make deliveries &#8212; because doing so would make the model far more costly. And in Europe political attention on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">gig economy workers rights </a>could force reforms that raise regional operational costs, putting further pressure on margins.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/">Spain has its own labor reforms in train</a> that will affect Glovo in its home market, for example.</p>
<p>Achieving sustainability (i.e. profitability without the need for ongoing VC funding injections) remains a huge hurdle for delivery apps. It will likely require massive market consolidation and/or convincing users to switch from making the occasional order of a hot meal on a weekend to relying on app-based delivery for far more of their local shopping needs &#8212; not just lunch/dinner but groceries and toiletries, and other fast moving consumers goods and household items.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/">super fast grocery delivery is a major focus for Glovo</a>, for example &#8212; which has recently been building out networks of inner city dark stores to service in-app convenience store shopping.</p>
<p>Lots of other on-demand app players are also ramping up on that front. Including Delivery Hero &#8212; which has been paying more attention to groceries (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/on-demand-grocery-startup-instashop-acquired-by-delivery-hero-for-360m/">picking up InstaShop last year</a> in a deal worth $360M).</p>
<p>Glovo building out in Central Europe while exiting markets further afield suggests it believes it can use a concentrated market footprint to drive operational efficiencies and strong order margins through a tightly integrated meal delivery and dark store play.</p>
<p>If it can do that &#8212; and offer at least the whiff of profitability &#8212; it could make its business an attractive future acquisition target for a larger global giant that&#8217;s looking to up the &#8216;consolidation chicken&#8217; stakes by bolting on new regions.</p>
<p>A larger player like Delivery Hero may even be a potential future suitor &#8212; having shown it&#8217;s happy to return to markets it left earlier. After all, it surely knows Glovo&#8217;s business pretty well since they&#8217;ve done a number of market swaps. But, for now, that&#8217;s pure speculation.</p>
<p>Zooming out, what the on-demand model of app-based urban convenience means for the future of urban environments is a whole other question &#8212; and one which both competition and urban regulators will need to ponder very carefully.</p>
<p>If the rush to scale delivery platforms drives unstoppable consolidation that sees smaller players gobbled up by a few global giants &#8212; that can then use their size and scale to outcompete local shops &#8212; it may spell even more dark times for the traditional High Street and its family-run bodegas.</p>
<p>Local retail in many places has already been hammered by Internet giants like Amazon. Delivery apps are another high tech threat to bricks-and-mortar shopping. Touch of a button convenience does carry wider costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Facebook has long been working on raising WhatsApp&#8217;s profile as a channel for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/whatsapp-business-now-with-50m-maus-adds-qr-code-and-catalog-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">businesses</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interact with</a> (and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-receives-approval-to-expand-its-payments-service-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell to</a>) their customers. Today, a startup that has built a suite of tools for retailers and others to build and run those services over WhatsApp and other messaging platforms is announcing growth funding to address that opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.yalo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yalo</a>, which describes itself as a c-commerce (&#8220;chat commerce&#8221;) startup building tools for businesses to use messaging apps as part of their customer outreach and sales strategies, has raised $50 million, funding that it will be using to expand its services with a specific focus on emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="p1">Yalo already counts big brands like Unilever, Nestle, Coca-Cola and Walmart among the customers using its platform for sales and marketing efforts. In total that speaks to potentially an audience of 350 million, although Yaho doesn&#8217;t disclose how many people are actually using Yalo services as a part of that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The funding is being led by B Capital, with participation from other, undisclosed, investors. Yalo, which recently rebranded from Yalochat, is on a funding roll at the moment: the company&#8217;s last round was in August, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/yalochat-a-fast-growing-conversational-commerce-startup-lands-15-million-led-by-b-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million Series B</a>. B Capital&#8217;s investment is interesting, given Yalo&#8217;s focus on building tools for businesses to better utilize Facebook apps to interact with customers: the VC firm was co-founded by Eduardo Saverin, one of Facebook&#8217;s co-founders.</p>
<p>CEO Javier Mata said in an emailed interview that the reason for the swift funding was because of how fast business has been growing in the last year, part of the bigger boom for e-commerce overall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid fast forwarded us into the future and with it the need for conversational commerce increased significantly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It went from being [one] digital commerce channel to becoming the main one.&#8221; He said that some of Yalo&#8217;s customers are seeing 80% of their sales happening on top of (and inside) messaging apps, a huge shift when you consider how reliant some brands in the consumer packaged goods sector have in the past been on more physical retail channels, whether that was a supermarket, a corner shop or a vending machine. &#8220;The market demand increased and we raised to continue overdelivering to customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Yalo wasn&#8217;t looking for more funding, &#8220;but then we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, so we did it. Everything we do is to provide value to our customers and in this case we decided to accelerate our product development so that customers would get conversational marketing, payments, and the world would get no-code builder to create all kind of conversational app sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yalo is not disclosing its valuation with this round, CEO Javier Mata said in an email interview. The startup has raised $75 million to date, with other past investors including NXTP from Argentina and Sierra Ventures.</p>
<p>Founded in Mexico, now based in San Francisco, and currently active in Mexico, India, Brazil and the U.S., Yalo&#8217;s strategy is to play into the role messaging apps have taken on for consumers in many markets, but especially emerging markets, where many people &#8220;live&#8221; when on their phones, using them not just to chat to friends, but to interact with a wide range of services.</p>
<p>This is also something that messaging companies like Facebook, taking a page from companies like WeChat and Line in Asia, have been looking to cultivate. Over the years, WeChat and Line have leveraged their success as basic messaging apps to build out wider &#8220;super apps&#8221; covering all kinds of other forms of communication, as well as a plethora of services like payments, shopping, entertainment and news, both build by the apps themselves as well as by third parties, and now used by hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>WhatsApp is Yalo&#8217;s biggest platform &#8220;by a lot,&#8221; said Mata, with SMS in second place, so this is where a lot of its focus is right now.</p>
<p class="p3">While WhatsApp has been building out the facility to provide more services, Yalo has built a platform that sits in between brands and the apps themselves in order to use them. Its service &#8212; which works with other apps as well (it describes itself as platform-agnostic and able to be embedded in any messaging app) &#8212; lets agencies or the brands themselves plan and run marketing and sales campaigns, offer helpdesk services and take payments, giving customers the option to create &#8220;micro apps&#8221; to live in various messaging environments.</p>
<p>The emerging market focus for Yalo seems to mirror the role that messaging and mobile have taken in these markets overall. In many cases, consumers in developing economies skipped straight over using traditional computers and went online for the first time with cheap smartphones. As a result, that paved the way for consumers, whose digital consumption was more focused on mobile screens, to being more receptive and likely to use messaging apps for more than just messaging.</p>
<p>Mata believes that while emerging markets may have paved the way, though, more developed economies will follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from brick and mortar to desktop apps, from apps to web apps, from web apps to mobile apps, and now the future/present is about conversational apps,&#8221; Mata said. &#8220;Conversational apps are the future because they take advantage of the messaging app that people have already downloaded and they do not need users to install or learn a new ux. It is easier to adopt a new technology when you do not need to replace a lot of legacy technology and you can just leapfrog. That is exactly what emerging markets are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believes that &#8220;the US and other markets will get there but they will take longer, and eventually the lines between e-commerce and c-commerce will blur. You are starting to see that with text marketing, which is only a tiny fraction of conversational and it is already huge. It&#8217;s not a surprise that China is further ahead in digital than the US and conversational commerce is the predominant way of commerce through WeChat. Emerging markets leapfrog when it comes to adopting new tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, <span class="s2">BCG<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OYFlp8ZJJv-kzIlp4bi49m1S318EP6j9/view"> <span class="s3">estimates </span></a>that c-commerce is already a $35 billion market, and will grow to $130 billion by 2025 in emerging markets alone, accounting for 60% of all digital commerce.</span></p>
<p class="p6">The question will be, then, that if this really takes off, whether the likes of Facebook will try to own the integration experience as much as owning the platform itself, or whether those who have helped to build more interesting commerce experiences on the traditional web &#8212; companies like Shopify and Magento, but also Amazon &#8212; might try to own this space too, presenting more competition down the line for Yalo.</p>
<p>Not an issue for now, investors say.</p>
<p class="p6">“Yalo has become the leading conversational commerce company, revolutionizing the way large enterprises engage with their customers and enabling them to transact through chat applications. We have been impressed with their execution and are very pleased t<span class="s2">o expand our r</span>elationship with them by leading their Series C round.” said Saverin in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationships between banks and fintechs are multi-faceted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, they partner. In many cases, they compete. In other cases, one acquires or invests in the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, today, an announcement by global payments giant Visa is aimed at helping facilitate banks and fintechs’ ability to work together.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Visa said today it has expanded its </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Fintech Partner Connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a program designed to help financial institutions quickly connect with a “vetted and curated” set of technology providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Angelos, senior vice president and global head of fintech at Visa, to understand just exactly what that means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Global fintech investment last year was $105 billion,” Angelos said. “There were about 2,861 deals in venture, PE and M&amp;A. So literally over $100 billion is going into fintech, which is more than the combined tech budgets of every bank in the U.S. As a result, a lot of innovation that is occurring in fintech is funded by venture dollars. We’re trying to bring that innovation to our clients, whether they are banks, processors or other fintechs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program initially launched in Europe in November of 2020, and now is available in the U.S., Asia Pacific, Latin American and CEMEA (Central Europe, Middle East and Africa). Visa has worked to identify fintechs that can help banks and financial institutions (that are clients of Visa’s) as well as other fintechs “create digital-first experiences, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the cost and complexity of building the back-end technology in-house.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local teams will run programs in the respective regions, and vet and manage partners in the following categories: account opening, data aggregation, analytics and security, customer engagement and new cardholder services and operations and compliance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Visa has identified about 60 partners that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer a range of technologies &#8212; from back-office functions to new front-end services, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Angelos. Those partners include Alloy, Jumio, Argyle, Fidel, FirstSource, TravelBank, Canopy, Hummingbird and Unit21, among others. Twenty-four are located in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of fintech focus and coverage is about disrupting existing banks. Everyone is trying to disrupt everyone, including fintechs like PayPal,” Angelos told TechCrunch. “Venture numbers are certainly very large. What we’re realizing is there is a significant opportunity to pair up a lot of venture-backed companies with our existing clients. It runs a little bit against us versus them approach you typically hear about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa clients can get in touch with program partners via the </span><a href="https://partner.visa.com/site/programs/fintech-partner-connect.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visa Partner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website and get benefits such as reduced implementation fees and pricing discounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fintech Connect program is about both helping to identify and curate interesting fintech companies and then create a favorable commercial partnership for our clients so they can engage with these Fintech Connect partners,” Angelos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what does Visa gain from all this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is that all of our clients are in a position to build better digital experiences for their consumers,” he told TechCrunch. “We would love it if every bank had the latest tools in order to onboard clients and build digital experiences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its partners, for example, is virtual card startup Extend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are fintechs that provide this today such as TripActions, Ramp and Divvy,” Angelos points out. “But what Visa is doing is looking at ‘How can we enable our banking clients to do something similar?’ So we’re bringing innovation into our ecosystem so that anyone can take advantage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can also help companies such as TripActions, Ramp or Divvy with other complementary technologies for security posture, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The net beneficiary is to hopefully move more spending onto those rails,” Angelos said. “For example, if you look at B2B spend, there’s about $120 trillion of it annually. We believe about $20 trillion of that is card eligible. Today, Visa captures about $1 trillion of that. So, another $19 trillion is available for Visa to capture through our partners if our banks and fintechs can build these kinds of solutions to enable B2B payments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Visa also invests in startups from time to time. But this initiative is distinct from those efforts, although a couple of its partners have been recipients of funding from Visa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India has asked social media firms to provide an update on whether they have complied with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a> &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; and &#8220;preferably today&#8221; even as the new regulations are being legally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatsapp-sues-india-government/">challenged by WhatsApp</a>.</p>
<p>In a letter to &#8220;significant social media intermediaries&#8221; &#8212; which New Delhi defines as social media firms with over 5 million registered users in India &#8212; on Wednesday, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology asked the firms to share the names of their apps, websites, or services that will come under the scope of the new IT rules and the status of their compliance.</p>
<p>The letter, obtained by TechCrunch, also asks the firms to provide names and contact details of chief compliance officer, nodal contact person, and resident grievance officer that they have appointed in India as part of the compliance, and also asked for the physical address of the local office. The new rules, unveiled in February this year, mandate that firms have several officials in India to address on-ground concerns.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The letter also implies that India doesn&#8217;t plan to give social media firms any extension on the deadline, which expires on Wednesday, to comply with the new regulations. &#8220;The additional due diligence required from SSMI [significant social media intermediaries] have come into effect today, at the conclusion of three additional months given to SSMIs,&#8221; it said. Shortly after unveiling the new IT rules, India had notified firms to comply within three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are not considered as SSMI, please provide the reasons for the same including the registered users on each of the services provided by you,&#8221; the letter adds. &#8220;The government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, WhatsApp sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet market’s new regulations that it said could allow authorities to make people’s private messages “traceable,” and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">conduct mass surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between American technology giants and the Indian government over the past few months. Earlier this year, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to take down posts that were critical of Modi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians’ tweets as manipulated media</a>.  This week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to “serve a notice” about an investigation into its intel on classifying politicians&#8217; tweets as misleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big tech like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Google often make terrible policies and decisions that are often harming millions of Indians. All of us at IFF, are consistently advocating with our public authorities for user rights centric regulations that help address them,&#8221; said New Delhi-based digital rights advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation, <a href="https://internetfreedom.in/pound-the-alarm-the-clock-strikes-for-social-media-tomorrow-with-the-intermediaries-rules-coming-into-effect/">in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our clear belief that the Intermediaries Rules do not fix these outstanding issues, suffer from core defects of procedural and substantive legality and end up harming your rights as well as the innovation which makes the internet so special and exciting. Today, more than ever we need to follow a path that is led by experts and the values of the Indian constitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (also known as Bappepti) began regulating Bitcoin and other cryptoassets as commodities two years ago, paving the way for licensed brokers like Pintu. Founded last year by Jeth Soetoyo to make it easier for first-time investors to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, Pintu is registered under Bappebti and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics as a licensed cryptoassets broker.</p>
<p>A wave of interest in capital investing during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among millennials who want alternatives to keeping their money in low-yield savings accounts, spurred interest in investment apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/ajaib-raises-65m-series-a-extension-led-by-ribbit-capital-increasing-the-rounds-total-to-90m/">Ajaib</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indonesian-robo-advisor-app-bibit-raises-30-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india/">Bibit</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a>, which have all recently raised funding.</p>
<p>Many first-time investors are also looking at cryptocurrencies. According to Pintu’s internal estimates, last year Indonesia processed $10 billion USD in cryptoassets transactions, mostly through retail investors.</p>

<p>Pintu chief operating officer Andrew Adjiputro told TechCrunch in an email that many Indonesian retail traders see crypto as an alternative investment asset class, and that the majority of retail investors are aged 20 to 35 years old. But the company is starting to see more older investors as crypto gains popularity.</p>
<p>“Based on our internal survey, in terms of public’s top of mind asset classes, we see crypto as a top three asset class in Indonesia, alongside gold and mutual funds,” he said.</p>
<p>Other Indonesian cryptocurrency exchanges include Indodax and Tokocrypto. When asked how Pintu differentiates, Adjiputro said it focuses on the mass market to reach mainly first-time crypto users, and its value proposition lies in its mobile-first app, easy user experience and educational materials developed by the company.</p>
<p>“For most Indonesians, the concept of investing and trading is new, because historically penetration in these categories have been so low,” he explained. “So what we’re seeing is also the opportunity to help Indonesians understand the concept of investing/trading and along the way leapfrog investments into other asset classes. What this means is that there is a large base of underserved first time investors that demand a simple and intuitive trading platform where they are handheld from the start to finish and also educated on the fundamentals of investing/trading on top of that of crypto.”</p>
<p>Pintu’s new funding will be used on marketing, hiring and product development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The handling of user data in China has become a delicate matter for foreign tech companies operating in the country. Apple&#8217;s move to store the data of its Chinese customers in servers managed by a Chinese state-owned cloud service has stoked controversy in the West over the years. A recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">investigation</a> found that the setup could give Beijing easy access to Apple&#8217;s user data in China, but Apple said it &#8220;never compromised the security&#8221; of its customers or their data.</p>
<p>Tesla, one of the few U.S. tech heavyweights that generate substantial revenues from China, is working out a similar data plan. The electric carmaker said it has established a data center in China to carry out the &#8220;localization of data storage,&#8221; with plans to add more data facilities in the future, the company <a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime&amp;type=comment">announced</a> through its account on microblogging platform Weibo. All data generated by Tesla vehicles sold in mainland China will be kept domestically.</p>
<p>Tesla is acting in response to <a href="http://www.moj.gov.cn/pub/sfbgw/zlk/202105/t20210512_392004.html">new requirements</a> drafted by the Chinese government to regulate how cameras- and sensors-enabled carmakers collect and utilize data. One of the requirements states that &#8220;personal or important data should be stored within the [Chinese] territory.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what level of data access Chinese authorities have to Tesla&#8217;s Chinese customers. In the case of Apple, the phone maker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html">said</a> it controlled the keys that protect the data of its Chinese users.</p>
<p>Tesla recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/">fell out of favor</a> with Chinese media and the public after a customer protested the carmaker&#8217;s faulted parts at an auto show in Shanghai, earning her widespread sympathy. Tesla also faces fierce competition from domestic rivals like Nio and Xpeng, which are investing heavily in world-class designs and autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p>The American firm clearly wants the government&#8217;s good graces in its second-largest market.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With more people than ever before going online to pay for things and pay each other, startups that are building the infrastructure that enables these actions continue to get a lot of attention.</p>
<p>In the latest development, <a href="https://paysend.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paysend</a>, a fintech that has built a mobile-based payments platform &#8212; which currently offers international money transfers, global accounts, and business banking and e-commerce for SMBs &#8212; has picked up some money of its own. The London-based startup has closed a round of $125 million, a sizable Series B that the company&#8217;s CEO and founder Ronnie Millar said it will be using both to continue expanding its business geographically, to hire more people, and to continue building more fintech products.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by One Peak, with Infravia Growth Capital, Hermes GPE, previous backer Plug and Play and others participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Millar said Paysend is not disclosing valuation today but described it as a &#8220;substantial kick-up&#8221; and &#8220;a great step forward in our position ahead towards unicorn status.&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I understand though, the company was valued at $160 million in its previous round, and its core metrics have gone up 4.5x. Doing some basic math, that gives the company a valuation of around $720 million, a figure that a source close to the company did not dispute when I brought it up.</p>
<p>Something that likely caught investors&#8217; attention is that Paysend has grown to the size it is today &#8212; it currently has 3.7 million consumer customers using its transfer and global account services, and 17,000 small business customers, and is now available in 110 receiving countries &#8212; in less than four years and $50 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are a couple of notable things about Paysend and its position in the market today, the first being the competitive landscape.</p>
<p>On paper, Paysend appears to offer many of the same features as a number of other fintechs: money transfer, global payments, and banking and e-commerce services for smaller businesses are all well-trodden areas with companies like Wise (formerly &#8220;TransferWise&#8221;), PayPal, Revolut, and so many others also providing either all or a range of these services.</p>
<p>To me, the fact that any one company relatively off the tech radar can grow to the size that it has speaks about the opportunity in the market for more than just one or two, or maybe five, dominant players.</p>
<p>Considering just remittances alone, the WorldBank in April said that flows just to low- and middle-income countries stood at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/05/12/defying-predictions-remittance-flows-remain-strong-during-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$540 million last year</a>, and that was with a dip in volumes due to Covid-19. The cut that companies like Paysend make in providing services to send money is, of course, significantly smaller than that &#8212; business models include commission charges, flat fees, or making money off exchange rates; Paysend charges £1 per transfer in the UK. More than that, the overall volumes, and the opportunity to build more services for that audience, are why we&#8217;re likely to see a lot of companies with ambitions to serve that market.</p>
<p>Services for small businesses, and tapping into the opportunity to provide more e-commerce tools at a time when more business and sales are being conducted online, is similarly crowded but also massive.</p>
<p>Indeed, Paysend points out that there is still a lot of growing and evolution left to do. Citing McKinsey research, it notes that some 70% of international payments are currently still cash-to-cash, with fees averaging up to 5.2% per transaction, and timing taking up to an hour each for sender and recipient to complete transfers. (Paysend claims it can cut fees by up to 60%.)</p>
<p>This brings us to the second point about Paysend: how it&#8217;s built its services. The fintech world today leans heavily on APIs: companies that are knitting together a lot of complexity and packaging it into APIs that are used by others who bypass needing to build those tools themselves, instead integrating them and adding better user experience and responsive personalization around them. notes, is a little different from these, with a vertically integrated approach, having itself built everything that it uses from the ground up.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Millar &#8212; a Scottish repeat entrepreneur (his previous company Paywizard, which has rebranded to Singula, is a specialist in pay-TV subscriber management) &#8212; notes that Paysend has built both its processing and acquiring facilities. &#8220;Because we have built everything in-house it lets us see what the consumer needs and uses, and to deliver that at a lower cost basis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more cost efficient and we pass that savings on to the consumer. We designed our technology to be in complete control of it. It&#8217;s the most profitable approach, too, from a business point of view.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That being said, he confirmed that Paysend itself is not yet profitable, but investors believe it&#8217;s making the right moves to get there. And, to be clear, Paysend actually does partner with other companies, including those providing APIs, to improve its services. In April, <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/paysend-and-plaid-working-together-to-make-international-money-transfers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid and Paysend announced</a> they were working together to power open banking transfers, reducing the time to initiate and receive money.</p>
<p>“We are excited by Paysend’s enormous growth potential in a massive market, benefiting from a rapid acceleration in the adoption of digital payments,&#8221; said Humbert de Liedekerke, managing partner at One Peak Partners, in a statement. &#8220;In particular, we are seeing strong opportunities as Paysend moves beyond consumers to serve business customers and expands its international footprint to address a growing need for fast, easy and low-cost cross border digital payments. Paysend has built an exceptional payment platform by maintaining an unwavering focus on its customers and constantly innovating. We are excited to back the entire Paysend team in their next phase of explosive growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As of now, one fo the UK’s biggest and most active tech VCs has a new partner. Principal Colin Hanna has spearheaded several of Balderton’s deals in the past couple of years, and has now been appointed a Partner. But there’s a twist to this plot. He will be officially based in Berlin (where he’s lived since 2019), thus giving the VC a more powerful reach, being based, as it is, solely in London.</p>
<p>Hanna said: “Having been with Balderton for five years, I am humbled to now call my mentors my Partners. I look forward to strengthening Balderton’s unique approach from Berlin as we engineer serendipity for European founders with planet-scale ambition.”</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner of Balderton commented: &#8220;We are delighted to announce Colin&#8217;s promotion to Partner. Since he joined Balderton in 2016, Colin has had a significant impact on both Balderton and our portfolio… Colin has strengthened our position in DACH by establishing our permanent presence in Berlin and bringing in Shikha Ahluwalia, whom we are delighted to have. In addition, he was instrumental in the definition of the Balderton Sustainable Future Goals. We have no doubt Colin will be highly successful in his new role.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The story does not end there, however. Joining him will be tech entrepreneur and founder Shikha Ahluwalia as an Associate covering the DACH region.</p>
<p>co-founded SBL, the D2C women’s fashion e-commerce company in India. Prior to that she was had a tech advisory boutique, and was previously with JP Morgan’s Investment Banking Division in London.</p>
<p>Balderton has 10 current investments across DACH including Contentful, Infarm, SOPHiA Genetics, McMakler, Demodesk, and vivenu.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia commented: “Over the past few years, I have seen the DACH start-up ecosystem evolve rapidly. We at Balderton believe the next European giant will be a technology company and know that the DACH ecosystem plays a significant role in helping form category-leading technology companies. As a former founder myself, I have first-hand experience with the unique challenges of running young businesses. I am excited to contribute and support founders on their own journey as part of Balderton Capital.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over an interview Hanna said: “Shikha’s hiring deepens our commitment to the local Berlin ecosystem and to the DACH region more broadly. We have been actively supporting Founders in Germany for more than a decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>After spending his childhood in Jakarta and Hong Kong, and picking up a degree in Political Economy, Hanna has carved out a career in venture investing &#8211; at Balderton since July 4, 2016 &#8211; looking at it through the prism on the rise of urban living, grassroots-driven technologies like open source and crypto, and the political ramifications of technology.</p>
<p>He sits on the Board of companies like e-bikes startup VanMoof, Finoa (a crypto custodian), Rahko (quantum computing drug discovery, and helped lead on investments into Traefik and Luno and Vivenu).</p>
<p>One these you might pick up from all those is that they err towards the ‘purpose-driven’ side of the equation.</p>
<p>He told me: &#8220;I believe the next generation of Founders, particularly in Europe, care more about just their bank accounts and want to build companies that generate impact and are not afraid to take a view on how they want the world to change. Measuring this is a challenge and something we are trying to do with our SFGs at Balderton which I helped spearhead. I believe that when companies like Coinbase and others go &#8220;apolitical&#8221; they commit themselves to defending the structural status quo rather than becoming agents of deliberate change.”</p>
<p>&#8220;My point about purpose driven companies is that when I think when employees want to work with companies believe in their values and you try to tell them those aren&#8217;t important, that could be viewed as political. I don&#8217;t think we should be we should be muffling the employees.”</p>
<p>Does he think Coinbase, and also recent more recently Basecamp / 37 Signals were wrong to so-called ‘depoliticize&#8217; their businesses?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, I think every CEO is free to run their company how they see fit. But I think that that poses challenges for them on the talent side. I understand, as an American, how charged and how destructive the political climate became, and so I can really understand and empathize why certain choices were made at that time, because you get to a point where that where the conversation becomes toxic… I hope that the steps that they&#8217;ve taken, don&#8217;t strangle dialogue and conversation that&#8217;s constructive about how we want to make an impact and change the world, either as individuals or with the companies we work for,” he said.</p>
<p>Hanna also told me that he think VCs should be wary that the shift to remote will make it easier to invest more widely. “You have to more background checks on founders now, and things like that. But is it a &#8216;little bit&#8217; more dangerous or is it &#8216;50% more dangerous&#8217; the fact that people aren&#8217;t meeting up in person?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.matera.eu">Matera</a> has announced that is has raised a new $43 million (€35 million) Series B funding round led by Mubadala Capital. Bpifrance, Burda Principal Investments as well as existing investors Index Ventures and Samaipata are also participating.</p>
<p>The company is building a vertical SaaS for residential property management. In France, co-owners of the common space of a building can decide to ditch the company that handles residential building management for them and do it themselves.</p>
<p>And it could work particularly well for small buildings with 10 or 15 apartments. There are fewer relationships to manage, fewer bills to pay and less work in general.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When co-owners vote to switch to Matera, they get a web-based platform and a mobile app to view information and see all the contracts with various partners — think about elevator maintenance, heating maintenance, water, electricity, etc.</p>
<p>If something feels odd, you can contact a residential building expert on Matera. They can help you make sure you comply with the law and file paperwork for you.</p>
<p>The platform also guides you when it comes to leading an annual co-owner meeting. It can help you communicate with all co-owners with a forum, an on-demand letter service, etc. Essentially, all co-owners get their own login information.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the company launched a new service to tackle a bigger chunk of the building management stack. Matera clients can now decide to manage their building’s bank account through the platform. This way, co-owners pay directly on Matera and everybody can keep track of the budget over time.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Matera plans to expand to Germany. The startup has been growing rapidly as it now manages 3,000 buildings, representing a 300% year-over-year jump. Overall, 60,000 owners use Matera.</p>
<p>“This past year gave us the opportunity to prove the relevance of our model and our value proposition, showing why Matera is the perfect solution for our times. The crisis sped up the digital transformation of our market, while at the same time increasing the attachment to our homes and buildings,” co-founder and CEO Raphaël di Meglio said in a statement. “Our clients wanted more transparency, and to save money and that’s exactly what we can bring them.”</p>
<p>By the end of 2021, Matera wants to manage 6,000 buildings including 40 in Germany. The company currently has 200 employees and plans to hire another 50 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp has sued the Indian government challenging the second largest internet market&#8217;s new regulations that could allow authorities to make people’s private messages “traceable,” and <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">conduct mass surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned instant messaging service, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, said it filed the lawsuit in the High Court of Delhi on Wednesday. It said New Delhi&#8217;s “traceability” requirement &#8212; which would require WhatsApp to help New Delhi identify the originator of a particular message &#8212; violated citizens’ constitutional right to privacy.</p>
<p>“Civil society and technical experts around the world have consistently argued that a requirement to &#8216;trace&#8217; private messages would break end-to-end encryption and lead to real abuse. WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy of people’s personal messages and we will continue to do all we can within the laws of India to do so,” WhatsApp said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India first proposed WhatsApp to make software changes to make the originator of a message traceable in 2018. The suggestion came at a time when WhatsApp was grappling with containing spread of false information in India, where circulation of such information had resulted in multiple real-life casualties.</p>
<p>But its suggestion didn’t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">become the law until this year</a>. Traceability requirement is part of New Delhi&#8217;s sweeping IT rules that also require social media firms to appoint several officers in India to address on-ground concerns, and also gives authorities greater power over taking down posts it deems offensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology and privacy experts have determined that traceability breaks end-to-end encryption and would severely undermine the privacy of billions of people who communicate digitally. Reasonable and proportionate regulations for an increasingly digital world are important, but eroding privacy for everyone, violating human rights, and putting innocent people at risk is not the solution. WhatsApp is committed to doing all we can to protect the privacy of people’s personal messages, which is why we join others in opposing traceability,&#8221; the messaging platform, used by over 2 billion users worldwide, <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it">said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian government gave large social media firms three months to comply with the new IT rules. Wednesday is the deadline for firms, including Facebook, to comply with the new regulation. Failure to do so may take away the safe harbor protection tech companies enjoy.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s move on Wednesday is highly unusual. Facebook has engaged closely with New Delhi over the years &#8212; to a point where allegations were made that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-addresses-political-controversy-in-india-monetization-opportunities-startup-investments/">didn&#8217;t take action on some politicians&#8217; objectionable posts</a> because it feared it would hurt its business in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have never seen a company sue the Indian government for asking for information.&#8221; said Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at consultancy firm Convergence Catalyst. &#8220;We have seen companies push back, but they have never explored legal options in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>WhatsApp is already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">fighting a legal case filed by the India government</a>, in the same aforementioned court, over its new privacy policy as New Delhi tries to get the Facebook-owned firm to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/india-tells-whatsapp-to-withdraw-its-new-policy-terms/">withdraw the new terms</a>.</p>
<p>Last year India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned over 200 Chinese apps</a>, including TikTok, which at the time of blocking identified India as its biggest overseas market. India said it was banning the apps because they posed threat to national security and defence of India.</p>
<p>None of the Chinese firms sued the Indian government, with at least two telling TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity that it&#8217;s nearly impossible to win a court case in India against the government when the national security issue has been raised.</p>
<p>&#8220;So much so, that you are going to have a hard time even finding a lawyer who represents you,&#8221; an Indian official added.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited similar national concerns when he unveiled the revised IT rules in February this year.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between American technology giants and the Indian government over the past few months. Earlier this year, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>Last month, the Indian government ordered Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to take down posts that were critical of Modi&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">handling of the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians’ tweets as manipulated media</a>. Earlier this week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to “serve a notice.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xiaomi, one of China&#8217;s high-profile tech firms that fell in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, has been removed from a U.S. government blacklist that designated it as a Communist Chinese Military Company.</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has vacated the Department of Defence&#8217;s designation of Xiaomi as a CCMC <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/xiaomi-us-blacklist/">in January</a>, a <a href="file:///Users/ritaliao/Downloads/2021.05.25_-_ECF_37_-_ORDER_vacating_Xiaomi_Corporation_s_CCMC_designation_and_remanding_the_matter_to_the_agency_See.pdf">document</a> filed on May 25 shows.</p>
<p>In February, Xiaomi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/xiaomi-sues-the-us-government-over-blacklisting/">sued</a> the U.S. government over its inclusion in the military blacklist. In March, the D.C. court granted Xiaomi a <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22367849/xiaomi_v_us_dept_of_defense.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> against the DoD designation, which would have forbidden all U.S. persons from purchasing or possessing Xiaomi’s securities, saying the decision was &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221; The ruling was made to prevent &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221; to the Chinese phone maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Xiaomi has this to say about getting off the blacklist:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Company is grateful for the trust and support of its global users, partners, employees and shareholders. The Company reiterates that it is an open, transparent, publicly traded, independently operated and managed corporation. The Company will continue to provide reliable consumer electronics products and services to users, and to relentlessly build amazing products with honest prices to let everyone in the world enjoy a better life through innovative technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Xiaomi&#8217;s domestic competitor Huawei is still struggling with its inclusion in the U.S. trade blacklist, which bans it from accessing critical U.S. technologies and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/huawei-iot-strategy/">crippled its smartphone sales</a> around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are backing Koo, an Indian alternative to Twitter, with large size checks at a time when tension is brewing between the American social network and New Delhi.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said on Wednesday it has raised $30 million in a financing round led by Tiger Global Management. Mirae Asset, IIFL&#8217;s venture capital fund and existing investors 3one4 Capital, Blume Ventures, and Accel also participated in the round, which valued the Bangalore-based startup at over $100 million, up from about $25 million in February.</p>
<p>Like Twitter, <a href="http://kooapp.com">Koo app</a> allows users to publish posts in English and half a dozen Indian languages. Its interface, logo, and social sharing mechanism are strikingly similar to those of Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app has gained popularity in India in recent months following flare-ups between Twitter and the Indian government after the San Francisco-headquartered firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">refused to block accounts that criticized</a> New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year.</p>
<p>(The Indian government, like Singapore&#8217;s, also ordered Twitter and Facebook last week to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">take down posts</a> that identified a new variant of the coronavirus as &#8220;Indian variant&#8221;. Also last week, New Delhi objected to Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">labeling of some of its politicians&#8217; tweets as manipulated media</a>. Earlier this week, police in Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">visited Twitter offices</a> to &#8220;serve a notice.&#8221;)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157509" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157509 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=300,263 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=768,673 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=680,596 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/koo-app.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157509" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshots of Koo app</p></div></p>
<p>Several prominent government officials &#8212; including Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, Union Cabinet Minister Smriti Irani, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad &#8212; and many celebrities have signed up on Koo in recent months and urged their followers to follow suit.</p>
<p>Though the app &#8212; co-founded by Aprameya Radhakrishna (who also co-founded TaxiForSure, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold to local giant Ola</a>; and is a prolific angel investor) &#8212; has won the trust of investors, it is yet to gain ground.</p>
<p>Koo app, which was launched last year, had fewer than 6.5 million monthly active users in India in April, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch).</p>
<p>The startup says it aims to build a social network for the entire nation and not just a fraction of it. Twitter remains largely popular among users in urban cities in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have aggressive plans to grow into one of the world’s largest social media platforms in the next few years. Every Indian is cheering for us to get there soon,&#8221; said Radhakrishna in a statement.</p>
<p>Koo, whose initial traction has been <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-koo-became-a-right-wing-darling-in-india/">credited to Hindu nationalists</a>, is currently one of the handful of social networks that has complied with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">India’s new IT rules</a> that grant New Delhi greater power to take down posts it deems offensive.</p>
<p>The revised IT rules, announced in February, would put an end to “double standards” by making platforms more accountable to the local law, government officials said then. Failure to comply might bereft social networks of safe harbor protection they enjoy.</p>
<p>The deadline to comply with the new rules expires on Wednesday. Facebook, which identifies India as its largest market, said it “aims to comply” with the new rules, while Google said in a statement that it “respects” India’s legislative process.</p>
<p>Koo is the latest investment from Tiger Global in India this year. The hedge fund, which has backed over 20 Indian unicorns, has emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/?tpcc=ECTW2020">most prolific investor in Indian startups in recent months</a>, winning founders with its pace of investment, check size, and favorable terms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, the publicly traded Swedish company that supplies driver monitoring systems for a dozen automakers, has acquired emotion-detection software startup Affectiva for $73.5 million in a cash-and-stock deal.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, has developed software that can detect and understand human emotion, which Smart Eye is keen to combine with its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The companies&#8217; founders see an opportunity to expand beyond driver monitoring systems — tech that is often used in conjunction with advanced driver assistance systems to track and measure awareness — and into the rest of the vehicle. Together, the technology could help them break into the emerging &#8220;interior sensing&#8221; market, which can be used to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="http://corp.smarteye.se/en/press/press-releases/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-enters-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-affectiva-and-intends-to-raise-equity-in-a-directed-share-issue">terms of the deal</a>, $67.5 million will be paid with 2,354,668 new Smart Eye shares, of which 2,015,626 are to be issued upon closing of the transaction. The remaining 339,042 Smart Eye shares will be issued within two years of closing. About $6 million will be paid in cash once the deal closes in June 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Affectiva and Smart Eye were competitors. A meeting at the technology trade show CES in 2020 put the two companies on a path to merge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Martin and I realized like, wow, we are on a path to compete with each other — and wouldn&#8217;t it be so much better if we joined forces?&#8221; Affective co-founder and CEO Dr. Rana el Kaliouby said in an interview Tuesday. &#8220;By joining forces, we kind of check all the boxes for what the OEMs are looking for with interior sensing, we leapfrog the competition and we have an opportunity to do this better and faster than we could have done it on our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston-based Affectiva brings its emotion-detection software to the deal, which will allow Smart Eye to offer its existing automotive partners a variety of products. Smart Eye helps Affectiva move beyond the development and prototype work and into production contracts. Smart Eye has won 84 production contracts with 13 OEMs, including BMW and GM. Smart Eye, which has offices in Gothenburg, Detroit, Tokyo and Chongqing, China, also has a division that provides research organizations such as NASA with high-fidelity eye tracking systems for human factors research.</p>
<p>Smart Eye founder and CEO Martin Krantz said that European manufacturers building luxury and premium vehicles led the charge for driver monitoring systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the same pattern repeating itself now for interior sensing,&#8221; Krantz said. &#8220;I think a large part of the early contracts will be European premium OEMs such as Mercedes, BMW, Audi, JLR, Porsche.&#8221; Krantz added that there are a number of other premium brands it will target in other regions, including Cadillac and Lexus.</p>
<p>The opportunity will initially be in passenger vehicles driven by humans and will eventually expand as greater levels of automated driving enter the market.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which employs 100 people at its offices in Boston and Cairo, also has another business unit that applies its emotio-detection software to media analytics. This division, which will be part of the deal and will operate separately, is profitable, Kaliouby said, noting the software is used by 70% of the world&#8217;s largest advertisers to measure and understand emotional responses to media content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The social video tool <a href="http://promo.com/">Promo.com</a> just raised $16 million in a Series B round led by Getty Images, the company synonymous with stock imagery.</p>
<p>Brands, creators or whoever else might need some quick and dirty video content can search Promo.com for what they need, just like they would use a stock photography service. Getty offers its own library of stock videos as well, but Promo.com provides both the video clips and the tools for non-editors to craft a basic edit with a little bit of customization.</p>
<p>Brands can select an existing professional video clip from a library, plug in their own message and add a logo or custom audio. All that&#8217;s left is downloading the customized video and whisking it off to their social channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank, one of the largest banks in Israel, also participated in the Series B round through debt financing. Promo.com&#8217;s existing &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; with Getty Images will deepen as part of the deal, giving the former company access to the latter&#8217;s expansive existing pool of video clips.</p>

<p>Of course, Promo.com isn&#8217;t the only show in town. Video creation platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/biteable-raises-7-million-series-a-for-its-template-based-online-video-builder/">Biteable</a> raised $7 million of its own in December, and similarly allows companies to make bright, bite-sized video content for social. The super streamlined<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/canva-raises-60-million-on-a-6-billion-valuation/"> graphic design platform Canva</a> also supports video editing with its own library of stock images. Vimeo offers its own video template service too, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/vimeos-new-app-helps-small-businesses-create-professional-social-videos/">known as Vimeo Create</a>, which grew out of the company&#8217;s acquisition of the AI-powered video editor Magisto.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Daily Crunch for May 25, 2021. Whether you are a developer, a startup fanatic or merely someone with wanderlust, we have something for everyone today. Well, except for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/">disappointed investors in Lordstown Motors</a>. They are stuck holding the bag today after the American electric vehicle company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">announced a pretty awful set of earnings</a>.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us, there’s quite a lot of tech and startup news to enjoy. Let’s get to it! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/"><strong>TechCrunch’s deep dive into Expensify continues</strong></a>: Ahead of its IPO, TechCrunch is digging into Expensify’s growth from startup to unicorn, with our latest entry discussing how the company shed its “Silicon Valley arrogance” to go global.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/"><strong>$300M for vertical farming</strong></a>: Startups shaking up the agricultural world is no longer a surprising idea, but the recent Bowery Farms round did make us sit up and take note. The company is now worth $2.3 billion, and its “vertically farmed produce is now available in 850 grocery stores.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/"><strong>Venture capital’s global march continues</strong></a>: New data from Africa indicates that the continent’s historically lagging venture capital results are making up for lost time. <a href="https://twitter.com/ulonnaya">Tage Kene-Okafor</a> reports that VC activity in Africa could reach “between $2.25 billion and $2.8 billion” this year. That would be a new record.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/"><strong>$26M for Airbyte, which is working to better connect data to where it’s needed</strong></a>: Having data is one thing, but startups are starting to get into not only <em>storing</em> data, but also how it gets ingested (Monte Carlo is working on that), and making sure it’s moved to where it’s needed. That’s where Airbyte comes in. And the company’s latest round comes just months after it raised a $5.6 million seed deal.</p>
<p>We asked our own <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron Miller</a> what induced him to cover the round. Here’s what he had to say: “What attracted me to this round was the fact that the founders were using open source to drive the development of a community of users, then worrying about monetization down the road.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/twilio-invests-in-adaptive-communications-platform-hyro/"><strong>Twilio opens wallet for Hyro</strong></a>: Whenever a company well known for leading a sea change in the tech world cuts a check, we tend to take notice. Recall when Salesforce was hip; its investments made waves. Today, Twilio is the BigCo in question, and Hyro the startup it is backing.</p>
<p>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, Hyro “calls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end users in a conversational way.” Very cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/whatnot-raises-50m-to-let-people-sell-pokemon-cards-funko-pops-and-more-via-livestream/"><strong>$50M for Whatnot, which wants to livestream e-commerce</strong></a>: Look, if you are not into buying things, Whatnot is not going to be your jam. But if you are, it has a neat take on e-commerce that is popular around the world, but has yet to take off in North America. Notably this round comes mere months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Whatnot raised $20 million</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/blockchain-startup-propy-plans-first-ever-auction-of-a-real-apartment-as-a-collectible-nft/"><strong>Something something real-life NFTs?</strong></a>: What happens when you cross a startup that wants to bring blockchain to the real estate market and NFTs? You get this: Propy. The startup in question, is “auctioning a real apartment as an NFT.” I don’t get it! But maybe that’s the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/security-startup-tessian-which-uses-ai-to-fight-social-engineering-trousers-65m/"><strong>$65M for social engineering-fighting Tessian</strong></a>: U.K.-based Tessian is a cybersecurity company, which means that of course it raised a huge new round. The cybersecurity market is hotter than all heck given <em>waves arms around at all the breaches lately.</em> But what makes Tessian neat is that it is taking on the human side of things by “flagging problematic [usage] patterns [that] could signify risky stuff is happening.”</p>
<h2>Brian Chesky describes a faster, nimbler post-pandemic Airbnb</h2>
<p>Managing Editor Jordan Crook interviewed Airbnb co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world’s biggest hospitality startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it’s like driving a car. You can’t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes and expect nothing really bad to happen.</p>
<p>“Now imagine you’re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today was Microsoft’s Build conference, the second time that the annual Redmond developer confab took place virtually. But before we get into that, a short note on autonomous deliveries.</p>
<p>Getting stuff brought to your house without human power is a long-running technology dream. Remember <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/a-first-look-at-amazons-new-delivery-drone/">those Amazon drones</a> that everyone got super stoked about and then we never heard from again (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/amazon-asks-faa-for-permission-to-test-its-delivery-drones/">not once, but twice</a>)? Or the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/postmates-robot-serve/">cute Postmates robot</a>? Well, there’s another set of players in the space, namely JD.com and Meituan. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/meituan-jd-com-and-neolix-begin-autonomous-deliveries-in-beijing/">the latest</a> on their self-driving delivery efforts.</p>
<p>Back to Build — oh boy was there a lot of news. From top to bottom, Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-brings-more-of-its-azure-services-to-any-kubernetes-cluster/">bringing more Azure services to Kubernetes</a>, new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-gives-developers-new-tools-for-building-for-teams/">tools for developers building on top of Teams</a>, updates<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsofts-edge-browser-can-now-start-up-faster-and-put-your-tabs-to-sleep/"> to its Edge browser</a> as Internet Explorer shuffles off this mortal coil, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-azure-launches-pytorch-enterprise/">enterprise Azure support for PyTorch</a>, and, my personal favorite, the company is leveraging GPT-3 (which I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">think is super cool</a>) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/microsoft-uses-gpt-3-to-let-you-code-in-natural-language/">help people code in natural language</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be a Microsoft beat reporter. I kinda miss those days. It’s a huge company with a finger in nearly every pie, which makes covering it surprisingly horizontal. Regardless, enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">Frederic’s</a> coverage!</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Some of us have started traveling again &#8230; revenge travel, if you will. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a> chatted with Airbnb’s CEO and we asked him if he thinks “the trends we’re seeing in travel right now, like more rural destinations and decreased business travel, are here to stay?&#8221; See what he had to say <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/brian-chesky-describes-a-faster-nimbler-post-pandemic-airbnb/">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1397251091323031558">tell us what <em>you</em> think here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla Model Y and Model 3 vehicles bound for North American customers are being built without radar, fulfilling a desire by CEO Elon Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support its advanced driver assistance system and other active safety features.</p>
<p>Like many of Tesla&#8217;s moves, the decision to stop using the sensor runs counter to the industry standard. For now, the radar-less cars will only be sold in North America. Tesla didn&#8217;t state when or if it might remove the radar sensor in vehicles built for Chinese and European customers. Automakers typically use a combination of radar and cameras — and even lidar — to provide the sensing required to deliver advanced driver assistance system features like adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, as well as lane keeping and automatic lane changes.</p>
<p>Musk has touted the potential of its branded &#8220;Tesla Vision&#8221; system, which only uses cameras and so-called neural net processing to detect and understand what is happening in the environment surrounding the vehicle and then respond appropriately. Neural nets are a form of machine learning that work similarly to how humans learn. It is a sophisticated form of artificial intelligence algorithm that allows a computer to learn by using a series of connected networks to identify patterns in data. Many companies developing self-driving tech use deep neural networks to handle specific problems. But they wall off the deep nets and use rules-based algorithms to tie into the broader system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380796939151704071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company detailed the transition away from radar in an <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision">update on its website</a>, noting that the switch started this month. This camera-plus-machine learning (specifically neural net processing) approach has been dubbed Tesla Vision and will be used in its standard Autopilot advanced driver assistance system as well as in its $10,000 upgraded feature that has been branded Full Self-Driving or FSD. Tesla vehicles are not self-driving and require a human driver to remain engaged.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles that are delivered without radar will initially limit Autopilot, including the lane-keeping feature known as Autosteer. For a short period of time, Autosteer will be limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph and a longer minimum following distance. The system&#8217;s emergency lane departure avoidance feature and smart summon, which allows the driver to summon its vehicle in a parking lot, may be disabled at delivery, Tesla said.</p>
<p>The company plans to restore these features through wireless software updates in the coming weeks. Tesla didn&#8217;t provide a specific timeline. All other available Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features will be active at delivery, depending on order configuration, the company said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new Model S and Model X vehicles as well as every model built for markets outside of North America, will continue to be equipped with radar and will have radar-supported Autopilot functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Model 3 and Model Y are our higher volume vehicles,&#8221; Tesla noted in its frequently asked questions section. &#8220;Transitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision.&#8221;</p>
