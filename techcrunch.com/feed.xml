										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vianai Systems, an AI startup founded by former chief executive of Indian IT services giant Infosys, said on Wednesday it has raised $140 million in a round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The two-year-old startup said a number of industry luminaries also participated in the new round, which brings its total to-date raise to at least $190 million. The startup raised $50 million in its Seed financing round, but there’s no word on the size of its Series A round.</p>
<p>Details about what exactly the Palo Alto-headquartered startup does is unclear. In a press statement, Dr. Vishal Sikka said the startup is building a “better AI platform, one that puts human judgment at the center of systems that bring vast AI capabilities to amplify human potential.” Sikka, 54, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/five-reasons-why-ceo-vishal-sikka-had-to-leave-infosys/articleshow/60114080.cms">resigned</a> from the top role at Infosys in 2017 after months of acrimony between the board and a cohort of founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“<a href="http://vian.ai">Vianai</a> helps its customers amplify the transformation potential within their organizations using a variety of advanced AI and ML tools with a distinct approach in how it thoughtfully brings together humans with technology. This human-centered approach differentiates Vianai from other platform and product companies and enables its customers to fulfill AI’s true promise,” the startup said.</p>
<p>The startup claims it has already amassed many of the world’s largest and most respected businesses including insurance giant Munich Re as its customers.</p>
<p>Its investors include Jim Davidson (co-founder of Silver Lake), Henry Kravis and George Roberts (co-founders of KKR), and Jerry Yang (founding partner of AME and co-founder of Yahoo). Dr. Fei-Fei Li (co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI), has joined Vianai Systems’ advisory board.</p>
<p>“With the AI revolution underway, we believe Vianai’s human-centered AI platform and products provide global enterprises with operational and customer intelligence to make better business decisions,” said Deep Nishar, Senior Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We are pleased to partner with Dr. Sikka and the Vianai team to support their ambition to fulfill AI’s promise to drive fundamental digital transformations.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Advertising giant Facebook announced Wednesday that they&#8217;re going to begin testing advertising inside virtual reality titles on its Oculus platform soon. The first roll-out is limited enough, with Facebook testing ads inside a single gaming shooter title: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2307085352735834/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=testing-in-headset-vr-ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blaston</a> from Resolution Games. They are interestingly not rolling this out with a first-party title, though I&#8217;m sure integration with Oculus Studio titles is inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, this is a test with a few apps — once we see how this test goes and incorporate feedback from developers and the community, we’ll provide more details on when ads may become more broadly available across the Oculus Platform and in the Oculus mobile app,&#8221; a company <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/testing-in-headset-vr-ads/">blog post</a> reads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users will be able to mute, hide or see information on why they are being served an ad in its current form.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an unsurprising development for a platform that Facebook has long been bankrolling with little regard for current revenues. Nevertheless, Facebook likely realizes that there are going to be plenty of privacy questions and addressed some of them head-on. The biggest admission is that Facebook says it will not be using any data stored locally on the Oculus headset, including images from the device&#8217;s cameras to target ads. It also says, somewhat less emphatically, that there are &#8220;no plans to use movement data to target ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook is likely realizing that it probably should&#8217;ve published a blog post years ago declaring that it was indeed not using smartphone microphones to monitor conversations and target ads (mainly because it has access to better personal information via adtech data partners anyway, but I digress) before those narratives took off. Facebook specifically notes it doesn&#8217;t use audio conversations on the headset for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Virtual reality has been a labor of future-minded thinking for Facebook. Since the beginning, it has spent billions bankrolling the ecosystem and this move seems to signal that it believes its wandered over some sort of adoption hump and are nearing the time to start more aggressively monetizing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Growth marketer and investor Susan Su says that after the pandemic, startup founders will need to develop a mentality that places growth at the center of company strategy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth leaders used to build key relationships across a company while working together in a real-life office. Those relationships could carry over through the pandemic, but let’s say you’re a new company and you’re remote-first.</p>
<p>How do you build this complex collaboration from scratch?</p>
<p>Growth marketer and investor Susan Su tells us that the solution is not just more software tools. In the interview below, she says that after the pandemic, startup founders will need to develop a mentality that places growth at the center of company strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Consultants and agencies can be great additions to this effort, especially if they have previously solved the types of problems you face. (In fact, TechCrunch is asking founders who have worked with growth marketers to share a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this survey</a>. We’ll use your answers to find more experts to interview.)</p>
<p>Su is currently the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susansu/">head of portfolio strategy for Sound Ventures,</a> previously a growth leader at Stripe and the first hire at Reforge. She also shared a few thoughts on market opportunities after the pandemic in the full interview below. E-commerce is mainstream for good, she says, even as we all try to step away from screens more often. However, many social and mobile sectors are mature, and it’s going to be even harder for startups to compete as real-world activities absorb more time.</p>
<p>Don’t forget: Susan Su will also appear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">at our Early Stage virtual event on July 8</a> (and answer questions directly).</p>
<p><strong>How are you seeing startups manage changes in user engagement as more people exit pandemic lockdowns and adjust their daily lives?</strong></p>
<p>As we exit the pandemic, I expect that we&#8217;ll see a natural and obvious spike in some consumer activity that will roll up to midsized businesses and enterprises. Just like with the onset of the pandemic, we&#8217;ll see uneven results across sectors:</p>
<p>E-commerce boomed during the pandemic but was really an augmentation of an already-accelerating trend toward digital commerce and streamlined logistics. I don&#8217;t think we backtrack from e-commerce because habit formation around online shopping has been building for years; we would be backtracking to an age long before 2020, and that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>New social-mobile experiences also boomed during the pandemic, but there&#8217;s still a valid question around whether 15 months or so is enough time to become part of the ingrained infrastructure of daily life. We are living in an age of mature platforms, so every new service is stealing time away from an existing service. As with pre-pandemic growth, their success rests upon fast-accumulating network effects and great, sticky core product experience. Now that we have parks, friends and dinners out calling to us again, it&#8217;s a real test of how compelling some of these new value propositions really are, and whether they can continue to demonstrate their relevance in a more hybridized online-offline world.</p>
<p>That said, the pandemic was an enormous constraint on human society and [the] economy, and these kinds of constraints often breed innovation that doesn&#8217;t go away. We will evolve, but we can never go back. It sounds cheesy but it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><strong>Some aspects of the pandemic, like remote work, appear to have radically changed certain industries. How will these societal changes impact how the typical startup thinks about growth?</strong></p>
<p>Growth will always be growth — that is, a process of iterative experimentation to identify and solve customer problems, and then scale those solutions in order to reach and convert bigger and bigger audiences. Platform changes like iOS 14 or Facebook&#8217;s periodic algorithm adjustments will have a bigger impact in the near term on the technical functioning of growth, and these aren&#8217;t specifically pandemic-related.</p>
<p>One area to watch is how growth teams are built and operated. Growth is a horizontal function that touches many different parts of the org, including product, engineering, marketing, comms and design. Many startup teams have already been working with collaboration tools even while they sat in the same office, but growth is about more than just using tools. The most effective growth leaders succeed by building relationships across the organization; it&#8217;s like the fable of Stone Soup — you&#8217;re creating this meal that will feed everyone, but you also need each person to bring a pinch of salt, or a dash of pepper, or one carrot, and that requires socialization and relationship-building. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see how new growth leaders onboard remote-only teams and what approaches they take to this &#8220;networking&#8221; need within the function.</p>
<p><strong>From the days of growth hacking on social platforms, growth marketing is now an established part of the world. But it’s not necessarily the main expertise of a startup founder, even if it needs to be. So, how should they think about addressing growth marketing in 2021? What are the essentials they should do in their roles?</strong></p>
<p>Every founder needs to have a growth mentality. They don&#8217;t need to memorize all the right buttons to push in an ads dashboard, but they need to be familiar and comfortable with the core work of gap-finding. That said, founders are by definition entrepreneurial — their company exists because they saw an opportunity that no one else did, and this is the fundamental work of growth as well.</p>
<p>Founders will fail if they adopt a mentality that someone else can or should do it for them. The founder&#8217;s job is to supply ambition and opinions, and then magnetize high-quality talent to come and pull the levers and bring their creative vision to life. There are many people who can <em>do</em> growth marketing — that is, they know how the platforms work, they understand the rules and the playbooks. But there are very few who can come up with truly visionary strategies that change the game altogether — those people become founders, and those companies become household names. So for a founder, I&#8217;d say the most important growth work is to continue to know your market and customer better than anyone else in the whole world, have an opinion about what&#8217;s missing, and work to bring the best talent to come in alongside you and be a thought partner, not just a button pusher.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>With limited resources, how should early-stage companies think about what to focus on?</strong></p>
<p>This is going to depend on the goals of your company. Are you planning to raise money and need to demonstrate certain KPIs? Are you bootstrapping and need to keep the lights on? Resources should always be allocated to the most strategic purposes, with the longest-term view you can afford. For some companies, this could mean forgoing revenue to focus on viral or word-of-mouth-driven user acquisition to demonstrate to future investors that there&#8217;s something special here. For other companies, perhaps in lower volume categories like enterprise, it&#8217;s about bringing a few strategic logos into the family as a signal to later customers and other stakeholders, including future employees and investors.</p>
<p>One thing that early-stage companies should always be focused on is building a top-shelf employer brand. You will only ever be as good as the talent you attract to your company, and interestingly growth can actually play a role in this. The best designers, engineers and product people are often flowing toward the companies that have the best growth. In that way, it&#8217;s a highly strategic role and function.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong?</strong></p>
<p>You can&#8217;t truly outsource growth or any other core function; you can&#8217;t tack on customer acquisition after product development. At the end of the day, if you really think about it, all a company is, is a customer-acquisition engine. This needs to be core; wake up every day and think about growth, not just to hit revenue or user KPIs, but to build the company that the best people are clamoring to work at. It&#8217;s not about finding someone sufficient to solve your near-term problems; it&#8217;s about framing problems in a way that&#8217;s so compelling to the most creative, hardest-working people so that they can&#8217;t get it out of their heads. Go for talent moonshots, and figure out how to close them. The rest will fall in line from there.</p>
<p><strong>When should a founder feel comfortable getting help from an outside expert or agency?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime. Agencies are great. They are an extension of your talent, and the best agencies aren&#8217;t selling you — they have to be sold on your problem because they have their pick of companies just like yours. That&#8217;s the agency or outside expert you want to work with, because they&#8217;ll have a priceless perspective from the other best-in-class founders and teams they&#8217;ve worked with that they can bring to your challenge. Any agency can run Facebook ads (it&#8217;s not rocket science), but you want to find the team that&#8217;s solved the gnarliest problems for your hero companies. Then you&#8217;ll get not just an ads manager, but a teacher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-tools-features-nurture-community/">introduced</a> a new set of tools aimed at helping Facebook Group administrators get a better handle on their online communities and, potentially, help keep conversations from going off the rails. Among the more interesting new tools is a machine-learning-powered feature that alerts admins to potentially unhealthy conversations taking place in their group. Another lets the admin slow down the pace of a heated conversation, by limiting how often group members can post.</p>
<p>Facebook Groups are today a significant reason why people continue to use the social network. Today, there are &#8220;tens of millions&#8221; of groups, that are managed by over 70 million active admins and moderators worldwide, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The company for years has been working to roll out better tools for these group owners, who often get overwhelmed by the administrative responsibilities that come with running an online community at scale. As a result, many admins give up the job and leave groups to run somewhat unmanaged &#8212; thus allowing them to turn into breeding grounds for misinformation, spam and abuse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook last fall tried to address this problem by rolling out new group policies to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-tries-to-clean-up-groups-with-new-policies/">crack down on groups without an active admin</a>, among other things. Of course, the company&#8217;s preference would be to keep groups running and growing by making them easier to operate.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where today&#8217;s new set of features come in.</p>
<p>A new dashboard called Admin Home will centralize admin tools, settings and features in one place, as well as present &#8220;pro tips&#8221; that suggest other helpful tools tailored to the group&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167072" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167072" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167072" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=680,349 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=1536,789 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/04_Admin-Home-2.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167072" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Another new Admin Assist feature will allow admins to automatically moderate comments in their groups by setting up criteria that can restrict comments and posts more proactively, instead of forcing admins to go back after the fact and delete them, which can be problematic &#8212; especially after a discussion has been underway and members are invested in the conversation.</p>
<p>For example, admins can now restrict people from posting if they haven&#8217;t had a Facebook account for very long or if they had recently violated the group&#8217;s rules. Admins can also automatically decline posts that contain specific promotional content (perhaps MLM links! Hooray!) and then share feedback with the author of the post automatically about why those posts aren&#8217;t allowed.</p>
<p>Admins can also take advantage of suggested preset criteria from Facebook to help with limiting spam and managing conflict.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/03_Admin-Assist.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>One notable update is a new moderation alert type dubbed &#8220;conflict alerts.&#8221; This feature, currently in testing, will notify admins when a potentially contentious or unhealthy conversation is taking place in the group, Facebook says. This would allow an admin to quickly take an action &#8212; like turning off comments, limiting who could comment, removing a post, or however else they would want to approach the situation.</p>
<p>Conflict alerts are powered by machine learning, Facebook explains. Its machine-learning model looks at multiple signals, including reply time and comment volume to determine if engagement between users has or might lead to negative interactions, the company says.</p>
<p>This is sort of like an automated expansion on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community/using-key-groups-tools/how-to-use-keyword-alerts/">Keyword Alerts</a> feature many admins already use to look for certain topics that lead to contentious conversations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167068" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167068" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167068" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/06_Conflict-Alerts.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167068" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>A related feature, also new, would allow admins to also limit how often specific members could comment, or how often comments could be added to posts admins select.</p>
<p>When enabled, members can leave one comment every five minutes. The idea here is that forcing users to pause and consider their words amid a heated debate could lead to more civilized conversations. We&#8217;ve seen this concept enacted on other social networks, as well &#8212; such as with Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/twitter-retweet-prompt-android/">nudges</a> to read articles before retweeting, or those that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/twitter-rolls-out-improved-reply-prompts-to-cut-down-on-harmful-tweets/">flag potentially harmful replies</a>, giving you a chance to reedit your post.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167067" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167067" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/05_Comment-Slowdown.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook, however, has largely embraced engagement on its platform, even when it&#8217;s not leading to positive interactions or experiences. Though small, this particular feature is an admission that building a healthy online community means sometimes people shouldn&#8217;t be able to immediately react and comment with whatever thought first popped into their head.</p>
<p>Additionally, Facebook is testing tools that allow admins to temporarily limit activity from certain group members.</p>
<p>If used, admins will be able to determine how many posts (between one and nine posts) per day a given member may share, and for how long that limit should be in effect for (every 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days or 28 days). Admins will also be able to determine how many comments (between one and 30 comments, in five-comment increments) per hour a given member may share, and for how long that limit should be in effect (also every 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days or 28 days).</p>
<p>Along these same lines of building healthier communities, a new member summary feature will give admins an overview of each member&#8217;s activity on their group, allowing them to see how many times they&#8217;ve posted and commented, have had posts removed or have been muted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/07_Member-Summary.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook doesn&#8217;t say how admins are to use this new tool, but one could imagine admins taking advantage of the detailed summary to do the occasional cleanup of their member base by removing bad actors who continually disrupt discussions. They could also use it to locate and elevate regular contributors without violations to moderator roles, perhaps.</p>
<p>Admins will also be able to tag their group rules in comment sections, disallow certain post types (e.g., Polls or Events), and submit an appeal to Facebook to re-review decisions related to group violations, if in error.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167075" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167075" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/11_Rule-Tagging.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Of particular interest, though a bit buried amid the slew of other news, is the return of Chats, which was previously announced.</p>
<p>Facebook had abruptly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/crd5ar/chats_in_facebook_groups_are_going_away_on_22/">removed</a> Chat functionality back in 2019, possibly due to <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/facebook-is-removing-its-group-chats-feature-to-limit-spammers/561141/">spam</a>, some had speculated. (Facebook said it was product infrastructure.) As before, Chats can have up to 250 people, including active members and those who opted into notifications from the chats. Once this limit is reached, other members will not be able to engage with that specific chat room until existing active participants either leave the chat or opt out of notifications.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook group members can start, find and engage in Chats with others within Facebook Groups instead of using Messenger. Admins and moderators can also have their own chats.</p>
<p>Notably, this change follows on the heels of growth from messaging-based social networks, like IRL, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/messaging-social-network-irl-hits-unicorn-status-with-softbank-led-170m-series-c/">new unicorn (due to its $1.17 billion valuation)</a>, as well as the growth seen by other messaging apps, like Telegram, Signal and other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">alternative social networks.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167069" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167069" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/09_Pinned-Comments.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Along with this large set of new features, Facebook also made changes to some existing features, based on feedback from admins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now testing pinned comments and introduced a new &#8220;admin announcement&#8221; post type that notifies group members of the important news (if notifications are being received for that group).</p>
<p>Plus, admins will be able to share feedback when they decline group members.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167064" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167064" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/01_Admin-Announcement-Notification.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The changes are rolling out across Facebook Groups globally in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few people are more closely tapped into the innovations in the transportation space than investors. They’re paying close attention to what startups and tech companies are doing to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle technology, electrification, micromobility, robotics and so much more.</p>
<p>Clara Brenner, co-founder and managing partner of Urban Innovation Fund; Quin Garcia, the managing director of AutoTech Ventures; and Rachel Holt, co-founder and general partner of Construct Capital talked (and debated) about how the pandemic affected the venture world and deal flow; why AutoTech Ventures was hesitant to invest in micromobility; on how to incentivize micromobility; and, of course, their take on the rise of mergers with special purpose acquisition companies as a route to going public. They also shared their thoughts on the most overlooked opportunities they are interested in within the transportation space.</p>
<h2>How the COVID-19 pandemic shaped VC</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic turned the world upside down, and VC was no exception. Holt and Garcia explained some of the effects they saw on startups &#8212; both new and existing &#8212; over the past year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Holt: There was enough dislocation in transportation, and in some other areas, that happened through COVID, that it&#8217;s just the time when, whether it&#8217;s buyers or cities or others are just evaluating what the new world order should look like. And I think that just creates a lot of opportunity. … When you have a shock to the system like COVID, it creates just an opportunity for everyone, whether it&#8217;s inside companies, whether it&#8217;s founders, or whether it&#8217;s cities and governments and other entities to take a step back and say, OK, what do we want the next five years to look like? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:18, 4:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today it&#8217;s updating and expanding its digital safety and citizenship curriculum called <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us">Be Internet Awesome</a>, which is aimed at helping school-aged children learn to navigate the internet responsibly. First introduced four years ago, the curriculum now reaches 30 countries and millions of kids, says Google. In the update rolling out today, Google has added nearly a dozen more lessons for parents and educators that tackle areas like online gaming, search engines, video consumption, online empathy, cyberbullying and more.</p>
<p>The company says it had commissioned the <a href="http://unh.edu/ccrc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://unh.edu/ccrc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdzMnl4n6ZRfl2R4-WZwTzJa3OAQ">University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center</a> to evaluate its existing program, which had last received a significant update back in 2019, when it added lessons that focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/googles-new-media-literacy-program-teaches-kids-how-to-spot-disinformation-and-fake-news/">teaching kids to spot disinformation and fake news.</a></p>
<p>The review found that program did help children in areas like dealing with cyberbullying, online civility and website safety, but recommended improvements in other areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google then partnered with online safety experts like <a href="https://www.cfchildren.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cfchildren.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEq3vKgqEgHiaBxZ1P7ULu0EcbPbg">Committee for Children</a> and <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1691541" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/81-1691541&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyPcqvPKReywSd2ACD3cbPLkyoRw">The Net Safety Collaborative</a> to revise its teaching materials. As a result, it now has lessons tailored to specific age groups and grade levels, and has expanded its array of subjects and set of family resources.</p>

<p>The new lessons include guidance around online gaming, search engines and video consumption, as well as social-emotional learning lessons aimed at helping students address cyberbullying and online harassment.</p>
<p>For example, some of the new lessons discuss search media literacy &#8212; meaning, learning how to use search engines like Google&#8217;s and evaluating the links and results it returns, as a part of an update to the program&#8217;s existing media literacy materials.</p>
<p>Other lessons address issues like practicing empathy online, showing kindness, as well as what to do when you see something upsetting or inappropriate, including cyberbullying.</p>
<p>Concepts related to online gaming are weaved into the new lessons, too, as, today, kids have a lot of their social interactions in online games which often feature ways to interact with other players in real time and chat.</p>
<p>Here, kids are presented with ideas related to being able to verify an online gamer&#8217;s identity &#8212; are they really another kid, for example? The materials also explain what sort of private information should not be shared with people online.</p>

<p>Among the new family resources, the updated curriculum now points parents to the recently launched online hub, <a href="https://families.google/">families.google</a>, which offers a number of tips and information about tools to help families manage their tech usage.</p>
<p>For example, Google updated its <a href="https://families.google/articles/tips-family-link/">Family Link</a> app that lets parents set controls around which apps can be used and when, and view activity reports on screen-time usage. It also rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens/">parental control features on YouTube</a> earlier this year, aimed at families with tweens and teens who are too old for a YouTube Kids account, but still too young for an entirely unsupervised experience.</p>
<p>Google says the updated <a href="http://g.co/beinternetawesome" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://g.co/beinternetawesome&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623936185119000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHflwfbyzkrRbuDIlWbb1Q3DsDdPA">curriculum</a> is available today to parents, families, teachers and educators, via the <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623945522828000&amp;usg=AFQjCNES0Bn8FdcL_Hz-NPg0TDytKGceiQ">Be Internet Awesome</a> website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Multiple suspects believed to be linked to the Clop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/are-we-overestimating-the-ransomware-threat/">ransomware</a> gang have been detained in Ukraine after a joint operation from law enforcement agencies in Ukraine, South Korea, and the United States.</p>
<p>The Cyber Police Department of the National Police of Ukraine <a href="https://www.npu.gov.ua/news/kiberzlochini/kiberpolicziya-vikrila-xakerske-ugrupovannya-u-rozpovsyudzhenni-virusu-shifruvalnika-ta-nanesenni-inozemnim-kompaniyam-piv-milyarda-dolariv-zbitkiv/">confirmed</a> that six arrests were made after searches at 21 residences in the capital Kyiv and nearby regions. While it&#8217;s unclear whether the defendants are affiliates or core developers of the ransomware operation, they are accused of running a &#8220;double extortion&#8221; scheme, in which victims who refuse to pay the ransom are threatened with the leak of data stolen from their networks prior to their files being encrypted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was established that six defendants carried out attacks of malicious software such as &#8216;ransomware&#8217; on the servers of American and [South] Korean companies,&#8221; alleged Ukraine&#8217;s national police force in a statement.</p>
<p>The police also seized equipment from the alleged Clop ransomware gang, said to behind total financial damages of about $500 million. This includes computer equipment, several cars — including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> and Mercedes, and 5 million Ukrainian Hryvnia (around $185,000) in cash. The authorities also claim to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang members to launch previous attacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, law enforcement has managed to shut down the infrastructure from which the virus spreads and block channels for legalizing criminally acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>These attacks first began in February 2019, when the group attacked four Korean companies and encrypted 810 internal services and personal computers. Since, Clop — often styled as &#8220;Cl0p&#8221; — has been linked to a number of high-profile ransomware attacks. These include the breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/execupharm-clop-ransomware/">U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm</a> in April 2020 and the attack on South Korean e-commerce giant E-Land in November that forced the retailer to close almost half of its stores.</p>
<p>Clop is also linked to the ransomware attack and data breach at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/accellion/">Accellion</a>, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider’s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software to steal data from dozens of its customers. Victims of this breach include Singaporean telecom Singtel, law firm Jones Day, grocery store chain Kroger, and cybersecurity firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/qualys/">Qualys</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the dark web portal that Clop uses to share stolen data is still up and running, although it hasn&#8217;t been updated for several weeks. However, law enforcement typically replaces the targets&#8217; website with their own logo in the event of a successful takedown, which suggests that members of the gang could still be active.</p>
<p>“The Cl0p operation has been used to disrupt and extort organizations globally in a variety of sectors including telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, aerospace, and technology,&#8221; said John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant&#8217;s threat intelligence unit. &#8220;The actor FIN11 has been strongly associated with this operation, which has included both ransomware and extortion, but it is unclear if the arrests included FIN11 actors or others who may also be associated with the operation.”</p>
<p>Hultquist said the efforts of the Ukrainian police “are a reminder that the country is a strong partner for the U.S. in the fight against cybercrime and authorities there are making the effort to deny criminals a safe harbor.”</p>
<p>The alleged perpetrators face up to eight years in prison on charges of unauthorized interference in the work of computers, automated systems, computer networks, or telecommunications networks and laundering property obtained by criminal means.</p>
<p>News of the arrests comes as international law enforcement turns up the heat on ransomware gangs. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside">it had seized most of the ransom paid</a> to members of DarkSide by Colonial Pipeline.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are often thought to be an issue that can be solved by intuition by some segment of the HR team. However, in reality, it needs to come from a data-driven approach that encompasses the entire workforce.</p>
<p>The primary aspect that companies usually look to, in terms of treating employees fairly, is remuneration. However, having the conversation and agreeing on the need for equality doesn’t mean it will be achieved on an organizational scale.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Particular attention should be paid to addressing inequities in the areas of attracting and hiring candidates, integration, performance assessment, compensation and promotion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/next-generation-global-research-when-women-thrive-2020.html">survey from Mercer</a> that included data from more than 1,000 companies in 54 countries, 81% agreed that it was important to have a plan for advancing gender equality, but just 42% actually had one in place. This points toward a tokenism attitude indicating companies are happy to talk around the issue without addressing it directly.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that women make up roughly half of all college-educated workers in the United States, they are underrepresented in positions of power &#8212; just <a href="https://www.holoniq.com/notes/women-ceos-leaders.-the-global-state-of-play.-2021/">8% of Fortune 500 companies</a> are led by women, and, incredibly, just 1% by women of color. Furthermore, the last U.S. census revealed that women who are employed full time are paid on average <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T#men-have-earned-more-than-women-since-1979-the-first-year-with-available-data-1">17% less than men</a>.</p>
<p>While there have been steps to ensure equal pay, such as Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2018/10/government-of-canada-introduces-historic-proactive-pay-equity-legislation.html">Pay Equity Act</a>, which states that men and women in the public sector should be paid equally, it does not cover the private sector. Given that the Institute for Women’s Policy Research <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T#men-have-earned-more-than-women-since-1979-the-first-year-with-available-data-1">estimates</a> that equal pay will not be reached until 2059, there is still plenty of work to be done.</p>
<p>Particular attention should be paid to addressing inequities in the areas of attracting and hiring candidates, integration, performance assessment, compensation and promotion. Companies need to think about initiatives that are supported by objective tools to drive progress, identify problems and strategize solutions. This is where data can be a great tool to provide insight into DEI: by highlighting shortcomings and areas where there is bias.</p>
<h2>Start with data collection</h2>
<p>The first step is to create a data set so that tangible metrics can be utilized and turned into actionable decisions. To do this, diversity and inclusion officers need to be given the opportunity to weed out bias.</p>
<p>Obviously, the data would drive decisions on areas such as compensation. But far too often, director-level discussions don’t involve the talent acquisition team. To eradicate the pay gap and ensure compensation is equalized on individual merit, this needs to change. Line managers and talent acquisition teams have the best knowledge of their staff and are well placed to procure the right information to help senior managers make equitable decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors Co. has yet again upped the amount it says it will spend on electric and autonomous vehicle investments, saying Wednesday that it would spend $35 billion through 2025 &#8212; an $8 billion increase from its previous plan announced in November 2020.</p>
<p>The company has set a target to bring 30 new EVs to the global market by 2025 and to transition to all-zero-emission by 2035. With the new investment, GM said it will add new electric commercial trucks to its North American plan, as well as build additional U.S. assembly capacity for electric SUVs.</p>
<p>Beyond building out a large portfolio of new electric models, the automaker has taken a multipronged approach in its quest to lead the EV revolution: it is also investing in two new battery cell plants under its joint venture with LG Chem, dubbed Ultium Cells LLC; and it’s poured funding into Cruise, its autonomous driving arm that it purchased for majority ownership in 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news was announced one day after Cruise said it had tapped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion line of credit</a> from the OEM’s financial arm as it prepares for commercialization of its Origin electric and autonomous vehicle. Commercial production of the Origin is anticipated to begin in 2023.</p>

<p>GM also manufactures hydrogen fuel cells under its HYDROTEC joint initiative with Honda. It confirmed Wednesday that it will launch the third-generation HYDROTEC cells by mid-decade. The automaker has partnership agreements with heavy truck developer Navistar and Liebherr-Aerospace, which is developing hydrogen fuel cell power systems for aircraft.</p>
<p>The company also said yesterday it would supply fuel cells and EV batteries to Wabtec Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based company developing the world’s first battery locomotive.</p>
<p>“GM is targeting annual global EV sales of more than 1 million by 2025, and we are increasing our investment to scale faster because we see momentum building in the United States for electrification, along with customer demand for our product portfolio,” CEO Mary Barra said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ford announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">similar increase in EV investment</a> last month, when it said it would invest $30 billion by 2025, up from $22 billion by 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hbcu.vc/">HBCUvc</a>, a nonprofit organization that wants<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/18/hbcu-vc-trains-students-become-venture-capitalists/"> to diversify the world of venture</a> by rooting itself in historically Black colleges and universities, nearly shut down last year. Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/hadiyahdotme?lang=en">Hadiyah Mujhid</a> met with her team, an entirely Black and Latinx staff, and warned them that they only had two months left before she would have to shut down the three-year operation.</p>
<p>One week after that conversation, George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis. His death prompted global Black Lives Matter protests and a nationwide reckoning with racism. In tech, it led to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/"> a rush of venture firms publicly pledging</a> to back more Black founders, trying to make up for a history of inequality in allocation of dollars.</p>
<p>The wave of support resulted in HBCUvc landing its biggest one-day unsolicited donation that it ever saw, $40,000. In the year since, the nonprofit was able to double its budget and team, and tripled its impact by launching programs in Baltimore, Alabama and Chicago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P5txmXTARc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/">Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venture firms rush to find ways to support Black founders and investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/diverse-startups-and-investors-matter/embed/#?secret=P5txmXTARc" data-secret="P5txmXTARc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And now, HBCUvc has raised a debut capital arm that will invest non-dilutive capital in Black, Indigenous and Latinx early-stage entrepreneurs. The $1 million fund was raised from a group of philanthropic investors, including the Mark Cuban Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and Google for Startups.</p>
<p>“It’s a very weird feeling to know that all of this, and the impetus for all this was because off unjustly murder,” Mujhid says, about one year later. “It sounds cold, but [my advisors] say that sometimes it takes a tragedy to spark a shift in how we think and do things. And so [I’m] recognizing this as an extra opportunity to shift the industry.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166902" style="width: 842px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166902" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2166902" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg" alt="" width="832" height="555" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/HBCUvc-Staff.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166902" class="wp-caption-text">HBCUvc staff. Image: HBCUvc</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Teaching capital </strong></h2>
<p>The investment vehicle, dubbed the Venture Capital Lab Fund, is different from a traditional venture capital fund. Because it offers non-dilutive financing, HBCUvc does not take equity from a startup in which it invests. The checks aren’t donations either, Mujhid said. The teaching capital goes to for-profit entrepreneurs and the nonprofit does not get a tax write-off for it.</p>
<p>Instead, Mujhid thinks the best way to describe the Venture Capital Lab Fund is “teaching capital.” Similar to how teaching hospitals give aspiring doctors a way to practice and learn their craft before formally entering the field, the fund wants to do that for aspiring investors.</p>
<p>The fund will give HBCUvc&#8217;s some 230 venture fellows, all from underrepresented backgrounds, check-writing experience. Fellows are invited to identify an entrepreneur, write an investment memo and submit to the HBCUvc investment committee, a board of partners as well as alumni community members.</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to give as many of our fellows who go through our program an opportunity to work to develop a track record right now,” she said.</p>
<p>While the fund has no specific number of checks that it plans to write, around half the capital will be allocated to founders who are tied to historically Black colleges and universities.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneurs that we see within our community are kind of eager to accept funding and sometimes they&#8217;re going into deals too early, and sometimes they&#8217;re taking funding and giving up equity way too soon,” Mujhid said. “This could be an opportunity to take funding, without giving away equity.”</p>
<p>The checks are meant to replace the “angel round” with an average size of $5,000 for student founders, and $10,000 for nonstudent founders.</p>
<p>A wave of new investment vehicles for Black and underrepresented founders has been growing in recent weeks. Google for Startups <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStartups/status/1405151042606673922?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">announced</a> today that it is launching a $5 million Black Founders fund that will offer $100,000 in non-dilutive funding to 50 Black founders from within its program and community. Last week, Screendoor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/06/09/screendoor-raises-50-million-to-back-underrepresented-vcs/?sh=43bfbbc92ba1">launched</a> as a $50 million fund-of-funds to back underrepresented, emerging investors. And last month, Collab Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">closed its $50 million debut fund that</a> will be invested solely in Black founders.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of organizations right now that are starting funds [with] the primary goal of supporting founders,” Mujhid said. “And that’s a goal of ours, but we’re hoping to have a ripple effect of training and really providing onramps for the next best in-class investors&#8230;and in order to do that, they have to have a training vehicle.”</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge to that progress, she says, is the return to in-person work as the pandemic fades away.</p>
<h2><strong>In-person is out </strong></h2>
<p>“When we were working with partners pre-COVID, investors would say that [they] need someone who&#8217;s based in San Francisco,” she said. “And we’d say, good luck because most of our demographic isn’t really here.” In contrast, going online opened up programming for the nonprofit because it removed geographic barriers. It recently onboarded its largest intern class to date: 45 interns working at 40 venture capital firms across America.</p>
<p>Now, as firms open back up, she’s worried about the recreation of geographic barriers, and if they will negatively affect opportunities for underrepresented folks who want to get experience in the industry. The nonprofit has begun advocacy work on educating tech professionals on how racial barriers intertwine with geographic barriers. Part of HBCUvc’s push will be around asking companies to rethink their policies as they open up, specifically by holding true to their commitment of diversity.</p>
<p>Despite this, remote work came with its own equity issues. Funding for female founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/">dropped to 2017 levels</a> as many check-writers turned to existent, largely male and white, networks while investing remotely. <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/highlighting-notable-funding-to-black-founders-in-2020/">According to Crunchbase data</a>, U.S. companies raised nearly $150 billion in venture capital, and of that, less than 1% ($1 billion) went to African-American or Black startup founders.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Funding for female founders falls to 2017 levels as pandemic shakes up the VC market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/funding-for-female-founders-falls-to-2017-levels-as-pandemic-shakes-up-the-vc-market/embed/#?secret=VayY5dP6gy" data-secret="VayY5dP6gy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the pledges that investors made? While HBCUvc was able to “shift the trajectory of its programming” thanks to an outpour of support, Mujhid thinks that a lot of the initial buzz around backing Black founders was “unfortunately, a knee-jerk reaction.”</p>
<p>“I was seeing our name everywhere,” she said, describing the series of memos and tweets that firms began putting out to show their commitment to diversity. Half the mentions came from people that HBCUvc had never talked to before. “You are riding this tragedy out and you are trading on our name unethically,” she said. Some of the interest turned into partnerships, some of it didn’t.</p>
<p>As they built out new programs based on an increased budget, a concern of Mujhid’s, then and now, was what it looks like if people shift priorities, or fall off their commitments. But for now, she feels like they are riding a fortunate wave, one that has the potential to make Black founders and investors a sturdy part of tech’s dollars and deals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joining us onstage as a judge for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>&#8216;s Startup Battlefield will be Yasmin Razavi, general partner at Spark Capital. Her engineering background and fintech chops should make for incisive questions for the founders presenting.</p>
<p>Razavi invests in growth-stage enterprise, fintech and developer companies, but her background is until fairly recently an engineering-focused one. She grew up in Tehran, studied engineering at the University of Toronto and got her MBA at Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>A stint at McKinsey eventually led to being a product manager at Snap, where she built the tech behind the app&#8217;s monetization stack. In 2017 she joined Spark, and since then has led investments in Marqueta, Deel, Rapyd, Niantic, Capitolis and Earnin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We recently had Razavi at Disrupt as a panelist, and of course if you&#8217;re an Extra Crunch subscriber you can watch the whole thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getting-to-the-growth-stage/">here</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ultimately anyone who wants to be a shareholder or investor in your business wants to understand the unit economics of your business,&#8221; she said during the  panel. &#8220;For me, there’s all sorts of fancy metrics being thrown around; ultimately they all come down to what is the unit economics, and what is the payback I can expect when I invest in growth?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Razavi&#8217;s philosophy is go to market and out-execute the competition, then capitalize on that success. Why anyone would want to do the opposite is hard to say, but the point is to move quickly and decisively as early as possible so that making money later is a natural consequence rather than a scramble.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For contemporary artists, attaching work to the blockchain in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) may seem like a secure and verifiable way to sell art online.</p>
<p>In some ways, it is. Blockchain inherently records time-stamped data on all transactions, with a permanent indication of ownership across a distributed ledger. A look inside a blockchain’s transactions will provide all the information needed about when an NFT was traded, who was involved in the transaction and how much was spent.</p>
<p>But the reality of NFT ownership is much more complicated than one might imagine. As a new crypto asset class, NFTs appear to exist almost unbound by current regulatory systems. But when combined with art, there are overlaps to consider. Understanding the legal pitfalls of the contemporary NFT ecosystem is the first step in unlocking its potential.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Does copyright exist on the blockchain?</h2>
<p>High hopes abound for the potential of NFTs to serve as copyright alternatives, with many believing them to be copyrights themselves. When viewed at face value, it’s easy to understand the confusion.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The NFT purchaser owns nothing more than a unique hash on the blockchain with a transactional record and a hyperlink to the file of the artwork.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The truth is, NFTs are just tokens that represent an asset, completely separate from the assets themselves. Because every NFT represents a unique asset, a single NFT can’t be duplicated while maintaining the same value as the original. Many equate this exclusive form of ownership with ownership of the work itself, but the distinction must be emphasized.</p>
<p>This misconception goes further. The range of possibilities for what can be an NFT coincides surprisingly well with works eligible for copyright. While every jurisdiction defines “works” in different ways, none stray too far from the essentials. In Canada, for example, <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html">copyright</a> protection extends to literary, artistic, dramatic or musical works in addition to performances, recordings and other related works. Creators need not apply for these protections — the state provides them <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html">inherently</a> upon the creation of the work.</p>
<p>Naturally, this protection is guaranteed for the original work that an NFT represents. When artwork is created and auctioned on an NFT marketplace, the copyright functions almost exactly as it would in an in-person scenario, with the copyright retained by the artist. But a lack of copyright trading infrastructure that complies with international law makes the exchange of NFT copyrights impossible on current platforms.</p>
<p>So unless an external agreement is made between the artist and the buyer, the bundle of copyrights to an NFT still belong to the original artist. The NFT purchaser owns nothing more than a unique hash on the blockchain with a transactional record and a hyperlink to the file of the artwork.</p>
<h2>Without legal parameters, fraud is inevitable</h2>
<p>The issue of NFT copyright tracking gets even trickier when considering the potential for theft and fraud. In order to be added to the blockchain, NFTs must be “signed” by the uploader in a process known as “minting.” Similar to a painter&#8217;s signature on their painting, this feature is intended to link the NFT to its creator. Things can go wrong when minters lie about their identity, which is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408">not uncommon</a> across many NFT platforms.</p>
<p>The issue stems from the lack of a strong legal framework in the NFT market. One can mint a tweet, art piece or even a <a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-560000-1945679">gif of Nyan Cat</a> without being the actual creator on some platforms. As a result, many artists have reported seeing their art being <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408#:~:text=Many%20artists%20around%20the%20world,work%20posted%20on%20social%20media.">stolen and sold</a> in NFT form without their consent in what would clearly be a copyright violation in the traditional art marketplace.</p>
<p>This issue is particularly pervasive among NFT tweet exchanges. A Twitter bot known as @tokenizedtweets went on a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-03-16/nfts-artists-report-their-work-is-being-stolen-and-sold/13249408">minting spree</a> earlier this year, sending shockwaves throughout Twitter and the NFT community. Its policy of creating NFTs from viral tweets without the author’s consent or even notification caused an outcry from several actors, artists and other creators, provoking responses from names as big as <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamShatner/status/1368645203045720064">William Shatner</a>, who expressed concern about “these @tokenizedtweets stealing content, images I upload and my tweets which are all under my copyright being tokenized and sold without permission.”</p>
<p>Theft and fraud are natural results of platforms that lack a strong legal infrastructure. The actions of @tokenizedtweets, now banned from Twitter, demonstrates this issue well.</p>

<h2>What’s missing? International compliance</h2>
<p>So far, no NFT platforms have ventured into internationally compliant territory for the copyright of art that an NFT sale represents. Doing so would be a tremendous leap for the NFT ecosystem. In addition to minimizing fraud through stronger copyright enforcement, international compliance would allow for tokenized copyright exchange within the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>The groundwork has already been laid thanks to the 1886 <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/">Berne Convention</a>, an international agreement that guarantees standardized copyright protection at the moment a work is created in any of its 179 signatory countries. The treaty was tested in 2014, for example, when Tom Petty sued Sam Smith for copyright infringement over Smith’s hit song, “Stay With Me,” which is almost melodically identical to Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.” The suit and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2015/01/26/sam-smith-stay-with-me-tom-petty-i-wont-back-down/22346051/">settlement</a>, which includes royalties to Petty’s estate, demonstrated the continuing functionality of the Berne Convention.</p>
<p>The 1996 <a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/wct/">WIPO Copyright Treaty</a> formally brought Berne principles into the digital art realm, but many Berne Convention signatories didn’t sign it. With no new treaties on the horizon, the private sector may have to pick up the slack left behind by world governments.</p>
<p>The NFT world still fails to comply with the diversity of copyright law around the world despite the uniformity imposed by international treaties. To move the industry away from speculation and into global functionality, international copyright compliance must be incorporated into this emerging ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I launched a software startup in Iran a few years ago, and I’m happy to say it’s now thriving. We’d like to expand our company in California. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now that President Joe Biden has eliminated the Muslim ban, is it possible to do that? Is the pandemic still standing in the way? Do you have any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Talented in Tehran</strong></p>
<p>Dear Talented,</p>
<p>Yes, it’s possible! Unfortunately, yes, the COVID-19 pandemic is still making the immigration process a bit challenging, but remember, where there’s a will, there’s most often, in immigration law, a way.</p>
<p>On his first day in office in January, Biden rescinded the ban on visas for many majority-Muslim countries, including Iran. The ban had been in place since 2017 and nearly 42,000 visa applications were denied, according to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/presidentialproclamation/PP-9645_Montly-Public-Reporting-January%202021.pdf">U.S. Department of State</a>.</p>
<p>Biden also allowed the bans on the issuance of H-1B, L-1, and J-1 visas and green cards at U.S. embassies and consulates that the previous administration put in place last year to lapse.</p>
<p>That means international startup founders like you and other international talent living outside the United States can start thinking about obtaining these visas and green cards without necessarily requiring exceptions to do so. In a recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/075-latest-biden-immigration-updates/">podcast episode</a>, I talked about these and other immigration-related changes, as well as those promised by the Biden administration. Take a listen to find out more!</p>
<p>As you probably know, most travelers from Iran are currently not allowed entry into the U.S. because of the COVID-19 travel ban, and most U.S. embassies and consulates are not open for routine visa and green card application processing. Because the United States has not had an embassy or consulate in Iran since the Iran hostage crisis of 1979, you and your co-founders should find out which U.S. embassies or consulates are currently processing routine visa and green card applications — and are in countries that are not on the suspended entry list — and apply there. We’re still waiting for detailed information from the State Department on the equivalent of reparations for individuals who were affected by the Muslim ban.</p>
<p>In addition, I recommend that you consult with an experienced immigration attorney who can help you devise an immigration strategy for yourself, your co-founders and your families based on your personal and professional goals. Now, here are a few options for you to consider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy tech continues cooking on gas. To wit: Non-tracking search engine DuckDuckGo has <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgrowing/">just revealed</a> that it beefed up its balance sheet at the back end of last year with $100 million+ in &#8220;mainly secondary investment&#8221; &#8212; from a mix of existing and new investors.</p>
<p>Its blog post name-checks Omers Ventures, Thrive, GP Bullhound, Impact America Fund and WhatsApp founder Brian Acton; inventor of the world wide web Tim Berners-Lee; VC and diversity activist Freada Kapor Klein; and entrepreneur Mitch Kapor as being among the participating investors. So quite the line up.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo said the secondary investment allowed some of its early employees and investors to cash out a chunk of their equity while bolstering its financial position.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although it also says its business &#8212; which has been profitable since 2014 &#8212; is &#8220;thriving&#8221;, reporting that revenues are now running at more than $100 million a year. Hence it not needing to keep dipping into an external investor pot.</p>
<p>Its last VC raise was in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push/">2018</a> when it took in $10 million after being actively pursued by Omers Ventures &#8212; who convinced it to take the money to help support growth objectives (especially internationally).</p>
<p>DDG has a few other metrics to throw around now: Over the last 12 months it said its apps were downloaded over 50 million times &#8212; more than in all prior years combined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also revealed that its monthly search traffic increased 55% and says market share trackers indicate that it grabbed the No. 2 spot for search engine on mobile in a number of countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the Netherlands (<a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america">StatCounter</a>/<a href="https://wiki-search-referrals.wmcloud.org/#referrals/4/N4IgbglgzgrghgGwgLzgFwgewHYgFwhpwBGCApiADTjTxKoY4DKZaG2A5lPqAMaYIEcAA5QyAJUwB3bngBmiMQF9qGALZlkOCgQCiaXgHoAqgBUAwlRByICNGQBOsgNqg0AT2E7CEDVYdkcvg+fqq+ZAAKjlgAJi6gMTAO6Fi4BBEAjACyVlD2wvgAtBmqnt5yCJiYATEgSgC6Km5lwXkOEJz+gcH8MNhoDu5WcLyMaSAdVmCIMGQuIACCMG2IEHBW5nDYcDHr1AByrAAWjkLYcVbG2BD2MQAETET23PXU2Jho+AoIypTNXq0Bh0OF0ggRMNxqCMxsFJtRpghZvMFucHJgILVqBAAPJMKwAdQ6MWkUDuESO2isACEhLwANZUxyDO64kCvEDvT7yRRkBrUKDCJBoeKEFoENrAqwxcLYKCpHqYPoDIb86pc0ABMEcmBqAD6mqZiisHgB4uicylEACo3lBBic14ZHOkuoXnamFqBDq1CQahu+AArE1RaaQBLOtRpRpZbaw2Q4A5eEddU6OB0KKqHOqQJrgtgdfrAoafsaxXH2hbI1ayDacMF7VBHc6IyA3bFgt6QL7/XgAwAGPnliAWvCuHNFgLYR15gsGhzJEvUOTVNToHgh7z2hQwOxTGbeTsm7waOCwALejUTp3Tgj5vVzheQ6wrtd4f7eN1Nz7w/cdlQb4IyAAD2EAIoDlOtqGA0C5ggtJQEwN0UjrAhPydNBdUwORdWEBN0LqQdhA6bAyBiAARGU4JcdkiOwEiYiYNUZ3vCdHzqIA=">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t track our users so we can’t say for sure how many we have, but based on market share estimates, download numbers, and national surveys, we believe there are between 70-100 million DuckDuckGo users,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">looming shift to Google&#8217;s Android choice screen in Europe</a>, where regulators have forced the company to present users of mobile devices that run its OS with rival options when they&#8217;re setting a default search engine, looks likely to further boost DuckDuckGo&#8217;s regional fortunes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yvIEmtqgs4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">Google ditches pay-to-play Android search choice auction for free version after EU pressure</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google ditches pay-to-play Android search choice auction for free version after EU pressure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/embed/#?secret=yvIEmtqgs4" data-secret="yvIEmtqgs4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google will be ditching the current paid auction model &#8212; so rivals which have a valuable alternative proposition for users (like privacy) combined with strong brand awareness (and, well, everyone likes ducks&#8230;) have the best chance yet to take slices out of Google&#8217;s market share.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo&#8217;s blog post confirms it&#8217;ll be dialling up its marketing in Europe and other regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our thriving business also gives us the resources to tell more people there is a simple solution for online privacy they can use right now. Over the last month, we’ve rolled out billboard, radio, and TV ads in 175 metro areas across the U.S., with additional efforts planned for Europe and other countries around the world,&#8221; it notes.</p>
<p>So it look like a good chunk of DDG&#8217;s secondary funding will be spent on growth marketing &#8212; as it seeks to capitalize on rising public attention to online privacy, tracking and creepy ads, itself fuelled by years of data scandals.</p>
<p>Awareness is also now being actively driven by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s recent switch to inform iOS users of third-party app tracking</a> and to give people a simple way to say no &#8212; which includes slick, Cupertino-funded ad campaigns (such as the one below) which are clearly intended to turn and engage mainstream heads&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fair to say it&#8217;s probably never been easier to craft a simple and compelling marketing message around privacy &#8212; and that&#8217;s also a testament to how far privacy tech has come in terms of usability and accessibility.</p>
<p>So, yes, DuckDuckGo&#8217;s business sure looks like it&#8217;s sitting pretty at this juncture of the web&#8217;s evolution. And its blog post talks about &#8220;becoming a household name for simple privacy protection&#8221;. So the scale of its ambition is clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Privacy skeptics have dominated the discussion about online privacy for too long. “Sure people care about privacy, but they’ll never do anything about it.” It’s time to lay this bad take to rest,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>More products are also on the slate from the 13-year veteran privacy player.</p>
<p>It already bolted on tracker-blocking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/duckduckgo-adds-tracker-blocking-to-help-curb-the-wider-surveillance-web/">back in 2018</a> but is looking to go further &#8212; saying that it will be rolling out additional privacy features to what it bills as its &#8220;all-in-one privacy bundle&#8221;, including an email protection tool that will be launched in beta &#8220;in a few weeks&#8221; and which it says will &#8220;give users more privacy without having to get a new inbox&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Later this summer, app tracker blocking will be available in beta for Android devices, allowing users to block app trackers and providing more transparency on what’s happening behind the scenes on their device. And Before the end of the year, we also plan to release a brand-new desktop version of our existing mobile app which people can use as a primary browser,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;By continuing to expand our simple and seamless privacy bundle, we continue to make our product vision, &#8216;Privacy, simplified.&#8217; a reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another trend we&#8217;re seeing in privacy tech: Innovators who have carefully and credibly built up a solid reputation around one type of tech tool (such as search or email) find themselves &#8212; as usage grows &#8212; perfectly positioned to branch out into offering a whole bundle or suite of apps they can wrap in the same protective promise.</p>
<p>Another player, ProtonMail, for example, has morphed into Proton, a privacy-centric company which offers freemium tools for not just end-to-end encrypted email but also cloud storage, calendar and a VPN &#8212; all neatly positioned under its pro-privacy umbrella.</p>
<p>Expect more development momentum as privacy tech continues to accelerate into the mainstream.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By its nature, sales is one of the most social faces of a business, so it&#8217;s no surprise that there are tools being built for sales teams that are tapping into some of the most interesting dynamics of the world of social networking, and that the startups that are doing this most successfully are making a killing.</p>
<p>In the latest example, a startup out of Canada called <a href="https://www.introhive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introhive</a> &#8212; which has built an AI engine that ingests huge amounts of data from across disparate applications to help companies (and specifically anyone in their organization that is selling to someone) to build better &#8220;relationship graphs&#8221; for target organizations &#8212; is announcing $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>Growth equity firm PSG is leading the round, with The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), Evergreen Capital and Mavan Capital Partners also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is not disclosing valuation but CEO and co-founder Jody Glidden tells me the company is doing well. It has raised about $150 million to date and is doubling revenues every year for the last several with a platform used by large enterprises &#8212; PwC, Colliers International, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, Plante Moran and Clark Nexsen are a few of them. Typical deployments range between 10,000 and 100,000 seats &#8212; it&#8217;s not just people with &#8220;sales&#8221; in their job titles using Introhive &#8212; and customer retention is currently at 95%.</p>
<p>The idea for Introhive came as many do to enterprise startup founders: they identify something that doesn&#8217;t quite work as they want it to, and then start a new company to try to fix it. In the case of Glidden, he and Stewart Walchli were at RIM (the old parent of BlackBerry), which had <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/rim-buys-chalk-media-for-231-million/article1067464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a previous startup of theirs called Chalk Media</a>.</p>
<p>Although they had just joined a much bigger company (it was 2008, and BlackBerry was still far from being completely killed off by Google and Apple) Glidden said he was surprised to see how hard it was to tap its vast troves of information to find prospective sales leads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized there were a whole lot of problems with sales people at RIM not able to hit their revenue numbers,&#8221; he recalled, and so they started asking themselves some questions. &#8220;Are they bringing in right lead data? Are they able to be as intelligent as they can be?&#8221; It took some years &#8212; four, exactly &#8212; and perhaps the rise of Facebook and its focus on the &#8220;social graph,&#8221; for them to land on how to articulate the problem. They needed to &#8220;unlock relationship graph in CRM,&#8221; Glidden said.</p>
<p>And Introhive was the company that they formed in 2012 to address that. The company not only provides a way to better leverage CRM-related data to find the best targets for particular products or services, but it also provides analytics to the team to measure how people are doing, and over time also helps predict &#8220;winnability&#8221;.</p>
<p>But that was not immediate: It took several years to build out its AI platform, Glidden said, with a lot of trial and error to ensure that the data that Introhive ingested was structured correctly to match up with other information to yield productive information.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ran into big problems in the first years because there were so many potential systems to tap into, homegrown or otherwise, for certain info. We effectively spent a lot of time building our own version of MuleSoft to fix that,&#8221; he said with a laugh. &#8220;But since it&#8217;s also something we use for our customers we ended up employing hundreds of engineers to build this underpinning layer to understand it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result, it took between four and five years for Introhive to make its own first sale, and in the process the whole company almost went under, he recalled. &#8220;It took a long time to get that engine running because if you are automating data that is wrong 35% of the time, you won&#8217;t keep your customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The machine is more well-oiled today, of course, and is on a roll to bring in more functions to work off the data trove that it has built.</p>
<p>There is something about the service that reminds me a bit of LinkedIn or ZoomInfo &#8212; which you may use in your own work, or come across when Googling someone online for some reason (hey &#8212; I&#8217;m not asking why here) &#8212; for providing some kind of data base/org chart of people connected to a business. But to be very clear, the data that Introhive builds for a customer stays with that customer, and doesn&#8217;t go anywhere else.</p>
<p>Glidden says that there are no plans to build any kind of &#8220;freemium&#8221; version of the service, or one that anyone can tap as a SaaS, but rather to remain focused on helping larger enterprises make better sense of their data and how it can better inform the wider concept of sales.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=R1fS7CYrWn" data-secret="R1fS7CYrWn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That in itself raises an interesting point about Introhive and business in general. When you consider a company like PwC, there are likely many people who specifically might hold a job title with the word &#8220;sales&#8221; in it, but just as many whose jobs are predicated on closing deals, consultants and partners for example, who do not, but might just as easily benefit from having better visibility of a &#8220;relationship graph&#8221; of people connected to buying products at a business they are working with, or want to work with. Sales is more than just about salespeople for many organizations.</p>
<p>And for that reason, you can guess that one interesting aspect of Introhive is if it might evolve these tools over time to tackle other parts of an organization and how it works. Similar to the social graphs of social media, which map out how people can be connected to one another, relationship graphs in the workplace potentially resonate well beyond signing a deal, too. Business intelligence and marketing automation are already in the mix for the company.</p>
<p>“Introhive is on the forefront of helping grow sales and customers through its visionary, AI-powered revenue acceleration platform built for companies of all sizes and complexity. It seamlessly improves business operations across multiple departments by helping teams reduce time on manual inputs and giving them advanced insights on where they can generate more revenue, build more relationships and easily identify what great sales reps are doing that average reps aren’t,” said PSG managing director, Rick Essex. “The team’s acumen and highly capital-efficient model has set the company on a clear path for growth, and we’re proud to partner with them on this journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tire-making giant Bridgestone has taken a minority stake in Kodiak Robotics, the Silicon Valley-based startup developing autonomous trucks, as part of a broader partnership to test and develop smart tire technology.</p>
<p>While the terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, Kodiak Robotics co-founder and CEO Don Burnette told TechCrunch that this is a direct financial investment. Bridgestone CTO Nizar Trigui has also joined the Kodiak board as an observer.</p>
<p>The deal involves more than capital. The two companies have also formed a strategic partnership focused on advancing Bridgestone&#8217;s tire tech and fleet management system. Kodiak will use Bridgestone&#8217;s sensor-laden tires and fleet management system on its self-driving trucks, which are used to carry freight between Dallas and Houston as part of its testing program. The company recently said it is expanding its freight carrying pilots to San Antonio. Kodiak also tests its self-driving trucks — always with a safety operator behind the wheel — in and around Mountain View, California.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Semi-trucks travel 100,000 to 150,000 miles a year, Burnette said, adding that tire integrity and tire monitoring are integral to the safety of trucking, whether they&#8217;re driven by a human or computer.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Self-driving truck startup Kodiak partnering with SK Group to expand into Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-partnering-with-sk-group-to-expand-into-asia/embed/#?secret=DcfTgpzxuq" data-secret="DcfTgpzxuq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Safety of an autonomy system ultimately comes down to our ability to manipulate the tires that touch the road when you are accelerating or braking or steering,&#8221; Burnette said. &#8220;You need to be able to rely on your tires to actually perform the way they are expected to perform, otherwise your safety envelope is not necessarily guaranteed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kodiak will use these smart tires to monitor pressure, temperature and even measure the loads on the wheels, which plays a role in vehicle dynamics and maneuverability. Kodiak will share the data it collects with Bridgestone, which the company can use to improve the chemistry of its tires.</p>
<p>Tire companies like Bridgestone already collect basic information from telematics providers that helps determine where trucks are driven, what types of roads they use as well as tire pressure and temperature. Predictive models are then developed based on that data. Autonomous vehicle companies bring an added value to tire companies, Burnette noted. Kodiak&#8217;s self-driving trucks are loaded with sensors of their own, which allows the company to collect massive amounts of driving data that can help Bridgestone understand exactly how its tires are being used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Autonomy providers like Kodiak have all of the raw data specifically on <em>how</em> the trucks are being driven,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know what the forces are, we know what the steering is, we know what the braking pressures that were being commanded in real time. And so we can gather a wealth of data that has never been previously possible to collect for companies like Bridgestone.&#8221;</p>
<p>This allows Bridgestone to build predictive models that will more accurately be able to predict the eventual lifetime and also possibly give warnings to when tires may fail out of field. &#8220;And that&#8217;s ultimately what Kodiak is really interested in,&#8221; Burnette added.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The news follows Kodiak&#8217;s announcement in May that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-partnering-with-sk-group-to-expand-into-asia/">partnering with South Korean conglomerate SK</a> to explore the possibility of deploying its autonomous vehicle technology in Asia. The ultimate aim of the SK partnership is to sell and distribute Kodiak’s self-driving technology in the region. Kodiak will examine how it can use SK’s products, components and technology for its autonomous system, including artificial intelligence microprocessors and advanced emergency braking systems. Both companies have also agreed to work together to provide fleet management services for customers in Asia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo, Google’s former self-driving project that is now a business unit under Alphabet, said Wednesday it raised $2.5 billion in its second outside funding round. The company said in a blog post it will use the funds to continue growing Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving platform, and growing its team.</p>
<p>The round saw participation from existing investors Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Magna International, Mubadala Investment Company, Perry Creek Capital, Silver Lake, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Temasek and additional investor Tiger Global.</p>
<p>The news comes only a few months after former CEO John Krafcik announced in April that he was stepping down from leading the company after five years in the position. The CEO position is now being held jointly by Tekedra Mawakana, former COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, who joined the original self-driving project at Google and was CTO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krafcik led the company through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/waymo-brings-in-2-25-billion-from-outside-investors-alphabet/">first external $2.25 billion investment round</a> in March 2020. That round was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/waymo-expands-first-external-investment-round-to-3-billion/">expanded by $700 million</a> a few months later. But Krafcik could be a polarizing figure in the company, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/the-station-argo-ai-plots-its-fundraising-course-and-waymo-changes-leadership/">TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec noted</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its Waymo One commercial ride-hailing service, which operates in the Metro Phoenix, Arizona area, the company has continued to build out its Waymo Via trucking and cargo transportation service. Earlier this month Waymo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/waymo-and-jb-hunt-partner-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-texas-in-new-pilot/">announced it was entering a &#8220;test run&#8221;</a> with J.B. Hunt for transportation services between Houston and Fort Worth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Naturally, we do this by having candid conversations with founders and their investors.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool?ref=cc6fdfd74b4f">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get even deeper on that subject with Nichols, and hear the perspective from the other side of the table with Bennett.</p>
<p>Wonderschool is a network of early childhood programs that combine the quality of top-notch early education with an in-home setting.</p>
<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on Wednesday, June 16 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. Extra Crunch Live is accessible to anyone who wants to attend, but on-demand access to the content, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire library of ECL episodes</a>, is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join now to check out what Aileen Lee, Roelof Botha, Mark Cuban and more had to say on earlier episodes of ECL. </a></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, Natasha and Danny unpacked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">the Expensify EC-1,</a> which includes a ton of surprises, building tips and, as we discuss in the show, some life lessons as well. This is our largest EC-1 to date, and is the result of six months of prodigious work from the inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim. </a>Of course, we had to add our Equity spin on the feature and boiled down our favorite musings into a succinct episode.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensify&#8217;s silent period was a fun dynamic to deal with as reporters</li>
<li>There&#8217;s always an Uber angle, and Expensify is no different when you realize its early roots are tied to entrepreneur Travis Kalanick&#8217;s persuasion</li>
<li>How Expensify manages to stay slim, focus on a rural town in Michigan and achieve profitability</li>
<li>Natasha asked if lack of structure negatively or positively impacts minorities and underrepresented folks, while Danny explained a nifty way that the company deals with promotions and raises</li>
<li>Danny explained how re-writing the playbook might positively impact recruitment, and how joining Expensify doesn&#8217;t come with your classic SaaS pitch</li>
<li>And we end with a meta conversation on how society views work, and why neither of us want to spend the next 50 years with predictability</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done listening to the episode, make sure to check out Heim&#8217;s EC-1 below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: Origin story “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant”</a> (2,400 words/10 minutes</li>
<li>Part 2: Culture: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">How Expensify got to $100M in revenue by hiring ‘stem cells’ and not ‘cogs in a wheel</a>’” (3,120 words/12.5 minutes)</li>
<li>Part 3: Expansion and remote work: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/">How Expensify shed Silicon Valley arrogance to realize its global ambitions</a>” (3,250 words/13 minutes)</li>

					<description><![CDATA[When Richard Joffe moved his family to Australia in 2019, he said applying for home insurance “was like traveling back in time 30 years.” “I found the sign-up process painful, the fine print was confusing and the insurance company was totally reactive, not proactive.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Richard Joffe moved his family to Australia in 2019, he said applying for home insurance “was like traveling back in time 30 years.”</p>
<p>“I found the sign-up process painful, the fine print was confusing and the insurance company was totally reactive, not proactive. They never contacted me aside from my renewal,” he told TechCrunch. Joffe, who founded parking sensor platform <a href="https://www.parkassist.com/">Park Assist</a> and jobs platform <a href="https://www.stella.jobs/">Stella.ai</a> in the United States, began researching and found many people in Australia shared the same frustrations. This was the impetus for him to found Honey Insurance, which launches today with $15.5 million AUD (about $11.9 million USD), the largest seed round ever raised by a tech startup in Australia, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>The funding was led by institutional investors <a href="https://www.racq.com.au/insurance">RACQ</a> (the insurer that also underwrites Honey Insurance), PEXA, Metricon, ABN Group, Mirvac, AGL, SFG and Apex Capital. Individual investors include Zip founder and global CEO Larry Diamond; Afterpay co-founder and CEO Anthony Eisen; former MEBank CEO Jamie McPhee; former Corelogic CEO Graham Mirabito; Airtasker co-founder and CEO Tim Fung; and former News Corp Australia and Foxtel CEO Peter Tonagh.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The capital will be used on hiring, with plans to fill 80 positions over the next 12 months, and research and development.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O6FmodSfZ7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/">As Next Insurance makes its first acquisition, insurtech looks energetic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Next Insurance makes its first acquisition, insurtech looks energetic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic/embed/#?secret=O6FmodSfZ7" data-secret="O6FmodSfZ7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Honey Insurance is underwritten by RACQ, one of Australia’s largest insurance providers, and offers home, contents and landlord coverage. Customers get $250 AUD worth of smart sensors to monitor for the top three risks to homes: flooding, fire and theft. For example, the sensors look for things like leaky water pipes, smoke and open garage doors. Joffe said half of insurance claims are avoidable and the sensors help prevent incidents. As an incentive, Honey Insurance customers get 8% off their premiums if their sensors are switched on.</p>
<p>The sign-up process for Honey Insurance is also designed to be simple. Joffe said customers can purchase insurance in as little as three minutes and the company avoids using confusing jargon. Over the long-term, Honey Insurance will also use publicly available information and satellite data to automatically update policies if a customer makes changes to their home, like a new extension or pool.</p>
<p>Joffe said another problem in Australia is underinsurance, which <a href="https://www.corelogic.com.au/news/underinsurance-knock-effect">affects about four out of five Australians</a>. Last year, 183,000 home claims were declined or withdrawn, and the average claim size was $8,400, up 16% from the year before. As a result, each year customers need to pay a total of $1.5 billion out of pocket.</p>
<p>To address underinsurance, Honey Insurance has taken steps like a 30% safety margin for a customer’s sum insured and four times the usual home office coverage, to the value of $20,000.</p>
<p>“We have far more electronics in our houses than 20 years ago, and we work far more from home than before COVID — it makes sense your insurance policy should take this into account,” Joffe said.</p>
<p>In a statement, David Carter, CEO of RACQ, said, “Investing in Honey Insurance is an opportunity to share in the innovation and increase the scale of our insurance portfolio to benefit our 1.8 million members and their communities.”</p>
