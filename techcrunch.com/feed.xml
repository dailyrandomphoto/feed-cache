										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are plenty of places where traditional speakers don&#8217;t have enough room to do their thing. The traditional solution is to just put more, smaller speakers into the spaces, but <a href="https://www.resonado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resonado Labs</a> is taking a different approach, and showing off its Flat Core Speaker tech. The speakers are, in the first instance, going to find their way into Airstream RVs and cars from various car manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional round speakers have been the industry standard for the past 100 years. As consumer electronics have become slimmer with a more minimalist aesthetic, the audio industry developed speaker types with an oval or racetrack form to better fit slim products,&#8221; explains Brian Youngil Cho, CEO at Resonado, summarizing the raison d&#8217;etre for his company. &#8220;The motors used to power these speakers never changed to accommodate the new speaker shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has developed a driver with bar magnets and a flat voice coil attached to a flat racetrack diaphragm. It claims that the speakers offer a smoother force distribution, and posits that this gives a much better sound from a sleeker package.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At CES, the company is showing off a demo it built for Hyundai, alongside products for the living room of the future. One such innovation is a slim soundbar with a &#8220;cinematic sound experience,&#8221; which the company claims means it doesn&#8217; require a separate subwoofer. It is also showing off an ultra-narrow side-firing speaker assembly aimed at premium televisions, a powerful smart speaker and an experiential armchair with immersive spatial audio.</p>

<p>This summer, the company launched its first commercial product in collaboration with RV maker Airstream.</p>
<p>“We have always seen ourselves as trailblazers in the recreational vehicle industry, pushing the boundaries of innovation in every detail of our vehicles to optimize what matters most to our customers,&#8221; said Airstream VP of Sales Justin Humphreys of the company&#8217;s collaboration. &#8220;Implementing Resonado Labs’ breakthrough audio technology into our touring coaches continues our legacy of placing a high value on product design while offering our customers the best performance aspects possible.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ghanaian health tech startup <a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a> is building a network of community pharmacies across Africa as it plans to be the go-to primary healthcare service provider for millions of people residing in the region.</p>
<p>mPharma plans to grow its community (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Mutti</a>) pharmacies across eight markets in Africa to be the first point of care for patients. The startup’s Mutti pharmacies are essentially mini-hospitals offering a wide-range of services including medical consultation, diagnostic and telehealth services. All these while increasing access and affordability to quality medication.</p>
<p>The startup has now set out to activate more mutti pharmacies to widen its reach and to build out its tech-infrastructure as it readies itself for the next phase of growth after raising $35 million in Series D round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253652" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding, mPharma co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson told TechCrunch, will be used to build the startup’s data infrastructure, triple its talent pool over the next three years and support expansion plans in its current and new markets. It is also rolling out an e-commerce platform for pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>“We are hiring over 100 engineers to build all our technology in-house and this includes a massive data infrastructure we are creating. We are also investing in other skilled talent like doctors and nurses, professionals that are critical in the work we do,” Rockson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“​​Bloom our pharmacy management software will allow us to build structured population health datasets that enable Mutti pharmacies to provide better care pathways to the community they serve,” he said.</p>
<p>The financing raised comprises $30 million in equity and $5 million in debt from CitiBank, bringing the total amount raised by mPharma to $65 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors that participated in the round include <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876840/000187684021000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">JAM Fund</a>; a venture capital firm founded by Tinder co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmateen/">Justin Mateen</a>, Unbound; a growth investment firm by Shravin Mittal the managing director Bharti Global limited (Bharti family investment arm) and the first investment in Africa for Lux Capital; a New-York City based VC firm investing in science and tech ventures. Other investors include Northstar, Social Capital, Novastar and TO Ventures.</p>
<p>mPharma was originally founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh">Rockson</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il">Daniel Shoukimas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/">James Finucane</a> to manage prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, retail pharmacy operations and provide market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.</p>
<p>In October last year, the startup added telehealth services to its portfolio, tapping into the telemedicine wave that took off after the Covid pandemic. During an interview with TechCrunch in October last year, Rockson said the startup was planning to have 100 virtual centers by the end of six months. The number of virtual centers is primed to grow further alongside mPharma’s plan to increase its community pharmacies by 10 times over the next three years, from the current 200 centers.</p>
<p>Patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia, where mPharma has a presence, now have access to the virtual services. mPharma is also present in Gabon where it has a contract with the government to build a drug supply chain infrastructure.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253695" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253695" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253695" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/mPharma-community-health-workers.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253695" class="wp-caption-text">mPharma community pharmacies conduct regular community health outreaches for random health checks and to educate the masses. Photo <strong>Credits: mPharma.</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Startups like mPharma are bridging gaps in healthcare provision by bringing vital services closer to communities through, among other channels, pharmacies and community health checks.</p>
<p>This is a needed involvement given that countries across sub-Saharan Africa have an average of 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in some of the most developed countries, according to World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">data</a>.</p>
<p>Besides a low doctor to patient ratio, healthcare infrastructure also remains critically underdeveloped.</p>
<p>“Covid showed us that the best form of care is local, it is in the community, and the closest thing in communities are pharmacies. We believe that the pharmacy of the future, which is what we are creating, is one built around longitudinal care not episodic care,” said Rockson.</p>
<p>“We are transforming community pharmacies into the foundation of a modern health system in Africa. We will have a Mutti pharmacy in every community on the continent. Guarantee the availability and safety of medicines for each community and utilize the physical infrastructure of Mutti pharmacies to expand Mutti Doctor (the telemedicine service) creating the largest network of doctor offices and diagnostic centers.”</p>
<p>To offer all-rounded services, mPharma rolled out an ecommerce platform &#8212; the Mutti Online Pharmacy &#8212; a few weeks ago allowing its members to shop for pharmaceutical products. Starting in Ghana, they are initially only dispensing over-the-counter medication, but with plans to include prescription drugs in the near future. mPharma’s Mutti Online Pharmacy is now among the handful of exclusively digital pharmacies, including Kenya&#8217;s MyDawa, with operations in Africa.</p>
<p>mPharma has also in recent months embarked on a diversification, partnerships and expansion strategies to grow the company. A few months ago it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/health-tech-startup-mpharma-acquires-vine-pharmacy-enters-uganda/">acquired a 55% stake in Uganda’s Vine Pharmacy</a>, which was previously held by the Abraaj Group. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">entered Ethiopia in March last year</a> by signing a franchise agreement with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited.</p>
<p>mPharma enjoys expertise backing from well-experienced professions in the pharmaceutical industry including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S. and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board. The startup&#8217;s other investors include U.K.&#8217;s development arm CDC Group, Breyer Capital and Golden Palm Investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fractal has raised $360 million from TPG in a new financing round and entered the unicorn club as the Mumbai and San Francisco-headquartered AI startup, which counts Google and Wells Fargo among its customers, scales its offerings and begins preparation for an IPO.</p>
<p>The new financing round valued the 21-year-old startup &#8220;at well north of $1 billion,&#8221; said Srikanth Velamakanni, co-founder and group chief executive at Fractal, in an interview with TechCrunch. TPG invested in the startup through its TPG Capital Asia, its Asia-focused private equity platform. The new round, which brings the startup&#8217;s all-time raise to about $685 million, involves some secondary share purchase as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://fractal.ai">Fractal Analytics</a> provides artificial intelligence and analytics solutions to scores of Fortune 100 firms. (A typical customer of Fractal generates at least $10 billion in revenue.) The startup&#8217;s offerings include Qure.ai, which assists radiologists in making better diagnostic decisions. Theremin.ai helps firms improve investment decisions; Eugenie.ai assists in finding anomalies in high-velocity data; Samya.ai is fuelling next-generation enterprise revenue growth management, and Senseforth.ai helps automate customer interactions at scale to grow top-line and bottom-line.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We solve every human problem in the enterprise,&#8221; said Velamakanni.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our clients are all looking to digitize their businesses and offer more personalized solutions to their customers,&#8221; he said. A telecom operator, for instance, works with Fractal to remove friction that customers face in signing up for a multi-year contract. Consumer goods giant P&amp;G last year launched a new product called &#8220;Secret,&#8221; an underarm perspirant that it formulated using AI, for which it publicly acknowledged Fractal&#8217;s contribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also work with them on areas such as improving efficiencies, productivity, supply chain planning and forecasting. This is becoming more and more crucial to firms, especially amid the pandemic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs over 3,500 individuals globally, also helps its clients with decision-making actions, Velamakanni said. &#8220;Many companies have developed expertise on their product and engineering sides. But on the commercial front, they need some assistance,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fractal also incubates and invests in AI projects, he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to see great momentum in how clients are leveraging AI to accelerate digital transformation. Fractal is building a great workplace and an innovative culture that&#8217;s driving significant client outcomes through our ‘user focused, decision-backwards’ approach to solving problems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;TPG&#8217;s capabilities across all our markets and their proven success in building and supporting top AI providers is the perfect complement to the partnership we&#8217;ve enjoyed with Apax, whose insight and expertise have been instrumental in accelerating our growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said it serves over 100 of the top 500 companies in the world and generates over $100 million in annual revenue. It&#8217;s started to prepare for an initial public offering, but Velamakanni declined to share exactly when it will make the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to become a public company sooner than later. How soon? That I won&#8217;t be able to share at this point of time. But certainly, we have scale, size, maturity and governance of a public company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the growing market for data and analytics services, Fractal continues to stand out as one of the most well-established, differentiated providers and a clear leader in AI and advanced analytics,&#8221; said Puneet Bhatia, Co-Managing Partner of TPG Capital Asia, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian commerce startup <a href="https://udaan.com">Udaan</a>, which helps merchants secure inventory and working capital, has raised $250 million as it accelerates its scaling efforts and prepares to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>The Bengaluru-headquartered startup has raised $200 million via a convertible note and an additional $50 million as debt, its chief financial officer Aditya Pande told employees in an internal email, seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited and glad to share that we have 5 new marquee investors coming onboard the Udaan juggernaut, as part of our recently concluded convertible note financing. This round was oversubscribed 2x and also saw participation from our existing investors, including those who bought into the company through the secondary (ESOP) round in H1 2021,&#8221; he wrote in the email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The email did not reveal the names of the new investors, but a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Tor Investment and Arena Investors are among those who have invested. The startup, which counts Lightspeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital among its existing backers and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">last valued at over $3 billion</a>, is engaging with a few more investors and is likely to raise more money in the coming months, a separate source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The new financing &#8220;reflects our &#8216;broadening the capitalization strategy&#8217; as we architect our journey for public markets and thereafter. With this convertible offering, we, as a company, have started building a complete new muscle in our finance function &#8211; which we will continue to strengthen as we go forward. With this note, the total funds raised by Udaan through debt and convertible note through just the last quarter of 2021 has crossed USD 250 Million, setting us up well to continue executing our strategic agenda,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>An Udaan spokesperson declined to comment. The startup has raised $1.4 billion to date.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the business-to-business market in India remains unorganized. This means that merchants in the nation today have to travel to other cities — where all the major dealers operate — to stock up their inventory. But these merchants don’t have much leverage to negotiate, so they struggle to find best-value for money and access to a wider selection of catalog.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Udaan &#8212; co-founded by three former Flipkart executives Sujeet Kumar, Vaibhav Gupta, and Amod Malviya &#8212;  is solving this problem by connecting small retailers with wholesalers and traders. The startup today serves more than 3 million retailers and small and medium-sized businesses and it has signed up thousands of brands, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Boat Lifestyle, Micromax, HP, LG, ITC, HUL and P&amp;G.</p>
<p>Other than the inventory problem, Udaan also helps merchants secure working capital. Small businesses, especially mom-and-pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for buying their next batch. Because Udaan is able to see the engagement of different merchants on the platform, it is able to determine to whom it could safely grant working capital.</p>
<p>The startup appointed Gupta as its chief executive last year as it kicked off the work to get ready for an IPO. Prior to the move, it did not have a CEO.</p>
<p>Scores of firms including Reliance Retail, the nation&#8217;s largest retail chain, e-commerce giant Amazon as well as startups such as Jumbotail, Khatabook and Dukaan are also attempting to serve this large merchant base through a number of offerings such as access to working capital and point-of-sale terminals to accept money digitally.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Chinese internet titan Tencent is divesting its vast portfolio. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to offload more than $3 billion worth of shares in Sea, a Singaporean internet conglomerate, trimming its stake in Sea from 21.3% to 18.7% and bringing its voting rights under 10%.  The move came less than a month after Tencent [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese internet titan Tencent is divesting its vast portfolio. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to offload more than $3 billion worth of shares in Sea, a Singaporean internet conglomerate,<a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/articles/2201261.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> trimming its stake in Sea from </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">21.3% to 18.7% and bringing its voting rights under 10%. </span></p>
<p>The move came less than a month after Tencent decided to hand $16 million of its stock in JD.com to its shareholders. The transition would lower Tencent&#8217;s position in JD.com <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/12/23/2357109/34064/en/JD-com-Announces-Board-and-Shareholder-Changes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to around 2.3%</a>. As part of the deal, Martin Lau, Tencent president and CEO Pony Ma&#8217;s top lieutenant, would retire from JD.com&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce operator JD.com and Singaporean entertainment and e-commerce group Sea are some of Tencent&#8217;s most important strategic bets. Before the rise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/pinduoduo-puts-profit-into-agriculture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinduoduo</a>, which is also backed by Tencent, JD.com was Tencent&#8217;s main defense against Alibaba&#8217;s growing e-commerce empire. Through Sea&#8217;s video games operator Garena, Tencent-owned titles have established footprints across Southeast Asia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253548" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tencent made these recent divestments against a backdrop of China&#8217;s antitrust crackdown and a campaign on &#8220;common prosperity.&#8221; Speculation is thus rife that Tencent is voluntarily dismantling its ironclad alliance to be in the government&#8217;s good graces. This argument might explain Tencent&#8217;s Christmas present to shareholders &#8212; its JD.com stock distribution. In a similar answer to the government&#8217;s effort to curb big tech&#8217;s influence, Alibaba is weighing a sale of about 30% of its share in Twitter-like Weibo to a state conglomerate, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-29/alibaba-said-to-explore-options-for-weibo-stake-with-state-firm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month.</p>
<p>The rationale behind Tencent&#8217;s sale of Sea shares seems less clear. Some investors suggest it could be linked to India&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toughening stance on Chinese investments</a>. Shopee, Sea&#8217;s e-commerce arm, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/sea-shopee-quietly-launches-seller-website-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gearing up</a> to crack the Indian market.</p>
<p>Despite its willingness to reduce its influence over other tech giants, Tencent has not slowed down its overall investment pace. The 23-year-old firm has invested in over 1,200 companies to date, according to<a href="https://www.itjuzi.com/investfirm/45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> IT Juzi</a>, a Chinese startup data aggregator. In 2021 alone, it deployed more than 130 billion yuan ($20 billion) across 278 companies, setting a record high. It remains to be seen whether Tencent will cut its influence over other major allies, including the likes of food delivery platform Meituan, video sharing site Bilibili and Pinduoduo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart is expanding its service that will deliver your groceries directly to your refrigerator, the company announced today. First launched in fall 2019, <a href="https://inhome.walmart.com/">Walmart&#8217;s InHome delivery service</a>, as it&#8217;s called, allows customers to place grocery orders online, then receive their deliveries by having a Walmart associate enter their home by way of a smart lock. The service was initially tested in a small handful of markets, including Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Vero Beach, and is now available to 6 million households across the U.S. after further launches in Northwest Arkansas, Atlanta, Phoenix, and D.C. Today, Walmart says it plans to expand InHome delivery more broadly, with the goal of reaching 30 million U.S. homes by the end of the year.</p>
<p>This will include forthcoming launches in major markets like Dallas, Nashville, L.A., Chicago, Houston, Indianapolis, and others.</p>
<p>As a part of this expansion, Walmart plans to hire more than 3,000 delivery drivers over the course of the year. It will also build out a fleet of 100% all-electric delivery vans which will be used to make the deliveries, while simultaneously marketing the service in the neighborhoods being served.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The InHome service itself is $19.95 per month, which makes it more appropriate for customers who work outside the home during the day or who travel, and want their groceries put away while they&#8217;re out.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1838780" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1838780" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1838780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg 7229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a01-walmart-inhome-associate-entering.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1838780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Though it may seem odd to think of having a delivery person enter your home to stock your fridge, the InHome service addresses a major consumer complaint with online grocery delivery &#8212; that you have to be at home (or at least be heading home soon) in order to put your cold and frozen groceries away after your order is left at the doorstep.</p>
<p>Services like Shipt and Instacart &#8212; top Walmart grocery competitors &#8212; don&#8217;t offer a solution for keeping customers&#8217; cold items insulated beyond possibly double-bagging items, at the shopper&#8217;s discretion. The shoppers for these services only use the paper or plastic bags provided by the store at checkout, and there&#8217;s no system for exchanging insulated bags or boxes at the time of delivery or using some sort of insulated cooler at the customer&#8217;s home. That means customers will sometimes arrive home to find their ice cream melted or other cold items spoiled, if left out for too long on a hot day. Complicating matters further is that the services don&#8217;t always deliver at the time you specified, meaning the deliveries could arrive too early or too late to be convenient.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By offering an in-home service, Walmart can better manage the logistics of delivery on its end, instead of having to work around customers&#8217; demands for specific timeslots throughout the day. Meanwhile, it sells customers on the usefulness of having not just the last mile handled, but also having those last steps covered between doorstep and fridge or kitchen countertop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Above all else, convenience is the leading factor for our customers,&#8221; Tom Ward, Walmart&#8217;s SVP of last-mile delivery, told TechCrunch. &#8220;People love to get on doing the things they want to do, and they don&#8217;t always want to wait at home for deliveries or whatever it might be&#8230;Really, the ultimate convenience is to come home and find all the items you bought waiting for you at home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1897696" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1897696" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1897696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1897696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>InHome customers also appreciate the other perks that come with their subscription, Ward noted.</p>
<p>Subscribers can access all the features of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus">Walmart+</a>, the retailer&#8217;s Amazon Prime competitor offering free shipping and more. In addition, InHome customers<a href="https://inhome.walmart.com/returns/"> can leave items they want to return</a> to Walmart on their counter for the InHome delivery driver to take back with them to the store. And this is only the beginning, Ward hinted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve essentially tried to do is think through what are the conveniences would you know customers really want to experience,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Rx is going to be on the horizon,&#8221; Ward added, referencing Walmart&#8217;s plans to integrate its<a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/pharmacy-mail-order/1042239"> prescription delivery business</a> with InHome, which is already being teased on the InHome website.</p>
<p>When it comes to the delivery process inside the home, the InHome system itself largely works the same as it had at launch.</p>
<p>The system relies on smart lock technology and a video camera worn on the delivery driver&#8217;s uniform. Walmart partnered with Level Home for its front door smart entry technology (Level Bolt and Level Touch) and had earlier worked with Nortek Security &amp; Control for its garage door smart entry technology. It&#8217;s now offering a retrofit kit <a href="https://inhome.walmart.com/landing-genie">for Genie</a> and overhead garage door openers instead.</p>
<p>Walmart customers can select either device for $49.95 or they can now use their existing smart lock or garage keypad as an alternative.</p>
<p>The delivery associate is able to enter the home using a one-time access code provided in their InHome app. The app also notifies the customer the delivery has begun and turns on the camera worn on the associate&#8217;s vest. This records the entire delivery which the customer can see as it takes place via their own InHome app. This is meant to eliminate any security concerns around allowing an unknown person into the home when the customer is away. The delivery associate puts the food away while wearing a mask, then sanitizes the surfaces they used and locks up as they leave.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1897695" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/walmart-inhome-app.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>This video recording can be accessed up to a week after each delivery, Walmart notes. But in tests, it&#8217;s found that customers begin to trust the process after a few uses &#8212; similar to how they may grow to trust other service personnel who are provided with a door code &#8212; like a house cleaner or dog walker, for example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often the same person making the Walmart deliveries, as well, and the company notes it requires a minimum of one year of employment to move up to the new associate delivery driver position.</p>
<p>As the service expands more broadly, Walmart says it&#8217;s now formally creating the role of associate delivery driver as a new full-time position that pays an extra $1.50 per hour more than most of its in-store roles. These employees qualify for company benefits like medical, vision, and dental insurance, 401K matching, paid time off, no-cost counseling, and Walmart&#8217;s Live Better U program which pays for a free college degree. The retailer says it will initially fill the new positions through internal promotions, and staff will be trained both in-person and using virtual reality experiences through Walmart&#8217;s existing VR training platform.</p>
<p>Most of the associate delivery drivers who are already doing this work have an average tenure of over five years with the company, Ward said. Though the promotions to the new position will largely involve existing employees, Walmart expects to fill the positions those employees are vacating &#8212; so this expansion will lead to the growth of Walmart&#8217;s overall headcount.</p>
<p>&#8220;It builds on that track record of more than 300,000 associates who were promoted into roles of greater responsibility and higher pay in FY 21,&#8221; Ward noted.</p>
<p>The electric vans used by InHome drivers, meanwhile, advances Walmart&#8217;s goal of operating a zero-emissions logistics fleet by 2040 and will be supported by Walmart&#8217;s 1,396 EV charging stations at stores and clubs across 41 U.S. states, the company said.</p>
<p>(Walmart is poised to detail its partnership efforts on the EV front in a separate announcement at CES.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chrysler, the 96-year-old brand owned by Stellantis that is best known today for its minivans, will become an all-electric brand by 2028.</p>
<p>The company made the announcement as it introduced the Chrysler Airflow Concept, an all-wheel drive electric SUV concept equipped with two electric motors and a battery designed to travel 350 miles to 400 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p>Stellantis didn&#8217;t say if the Airflow concept would go into production. For now, the Airflow is meant to provide a peek at the design and technology that will characterize the brand&#8217;s future portfolio.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253538" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The first real product in Chrysler&#8217;s new EV future will arrive in just a few years. The global automaker, formed through a merger between Fiat Chrysler and French PSA Group, revealed that its first battery electric vehicle will come to market by 2025.</p>
<p>The brand has just three vehicles under its nameplate today: the Chrysler Pacifica and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans and the Chrysler 300 sedan. The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid that came to market in early 2017, has served as a springboard to where the brand is headed, according to Chrysler brand CEO Chris Feuell.</p>
<h2>Inside the Chrysler Airflow</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2253555" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253555" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253555 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg" alt="Chrysler Airflow Concept interior CES" width="2000" height="1067" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=768,410 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=680,363 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=1536,819 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_068CH.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253555" class="wp-caption-text">The interior of the Chrysler Airflow Concept. <strong>Image credit</strong>: Stellantis</p></div></p>
<p>The Chrysler Airflow concept is an SUV designed with a low ride height and a two-toned roofline meant to improve the aerodynamics, and therefore range, while also giving the vehicle an athletic stance. The vehicle&#8217;s long wheelbase and wide track are combined with 22-inch wheels to complete the look.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The aim here is to show off a premium SUV, a goal achieved through a series of exterior and interior touches from the panoramic roof and lighting that changes based on the passengers’ preferences to the Chrysler Wing logo that is tied into the grille, which includes a light blade illuminated with crystal LED lighting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253568" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253568" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253568 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg" alt="Chrysler Airflow Concept announces its electric aesthetic with the Chrysler Wing logo tied into a cross-car grille/light blade illuminated with crystal LED lighting." width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_034CH.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253568" class="wp-caption-text">The Chrysler Airflow concept ties the brand&#8217;s wing logo into the grille, which includes a light blade illuminated with crystal LED lighting. <strong>Image credit</strong>: Stellantis</p></div></p>
<p>But the real view into what Stellantis has planned for the brand is the technology — hardware and software — that is in the Airflow. As Stellantis&#8217; chief design officer Ralph Gilles noted in the announcement, the Airflow is &#8220;the result of a thoughtful synthesis of the full arsenal of Stellantis’ connected vehicle technology – inside and out.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does that mean exactly? In Stellantis&#8217; view it&#8217;s all about connectivity, digital content and services and an advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>The concept includes three areas that Stellantis is already developing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/how-stellantis-plans-to-make-22-5b-a-year-from-software-in-its-cars-trucks-and-suvs/">outlined back in December</a> as part of its plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software in its vehicles that can sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions.</p>
<p>It starts with the underlying electrical and software architecture, which it&#8217;s calling STLA Brain. This system is integrated with the cloud and connects electronic control units within the vehicle to the vehicle&#8217;s central high performing computer via a high-speed data bus. It will allow the company to upgrade software to vehicles &#8220;over the air,&#8221; or wirelessly.</p>
<p>On top of this &#8220;brain,&#8221; Stellantis has added its &#8220;SmartCockpit,&#8221; a platform built in partnership with Foxconn that will deliver applications to the driver such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce marketplace and payment services.</p>
<p>Finally, a third automated driving platform called &#8220;AutoDrive,&#8221; developed with BMW, will complete the automaker&#8217;s software plan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253575" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253575" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253575 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg" alt="Chrysler Airflow Concept " width="2000" height="1059" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CN021_057CH.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253575" class="wp-caption-text">Each screen in the Chrysler Airflow Concept is a personalized space to access the digital content. <strong>Image credit</strong>: Stellantis</p></div></p>
<p>All three of these platforms &#8212; &#8220;brain,&#8221; &#8220;smartcockpit&#8221; and &#8220;autodrive&#8221; will be in all new Stellantis vehicles by 2024. The Airflow, being a concept that shows where the company is headed, has those three platforms as well.</p>
<p>In the Airflow, which illustrates what can be accomplished with the brain, smartcockpit and autodrive platforms, there are screens throughout the vehicle, where users can access personalized digital content such as apps and entertainment. Information on the screens can be shared with all passengers by swiping.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">That startup founders are in the driver&#8217;s seat has been plain for a while now. Consider the extent to which funding has soared, with investors reportedly plugging a record <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-booming-startup-market-prompts-an-investment-rush-for-ever-younger-companies-11641119403">$93 billion</a> into early-stage U.S. startups last year &#8212; triple what they raised five years earlier. Consider that the median valuation for seed- and early-stage startups doubled over the same period.</p>
<p>Consider also the <a href="https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/04/21/the-rise-of-dual-class-stock-ipos/">continued rise</a> of dual-class shares that provide founders with outsize voting power. Almost <a href="https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/04/21/the-rise-of-dual-class-stock-ipos/">30%</a> of IPOs between 2017 and 2019 had dual-class structures, and that number likely increased between 2019 and the end of last year.</p>
<p>A less discussed proof point that underscores how far founders can push their investors &#8212; and eventually bankers &#8212;  in a frothy market centers on lock-up periods. Typically a 90- to 180-day window after a company begins to trade publicly &#8212; time during which founders, investors, and employees agree not to sell their shares to show their faith in the company and instill confidence in new shareholders &#8212; lock-ups are starting to disappear, and somewhat quickly. <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/89910/The-erosion-of-the-IPO-lock-up">According to new research</a> from Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds, early lock-up provisions &#8220;exploded&#8221; last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253438" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>By the numbers, fully one-quarter of the year&#8217;s IPOs (or 91 offers) had provisions that allowed for early lock-up releases. That&#8217;s more than five times the number in 2020. Unsurprisingly, tech IPOs accounted for 60 of the new issuers with early lock-up provisions, or 66% of the group.</p>
<p>You might recall reading at the time about some of these offerings, including that of Coupang and Robinhood. In the case of Coupang, South Korea&#8217;s biggest e-commerce retailer, it announced an early stock lockup agreement release for about 34 million shares just one week into its March debut on the NYSE based on a specific condition &#8212; that its stock needed to close at or above its IPO price of $35 &#8212; that was quickly satisfied. (The shares today trade at roughly $26 apiece.)</p>
<p>When Robinhood began trading at the end of July, employees were allowed to sell 15% of their holdings immediately and another 15% three months later.</p>
<p>Other companies to loosen lock-ups include Snowflake, the data warehousing company that went public in the fall of 2020 and allowed employees to sell as much as 25% of their vested stock three months afterward; Airbnb, which went public in December 2020 and allowed employees to sell up to 15% of their shares in its <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-others-upend-rules-for-early-ipo-trading-11626350400">first seven trading days</a>; and DoorDash, whose underwriters similarly agreed to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doordash-discloses-early-expiration-of-lockup-agreements-on-about-114-million-shares-2021-03-01">cut in half</a> the company&#8217;s 180-day lockup agreement for some shares after it also went public in December 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dutch Bros, Allbirds, The Honest Company, TuSimple, and Affirm also featured early lock-up provisions, notes Renaissance&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>Lock-up periods have never been required by the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission but were long considered a good faith sign to outsiders and even helped some public market shareholders plan their stock purchases. (Often, a company&#8217;s shares will fall in price following a traditional lock-up as early investors unload their shares en masse, driving up the supply of available shares. When Uber&#8217;s lockup period ended in 2019, for example, its shares dropped to 43% below their IPO price as newly sold shares <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7660599/Uber-loses-2-billion-market-capitalization-IPO-lockup-period-ends-triggering-massive-selloff.html">flooded the market</a>.)</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on exactly? A number of trends have since conspired to whittle away such measures, from the longer stretch that many companies now operate as privately held concerns (creating greater demand for liquidity by insiders), to the advent of direct listings. Just one of 12 direct listings to date has featured a lockup, that of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-analysis-lockup-expiration-cathie-wood-soros-fund-2021-2">Palantir</a>.</p>
<p>The rise last year of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, is yet another factor. As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/dealbook/spac-sponsors.html">reported last spring</a>, many related deals contain language that restricts sponsors from selling shares for a year from the day the deal is completed, but there are much faster ways out. According to one popular provision, if a SPAC&#8217;s shares trade slightly above their initial pricing for more than 20 days in a 30-day period, the lockup provision vanishes. Sometimes, the terms are even more porous. Indeed, when ride-hail giant Grab began to trade publicly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/softbank-backed-grab-begins-trading-after-completing-spac-merger.html">last month</a> following a tie-up with a blank-check company, more than 20% of shares held by company shareholders were immediately tradable after the merger.</p>
<p>The unifying thread here is that all involve founding teams who demanded, and received, more flexible lock-up terms from their investors, who also largely benefit from the trend. (What VC would prefer to have his or her hand&#8217;s tied for three to six months after a public offering?)</p>
<p>In the meantime, as Renaissance <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/89910/The-erosion-of-the-IPO-lock-up">notes in its new report</a>, lockups aren&#8217;t just fewer in number but they&#8217;re becoming more difficult to track. As the report observes: &#8220;Instead of a simple reduction in lock-up days, early releases are now regularly based on earnings dates or blackout periods that are undetermined at the time of the IPO. The release date may also be a moving target, dependent upon the share price hitting a certain threshold (for example, once shares are 33% above the IPO for 10 out of 15 consecutive trading days).&#8221;</p>
<p>More, it adds, &#8220;Early releases are often buried in complex legalese, and may be vague regarding the actual number of shares released . . .&#8221;</p>
<p>The big question is whether public market shareholders care about the increasing disappearance of lock-up periods, and right now, there isn&#8217;t a strong case to make why they should. While SPACs have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-a-spac-wall-street-investor-risk/?sref=gni836kR">significantly underperformed</a> typical IPOs, direct listings &#8212; perhaps because they are far fewer in number &#8212; have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/direct-listings-have-paid-off-for-investors-so-far-11630315801">performed better. </a></p>
<p>As for the broader market, U.S. stocks enjoyed a record-setting year in 2021, so investors aren&#8217;t likely to push back on much until that changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.brankas.com/">Brankas</a>, an open banking startup for Southeast Asian markets, is entering the new year with a $20 million Series B. The funding was led by Insignia Ventures Partners, with participation from returning investors Beenext and Integra Partners. Other backers included Visa (Brankas was a member of its 2021 Accelerator Program), AFG Partners and Treasury International, the venture capital firm led by fintech veterans including Jeff Cruttenden, co-founder of Acorns and Eli Broverman, co-founder of Betterment, also invested.</p>
<p>Brankas’ platform offers a roster of more than 10 “banking-as-a-service” embedded APIs, including ones for opening online bank accounts, credit scoring, identity verification, e-commerce transactions and gig economy payments. Founded in 2016, Brankas goal is to “democratize access to financial and identity data.” Clients include traditional financial institutions, banks and fintech startups.</p>
<p>Brankas says it is seeing 30% month-on-month growth in API usage and is now used by more than 40 banks and 100 enterprise customers and channel partners. Since many of its fintech clients focus on “unbanked” people, or people who don’t have traditional bank accounts or credit cards, Brankas’ partners include financial providers like remittance companies and e-wallet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253551" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Since then, Brankas co-founder and CEO Todd Schweitzer and chief of staff Bala Subramanian told TechCrunch in an email that it&#8217;s been “aggressively building new products during the pandemic, which have seen great uptake in our current operating markets of Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore.”</p>
<p>For example, these included four new payments products—Direct, for account-to-account bank transfers; Disburse for remittances directly from accounts; Pay, a no-code solution for micro-businesses to collect payments; and for enterprise customers, IPG, a platform created for large financial institutions to collect payments on behalf of merchants).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of data, Brankas developed four new APIS—Statement, for retail and corporate transaction retrievals; Balance, to let people view their current and average account balances; Income, which uses machine learning to identify individual income or salary; and Telco, to allow clients access to users’ telecom data.</p>
<p>Since its Series A in 2019, Subramanian said Brankas has witnesses more regulator support for open finance, because they see it as an enabler to financial inclusion and greater customer choice. Its also seen more “banking-as-a-service” products, or bank products like savings accounts, cards and loans offered as “embedded finance” on third-party apps, including e-commerce, SME account management and HR and payroll software. As a result of increasing adoption, he said that “large multinational financial service providers like Visa are embracing open finance, even if it may threaten their legacy business in the short term.”</p>
<p>Open finance has also been adopted by the mainstream cryptocurrency community, he added, thanks to increasing demand for “tradefi” products to complement crypto earnings.”</p>
<p>Brankas new funding will be used to build new APIs and double its current team of 100. It also plans to add more capabilities to its payments, data and banking-as-a-service API product menu in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. It will also announce partnerships with digital banks and fintech companies in Vietnam and Bangladesh, two new markets where Brankas will go live early this year.</p>
<p>Brankas also plans to deepen the capabilities of its payments, data and banking-as-a-service API product menu in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. They will also announce partnerships with digital banks and fintech leaders in Vietnam soon and Bangladesh, going live early this year].</p>
<p>Other open finance API startups in Southeast Asia include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/singapore-based-open-finance-startup-finantier-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Finantier</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/open-banking-startup-finverse-wants-to-build-the-asia-pacific-regions-plaid/">Finverse</a>. Subramanian said Brankas’ differentiators include its regional coverage and being the only company to offer regulated payments APIs enabling direct bank transfers and remittances without a middleman, as well as cryptocurrency payment and wallet linking APIs. He also said that through Visa, Brankas enables open finance for all Visa partner banks in the region and is currently developing new solutions for payments, identity and data analytics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been covering Waverly Labs for a few years now, primarily focused on the company’s wearable language translators. Today at CES, the Brookyln-based hardware startup unveiled a new form factor for its tech &#8212; designed for real-world interactions, and removing the need to share in-ear devices (something that seems like a net positive when we’re all so focused on germs).</p>
<p>Subtitles is comprised of a double-sided touchscreen display that sits atop a counter or desk in places like restaurants, retail stores, banks, airports, hotels and the like. A user chooses their language, speaks, and the translation appears on the opposite display “in near real-time.”</p>
<p>In addition to language translation, it could also prove a useful tool for the hearing impaired &#8212; almost like in-person closed captioning. As the name implies, the company compares the experience to watching a translated film.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249605" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The system is built on Waverly’s tech, which translates 20 languages and 42 dialects, including: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic, Greek, Russian, Hindi, Turkish, Polish, Chinese Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Hebrew, Thai, Vietnamese and Dutch. It&#8217;s currently being shown off at CES and is set to arrive at some point in Q2. No pricing has been announced.</p>
<p>Waverly also used the show to introduce a new version of its Amasaddor Interpreter over-ear translator. Says Waverly:</p>
<blockquote><p>It uses an advanced far-field microphone array combined with speech recognition neural networks to capture speech with astounding levels of clarity. It then seamlessly processes speech with cloud-based machine translation engines to deliver fast, fluid, and highly accurate translations.</p></blockquote>
<p>That one is <a href="https://www.waverlylabs.com/shop/ambassador-interpreter">available now</a> for $179.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT auction marketplace OpenSea had a blockbuster 2021 and as a result is seeing its private valuation grow more quickly than almost any other startup.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The crypto firm <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-openseas-new-funding/">announced</a> late Tuesday that it closed a $300 million Series C round led by Paradigm and Coatue. The raise valued the startup at a massive $13.3 billion valuation, showcasing the wild growth the startup has seen in recent months. The Information first reported </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/berber_jin1/status/1461118357965393922?s=20">details</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> on the Series C raise in November with <a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-opensea-eyes-13-billion-valuation">Newcomer</a> confirming additional details earlier today.</span></p>
<p>OpenSea saw more than $2.4 billion in transaction volume in the past 30 days alone, hauling in some hundreds of millions in fees last year. The firm&#8217;s ballooning valuation, which surged from a $1.5 billion valuation it was given just six months ago by Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto arm, is reflective of their own volume growth but also that of other flagship NFT firms including Dapper Labs which raised at a $7.6 billion valuation last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253529" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/announcing-openseas-new-funding/">blog post</a>, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer highlighted that his platform&#8217;s transaction volume increased &#8220;over 600x&#8221; last year.</p>
<p>OpenSea is firmly in the sights of dozens of other NFT marketplaces but has few major competitors at the moment, though that may change as Coinbase eyes the opportunity and other NFT marketplaces launch and receive funding. The NFT space saw plenty of action in 2021, but OpenSea realizing this valuation will rely on its continued success and its ability to entice newbies into the burgeoning world of crypto collectibles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sony has announced some basic information about its much-anticipated next-generation VR hardware for the PS5, which it calls — predictably — PSVR2. Little was revealed about the device beyond its basic specs but it did confirm some features gamers will care about.</p>
<p>The original PSVR was a competent, relatively affordable, easy to use device but fairly limited in terms of hardware: resolution, field of view and such. So Sony&#8217;s announcement that the new one will be considerably more advanced will be very welcome.</p>
<p>The PSVR2 was confirmed by Sony to have 4K HDR imagery, 2000&#215;2040 per eye, and the field of view will also be wider than the original hardware at 110 degrees. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/04/playstation-vr2-and-playstation-vr2-sense-controller-the-next-generation-of-vr-gaming-on-ps5/">A blog post that appeared after the live announcement</a> confirmed rumors that it uses OLED and will have a 90-120Hz refresh rate. (This paragraph has been updated with details from that post.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It will however feature eye-tracking and foveated rendering, must-haves these days. Eye-tracking for obvious gameplay and other reasons, and foveated rendering so that the notoriously resource-hungry VR rendering process can focus its cycles on the area where the player is looking.</p>
<p>One last and rather unexpected feature is force feedback in the headset. Whether people really want their heads vibrated is an open question, but you never know unless you try. A lot of people thought the Wii was a stupid idea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253517" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253517" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253517" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="583" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg 2129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=1536,874 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=2048,1166 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/psvr2-controllers.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>A new set of controllers will also come with the set, which will include their own improvements over the PSVR&#8217;s original two, which though perfectly fine at the time have been superseded by the competition&#8217;s capabilities. Sony actually <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/18/next-gen-vr-on-ps5-the-new-controller/">spilled the beans on these</a> a while back.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company announced that a VR-only game in the Horizon series (started by Zero Dawn and to be continued soon with Forbidden West) will be among the many Sony first party studios exclusives for the platform.</p>
<p>More information is surely forthcoming, though this seems to be all we can expect from today&#8217;s event. We&#8217;ll update if we hear more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At CES in Las Vegas this evening, Sony&#8217;s Chairman, President and CEO Kenichiro Yoshida showed off a brand new prototype of its Vision S concept electric car, and announces that the Sony Group is starting a new division &#8211; the Sony Mobility Inc &#8211; which will start commercializing its electric vehicles.</p>
<p>On the CES stage during the Sony press conference, the company showed off its existing Sony Vision-S sedan, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/">revealed at CES last year</a>. This year, it also flexed a new model in the line-up, the Sony Vision-S SUV prototype.</p>
<p>&#8220;The excitement we received after we showed off the Vision-S really encouraged us to further consider how we can bring creativity and technology to change the experience of moving from one place to another,&#8221; said Yoshida, before revealing the new Vision S SUV prototype. &#8220;This is our new Vision-S SUV. Vision-S has been developed on a foundation of safety, adaptability and entertainment. Safety has been our number 1 priority in creating a comfortable mobility experience. That has not changed when building this SUV. A total of 40 sensors are installed inside and outside of the vehicle to monitor safety.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In terms of adaptability, we have connectivity that enables us to build a vehicle that continuously evolves. It also makes it possible to personalize the cabin for each user. With 5G, it enables high speed, high capacity, and low latency connectivity between the in-vehicle system and the cloud. The VIsion-S also evolves mobility as an entertainment space,&#8221; said Yoshida. &#8220;The VIsion-S also evolves mobility as an entertainment space, including gaming experience and audio. We have learned more about mobility through our exploration of VIsion-S, and through our partners who have supported this effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sony announced that it was establishing a new company &#8211; Sony Mobility Inc. &#8211; to accelerate the efforts of &#8220;exploring the commercial launch of Sony&#8217;s EV&#8221; &#8211; hinting that a Sony car may be coming to a lot near you in the none-too-distant future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">OnePlus has seemingly taken a page out of co-founder Carl Pei’s book with the 10 Pro launch. Gone, it seems, are the days where we get everything we want to know about an upcoming device in one handy location. Instead, the company’s meting out information about its latest flagship, piece by piece.</p>
<p>Overnight we got the first official glimpse of the product’s design, courtesy of a launch announcement in China. Today we’re getting some key specs about the product. As mentioned the other week, the company canceled its unofficial CES presence, meaning there won’t be a big in-person event this week to check out the device (probably for the best). That also means we’re going to have to wait a bit for other key pieces of information &#8212; North American availability being a pretty key one.</p>

<p>Following several credible-looking leaks, we now know straight from the source that the OnePlus 10 Pro will be among the first round of devices to sport Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. This is the rebranded successor to last year’s 888. We did see that bit coming, as OnePlus (along with parent company, Oppo) was among the first batch of partners listed &#8212; though fellow Chinese device maker Xiaomi beat the company to the punch by announcing the first handset to support the chip.</p>

<p>The system runs Android 12-based OxygenOS, which the company has recently combined with Oppo’s ColorOS, which it’s thus far shown off as beta. The display sports a 120Hz refresh rate and the rear triple-camera system sports 48, 50 and eight-megapixel lenses. More specifics on the breakdown of the camera system are likely coming in some future update. The system sports a beefy 5,000mAh battery and 80W wired/ 50W wireless charging. More info soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here’s a fun left-field idea from CES this week:<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220103005118/en/Smart-Lighting-Expert-Sengled-Highlights-New-Product-Offerings-During-CES" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a smart lightbulb capable of taking health readings</a>, including heart rate, temperature and tracking sleep. Necessary? Not in the slightest. Interesting, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the product operates in a similar capacity as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-nest-hub-2-review-the-solid-smart-screen-adds-sleep-tracking/">latest Nest Hub</a> &#8212; and uses a similar technology. Radar sensing is at the heart of it, measuring changes in the user’s body to deliver a kind of passive health monitoring system &#8212; i.e. one that doesn’t require you to put on a smartwatch or fitness band.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a lot more variables with a lightbulb, versus a product specifically designed to sit next to your head while you sleep. There are also some broader questions here, like, is the sense of convenience in not wearing a fitness band &#8212; or even ring &#8212; so great that you’d want to outsource it to a lightbulb? And what of accuracy? It’s tough to compete with readings from sensors mounted directly next to the body.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The smarthome gadget has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi functionality, and could have some potentially useful applications for eldercare, including fall detection. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> has a bit more insight into the bulb, which is set to launch toward the end of the year for an undisclosed price. Sengled announced a number of other products at the show, as well, including a smart oil diffuser, a portable lamp and a motion sensor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No one wants to be the maintenance worker who has to hike through half a mile of damp hallways just to check the pressure gauge on a valve somewhere. <a href="https://lilzgauge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiLz</a> makes it possible to keep an eye on such inconvenient physical interfaces remotely with a clever and practical application of machine learning.</p>
<p>The Japanese (specifically Okinawan) startup has been around for a little while — in fact <a href="https://jp.techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/lilz-explosion-proof-camera/">our colleagues at TC JP have written them up</a>. But despite the seemingly obvious value of its service, it hasn&#8217;t quite hit the big time yet. LiLz participated in CES as part of the country&#8217;s trade group, along with a bunch more companies <a href="https://www.jetro.go.jp/usa/topics/ces-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed here</a>.</p>
<p>LiLz&#8217;s device looks a bit like a chubby tablet without a screen. It&#8217;s essentially a camera, light and processing and communications chips packed in with a big battery — enough power to last up to three <em>years</em>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253155" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You mount the device so it can see the gauge or dial in question. After confirming picture and signal, you configure it in the app to interpret what it&#8217;s pointed at; it can read circular, semicircular and linear gauges, digital and rolling or analog digit displays, or things like colored warning lights. (The ML involved here is not trivial — I ran across <a href="https://indatalabs.com/blog/ai-inspection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this interesting article</a> while looking into it.)</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s set up, it&#8217;ll send readings live or at intervals to a central dashboard, or make them available via API so they can be queried or recorded elsewhere. The data goes out via LTE or Bluetooth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253472" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253472" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg" alt="Two Lilz cameras mounted near the ceiling of an industrial area." width="1024" height="652" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=1536,978 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=2048,1303 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-camera.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253472" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LiLz</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a solution aimed directly at infrastructure and heavy industry, which often involve lots of legacy equipment located in hard-to-reach places: roofs, underground (but not too deep or the signal can&#8217;t penetrate), in labyrinthine factories and warehouses, etc.</p>
<p>Doing daily rounds of these dials is not just dull work for humans, but can be dangerous as well. Using a robot is another way to automate it, but doesn&#8217;t a network of IoT devices seem more practical than a quadrupedal bot trucking around constantly?</p>
<p>LiLz CTO Kuba Kolodziejczyk said that the company has been expanding quickly following its debut in 2020 and a $2.2 million Series A round in early 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253473" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253473" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Lilz interface showing readings from a dial being made by the software." width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/lilz-screen.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253473" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LiLz</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We grew from 240 cameras deployed at 34 locations by a few early users before June 2020, to 2000 cameras deployed at 320 locations for over 100 clients now, and expect to grow to 5000 cameras by end this year,&#8221; he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;We now have a few clients using more than hundred cameras at single location.&#8221;</p>
<p>They started by targeting basic building management, but now have expanded to chemical and industrial plants, construction and manufacturing sites, public infrastructure and more due to customer demand, he added.</p>
<p>And the capabilities of the device are increasing as well. They&#8217;ve mainly been iterating on the software, making it able to be updated remotely, improving accuracy and resilience to disturbance, and adding data sharing and other features. There&#8217;s a new explosion-proof (!) version of the hardware as well. Maybe they should get into making phone cases as a side gig.</p>
<p>New products are on the way, one for &#8220;sound search&#8221; and another for counting of objects in the camera&#8217;s view, but both are at a very early stage now. And new capabilities like monitoring float and level gauges, among other things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they&#8217;ve come to CES to make some outreach to potential clients outside Japan. The show is looking like something of a bust, but maybe a few techs and managers will read this and think &#8220;wow, that would be handy.&#8221; You can find out more at the <a href="https://lilzgauge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shiny new English website here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 4, 2022! Yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/equity-monday-big-tesla-numbers-juice-ev-companies/">we noted</a> that startup news was kicking off the year a little light, but that that would change quickly. And change it has. In the following we have IPO news, robot news, canned-water startup news, acquisitions and more. Let’s go! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/justworks-targets-multibillion-dollar-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/"><strong>Justworks’ valuation could top $2B in IPO:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The first of the anticipated 2022 technology IPOs dropped a price range this morning, meaning that the public offering season is officially underway. SMB HR-focused Justworks’ valuation could scoot past the $2 billion mark, by our reckoning, when it starts to trade (we presume) later this month. For its investors, the price appears to be a win.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/vc-joe-lonsdales-tweets-about-woke-tech-diversity-spark-investor-pushback/"><strong>Joe Lonsdale’s bad tweets get him in trouble:</strong></a><strong> </strong>After diving into the issue of disparate investment totals for different groups of people, 8VC’s Joe Lonsdale has been trying to walk back his comments on Twitter. It’s not really working, as he appears to have said what he thinks. And folks in venture are not thrilled, Natasha reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/google-confirms-it-acquired-cybersecurity-specialist-siemplify-reportedly-for-500m-to-become-part-of-google-clouds-chronicle/"><strong>Google confirms $500M buy of Israeli cybersecurity startup:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Reports that U.S. search giant Google was buying Israeli startup Siemplify have been confirmed, TechCrunch writes. Sources close to the deal confirmed the price, even if Google is staying mum on how much it dished out for the company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into startup news about individual companies, a few notes. First, while tech stocks have taken a hammering in recent weeks, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">appears that the private markets are full-steam ahead</a>. There’s risk there. Looking abroad, we also have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/fintechs-in-africa-continue-to-overshadow-all-other-startups-in-funding-gained/">notes up on fintech in Africa and how dominant</a> the single startup category is proving to be. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/refinery-ventures-second-fund-aimed-at-getting-startups-to-series-a/">Refinery Ventures’ new fund</a> is all about getting startups to their Series A, Christine Hall reports.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253322" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, the rest of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/liquid-death-lands-75-million-more-in-funding-including-to-roll-out-flavored-water/"><strong>Why is canned water so expensive to sell?</strong></a> That’s my question regarding the news that Liquid Death just raised a $75 million round. Don’t get me wrong, water is fine, and death-themed water is right up my heavy metal alley. But the sheer amount of capital that is flowing into tech-light businesses is confusing. That said, I am here to support any brand that leans into metal music as far as Liquid Death has, per its merch page.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/"><strong>Robot bar carts are here to help:</strong></a> Labrador Systems’ multiyear project to build a robot for moving things about a home is coming to fruition, TechCrunch reports. We clapped eyes on the device back in 2020, meaning we’ve been waiting for it to come out for some time. Per our reporting, the company’s Retriever robot offers “assistance for elderly users and people with limited mobility.” That’s rad.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/skydio-debuts-updated-1099-self-flying-drone-with-new-bells-and-whistles/"><strong>Skydio launches refined drone model:</strong></a> U.S. drone startup Skydio has updated its Skydio 2 drone to the Skydio 2+, which brings with it longer flight range, more battery life and new software. Skydio captured attention with its drones that follow and film their owners.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/calm-makes-its-first-foray-into-physical-activity-and-video-content-with-new-daily-move-feature/"><strong>Great, now my meditation app wants me to actually do things:</strong></a> Calm, best known as one of the major meditation mobile apps, is expanding into other areas of self-care. And now, we don’t mean extra wine on Monday mornings. Instead, Calm has put together what it calls “Daily Move” videos that will help its users move. Bold from a company that made its bread to date on helping people sit still. But because you have to do both to be sane, I have learned, Calm could be onto something here. Let’s see how the new content performs in-market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/recorded-future-securitytrails/"><strong>Recorded Future spends $65M on SecurityTrails:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s a neat little startup deal. Recorded Future, a threat intelligence company, has purchased SecurityTrails, a company that we report “collects and maintains vast amounts of current and historical internet records, such as domain name records, registration data and DNS information, giving organizations visibility into what their threat attack surface is.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/atmosphere-raises-100m-as-its-business-focused-streaming-tv-service-passes-19k-venues-and-20m-viewers/"><strong>Atmosphere raises $100M:</strong></a> OK, this one is cool. Atmosphere is a startup that creates video content — at times sans sound — for “broadcast in public places like bars, restaurants and doctors’ offices.” Think of the visual version of the music you hear in elevators. Get it? The company’s new round was 80% equity, 20% debt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday, TechCrunch reporter Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/aws-will-buy-a-saas-company-and-other-2022-enterprise-predictions/">shared his predictions for enterprise companies this year.</a></p>
<p>As he noted, making enterprise forecasts is tricky: In 2021, who expected Salesforce to snap up Slack for almost $28 billion, or that Jeff Bezos would hand over the reins of Amazon to Andy Jassy?</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure didn’t see that coming, and I’m betting most people didn’t,&#8221; wrote Ron. &#8220;The tech world moves so quickly, it’s often hard to keep up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With &#8220;the usual caveats,&#8221; his prognostications encompass ongoing supply chain issues, the impacts of increased regulatory oversight in Europe and the U.S., and his thoughts on a M&amp;A market where table stakes are measured in the tens of billions.</p>
<p>His boldest, spiciest take?</p>
<blockquote><p>Salesforce … was quiet in 2021, busy closing the Slack deal. It won’t be too unrealistic to expect something in 2022. Maybe something SaaS-y like Zoom, Box or Dropbox. Maybe Benioff finally gets Twitter, a company he desperately wanted in 2016, as Casey Newton suggested in The Platformer this week.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>There are two topics to hit on today from Big Tech. The first is from Amazon, and the rest is a huge pile of reporting on what’s going on at CES this year. First, Kindle:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/amazon-kindle-china/"><strong>Kindle’s future in China is fading:</strong></a> The Amazon e-reader has been in the Chinese market for nine years, but supply of its devices is drying up in the country. Given the broader push by the Chinese government to control media of all sorts, the move is not a surprise. After all, even a smaller Kindle library is still a lot of books. And, well, open inquiry is not really ascendant in the Chinese market these days thanks to the Chinese Communist Party.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BMW&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bmw-m.com/en/index.html">M division</a> has always been about taking the German luxury car manufacturer&#8217;s production vehicles a few steps further. And like its competitors, the company has long thought about what the combination of electric drivetrains and advances in autonomous driving will mean for brands like BMW M. The first all-electric M car was the i4 M50, its top-of-the-line 536 horsepower sedan that hit the market last year. But at CES this week, the company is announcing the most powerful version of its iX technology flagship, the 2023 iX M60, a 610 horsepower machine (when Sport Mode is enabled) that aims to combine the company&#8217;s tech-centric flagship iX platform with the heritage of the M-series&#8217; focus on performance.</p>
<p>The promise here is a car that hits 60 mph from a standstill in 3.6 seconds, thanks to its two motors that can provide a total of 811 lb-ft of instantaneous torque when called upon in launch mode. The car is electronically limited to 155 mph, which should be sufficient in most situations that don&#8217;t involve fleeing a supervillain. This is a big, heavy car, but it still promises a range of 280 miles per charge (that&#8217;s the preliminary EPA estimate), compared to a Tesla Model Y&#8217;s maximum range of 330 miles. With a DC fast charger, the battery can go from 10 to 80% in 35 minutes.</p>

<p>BMW specifically notes that the two motors don&#8217;t use any rare earth metals due to eliminating permanent magnets. Instead, the motors use the principle of a &#8220;current-energized synchronous machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car&#8217;s standard adaptive dual-axel air suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers promises to keep the vehicle at the right height, no matter the speed (and you can manually adjust the height, too).</p>

<p>On the tech side, BMW promises its latest generation of sensors and software for its driver assistance and infotainment systems, as well as a computing platform with &#8220;considerable potential for consistently advancing automated driving and parking.&#8221; In addition, there&#8217;s standard equipment like BMW Live Cockpit Professional and BMW Natural Interaction, a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System, BMW Laser Light, Comfort Access, Active Seat Ventilation for the driver and front passenger &#8212; and the Radiant Heating Package, which warms the seats, steering wheel and armrests. There&#8217;s also radiant heating in the door panels and dashboard for all those mid-winter ski trips.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing’s for certain: Hyundai has some grand ambitions for its robotics development. And thus far, the automaker has been willing to put its money where its mouth is, most notably in the form of its acquisition of Boston Dynamics, which valued the robotics pioneer at north of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Robotics are, predictably, taking center stage with the company’s CES presentation this week. Last month, Hyundai offered a sneak preview in the form of the Mobile Eccentric Droid, a four-wheel modular mobility platform. Today, the company outlined broader plans for the future with its new “metamobility” concept.</p>
<p>Hyundai will be revealing more information about its strategy, and we’ll be speaking to some executives to get a better idea of what it might look like in practice. For now, the broad idea was presented under the banner of “Expanding Human Reach,” which aims to find a role for mobility and robotics in a virtual reality metaverse. It’s hard to separate the buzzwords from the practical implications at this early stage, but a primary component seems to be the use of hardware to serve as a kind of real-world proxy for VR interactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2252987" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252987" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252987" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/03_CES-2022_metaverse_169_youtube_220103_Final.2022-01-04-09_07_18.gif" alt="" width="800" height="330" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252987" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>For now, let’s just say there are a lot of big promises surrounding a lack of tangibility that has long been a root problem for VR applications. Here’s Hyundai Motor Group President Chang Song:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea behind Metamobility is that space, time and distance will all become irrelevant. By connecting robots to the metaverse, we will be able to move freely between both the real world and virtual reality. Going one step further from the immersive ‘be there’ proxy experience that the metaverse provides, robots will become an extension of our own physical senses, allowing us to reshape and enrich our daily lives with Metamobility.</p></blockquote>
<p>A near-term, plausible use for such technology is using remote teleoperations to control a manufacturing robot. That’s something that Toyota has long been exploring with its T-HR3 system. The company notes that Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing could serve as a gateway for such remote-controlled work — and it’s not too difficult to imagine a system like this serving some practical functionality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2252981" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252981" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg 5815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CES2022-KV_4.-RemoteworkRobotics.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252981" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>Other applications are a fair bit further out. “For example,” writes Hyundai in a press release, “when a user accesses a digital twin of their home in the metaverse while away from their physical home, they will be able to feed and hug a pet in Korea through the use of an avatar robot. This will allow users to enjoy real world experiences through VR.”</p>
<p>Such notions appear to be largely conceptual at the moment, though Hyundai is offering demos of what they might eventually look like in-person at CES this week. Given the number of people currently attending the show virtually (TechCrunch included) amid the most recent COVID surge, it is, at the very least, easy to imagine how remote operations could prove useful down the road.</p>
<h2>Bringing robotics to inanimate objects, transit</h2>
<p>Hyundai didn&#8217;t spend all of its time in the metaverse at CES. The company also introduced a concept branded &#8220;New Mobility of Things&#8221; that will use robotics to move inanimate objects — big and small — autonomously.</p>
<p>Under this New Mobility of Things concept is a product called Plug &amp; Drive, or PnD. This single wheel unit has intelligent steering, braking, in-wheel electric drive and suspension hardware as well as lidar and camera sensors that let it detect objects and navigate around them.</p>
<p>These PnD modules are designed to attach to objects like tables in an office, for instance. The user might command the table to move closer to them or to schedule that table to move at a certain time when more space in the office is needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PnD Module is adaptive and expandable to match human needs. Because in the world to come, you won&#8217;t move your things &#8212; they will move around you,&#8221; Dong Jin Hyun, the vice president and head of Hyundai&#8217;s robotics lab, said. &#8220;PnD makes normally inanimate objects mobile. It&#8217;s this ability that makes changing practically any space possible. It&#8217;s a way to configure spaces on demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hyundai showcased a number of applications for the PnD, including a personal transport system that could ferry an individual to a waiting bus. This pod, which is equipped with four 5.5-inch PnD modules, would then attach itself to this &#8220;mother shuttle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theoretically, the bus would stop and the pod (the human sitting inside) would continue on for that last mile to their destination.</p>
<p>That idea, which Hyundai showed in a video that depicted an elderly woman whose cane was delivered to her via a single PnD before she climbed into the pod and zipped off to an awaiting bus, is targeted directly to an aging population. However, it could be used — if it ever becomes a reality — to provide first- and last-mile public transit without adding a lot of single-occupant large cars to roadways.</p>
<p>Hyundai also showed off another concept called &#8220;Drive &amp; Lift&#8221; (or DnL), a module designed to lift objects. Hyundai combined the DnL with its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED) robot. The DnL is mounted on each wheel of the ModED, allowing it to lift up and down, keeping it level even as the robot</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> traverses uneven terrain or low barriers such as steps or speed bumps.</span></p>
