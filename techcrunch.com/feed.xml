										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One-a-half-year-old Indonesian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/ula-raises-20-million-to-expand-its-e-commerce-marketplace-in-indonesia/">e-commerce startup Ula</a>, which has raised over $30 million and courted many high-profile investors, is inching closer to adding one of the biggest tech profiles to its captable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/5-months-old-indonesian-startup-ula-raises-10-5-million-for-its-wholesale-e-commerce-marketplace/">Jakarta-headquartered startup</a> &#8212; which counts B Capital Group, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Quona Capital among its existing investors &#8212; is in advanced stages of talks to finalize a new round of over $80 million in which Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and world&#8217;s richest person, is also investing, according to two sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Bezos has agreed to invest in Ula through his family office, Bezos Expeditions, sources said. B Capital Group, Tencent and Prosus Ventures are positioning to co-lead the round, which could close as soon as this month.</p>
<p>Bezos’ interest in Ula, which operates a business-to-business e-commerce platform, comes at a time when Amazon has either not entered most Southeast Asian nations &#8212; or maintains a limited presence there.</p>
<p>Public relations reps of Ula did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ula helps small retailers solve inefficiencies that they face in supply chain, inventory and working capital. It operates a wholesale e-commerce marketplace to help store owners stock only the inventory they need, and also grants them with working capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Nipun Mehra (a former executive of Flipkart in India), Alan Wong (who previously worked with Amazon), Derry Sakti (who oversaw consumer goods giant P&amp;G’s operations in Indonesia), and Riky Tenggara (formerly with Lazada and aCommerce).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla delivered a record-breaking 241,300 electric vehicles in the third quarter, blowing past expectations as other U.S. automakers experienced a drop in sales as the result of a global chip shortage.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Tesla deliveries (some 96%) were its newer Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, according to its <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries">report released</a> Saturday. Tesla said that 9,275 of the vehicles it delivered were  Model X and S. Deliveries grew 20% since the second quarter and by 73% than the same period last year.</p>
<p>Production numbers have also grown. Tesla produced 237,823 electric vehicles in the third quarter, another record for the company.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk congratulated the company and its employees via a tweet for hitting the delivery and production numbers. In a separate tweet, Musk wrote &#8220;And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1444362460459323392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Tesla beat expectations, other legacy automakers reported a drop in U.S. sales. (Tesla&#8217;s sales are global and the company does not provide regional data).</p>
<p>GM took the hardest hit. GM reported Friday it sold <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1001-gmsales.html">446,997 vehicles in the U.S.</a>, a 33% drop in new vehicle sales compared to the same quarter last year. GM has idled several plants this summer due to the global shortage of semiconductor chips and battery packs for its Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV vehicles. Those plants have since come back online.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in U.S. sales, GM said it was maintaining its full-year adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion as the company &#8220;continues to develop solutions to mitigate the impacts of the semiconductor shortage and Chevrolet Bolt EV recall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, reported an 18% drop in U.S. sales. Ford has not reported its sales numbers yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.</em></p>
<p>Emerging founders and investors in tech must be exuding extreme main character energy, because this week in tech was all about making their lives easier.</p>
<p>AngelList announced AngelList Stack, a new suite of products that will compete with Carta in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">providing services to help founders start, operate and maintain ownership over their companies.</a> The new software will cover four bases: end-to-end incorporation, business banking, adviser equity grants and cap table management.</p>
<p>Here’s why AngelList isn’t worried about Carta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">per CEO Avlok Kohli</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of experiments around point solutions, around solving different problems for different point problems for founders. Our view is that founders prefer always being integrated into one bundle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving into the world of founder support was a surprising but sensical move for AngelList, according to my Twitter DMs. The startup spent the last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">growing its venture services business,</a> after first piloting rolling funds, which allow LPs to back investors on a quarterly subscription model. Speaking of rolling funds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/gumroad-founder-sahil-lavingia-launches-new-seed-fund-in-collaboration-with-angellist/">one of the first to launch was from Sahil Lavingia</a>, the founder and CEO of Gumroad. He had some news of his own with AngelList this week, albeit in the world of scouts, or people who source deals for venture capital investors.</p>
<p>Lavingia is launching a new, pooled scout fund with AngelList in which each scout gets carry in their referred deal (5%) and an additional 5% in the whole pool of startups. In other words, he redirected 33% of his carry, or how much money the fund makes from portco exits, to its scouts.</p>
<p>The scout fund is unique because, while most funds may have scout programs today, it’s still super rare to share carry with scouts both from a pooled <em>and</em> individual perspective.</p>
<p>He explained why it matters on a personal note: paper trails.</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to go super wide with this and build a very different kind of coalition of scouts. If they can prove themselves, and they get a paper trial that they have, I can help them get plugged into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>[Even with crypto] you&#8217;re seeing the financialization of all these relationships. Before, there&#8217;s kind of this informal handshake, pay-it-forward thing that happens in Silicon Valley, whereas with crypto, it&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna buy it in this transactional way knowing what the incentives actually are.&#8221; I&#8217;m sending you this deal, but let&#8217;s be real here: This is a business transaction and I&#8217;m sending you this deal so I think it’s good to codify it.</p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t mind that I didn’t make any money off of Pinterest, but what is sometimes frustrating is that an LP won’t value the fact that I sent an investor to Pinterest [when it was valued at $5 million].</p></blockquote>
<p>As Lavingia hints, a common thread between his effort and AngelList&#8217;s is that they both want to  formalize processes &#8212; whether it’s starting a company or introducing an investor to one. It’s hard to philosophically argue against more transparency and distribution in entrepreneurship, but it’s also hard to pull off those goals in a way that actually helps those who need it most.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: AngelList wants it to be easier than ever to start a startup. But for whom? Lavingia thinks it&#8217;s great for scouts to get paid, in full, for companies that they spot and thus develop a track record. But what if the scouts are the same people that could probably start a rolling fund if they wanted to? I always worry that new bets, whether it&#8217;s a company going full stack or an investor sharing more of their carry, will want to de-risk from built-in volatility. In the end, democratizing access requires betting on historically overlooked people, and that’s a risk that venture clearly doesn’t make often.</p>
<p>It’s why AngelList and Lavingia have to go bold when building these new projects. Optionality (and affordability) is key when trying to usher in a new generation of innovators. But, they need to ignore the status quo of who full stack served in the past. Hell, they even need to take a page out of the crypto playbook.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about frozen yogurt’s impact on consolidation, workplace benefits and a walk back on blitzscaling.

<p>As the pandemic drags on, employees are either soul-searching for a bigger purpose or simply exhausted by the uncertainty and stale culture of their current jobs. And consumer edtech is taking notice.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you need to know: </strong>Outschool and MasterClass are quietly building teams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/employers-are-consumer-edtechs-next-beta-test/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">to sell their services to employers</a>, instead of going direct to end users like the old times. <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyfarr/status/1443602125867548672">Similar to other sectors</a>, edtech wants to refresh how it sells to consumers but will come up against &#8220;point-solution benefits fatigue&#8221; when it gets knocking on corporate doors.</p>

<h2>Consolidation everywhere, always</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2211515" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211515" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2211515" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg 6048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/froyo.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2211515" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TheCrimsonMonkey / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>This week on Equity, we graduated from a conversation on full-stack approaches, like the ones above, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/here-for-influencer-branded-mac-and-cheese/">how consolidation seems to be everywhere these days</a>. There’s layers, or as the Equity team would like to say, flavors, to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>We used fro-yo toppings as a way to understand if it makes sense for startups to be point-solutions (give you the best of one flavor) or full-stack solutions (give you the medium option, but offer everything). This mindset helps fuel if consolidation makes sense from a horizontal or vertical perspective. And the conversation all started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rpa-industry-consolidation-continues-with-sale-of-blue-prism-to-vista-for-1-095b/">with a deal from the RPA space. </a></p>

<h2>Reid Hoffman wants to have a word</h2>

<p>I’m still reflecting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">on a conversation</a> that I had with Reid Hoffman last week during TechCrunch Disrupt. The founder of LinkedIn joined us the same day that Greylock, where he is an investment partner, announced a $500 million seed fund. So, there was definitely a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Even though Hoffman is ironically adding to the ample capital in the market today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">one of his loudest messages was to stay focused. </a></p>
<p>An excerpt from my piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>When LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman first coined the term “blitzscaling,” he kept it simple: It’s a concept that encourages entrepreneurs to prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty. Years later, founders are navigating a pandemic, perhaps the most uncertain period of their lives, and Hoffman has a clarification to make.</p>
<p>“Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal … blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.” Instead, he said, blitzscaling is a choice companies may have to make for a set period of time to outpace a competitor or react to a pandemic rather than a route to take from idea to IPO.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Around TC</h2>
<p>I buried the lede here, but this week we announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">ExtraCrunch is rebranding to TechCrunch+</a>! We’re doing it to better harness the TechCrunch brand, but also because we don’t think our pieces — most of which are helping to provide signal amid the noise — are “extra.” Instead, as our team puts it, it’s table stakes. Plus, it’s a super cute logo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>At TikTok&#8217;s online event, TikTok World, the company announced a range of new initiatives, product updates and advertising formats in an effort to woo more marketers to its platform. On the e-commerce front, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">expanded its set of shopping partners</a> beyond pilot partner Shopify. Earlier this year, the video platform began piloting TikTok Shopping in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in a deal that allowed Shopify merchants with a TikTok For Business account to add a Shopping tab to their TikTok profiles and sync their product catalogs to the app to create mini-storefronts. Now, TikTok is rolling out to new brand partners for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, with Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE coming soon. It also introduced a fuller slate of solutions for TikTok commerce, including ad products and later this year, a TikTok Shopping API. The app now offers a trio of in-feed ad products for online shopping: Collection Ads which feature swipeable and tappable product cards; Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs), which are automatically generated ads; and Lead Generation ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also presented its new plan to ramp up advertiser investment with a new promise of “brand safety” and the launch of several new and interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to “Choose Your Own Adventure”-type ads to “super likes” and more. The ads are meant to encourage TikTok users to tap, swipe and use gestures to interact with the ads&#8217; content. There&#8217;s even an ad where users get to direct the storytelling, and a mini page that lets brands connect users with their message directly in the TikTok app.</p>

<p>To date, marketers haven’t carved out as much of their spending for TikTok compared with other major platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. But TikTok parent company ByteDance has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-owner-bytedances-annual-revenue-jumps-to-34-3-billion-11623903622">been making inroads in the global ad market</a>, with annual revenue across its apps more than doubling in 2020 to reach $34.3 billion. In the U.S., TikTok was expected to bring in $500 million in 2020, up from $200-$300 million in the year prior, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-u-s-revenues-expected-to-hit-500-million-this-year">The Information.</a> (Some of that is from <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue-75-million">in-app purchases</a>, of course.)</p>
<p>As TikTok has scaled its ad business, its ad prices have been steadily increasing, too. Bloomberg noted this summer it was jacking up home page takeover ads, its most valuable real estate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business?sref=gni836kR">to more than $2 million</a> on top days — like holidays. Reuters also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktoks-us-ad-business-roars-back-trumps-threats-recede-2021-02-16/">noted</a> that TikTok saw a 500% increase in the number of advertisers that were running campaigns in the U.S. from the start of 2020 to the end, though ad sales were still small compared with other major platforms. That continues to be the case in 2021. In fact, TikTok was not even broken out in eMarketer’s recent tabulation of U.S. ad revenues, where it’s instead lumped into an “Other” category with other, smaller social networks (like Tumblr), which, combined, are expected to reach $1.3 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>The company also this week announced a new milestone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">with 1 billion monthly active users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210742" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210742" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=768,760 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=680,673 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>

<h3>Apple finally lets users review its own apps</h3>
<p>Apple has put itself on equal footing with its rivals by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/">allowing users to rate and review</a> its first-party apps that are available for download in its App Store. That means users can now leave reviews for built-in apps like Mail, Music, News, Stocks and Calculator and others. Some apps are holding up better than others. News is sitting at 2.5 stars as users complain about ads, even in the paid version, personalization elements, nags to buy Apple News+ and more. Podcasts has just 2 stars, Apple Music has 3.5 stars. Fitness is doing well with 5 stars, and Wallet app has a solid 4.</p>
<p>The change likely came about due to increased regulatory scrutiny over the App Store, which critics argue gives Apple an unfair advantage over its competition. That could have included not displaying user sentiment and feedback about Apple&#8217;s own apps.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Windows store opens to third-party storefront; your move, Apple?</h3>
<p>Remember when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/apple-digs-in-heels-over-its-app-store-commission-structure-with-release-of-new-study/">Apple last year argued</a> that its commission rate wasn&#8217;t so high because the wider market for apps and games had already determined that 70/30 was a standard split? At the time, it pointed to other major app stores&#8217; policies, including the Amazon Appstore, Galaxy Store and Microsoft Store as points of comparison with its own App Store. (See below)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2020294" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2020294" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2020294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2020294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analysis Group</p></div></p>
<p>Well, Apple would probably appreciate it if everyone would look away from those app stores now. And particularly don&#8217;t look too closely at what the updated Microsoft Store is doing!</p>
<p>This June, the Microsoft Store <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">updated</a> its revenue share terms and <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2F%3Flinkid%3D528905&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cchoneck%40we-worldwide.com%7C65df3fea2a2444edec0608d9841cf255%7C3ed60ab455674971a5341a5f0f7cc7f5%7C0%7C0%7C637686082165371040%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=tY4PvkbRRRXpJCdVs8Ve9ZXEJAVG8FsxqeBzpsVUeRk%3D&amp;reserved=0">policies</a> to offer more favorable terms. App developers using Microsoft&#8217;s payments platform will now see an 85/15 revenue share, while game developers will see an 88/12 split as of August 1. More importantly, (non-game) app developers are allowed to use third-party payment processors in their own apps and retain 100% of the revenue.</p>
<p>This week, the Microsoft Store announced it will allow third-party app store apps as well. The company <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">says it will make third-party storefront apps discoverable</a> in the Microsoft Store on Windows, including Amazon and Epic Games, over the next few months. There is no requirement for these stores to also list their apps and games inside the Microsoft Store, if they choose to go this route. And they can use their own payment processors and keep the revenues.</p>
<p>While being presented as a major win for an open ecosystem, the reality from a consumer&#8217;s perspective is that this doesn&#8217;t change much. You could always download third-party apps and third-party app stores, like the Epic Games Store, on Windows devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211227" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211227" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png 1429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>But in the broader regulatory environment, it&#8217;s a deft move. It immediately reduces the potential regularity scrutiny that could have landed on Microsoft &#8212; after all, the company is still tapping into the revenue streams for the apps and games it hosts, in some cases. And it would like that to continue! However, now Microsoft will be able to say developers on its platform have choices &#8212; they can distribute their apps with their own payment mechanisms and they can package their games into storefronts to avoid commissions, too.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will point the finger back at Apple and Google as being the platforms that are being slow to catch up with where the market is headed. And it could potentially keep Microsoft&#8217;s name out of any forthcoming legal battles or new app store legislation. In the meantime, Microsoft&#8217;s expanded and redesigned store &#8212; which will include storefront apps, PWAs and alternative browsers, too &#8212; has a better shot at becoming a place where users actually want to shop.</p>
<p>The question of third-party storefronts has been a longtime point of contention between Epic Games and Apple &#8212; the gaming company wants to offer its own distribution system from within the App Store to reach iOS users and retain the revenue it generates. But this issue extends further back than Apple&#8217;s latest fight with Epic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/apple-tightens-the-noose-on-apps-for-recommending-apps-going-after-sharing-and-search-tools/">Apple has banned third-party app store apps</a> for years, as they had been used in the past as a way to artificially inflate app store rankings. The storefront apps claimed that all they offered was another way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/apple-pulls-ios-app-discovery-service-appgratis-from-app-store/">discover new apps</a>, of course. But even that was a threat. Apple has always wanted to own discovery &#8212; and the ad dollars that accompany paid discovery, too.</p>
<p>While anyone who understands app ecosystems knows that a PC platform like Windows is <em>not at all</em> a direct comparison to a closed ecosystem like iOS and the App Store, it was Apple itself that had listed Microsoft, among others, as points of comparison. Apple said &#8220;everyone else was doing x,&#8221; so it should too, when it came to commissions. Now the company will have to hope that regulators can pick up on the nuances between a Windows app store and its own.</p>

<p>I love that the App Store still supports (at least, for now) small, single-purpose indie apps like Pearl. The app is great if you&#8217;re the kind of person who gets energized by motivational quotes or just needs to be reminded to chill, be calm, breathe, work toward your goals or anything else. With Pearl, you can turn Apple&#8217;s push notification system from a thing of annoyance into a thing that brings hope and purpose. The app lets you add images to motivational quotes or any other message of your choosing to create custom push notifications that will appear randomly throughout your day. Mac, iPhone and iPad are supported. Free download with a $1.99 one-time in-app purchase for multiple notifications.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered which politicians own a stock you&#8217;re looking into? Or do you wish you could see what the WSB folks were into without having to constantly check in with that community? Maybe you like to read Reddit for crypto ideas? In other words, if &#8220;alternative data&#8221; is your thing, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quiver-quantitative/id1568546369">Quiver Quantitivative</a> is a destination that makes it easier to access, by pulling from public records and message boards and putting it all in one place. While we <em>can&#8217;t</em> recommend making investment decisions off alternative data, as a research tool, the Quiver Quantitative app is an interesting find. The app was updated this week with a new dashboard tracking stock trading by U.S. Representatives, a new dashboard tracking off-exchange trading and a new dashboard tracking Reddit cryptocurrency discussions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>As the week closed out, we had a big SPAC deal drop that I have yet to fully unpack — though I will note that <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/828571518/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/IonQ_Investor_Presentation_-_Sept_2021_Updates_v092121.pdf">its investor presentation</a> includes a slide of global leaders’ headshots, which is worth at least a silver medal in the ISPAC presentation hype Olympics — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/softbank-backed-oyo-files-for-1-16-billion-ipo/">Oyo filed to go public</a>. Expect a lot more on those matters to start next week!</p>
<p>But this fine Saturday we’re talking Y Combinator and DAOs. These are different topics, mind, as YC is most certainly not a DAO. Let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>Y Combinator, credentialism and for whom the valuation tolls</h2>
<p>In terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">Scovilles per character</a>, few tweets were as spicy this week <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1443772381567225873">was the following</a>:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most surprising thing in 2021 early-stage investing isn’t Tiger, or $500m seed funds, or rolling funds.</p>
<p>It’s that YC is still buying 7% of incredible companies for $125k.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chris Bakke (@ChrisJBakke) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1443772381567225873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Translating a bit, with more and more capital lining up to pour itself into the open maws of early-stage startups, and the recent valuation inflation that the startup market has seen, how the hell is Y Combinator still able to charge so much for its capital-and-course in startup mechanics? Brand, in part. And the guidance it provides, to some degree.</p>
<p>Being a Y Combinator-backed startup provides an imprimatur of credibility to a nascent org that may be more dream than reality. It’s a bit like a diploma from a school you are proud to have attended for uni on your wall. And, critically, for startups in emerging economies, going through Y Combinator can help put you on the investor map. So, the dilution may be worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>It’s a darn steep cost, though. You are getting way less than $200 per basis point in your startup, a price that is beyond inexpensive given the hit rate of the standard Y Combinator batch these days. It’s essentially a license to print money for the group.</p>
<p>Not that there is a problem with that, per se, as it’s just capitalism at work. But as the effective cost of Y Combinator attendance has gone up — as the gap between market prices for YC-backed companies and the value that the accelerator places on them as an admission tax <em>expands</em> — the deal is getting less attractive as more international companies take part. So, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/">rise in Indian</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">African startups</a> getting into YC is great, but it does seem that they are going to have to pay more for a more diluted program. That irks some part of my brain.</p>
<p>Still, hats off to whomever gets to LP the Y Combinator seed fund. Please enjoy your yachts.</p>
<h2>DAOs</h2>
<p>With that cranky of a start, I thank you for sticking with me for another segment. This one is a bit kinder.</p>
<p>The world of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, had two key news items this week. The <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1444022549843623937">first was hysterically funny</a>:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m worried we’re not talking enough about how funny this is. <a href="https://t.co/5W1fUBbUc2">https://t.co/5W1fUBbUc2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1444022549843623937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To catch you up, Compound made a coding error that led it to sending out tens of millions of dollars in coins out. It was a mistake. And then it tried to get the money back. By <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html">threatening to dox users</a> to the IRS if they didn’t send back their free money.</p>
<p>The issue of threatening your own user base for your own mistake aside, Compound operates along a democratic setup that decentralizes authority. You can read more about how that works <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68">here</a>, but what matters is that in the case of Compound’s error we’re seeing what happens when a <em>decentralized</em> authority fucks up in a massive, hilarious manner.</p>
<p>More errors like this will occur. They will also be funny. But I don’t think that they put me off what’s attractive about DAOs.</p>
<p>One craptastic element of today’s capitalism has been the degradation of shareholder voting power. Facebook is a prime example of a company where a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/shareholders-wont-force-zuckerbergs-hand-in-facebook-management.html">single person</a> controls its future. Snap famously went public with public shares that <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/05/26/snap-and-the-rise-of-no-vote-common-shares/">got no votes at all</a>. Dual, and even triple-class shares that award more power to insiders than external parties are, it feels, increasingly common from Silicon Valley-backed companies.</p>
<p>And it sucks. Who the fuck wants capitalism to get <em>more</em> monarchical? The very thought makes me vomit a little in my mouth.</p>
<p>DAOs, by contrast, are more democratic by nature. Sure, voting power will likely be ascribed to those with more ownership. But that’s how the stock market works on a <em>good</em> day, so it’s at least an improvement on today’s IPOs and their hilarious demand that everyone trust that the folks in charge of it today are going to be the best stewards for life.</p>
<p>VCs didn’t used to believe that. They were big on professional CEOs back in the day. Then founders got more power thanks to a changing founder-investor power balance, and after a few founder-led companies did well VCs gave up on the matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps DAOs will have some success in making business slightly more democratic!</p>
<p>The second news item this week from DAO-land was this: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/">Utopia Labs is building an operating system for DAOs</a>.” The company’s name is not bad; it’s actually almost good. Why? Because utopias are hardly fascist paradises; more often when we consider utopia a model in which everyone has a say comes to mind. So, perhaps DAOs are to some degree the business equivalent of utopian thinking. I can’t hate that.</p>
<p>That’s all for this week. Notes from a chat with CapitalG’s Gene Frantz next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s anti-competition tech crackdown continues to redefine the dynamics among the country&#8217;s internet giants, leading to collaboration between Alibaba and Tencent in the payments race. In the meantime, China&#8217;s tech giants are expanding fearlessly around the world. TikTok became the first internet firm from China to have topped 1 billion overseas users, and Tesla&#8217;s battery supplier CATL is on course to buy a Canadian lithium company to lock up critical battery components.</p>
<h2>Lithium race</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s battery-making giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, known as CATL, has made some big moves to shore up its lithium supply that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/dupont-and-vcs-see-lithium-mining-as-a-critical-investment-for-the-electric-future/">critical for electric car production</a>. The firm has agreed to acquire Vancouver, Canada-based Millennial Lithium in an all-stock cash deal valued at CAD$377 million, or $297 million, according to an <a href="https://www.millenniallithium.com/news/contemporary-amperex-technology-co-ltd-to-acquire-millennial-lithium-corp-in-an-all-cash-offer-for-cad377-million">announcement</a> made by Millennial Lithium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deal is set to secure the critical metal lithium for CATL, one of the world&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-positioned-itself-to-dominate-the-future-of-electric-cars-11572804489">largest</a> automotive battery makers. Millennial Lithium&#8217;s main exploration activity <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/millenial-lithium-corp./about/">takes place in Argentina</a>, which, along with Chile and Bolivia, forms the &#8220;lithium triangle&#8221; that holds <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/LAP_201002_vasqyez%20brief_update_v1b%5B1%5D.pdf">most of the world&#8217;s lithium resources</a>.</p>
<p>CATL has been riding the EV boom in recent years, with its revenues spiking from 5.7 billion yuan ($880 million) in 2015 to over 50 billion yuan in 2020. It struck a <a href="https://www.catl.com/uploads/1/file/public/202107/20210712132229_bxn3nxmkua.pdf">major partnership</a> with Tesla earlier this year to supply lithium-ion batteries to the American EV maker from 2022 to 2025, which will no doubt further boost its revenues.</p>

<p>The Millennial investment is just one piece of CATL&#8217;s gigantic investment empire. A few weeks ago, news came that it had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pilbara-minerals-raising/chinas-catl-buys-into-beaten-down-australian-lithium-miner-pilbara-idUSKCN1VP0GT">bought 8.5% in</a> Australian lithium miner Pilbara Minerals.

<p>This is a remarkable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">milestone</a> for ByteDance, and really, China&#8217;s tech industry overall. Up until TikTok, no social media platforms from China had been able to rival the global reach of Western giants like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>TikTok had a series of hurdles to overcome as it rose in dominance around the world, from PR crises around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">child safety concerns</a> to threats by the Trump administration to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">ban the app</a> over national security concerns. These deterrents haven&#8217;t seemed to kneecap TikTok&#8217;s growth in the West, though the app did lose a major market, India, after it was banned by the local government. It&#8217;s not a surprise that ByteDance is the fourth-largest lobbying spender in the U.S. only after Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet.</p>
<p>The question now is how TikTok can optimize monetization from its 1 billion monthly users. In China, ads and e-commerce are already major revenue drivers for TikTok&#8217;s sister short video app Douyin. TikTok is trying to beef up its content commerce business, for instance, by joining hands with Shopify to let its &#8220;business&#8221; creators easily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">showcase products</a> on their in-app mini-stores.</p>

<p>TikTok&#8217;s shopping endeavors, if successful, will also be a boon to China&#8217;s millions of small and medium e-commerce exporters. Many Chinese sellers on Amazon are diversifying sales channels amid the platform&#8217;s wave of crackdowns on black hat tactics, though they understand that in the foreseeable future, no other marketplace can match the Seattle-based behemoth&#8217;s scale.</p>
<h2>Further integration</h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been pressuring the country&#8217;s tech titans to dissolve their &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; and make their services more interchangeable. We wrote two weeks ago that WeChat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/">began allowing</a> external web links, including those from Douyin and Alibaba, to be viewed inside the messenger after the government urged apps to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/">open up</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, users noticed that apps affiliated with Alibaba, like food delivery platform Ele.me and video streaming site Youku, have added WeChat Pay as an alternative payments option to Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate Alipay. But Alibaba has yet to allow its rival&#8217;s payment system to enter its flagship marketplace Taobao.</p>
<p>Some of the collaborative efforts between the giants seem reluctant. For example, users can&#8217;t easily make purchases when viewing a Taobao link on WeChat, which defies the purpose of sharing content between apps. Inevitably, internet giants will find new ways to keep users on their platforms under the new and strict regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Hello friends and welcome to <em>bonus</em> Equity, the sort of podcast episode where you get even more chat for the same low price of zilch. We are here to ensure a high ROI for your podcasting dollar!</p>
<p>To cap the week off, Danny and Alex and Chris got together live on Twitter to chat through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/and-thats-that-as-the-zoom-deal-to-buy-five9-is-called-off/">the demise of the Zoom-Five9 deal</a>. Those of you who remember how recently the deal was announced are likely a little surprised &#8212; how did it fall apart so quickly? Well, a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There could be inherent risk in all-stock transactions provided a rapidly-changing market.</li>
<li>It may be the case that Zoom simply did not bid enough for Five9.</li>
<li>And there&#8217;s a mix of anti-trust and national regulatory issues to the deal that never got fully hammered out.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you can pick your poison, even though the answer appears to be some of each above point.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">China, the most populous nation in the world, passed its first significant data privacy legislation in August. Moving forward, any global business or aspiring startup doing any type of trade or offering services online likely will be affected because they’ll be engaging with Chinese residents covered by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/">Personal Information Protection Law</a> (PIPL).</p>
<p>Although this seems like pretty significant news, the legislation itself is similar to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was introduced in 2016. What is shocking, however, is that companies had two years to prepare for GDPR, while PIPL goes into effect on November 1, 2021.</p>
<p>This leaves companies scrambling to figure out compliance. In addition, it highlights the importance and urgency of data privacy on a global scale. China marks the 17th country to establish a <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">GDPR-like privacy law.</a> Which global superpower is not on this list?</p>
<p>The United States has yet to adopt a broad-reaching, consumer-focused national data privacy law — despite <a href="https://www.datagrail.io/blog/data-privacy-day-survey/">multiple</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/572607-majority-of-americans-support-national-data-privacy-standards-poll">studies</a> indicating that Americans want more control over their personal data online. This oversight has significant implications for the technology industry in particular.</p>
<p>With so much going on, it’s clear that we’ve reached a critical juncture in the maturation of data privacy. How we proceed will affect potentially billions of consumers worldwide as well as the development of companies ranging from the smallest startups to the biggest global enterprises. This moment demands careful consideration.</p>
<p>As such, let’s attempt to break down the present data privacy conundrum, starting first by examining how data privacy legislation is evolving in the U.S. and what this means on a broader scale, before diving into how data minimization attempts address these issues. After weighing these integral pieces of the data privacy puzzle, I will conclude by issuing a call for global data privacy standards that place people firmly in control of their data.</p>
<h2>Data privacy in the U.S.</h2>
<p>The data privacy landscape in the U.S. is complicated. In short, on the federal level, there has been movement but no overarching data privacy policy in place. There are industry-specific privacy regulations — The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) governing healthcare and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> (GLBA) covering consumer financial products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is also the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule</a> (COPPA), designed to protect children under 13. The FTC jumps into the mix as well because it can go after an app or website that violates its own privacy policy (the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act">Federal Trade Commission Act</a>).</p>
<p>But our federal government hasn’t passed a sweeping bill that protects consumers’ digital privacy rights, leaving it up to individual states to do it themselves (e.g., California’s <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, Virginia’s <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">VCDPA</a> and Colorado’s <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_rer.pdf">ColoPA</a>). This has left plenty of Americans without privacy rights and businesses confused about what they need to do.</p>
<p>Some folks argue that this is how it should be, warning that a gridlocked Congress could never pass meaningful consumer privacy legislation. Even if they do, it will be too watered down to matter, which would then negatively affect carefully constructed state laws.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is the potential of having 50 individual state data privacy laws &#8212; all similar, but likely each different in its own way, creating the nightmare scenario for businesses trying to do the right thing. Now magnify this globally.</p>
<h2>Data minimization is not the only answer</h2>
<p>One approach being bandied about to help address data privacy involves the principle of data minimization, which allows companies to collect and retain personal information only for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s a call for companies to simply collect less data. Think marketing teams reducing their intake or establishing retention schedules to purge existing data.</p>
<p>This is great for some, but for others, it can be unrealistic. Even the most consumer-friendly companies are unlikely to encourage marketers to go out and collect less personal information about potential customers, and they could nearly always find a justification for grabbing data.</p>
<p>But, the practice, even in its purest state, could be detrimental to startups that rely on personal information and preferences to develop products and grow their businesses. Data minimization in this sense could have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation.</p>
<p>And frankly, it may not even be necessary if consumers have a say in how their data is acquired and used. In some cases, consumers are OK with sharing personal information because they prefer a more personalized, bespoke experience. For example, brands like <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/stitch-fixs-ceo-on-selling-personal-style-to-the-mass-market">Stitch Fix</a> or <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/09/20/sephora-wins-at-online-personalization/">Sephora</a> ask for a lot of personal preferences upfront to provide a better shopping experience &#8212; and for many, that’s OK.</p>
<h2>A call for global data privacy standards</h2>
<p>It is my view that all of these complexities, fine lines and moving parts are surfacing and posing problems for companies and consumers because there is no global standard to get people on the same page. Until one exists, everything else is just a Band-Aid.</p>
<p>The time has come for us to develop a set of basic principles on which countries can agree so that consumers worldwide are protected and businesses know what is required of them in any geography.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it won’t be long until we’re looking at a gaggle of international data privacy laws, some more stringent than others and all just a little bit different, making it next to impossible for companies to ensure 100% compliance. It’s time to rein things in.</p>
<p>Data privacy standards would establish a baseline of fairness that spans geographic borders and works for companies at any stage. This would make it exponentially easier for companies to engage in business internationally.</p>
<p>Expect the existing spheres of influence to drive this change. Because there are massive, negative and costly implications on the line for any company that even hopes to go global, entities will work together to create common solutions. The momentum is there. Considering the footprint of China alone, it won’t be long until other countries follow suit.</p>
<p>Despite the shortfalls on data privacy here at home, even U.S.-based trade organizations are pushing forward with the first steps toward global standards. Consumer Reports, for example, has put together <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">a working group</a> to develop potential solutions. This could help fast-track global data privacy interests to protect both companies and consumers.</p>
<h2>The heart of data privacy standards</h2>
<p>Data privacy standards are now necessary, and the main thing to remember as they develop is that we must give people control over how companies handle their information.</p>
<p>Consumers deserve to know who has access to their information and why, particularly as services and applications become more connected to facilitate transactions. They should also have the right for personal data to be deleted upon request as well as to prevent companies from selling their information without permission. These are basic, universal rights; these are the things governing and supporting bodies should agree on.</p>
<p>Although marketers may grouse, it shouldn’t just be assumed that all consumers object to sharing their information. In fact, many appreciate the customization of experiences or ease of transactions that are made possible by allowing companies to collect and retain their personal information, as noted in the examples above.</p>
<p>Consumer choice ultimately creates a healthier ecosystem overall and opens up new ways for companies to build trust and transparency. It will also prevent companies from perpetually scrambling to develop and manage a slew of different mandates.</p>
<p>I foresee a future where startups are founded as privacy first. This is even likely to become a true differentiator. But the biggest element of change will be to give consumers unquestionable control of their data, no matter where they are, or the systems that contain their personal information. Data privacy standards will protect these rights in ways that other approaches can’t reasonably replicate or deploy at scale; they will eliminate confusion so that businesses can operate efficiently.</p>
<p>Once we are all on the same page through data privacy standardization, true progress can be made.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Community" has grown into one of those buzzy Silicon Valley terms over the years, but long-time advocates explain that the concept is fundamental in entrepreneurship and venture capital investments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We believe that a thriving community is a company&#8217;s most valuable asset,&#8221; <a href="https://www.communityled.com/declaration">Community-led writes in its Declaration</a>. &#8220;Community scales your business, resources and presence in ways that traditional marketing or advertising channels can&#8217;t. When done right, community enables and improves customer acquisition, streamlines support and success, bolsters retention, and provides crucial product insights. Community is the beating heart of the business that keeps the rest of the team running.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter-of-fact document, aiming to emphasize the importance of community in building a forward-looking startup, while highlighting the concept’s elasticity. But it leaves a lingering question: What, precisely, do we mean when we use the word “community” in the world of startups?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that&#8217;d be a question answered easily by a panel titled, “How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts” during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week. But if I’ve learned anything from moderating said Disrupt panels, it’s that there’s no easy answer to the question, due in part to the aforementioned elasticity. So, is this just one of those “we know it when see it” things, to paraphrase a famous Supreme Court ruling?</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on the person, the context and the company,&#8221; says Commsor&#8217;s chief community officer, Alex Angel. &#8220;But ultimately, to me, community, at its most basic, is a group of people who&#8217;ve come together with a shared purpose. That shared purpose could be your product, it could be a company, it could be a topic, it could be whatever, but they&#8217;re all there intentionally around that thing to gather and talk and learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Community&#8221; has grown into one of those buzzy Silicon Valley terms over the past few years, but long-time advocates explain that the concept is fundamental in entrepreneurship and venture capital investments.</p>
<p>“Last October, when we launched Community Fund, people were asking investors and founders in the industry, ‘What is this community thing?&#8217; It’s very fluffy,” says Lolita Taub, corporate Development VP at Catalyte, and co-founder and general partner at The Community Fund. “All of a sudden, we started seeing companies like Reddit, Peloton and Glossier become unicorns. You’re seeing the real generational wealth that exists in community-driven companies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;As a nerdy kid I loved tech and was fascinated by how business works,&#8221; says Cam Sinclair, founder of Australian growth marketing firm Ammo. &#8220;I always knew I wanted to find some way to help founders and innovators get their great ideas out into the world. After working in political campaigns, I realized that many of the skill sets overlapped with what startups need: moving fast, being lean, communicating well, being adaptable and staying flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the latest installment of our ongoing interview series with top growth experts, Sinclair tells Anna Heim that his experience in politics &#8220;inspired me to grow an &#8216;anti-agency&#8217; where startup founders could genuinely feel like they had someone on their team who understood their challenges and the risks they were taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team has been hard at work the past two weeks. We had a wildly successful Disrupt conference, with all sorts of growth-related discussions that we&#8217;ve included links to below. We also renamed Extra Crunch, our subscription service for startups, to TechCrunch+ and expanded its availability to dozens of new countries (read more about that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">here</a>).</p>
<p>First up, though, here&#8217;s not one but two interviews that Anna did with top growth marketers. If you have a growth marketing expert that you think we should know about, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/growth-marketing-is-not-a-magic-trick-says-ellen-jantsch-of-tuff/">Growth marketing is not a magic trick, says Ellen Jantsch of Tuff:</a> Anna had the chance to speak with Tuff founder Ellen Jantsch, who shares how they hire for their team, some pros and cons of hiring a marketing agency versus an in-house marketer and more. &#8220;We work with more than just e-commerce businesses; we flex into SaaS, fintech and B2B industries and it’s forced us to truly develop a model/process for growth and not just a playbook, meaning our channel and tactic mix is always different,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/australian-growth-marketing-agency-ammo-helps-startups-calibrate-their-efforts/">Australian growth marketing agency Ammo helps startups calibrate their efforts:</a> Anna spoke with Ammo about their collaboration process with startups, how they know when a startup is ready to work with them and how they help startups develop a minimum viable brand. Sinclair, Ammo’s director, says, &#8220;In the past we have described our role as making ourselves obsolete — that our clients would grow large enough to be able to hire their own in-house marketing team. Today we still retain many of these client relationships in different ways by providing more strategic advice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">(TechCrunch+) How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing:</a> During Disrupt, Jordan Crook spoke with Ryan Reynolds about his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Jordan says, “At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, we sat down with Reynolds to discuss how startups can use &#8216;fast-vertising&#8217; (a term Reynolds coined), which involves treating real-time cultural moments as a springboard, to build their own brand buzz.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[It was almost exactly two years ago that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was almost exactly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/virgin-galactic-set-to-trade-on-the-nyse-on-monday-as-the-first-space-tourism-stock.html">two years ago</a> that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic. It was the first human spaceflight company to trade on the NYSE &#8212; or any exchange, for that matter &#8212; and it was so successful, with the company&#8217;s shares trading higher and higher for so many months afterward, that it almost immediately kicked off the SPAC frenzy.</p>
<p>Consider that in the first three months of this year alone, SPACs raised $87.9 billion, exceeding the total issuance in all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research. So far, according to SPAC Insider, 450 blank check companies have been successfully formed, compared with 15 just 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the craze. Called the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/the-pied-piper-of-spacs">Pied Piper of SPACs</a>&#8221; by The New Yorker and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/the-king-of-spacs-wants-you-to-know-he-s-the-next-warren-buffett">King of SPACs</a>&#8221; by Bloomberg, he has formed at least 10 blank check companies and publicly shared plans to raise many more. (On the “All-In Podcast” that he co-hosts, Palihapitiya last year revealed he had reserved the symbols from “IPOA” to “IPOZ” on the NYSE.)</p>
<p>Of course, whenever market activity grows too feverish, retail investors <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spac-selloff-bruises-individual-investors-11621396808">get bruised</a>. Indeed, after a number of companies taken public via blank check companies were discovered to have fudged some of their numbers &#8212; in June, for example, Lordstown Motors admitted it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/">did not</a> have binding orders from customers for its electric Endurance pickup truck after all &#8212; fears have grown that SPACs don&#8217;t feature enough disclosures and that they mostly benefit the people organizing them, like Palihapitiya, who joined us last week to talk about that concern and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://rivian.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric automaker backed by Amazon, Ford and a cornucopia of heavy-hitting institutional investors like T. Rowe Price Associates and Coatue, finally made its once-confidential IPO filing </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm#toc157488_15"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which started in 2009 as Mainstream Motors before adopting the Rivian name two years later, has exploded in terms of people, backers and partners in the past few years. Rivian operated in secret for years before it revealed prototypes of its all-electric R1T truck and R1S SUV at the LA Auto Show in late 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Rivian has raised about $11 billion ($10.5 billion of which was raised since 2019); expanded its Normal, Illinois, factory; hired thousands of employees; landed Amazon as a commercial customer; and, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/electric-vehicle-company-rivian-has-confidentially-filed-for-an-ipo/">filed confidentially for an IPO</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, its S-1 is revealing more details about the company and its operations. According to its IPO filing, Rivian is officially based in Southern California, a detail that, believe or not, wasn&#8217;t so clear a few months ago. The company’s headquarters previously were listed as Plymouth, Michigan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, 2021, Rivian had 6,274 employees across the United States, Canada, and Europe, according to its filing. The company has told TechCrunch more recently that it employs more than 8,000 people, an indication that its growth is accelerating. In addition to the Illinois factory and Plymouth office, Rivian has facilities in Palo Alto and Irvine, California as well as Arizona, Vancouver, Canada, the Netherlands and the U.K.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media reports indicate that the company could pursue a valuation as high as $80 billion in its debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there are a host of backers hopeful that that number – bandied about today as pre-IPO pricing numbers often are in companies that attract significant media attention – becomes reality. The TechCrunch crew has executed an initial dive through the company’s IPO filing, looking for intricacies, gems, and possible headaches now that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve digested the news itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s talk just how expensive it is to build an EV company, why market size estimates are bullshit, what sort of voting structure Rivian intends to sport post-debut, how Amazon is a blessing and a sticking-point for the company, why services matter, and where Tesla crops up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sound good? Let’s have some fun.</span></p>
<h2>It’s expensive to build an actual EV company, despite what SPACs will tell you</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks love to say that it’s cheaper and easier than ever to found, and build a startup. They are talking about pure-play software companies. It’s still incredibly difficult and expensive to build an EV company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence of that fact can initially be spotted in the sheer scale of capital that Rivian raised while private, just to get to the point when it has started to manufacture vehicles. But the company’s income statements shared in its S-1 filing are even more illustrative of the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the company’s operating results for 2019, 2020, and the first two quarters of both this year and the last:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter wp-image-2211580 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png" alt="" width="880" height="375" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png 880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-6.25.19-PM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we didn’t make a mistake and miss the revenue line from the above graphic. It doesn’t exist since. Because Rivian has essentially zero historical revenues to report; that of course makes sense because Rivian it is just starting to deliver the first R1T trucks (revenue yay!) to customers. You can spy a dribble of income in the interest section, but that’s effectively it; Rivian has only made money thus far from simply having lots of cash, some of which generated a paltry return. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A dispute over working conditions at &#8220;new media&#8221; properties like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV and others may shut down productions across the country if a strike vote by the union succeeds. Thousands of workers on and off set claim they are not receiving appropriate wages, breaks, safety measures and other needs due to a contractual loophole exempting these companies from established film and TV production labor standards.</p>
<p>The conflict has been widely covered in the entertainment press, with celebrities and studios voicing their support and countless workers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ia_stories/">sharing horror stories</a> from jobs on these productions.</p>
<p>The issue, as explained by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, or IATSE, is a 2009 agreement made when companies like Netflix were just starting to get into original productions and didn&#8217;t have the kind of labor infrastructure that  established studios did. The economics of these &#8220;new media&#8221; companies being &#8220;uncertain,&#8221; it was decided that &#8220;greater flexibility&#8221; would be afforded to them in on-set matters where union rules might impede new and untested entrants.</p>
<p>But that same agreement noted that once these services became more economically viable, then a new agreement should take its place acknowledging that. <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-amptp-to-make-a-deal-with-behind-the-scenes-workers">That time, the IATSE says, has come.</a></p>
<p>And who could possibly disagree? Netflix is now an industry powerhouse, and billions are being spent by Disney, Apple, and Amazon on some of the most high-profile media productions ever attempted. Yet because they are &#8220;new media,&#8221; the gaffers and grips on, say, something like the next season of <em>Jack Ryan</em> or <em>Bridgerton</em> don&#8217;t have the same guarantees of lunch breaks, hour limits, or proper scale wages as an &#8220;old media&#8221; production. (Note: I originally listed the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as an example but this was poorly chosen, as it is a New Zealand-based production and not using IATSE union workers.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211542" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211542" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2211542" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png" alt="Screenshot of Instagram posts describing bad conditions on TV and movie sets." width="1024" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iatse-stories.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2211542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IA_stories / Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that every production under these companies is hell — a lot depends on the producers — but the lack of guarantees has produced what many workers describe as systemic exploitation. It&#8217;s taken for granted that they will work longer hours than they are officially paid for, skip holidays and weekends, and so on, while earning less than they would for equivalent work on a production under, say, Universal or A24.</p>
<p>Much ink has been spilled on the huge production efforts of these companies, dropping billions to compete with one another over lucrative subscribers. Each company has dozens of shows being produced simultaneously and on breakneck schedule in order to satisfy the seemingly bottomless demand for content. If we don&#8217;t get a new <em>Stranger Things</em> season in time, there&#8217;s a good chance something will become &#8220;the new <em>Stranger Things</em>&#8221; and eat Netflix&#8217;s lunch, or rather popcorn.</p>

<p>Comparatively little has been written in the tech world about the human cost of these productions — after all, that&#8217;s more on the &#8220;entertainment&#8221; beat. But it&#8217;s par for the course with tech companies to claim the benefits of &#8220;innovation&#8221; while washing their hands of the repercussions; hardly a week goes by that we don&#8217;t hear about some horrible new consequence due to a feature or policy at Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber, DoorDash or any number of other companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to hear that some of these same companies are fostering an exploitative work environment — many of them rely on one already!</p>
<p>At any rate, negotiations between the IATSE and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have stalled and the union has formally asked its workers to vote on whether to initiate a strike. If it&#8217;s a &#8220;yes&#8221; when the votes are counted in a few days, there will probably be one last chance for &#8220;new media&#8221; to make a satisfactory proposal before a huge number of productions are halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are united in demanding more human working conditions across the industry,&#8221; said IATSE president Matthew Loeb in a press release today. &#8220;If the mega-corporations that make up the AMPTP remain unwilling to address our core priorities and treat workers with human dignity, it is going to take the combined solidarity of all of us to change their minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly almost everyone involved would prefer not to have to strike, though it would be an impressive demonstration of organized labor&#8217;s power to disrupt a plainly hostile industry. Here&#8217;s hoping negotiations succeed at last and the production professionals being trodden on by this new crop of media overlords get the breaks they deserve.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 1, 2021! What a week, y’all. With the third quarter of 2021 now behind us, it’s time to gird ourselves for earnings season, new VC data drops and what we hope — pray? — is one more IPO cycle before the year ends. And with the holiday season starting in roughly 1.5 months, there’s not <em>that</em> much time left. So, make sure you’re reading your friendly neighborhood TechCrunch. We’ve got you covered. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/twitter-ban-in-nigeria-to-be-lifted-if-platform-sets-up-a-local-office-and-pay-taxes-president-says/">Nigeria may unban Twitter:</a> </strong>After fail-whaling Twitter across the country, the Nigerian government may unblock the social service if it meets certain conditions. Some have been agreed to. Others appear less certain, like Twitter building an office in the country. We’ll see, but the Nigerian beef with Twitter matters as we have seen other nation-states quash the service to varying degrees; China does so fully, for example, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/">India has leaned into the intimidation side of influence</a>. In other Twitter news, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/twitter-for-professionals-will-begin-to-roll-out-this-week-for-businesses-and-creators/">has a service for professionals coming out</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/startups-have-more-options-than-ever-to-lower-their-reliance-on-venture-capital/"><strong>Startups find money outside venture circles:</strong></a> TechCrunch spends quite a lot of time tracking the financial flows between startups and their venture backers. But not all dollars and yen that flow to startups come from the sale of equity. And the methods by which startups can raise alternative funds are becoming increasingly mature. This is good news for upstart tech companies around the world. (More on the pace at which capital is flowing <em>into</em> startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/softbank-backed-oyo-files-for-1-16-billion-ipo/"><strong>Oyo files to go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Perhaps the Q4 IPO cycle will be, as they say, lit? Oyo is at least jumping into the mix with a public offering that could raise more than $1 billion. TechCrunch has a dive into the filing in the link; recall that Oyo is a SoftBank-backed company that hit some growth issues over the last few years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/all-day-kitchens-wants-to-expand-every-independent-restaurants-delivery-network/"><strong>Megabucks for ghost kitchens:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s a brand-new sentence, I reckon. Regardless, the news today is that All Day Kitchens, which operates a network of ghost kitchens for smaller restaurants to leverage for delivery prep, has raised a $65 million round. Precisely why <em>venture</em> capital is the right choice here is somewhat opaque, but the new capital brings All Day Kitchens’ historical fundraising to more than $100 million, a sum that is impressive for the food space.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/productwind-raises-1-67m-to-connect-your-brand-with-hundreds-of-influencers/"><strong>Smallerbucks for influence connecting:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The influencer economy is still going strong, it appears, with fresh evidence coming today in the form of a $1.67 million round being raised by ProductWind. The startup “aims to connect brands with influencers in one click,” TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/"><strong>DAOs, utopial thinking and you:</strong></a> The DAO space, or the market for decentralized autonomous organizations, is hot in that it’s something that tech folks are thinking and talking about. And funding, it turns out, as Utopia Labs has put together $1.5 million for its infrastructure work for DAOs. DAOs are a hybrid of capitalism and democracy, implying a future where the two are in closer harmony. Hence “utopia” in the name. You won’t find snark about utopia in this newsletter, or aspirations thereof. As Oscar Wilde said, <em>“</em>A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.<em>”</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/leadiqs-rapid-revenue-growth-snags-venture-attention-capital/"><strong>LeadIQ just landed a $30 million round for its sales software:</strong></a> LeadIQ helps save sales reps time by handling some of their rote entry, freeing those folks up for more creative work. And the startup has plans to better unite sales and marketing teams’ data, which its CEO reckons could help boost sales numbers.</li>
<li>From the TechCrunch+ side of things, we have pieces from Disrupt that cover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">our talk with Reid Hoffman on blitzscaling</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/where-and-when-to-spend-your-recently-raised-dollars/">startups can spend their newly raised capital</a> (and what the hiring market is doing to profligacy!) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/battery-chemistry-company-silas-founder-gene-berdichevsky-on-the-science-of-scaling-up/">how to scale science</a>.</li>

<h2>Ben Rubin explains why the Web3 era of social media will help everybody get paid</h2>
<p>Web3 is still taking shape, so it is hard to define.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, Houseparty founder Ben Rubin emphasized decentralization as Web3’s central feature. In today’s Web 2.0, individuals give money and personal data to network operators in exchange for access to information.</p>
<p>“In Web3 there is a possibility — not saying that it’s going to actually 100% gonna happen — but there is a possibility where the network owns the network,” said Rubin. “And that’s, I think, the simplest way, the shortest way I can explain it.”</p>
<p>In conversation with reporter Taylor Hatmaker, Rubin said NFTs show that individuals can benefit from Web3 adoption, while decentralized finance and cryptocurrency trading are more commercialized forms.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s going to be a better incentive alignment than we have right now. And that will create competition on incentive alignments with their users,” said Rubin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Rivian, which started deliveries of its R1T pickup truck in September, released its filing to become a publicly traded company in the United States.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The S-1 document <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/d157488ds1.htm#toc157488_1">filed Friday</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not include terms for its offering.</p>
<p>The filing — one of the most anticipated of the year — shows a company burning through cash as it takes on the mammoth effort of designing, developing, producing and then selling electric vehicles. The S-1, the document where companies disclose financial data, risks and opportunities, also provides insight into its expansion, relationship with Amazon and spending projections.</p>
<p>Rivian reported a net loss of $426 million in 2019. Those losses more than doubled to $1 billion as the company built out its factory in Normal, Illinois, prepared to begin producing its R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV and expanded its workforce. Its S-1 states that it employed 6,274 people as of June 30. However, the company recently told TechCrunch it employs more than 8,000 people across several facilities in Arizona, California, Michigan, Illinois, Vancouver, Canada and the UK.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian&#8217;s losses grew as it approached production of the R1T and R1S. The company posted a net loss of $994 million in the first half of 2021 alone, far more than double its $377 million net loss the company posted in the same period of 2020. Rivian&#8217;s R&amp;D expenses are driving the spike in costs. </span>The company spent $766 million on R&amp;D in 2020. In the first half of 2021 the company spent $683 million on R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Those costs are projected to grow. Rivian said it expects cumulative spending on capital expenditures to be about $8 billion through the end of 2023 as it invests in and builds out infrastructure, including additional manufacturing capacity, battery cell production, service operations, charging networks, retail and software development.</p>
<p>Rivian outlined its long-term business strategies, its plan to first sell its EVs and the United States and Canada and then soon expand to Western Europe. Sales in Asia will follow. Rivian said in its S-1 that it will build local facilities to support growth into those new markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rivian also disclosed it had 48,390 preorders for its R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs in the United States and Canada as of September. Pre-orders, which requires a refundable $1,000 deposit, don&#8217;t always convert to sales. However, they can provide an indication of demand for the product.</p>
<p>The company said in its S-1 that it has also established a philanthropic mission called <span class="il">Forever. Initially, the company will fund the entity with shares of Rivian&#8217;s </span> Class A common stock equal to 1% of the company&#8217;s outstanding equity immediately preceding the completion of this offering.</p>
<p>For a more detailed breakdown of the S-1, check out:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most big accelerators tend to dedicate some of their resources to dauntingly hard science problems and the companies taking them on&#8230; but for SOSV&#8217;s <a href="https://indiebio.co">IndieBio</a>, it&#8217;s the primary focus.</p>
<p>Last time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/from-improving-cancer-treatments-to-saving-the-bees-these-are-the-companies-in-indiebios-latest-class/">we checked in with IndieBio</a>, their companies were working on everything from lozenges to treat gum disease, to vertical farms for the sustainable production of shrimp, to saving the bees.</p>
<p>While IndieBio&#8217;s next Demo Day is still a few months out, the companies in their next New York batch have been selected and are already chipping away at a whole new set of problems — things like battling opioid addiction, improving crop yields amidst climate change, or making better/safer leather alternatives from stuff we&#8217;d otherwise throw away.</p>
<p>I hopped on a call with IndieBio NY’s Chief Science Officer Julie Wolf, who told me a bit about what each company in this latest New York batch is working on. <strong>Here&#8217;s my understanding of each company in the new class, in alphabetical order:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ceragengrow.com">Ceragen</a>:</strong> Making a microbe-based &#8220;inoculant&#8221; that improves crop production in hydroponic greenhouses, using beneficial bacteria to help plants increase heat resistance, battle root rot and more. The team says they&#8217;ve seen yield increases of up to 20% in tomatoes (think more fruit, not bigger fruit.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue, but to do that you require customers. So how do you convince someone to bet on you?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New companies face innumerable challenges around fine-tuning their product and constructing the appropriate revenue model. You may be looking ahead to raising some funds and trying to juggle the administrative aspects of running a business, but before all that, the purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue.</p>
<p>But to do that requires customers, so how do you get someone to take a chance with you?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we convened a panel of three technology industry veterans at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week. The panel included Kate Taylor, head of customer experience at Notion; Pablo Viguera, co-CEO and co-founder of Belvo; and Vineet Jain, CEO and co-founder of Egnyte.</p>
<p>Beyond their body of experience in helping build successful startups, each of these panelists&#8217; companies have taken a very different approach to generating revenue. Egnyte, a content storage and management platform, is more of a straight enterprise sale, while Notion, a collaboration and content organization tool, uses the freemium model and then upsells to paid subscriptions with additional features. Belvo, for its part, is a financial services API provided to developer organizations and is monetized when the API is added to products and people use them.</p>
<p>Viguera says you shouldn&#8217;t try to do too much with the product initially. Get something out the door and get customers to tell you what they think. &#8220;In the early days, the v1 that you&#8217;re shipping, that you&#8217;re building, will hardly be anything like what you have two years down the road or 10 years down the road. So focus on getting a lot of feedback, not only in the early days, but over time. Really build in those feedback loops and be really deliberate about seeking feedback, even if it&#8217;s a complex business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Taylor says, you can&#8217;t let customer feedback push and pull you in too many directions. You have to find a set of committed users and let that core help you guide the product. &#8220;[You have to] manage the distractions, because there are a lot of different ways that you can take the product, and a lot of different feedback that you&#8217;ll hear. So find those engaged voices, and the people you&#8217;re going to bring in the circle that are helping you understand where to grow,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The possibilities of Web3 are fascinating, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web3 is still taking shape, so it is hard to define.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, Houseparty founder Ben Rubin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/what-is-web3-disrupt-ben-rubin/">emphasized decentralization as Web3’s central feature</a>. In today’s Web 2.0, individuals give money and personal data to network operators in exchange for access to information.</p>
<p>“In Web3 there is a possibility — not saying that it’s going to actually 100% gonna happen — but there is a possibility where the network owns the network,” said Rubin. “And that’s, I think, the simplest way, the shortest way I can explain it.”</p>
<p>In conversation with reporter Taylor Hatmaker, Rubin said NFTs show that individuals can benefit from Web3 adoption, while decentralized finance and cryptocurrency trading are more commercialized forms.</p>

<p>“It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s going to be a better incentive alignment than we have right now. And that will create competition on incentive alignments with their users,” said Rubin.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting discussion that helped me better understand the topic, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.</p>
<p>We have many more Disrupt recaps to come in the next few days, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>On a personal note: I celebrated my second anniversary at TechCrunch yesterday, and I’d like to thank the incredible team I work with for making all of this possible!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading,</p>

<p>It’s the beginning of Q4, so Alex Wilhelm couldn’t help but get an early start on parsing Q3 data. For Thursday’s Exchange, he looked at preliminary data out of India and China.</p>
<p>“The trendlines appear clear,” he writes.</p>
<p>“One more great quarter from India and a modest decline in China could see the former dethrone the latter for second place in the global startup market fundraising ranks.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to find actionable, proven advice for scaling startups.</p>
<p>That’s because only 7% of the startups that raise seed rounds are able to grow their companies enough to land a Series C investment, according to a Dealroom study.</p>
<p>To create a framework for founders who are charting a path from $1 million to $25 million in annual revenue, Arthur Nobel, a principal at Knight Capital, conducted 47 interviews with founders and investors who’ve taken startups from Series A to C.</p>
<p>More than an overview, the article offers approaches for navigating the challenges of T2D3 (triple, triple, double, double, double) growth, specific hiring recommendations and other strategic insights.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the post also includes steps and visualizations you can use to create your own scaling roadmap.</p>
<p>“The takeaway is to initially figure out in which stage your company and departments are in and only do what is required for that stage,” writes Nobel.</p>

<p>Startup founders have more options than in years past when it comes to fundraising, thanks in large part to a surplus of liquidity. Besides traditional VC, crowdfunding, venture banks and venture debt funds are all viable options.</p>
<p>In a detailed overview of venture debt options, Andy Weyer, managing director of technology at Runway Growth Capital, shares three use cases depicting how debt capital can benefit borrowers hoping to retain leverage for future rounds or access working capital.</p>
<p>“Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle,” advises Weyer.</p>

<p>There is no level playing field in capitalism, but it is easier than ever for a scrappy startup to go head-to-head with industry leaders.</p>
<p>Warby Parker is reshaping consumer expectations about eyewear, just as Poshmark and ThredUp made a direct run at eBay and the luxury resale market.</p>
<p>In a world where customers are more loyal to value than branding and 18-month roadmaps are the norm, startups that develop solid competitive plans have an advantage, says Sudheesh Nair, CEO of business intelligence company ThoughtSpot.</p>
<p>“Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry,” he writes for TechCrunch+. “They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.”</p>

<p>End users and regulators are increasingly unhappy about how tech companies slice and dice our personal data. Many countries and regions have been enforcing new privacy guidelines, and consumers are embracing privacy features that make it harder to track them for targeted advertising and market research.</p>
<p>According to Ted Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins who focuses on cybersecurity and enterprise software, companies should consider shifting to pattern analysis.</p>
<p>“Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence,” he says.</p>
<p>“Real-time analysis can help companies identify patterns of behavior to understand how customers engage, and why — all while protecting their privacy.”</p>

<p>“What follows is a dive into the IPO pricing issue and how startups are looking to get around the matter through alternative listing mechanisms,” he writes, adding that the column closes with notes from an interview with Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates.</p>
<p>“If you care about the value of private companies and how they are priced, this is for you. If you do not, please read anything else; you are going to be bored out of your socks.”</p>

<p>Roham Gharegozlou has been betting on the potential success of NFTs for years. This year, it happened.</p>
<p>Gharegozlou and the team at his startup, Dapper Labs, shipped the blockchain world’s first popular game, CryptoKitties, back in 2017.</p>
<p>The startup then launched NBA Top Shot late last year, and it promptly caught fire and brought worldwide attention to the crypto collectibles space.</p>
<p>Lucas Matney caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.</p>
<p>“I knew it would be fast, but NBA Top Shot went from 4,000 to 400,000 users in a matter of weeks,” Gharegozlou said.</p>

<p>Two things are true: Edtech companies are looking for ways to grow their valuations, and a strikingly high percentage of employees are dissatisfied in their current jobs and hope to make a change.</p>
<p>“Employers are under fresh pressure to retain talent, which has made some turn to more comprehensive and creative benefits,” writes Natasha Mascarenhas in an article about new offerings from MasterClass and Outschool meant to help workers develop soft skills.</p>
<p>“Think a class on the art of negotiation by Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, or a lesson on effective and authentic communication by Robin Roberts, a ‘Good Morning America’ anchor,” she reports. “The value proposition, therefore, is more about complementary skills that could develop or upskill a workforce.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm takes a look at direct-to-consumer eyewear company Warby Parker, which direct listed this week.</p>
<p>“The company not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“For the DTC market, the results partially combat the odor that 2020’s ill-fated Casper IPO left lingering around the startup business model category.”</p>

<p>Following last week’s TechCrunch Disrupt event, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim considered startups’ various options for fundraising beyond venture capital.</p>
<p>They pulled notes from a Disrupt panel on revenue-based financing “to help frame our thinking around venture capital investment, and when startups may want to pursue other methods of funding.”</p>
<p>“With alternative capital concerns like Pipe attracting top talent while expanding to new markets, and Clearbanc rebranding to Clearco while raising $100 million earlier this year, it’s clear that the market for funds outside of traditional venture checks is maturing. Let’s talk about it.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve had your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">iPhone set up to unlock with your Apple Watch</a> and recently upgraded to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">an iPhone 13</a>, a software bug may have prevented you from continuing to use this. Thankfully, a fix is here and once you install it, you shouldn&#8217;t have to resort to Face ID (or worse, typing in your passcode) anymore. The latest iOS 15 update (iOS 15.0.1) is here and according to the changelog, it brings bug fixes &#8220;including an issue where some users could not unlock iPhone 13 models with Apple Watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple added the unlock with Watch feature in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">watchOS 7.4 earlier this year</a> to make it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">easier to get into your iPhone</a> while you&#8217;re out and masked up. This feature later got broken with a subsequent iOS and update and required <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-7-1-apple-watch-unlock-with-iphone-fix-191917256.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">another over-the-air package</a> to fix. Apple recently acknowledged that this was also not working on some iPhone 13 models, and said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-iphone-13-unlock-bug-fix-174529852.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">would roll out a solution soon</a>. The iPhone 13 only started being available on September 24th, so this issue was at least caught early. Though it&#8217;s nice that the update is here days later, it&#8217;s interesting to see the trouble the company has had with this feature in the last few months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal," said Hoffman. "Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman first coined the term &#8220;blitzscaling,&#8221; he kept it simple: It’s a concept that encourages entrepreneurs to prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty. Years later, founders are navigating a pandemic, perhaps the most uncertain period of their lives, and Hoffman has a clarification to make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal,&#8221; Hoffman said during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. &#8220;Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.&#8221; Instead, he said, blitzscaling is a choice companies may have to make for a set period of time to outpace a competitor or react to a pandemic rather than a route to take from idea to IPO.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean startups should avoid prioritizing breakneck speed, especially in industries like fintech and edtech, where the pandemic spotlighted a lot of potential. Instead, Hoffman thinks the pandemic’s real impact on his definition is that “the benchmark for what you may need to do in order to outpace your competitors to scale in an ecosystem may have changed.”</p>
<h2>A lot of new money</h2>
<p>Hoffman’s broadened view of blitzscaling blends well with his firm’s recent announcement of a <a href="https://greylock.com/firm-news/500m-for-seeds/">$500 million seed fund</a>. The close came weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">Andreessen Horowitz closed its own $400 million seed fund</a>.</p>
<p>Greylock claims that its new fund is &#8220;the largest pool of venture capital dedicated to backing founders at one,&#8221; and explicitly said that it is &#8220;willing to write large seed checks at lean-in valuations, which gives companies more runway to hit milestones without taking on additional dilution.&#8221; It’s fair to say that Greylock&#8217;s checks could help seed-stage startups afford to blitzscale while still prioritizing runway and other business-oriented resources.</p>
