<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I have an early-stage startup. We’re having a really tough time recruiting engineering talent, but we’re open to hiring internationally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Any suggestions on strategies and how to help our company stand out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Flourishing Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Flourishing,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out! I recently invited <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethscheer/">Beth Scheer</a>, head of talent at <a href="https://homebrew.co/">Homebrew Ventures</a>, for a chat on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/093-recruiting-with-beth-scheer/">podcast</a>. Scheer serves as an adviser to startup founders and executive teams on all things under the talent umbrella. She sees her job as “teaching founders to fish.” She shared her insights on recruiting talent, the importance of diversity and inclusion, and compensation:</p>
<p>“One of the things I say in my first meeting with, let’s say two co-founders,” Scheer said, “is until you raise your [Series] A, you will spend about 40% of your time on recruiting. And they’ll look at me and say, ‘Oh, that’s not so bad, that’s 20% each.’ And I say, ‘No, no, no, that’s 40% each person.’ And that’s when they realize how hard it is, and that’s always been the case no matter what type of [hiring] market. People underestimate how hard it is. And right now, in this market, it’s a lot harder.”</p>
<p>As you’ve discovered, competition, particularly for engineering talent, is extremely intense right now, with job candidates firmly in the driver’s seat. According to <a href="https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Updated-Employment-Data-for-Computer-Occupations-September-2021.NFAP-Policy-Brief.September-2021.pdf">an analysis</a> by the National Foundation for American Policy, there were more than 1.2 million unique active job vacancy postings in computer occupations in the United States as of September 6, 2021, up 15% from six months earlier.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Moreover, Scheer said the startups she works with are finding that nearly every candidate they make an offer to already has at least three other offers. That means you have to be strategic and deliberate on everything from clearly articulating your value proposition and mission statement to the makeup of your team to the benefits and compensation packages you offer.</p>
<p>As early as possible, early-stage companies need to be intentional about diversity, inclusion and equity whether the company has two male founders or two female founders.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Washington D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine has added Mark Zuckerberg to a lawsuit against Facebook over consumer privacy violations related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our continuing investigation revealed that he was personally involved in decisions related to Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s failure to protect user data,&#8221; Racine said of the decision to name Zuckerberg in the suit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My office filed our lawsuit in 2018, and since then, we’ve reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of documents produced in litigation and completed a wide range of depositions including former employees and whistleblowers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Racine noted that his office has reviewed &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of documents and conducted numerous depositions with former employees <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/facebook-washington-dc-attorney-general-sues-over-cambridge-analytica/">since filing the suit in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>The D.C. AG filed the suit in 2018 following revelations that the company allowed British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to collect profile data on more than 50 million Facebook users without their consent.</p>

<p>The decision to name Zuckerberg is notable due to the fact that it could expose the Facebook founder to personal liability for the first time in a suit brought by a government entity in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lawsuit is about protecting the data of half of all District residents and tens of millions of people across the country,&#8221; Racine said. &#8220;We’ve taken our obligation to investigate wrongdoing very seriously — and Facebook should take its responsibility to protect users just as seriously.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Udemy's slowing revenue growth is not bullish for edtech valuations more broadly; the company's modest resulting revenue multiple is also somewhat beige.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Online education company Udemy this morning set an initial IPO price range for its upcoming debut.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based edtech unicorn &#8212; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/udemy/company_financials">backed by</a> Learn Capital, Insight Partners and Norwest, among others &#8212; <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001607939/000119312521302492/d163445ds1a.htm">expects to price</a> its IPO between $27 and $29 per share. The company could be valued at more than $4 billion at the upper end of its price range. It&#8217;s a modest bump in worth for the company, which was last valued at $3.32 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/filing-online-learning-marketplace-udemy-is-raising-up-to-100m-at-a-3-32b-valuation/">during its $50 million November raise. </a></p>
<p>The pricing comes amid a busy year for edtech IPOs, which has included the public debut of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/">language learning company Duolingo</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/"> tutoring marketplace Nerdy,</a> <a href="https://marketbrief.edweek.org/marketplace-k-12/powerschool-major-ed-tech-provider-valued-3-5-billion-following-initial-public-offering/">edtech software firm PowerSchool</a> and potentially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/quizlet-plans-for-ipo-over-a-year-after-hitting-unicorn-status/">even Quizlet. </a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig into where Udemy&#8217;s IPO price range puts its potential public value in detail, and then look at new preliminary numbers for its third quarter to see what they can tell us about edtech valuations more generally.</p>
<h2>Udemy&#8217;s possible IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Udemy is selling 14,500,000 shares in its IPO, with an additional 2,175,000 shares set aside for its underwriters, if they so desire to purchase them.</p>
<p>The company will have 139,602,466 shares outstanding, inclusive of its underwriters&#8217; option, when it is public. At its current $27 to $29 per-share IPO price range, Udemy would be worth $3.77 billion to $4.05 billion in its public offering.</p>
<p>Turning to fully diluted valuations, which include fully vested stock options that have yet to be exercised, for example, Udemy is worth more. IPO-watching group <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/87502/Online-education-marketplace-Udemy-sets-terms-for-$406-million-IPO">Renaissance Capital estimates</a> that at the company&#8217;s midpoint valuation &#8212; $28 per share &#8212; the edtech giant is worth $4.3 billion.</p>
<p>Quick math provides us with a fully diluted valuation at the <em>upper</em> end of the company&#8217;s price interval of $4.45 billion.</p>
<p>Each valuation is an improvement on the company&#8217;s final private valuation, set during a $50 million late-2020 Series F. At that juncture, the company was worth $3.25 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/udemy-series-f--dafd7d75">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<h2>Does that pricing make sense?</h2>
<p>In its new S-1/A filing, Udemy detailed its financial performance through the first nine months of 2021, an upgrade from its first filing that only included data through Q2 of this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been steadily rolling out updates to Facebook Groups aimed at giving admins better ways to manage and moderate their online communities. Recently, this has included a combination of product releases &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-group-admins-including-automated-moderation-aids/">access to automated moderation aids </a>and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/facebook-rolls-out-new-tools-for-group-admins-including-automated-moderation-aids/"> alerts about heated debates</a> &#8212; as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-tries-to-clean-up-groups-with-new-policies/">new policies</a> aimed at keeping Groups in check. Today, Facebook says it&#8217;s introducing two other changes. It will now enforce stricter measures against Group members who break its rules and it will make some of its removals more transparent, with a new &#8220;Flagged by Facebook&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>Specifically, Facebook says it will begin to demote all Groups content from members who have broken Facebook&#8217;s Community Standards anywhere across its platform. In other words, bad actors on Facebook may see the content they share in Groups downranked, even if they haven&#8217;t violated any of that Groups&#8217; rules and policies.</p>
<p>By &#8220;demoting,&#8221; Facebook means it will show the content shared by these members lower the News Feed. This is also called downranking and is an enforcement measure Facebook has used in the past to penalize content it wanted less of in News Feed &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/facebook-anti-clickbait/">clickbait</a>, spam, or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/29/facebook-news-feed-change/">posts from news organizations</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221027" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, Facebook says these demotions will get more severe as the members accrue more violations across Facebook. Because Facebook algorithms rank content in News Feed in a way that&#8217;s personalized to users, it could be difficult to track how well such demotions may or may not be working going forward.</p>
<p>Facebook also tells us the demotions currently only apply to the main News Feed, not the dedicated feed in the Groups tab where you can browse posts from your various Groups in one spot.</p>
<p>The company hopes this change will reduce members&#8217; ability to reach others, and notes it joins existing Groups penalties for rule violations that include restricting users&#8217; ability to post, comment, add new members to a group or create new groups.</p>
<p>Another change is the launch of a new feature called &#8220;Flagged by Facebook.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221103" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221103" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2221103" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Flagged-by-Facebook.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221103" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This feature will show Group admins which content has been flagged for removal before it&#8217;s shown to their broader community. Admins can then choose to remove the content themselves or review the content to see if they agree with Facebook&#8217;s decision. If not, they can ask for a review by Facebook and provide additional feedback as to why they believe the content should remain. This could be helpful in the case of automated moderation errors. By allowing admins to step in and request reviews, they could potentially protect members ahead of an unnecessary strike and removal.</p>
<p>The feature joins an existing <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/new-tools-to-help-group-admins-manage-their-communities/">option to appeal</a> a takedown to the Group admins, when a post is found to violate Community Standards. Instead, it&#8217;s about giving admins a way to be more proactively involved in the process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Facebook, systems like this only work when Groups are actively moderated. That&#8217;s not always the case. Though Groups may have admins assigned, if they decide to stop using Facebook or managing the Group but don&#8217;t add another admin or moderator to take over, their Group can plunge into chaos &#8212; particularly if it&#8217;s larger. One group member of a sizable group with over 40,000 members told us their admin had not been active in the group since 2017. The members know this and some will take advantage of the lack of moderation to post anything they want, at times.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how Facebook&#8217;s Groups infrastructure is still largely a work-in-progress. If a company was building a platform for private groups from scratch, policies and procedures &#8212; like how content removals work, or the penalty for rule-breaking, for instance &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t likely be years-later additions. They would be foundational elements. And yet, Facebook is just now rolling out what ought to have been established protocols for a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/new-facebook-groups/"> product that arrived</a> in 2010.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global shipping and freight industry has never been more in the spotlight, as the pandemic and other disruptions have led to enormous supply chain bottlenecks. While trucking logistics company Flock Freight can’t solve the global supply chain crisis, it could help get goods to their destinations faster and with less waste.</p>
<p>Less than a year after it closed its Series C, the company has raised a $215 million Series D round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, making it the industry’s most recent unicorn at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Flock Freight has developed a software-driven “shared truckload” service called FlockDirect &#8212; think of it as carpooling for shipping customers, letting them pool their goods and avoid terminals and hub transfers in the process. By using probability pricing algorithms, the company pools midsized freight from multiple shippers that are all heading in the same direction.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to the company, both customers and vehicle haulers benefit: customers by avoiding costs associated with repeated loading and unloading, as well as paying for trailer space they don’t actually need; and haulers by filling their trucks to capacity. Flock Freight offers additional savings through its “prebate” program, an incremental cost-savings program for freight that is less than 40 feet and 36,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The savings aren’t just monetary. Flock Freight says its tech reduces carbon emissions &#8212; as much as 40% &#8212; compared to the traditional hub-and-spoke shipping system. The company estimates that it has eliminated more than 15,000 tons of emissions to date.</p>
<p>The six-year-old startup is also aiming to use the funds to expand its operations and to hire, especially in Chicago, where it will open a new office this year.</p>
<p>SoftBank was an early investor in Flock Freight, leading its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-volvo-back-flock-freight-with-113-5m-to-help-shippers-share-the-load/">$113.5 million Series C last year</a>. In addition to the Japanese firm, this latest round also saw participation from new minority investor Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, as well as Eden Global Partners. Existing investors SignalFire, GLP Capital Partners and Alphabet’s venture fund GV also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72">announced</a> on Wednesday that its news app on Fire TV is expanding local coverage to 158 cities across the U.S. The app, which launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/amazon-is-rolling-out-a-news-aggregation-app-for-fire-tv-and-tablets/">last year</a>, is a customizable news aggregator preinstalled on all Fire TV streaming media players and smart TVs in the U.S. It initially rolled out in 12 cities and expanded to 88 cities earlier this year.</p>
<p>Today’s expansion includes cities like Charleston, Wichita, Tucson, Reno, Raleigh-Durham, Honolulu, and Lincoln, and doubles the local stations available from 126 to 259. Amazon notes that Fire TV will automatically detect your local news station when you open the app.</p>
<p>When users launch the app for the time, they can select the news that they’re most interested in. From there, a custom playlist will be generated based on your selections. You can access local news for your city using the “Local News” tab within the Amazon news app or by saying “Alexa, play local news.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221044" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon notes that the local news channels that are launching today are in addition to the national news channels already available on the app, such as ABC News, Bloomberg TV+, Black News Channel, CBS News, CBS Sports HQ, Court TV, Estrella News, People TV, USA Today and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">Twilio bought Segment</a> last year for a hefty $3.2 billion, you knew it was going to put it to work. Today at the company&#8217;s Signal customer conference, it announced a new omni-channel marketing tool built on top of Segment called Twilio Engage.</p>
<p>Segment CEO Peter Reinhardt says the new tool is designed to take advantage of several pieces of the Twilio product family including Segment to create an entirely new cloud marketing technology (MarTech) tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re launching today is Twilio Engage, a brand new growth automation platform, built natively on Segment as the customer data platform (CDP) and natively on Twilio&#8217;s communications APIs,&#8221; he said. The goal of the new application is to help marketers to understand their customers better and provide a way to deliver more customized messaging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It starts by taking advantage of Segment, gathering customer info from over 50 data sources. Next, the piece that really drives this tool is a new journey orchestration component, which lets marketers define a workflow for each set of customers. They can then write and deliver customized messages across the different communications channels including email and SMS, which is where Twilio&#8217;s core communications APIs come into play, and they can also connect to a variety of external tools.</p>
<p>These different communications components can be delivered in the form of customized text messages, emails or ads when the journey workflow meets certain conditions or encounters certain triggers. &#8220;You can create an entire campaign now, soup-to-nuts, with all the content, all the audience creation, all the targeting inside of Twilio Engage,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As an example, say a sneaker company has a running app. Using Twilio Engage, they could set up a campaign that begins when a user logs 100 miles in the company&#8217;s app. That milestone could trigger an SMS text with a congratulatory message (using Twilio&#8217;s Communications API). If the individual is also an existing customer, the system could automatically send an email congratulating them on reaching their first goal and include a 20% off coupon. If the user was not a customer, the company could re-target them across different ad channels &#8212; Facebook, Snapchat, Google &#8212; with a similar discount and message.</p>

<p>Daniel Newman, founder and principal analyst at Futurum Research says that while the full plunge into MarTech is new, the company has had a foothold there with the CDP and its messaging platform, and he thinks it can leverage its developer community to make this move successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the CDP and MarTech environments are highly competitive, I do believe that Twilio, and it’s loyal developer community will be attracted to the company’s expanded offering as the aspirational goals of understanding your customer&#8217;s [full] journey continues to be a complex, yet increasingly possible goal for marketers and revenue leaders,&#8221; Newman said.</p>
<p>It is clear that Twilio wants to expand its platform and revenue opportunities beyond the core communications APIs the company was built on. Reinhardt says that it became clear to him and Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson that the best use case for combining the two companies&#8217; tool sets involved marketing, and that&#8217;s why they are placing this bet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke with customers, and as we looked at how folks were using the messaging API&#8217;s on Twilio and how folks were using the data on the Segment side, it was really obvious that on both sides the [biggest use case] is marketing. And there&#8217;s a lot that we could do to make that easier and better,&#8221; he said. That resulted in them building Twilio Engage.</p>
<p>It will be going into pilot with select customers today and is expected to be generally available in the first half of next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced Windows 11, it didn&#8217;t mention anything about how it wanted to annoy users with a less functional taskbar, but it did talk quite a bit about how its new operating system would feature support for Android apps. It quickly became clear, though, that the first version, which went out only a few weeks ago, wouldn&#8217;t actually support Android apps. Now, however, Microsoft &#8212; in <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/fe7771ac-f2df-42be-ac51-eb7fe0df1b5b/amazon-and-microsoft-announce-next-steps-for-bringing-the-amazon-appstore-to-windows-customers">partnership with Amazon</a> and its app store &#8212; is bringing a small subset of about 50 Android apps <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/20/introducing-android-apps-on-windows-11-to-windows-insiders/">to the Windows 11 Insider Program</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the beta build (not the dev build, because that&#8217;s on a different development cycle), you can now try apps like Amazon&#8217;s own Kindle app, The Washington Post app, Clash of Kings, Coin Master and Lego Duplo World.</p>
<p>All of this should work on AMD and Intel devices, with the apps running on what Microsoft calls the &#8216;Windows Subsystem for Android,&#8217; which itself is powered by Intel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-tech-unleashes-windows-experience.html#gs.dldf2i">Intel Bridge Technology</a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft is using the Linux Kernel and Android OS based on the open-source version of Android 11. With that, it gets virtually all of Android&#8217;s capabilities, but not some of the apps and additional functionality that Google brings to its Android build. Since that&#8217;s pretty much also what Amazon does, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that apps from the Amazon Appstore should work well on the Windows subsystem, too.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Your PC must have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#error-0x80370102-the-virtual-machine-could-not-be-started-because-a-required-feature-is-not-installed">virtualization enabled</a> and fulfill Microsoft&#8217;s overall requirements for running Windows 11, of course. You&#8217;ll also need an Amazon account to access the store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221074" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2221074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SUR22_ProX_Feature_Platinum__WithBG-scaled-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2221074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>Is any of this a game-changer? I don&#8217;t know. I have no issues reading the Washington Post on the web &#8212; and I think many parents would prefer it if their kids played Lego Duplo World on a cheap tablet anyway. If you play Clash of Kings or Coin Master, there are other questions you have to ask yourself first anyway.</p>
<p>Now if Microsoft would allow me to move my taskbar up to the top of the screen again, where it belongs, that would be nice, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter has acquired London-based Sphere, which operates an eponymous groups chat app, the latest in a series of recent moves from the social network as it looks to aggressively broaden and improve its product offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sphere.me">Sphere</a> &#8212; founded by Tomas Halgas and Nick D’Aloisio, who previously founded news summary app Summly, which he famously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/summlys-nick-daloisio-on-yahoos-approach-to-ephemerality-and-its-startup-mentality/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold to Yahoo at the age of 17</a> for a <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> $30 million &#8212; did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The startup had reportedly raised <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43a05ff4-45b0-11e9-b168-96a37d002cd3">at least $30 million</a> &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/sphere/">$11.8 million in the first two rounds</a> that TechCrunch first reported.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokesperson confirmed the Sphere acquisition news to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221054" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Much like others, we’ve been watching and admiring Twitter’s growing investment in community-building with the release of Communities, Spaces, and features that promote safety,&#8221; Sphere <a href="https://blog.sphere.me/sphere-has-joined-twitter-e7127cfe0467">said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met the team, we were even more impressed by how seriously they are pursuing interest-based community and how much they believe in its potential impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sphere said as part of the move, which will see its headcount of about 20 join Twitter, the startup will be winding down the standalone app next month. The startup didn&#8217;t disclose the number of users or customers it had amassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a long and exciting journey to this point. Like many startups, Sphere started with a very different mission — to help anyone find and share knowledge instantly through the creation of a &#8216;global brain.&#8217; We originally built a marketplace of paid experts from all around the world, connecting them through group chat,&#8221; the startup said in the blog post.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we realised is that some of the most helpful and knowledgeable conversations came from groups where members felt a strong sense of belonging to one another. In other words, at the heart of our challenge was helping every single person find their community. The opportunity is massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The move comes as Twitter has visibly become more aggressive to expand its product offerings in recent quarters. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/twitter-said-to-have-held-acquisition-talks-with-clubhouse-on-potential-4b-deal/">attempted to acquire Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twitter-spaces/">introduced a similar feature this year</a> and more recently has taken several steps to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/twitter-intense-tweet-warning-prompt/">curb unruly discourse</a> on its platform.</p>
<p>Hopefully with Sphere under its umbrella, the social giant will do something about the state of personal and group messages on its platform.</p>

<p>When working to fine-tune company culture, start from the bottom up. Don’t first dictate what the company’s culture will be and then create programs or initiatives around it. Instead, connect with employees from diverse backgrounds with varied perspectives and priorities to learn what they think and what differences they want to make in the workplace and in their communities.</p>
<p>From there, create the support, forums and opportunities for them to put forward solutions. But remember, program leaders should be careful to not assume or try to educate the masses, as social matters are localized by community.</p>
<p>Outlined below are four key ways to help diversity, equity and inclusion take root as core elements of your company’s culture:</p>
<h2>Start with an inclusive onboarding process</h2>
<p>Regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, appearance or ability, customer service teams must be provided with the training and tools needed for their own success. Not every representative’s onboarding experience should look or feel the same. Accordingly, you should design programs that take into account individual learning styles, physical accommodations and cultural considerations.</p>
<p>Navigate each training experience so they are flexible and nimble to widen the talent pool as well as minimize stressors associated with onboarding. For example, deploy microlearning tactics where millennial and Gen Z employees can learn in short and visual video clips rather than through traditional manuals or lecture formats. Or provide screen readers for employees who are visually impaired and noise-cancelling headphones for those with hearing challenges.</p>
<p>Also set clear intentions on the front end to welcome and absorb employee feedback throughout their tenure. This could include regularly scheduled check-ins with each customer service rep at every phase — day 1, 30, 60, 90, etc. — alongside a “confidence meter” to gauge how they’re feeling about their progress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneur<a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal"> Ankur Nagpal</a> spent seven years building up Teachable, a marketplace for teachers to make their online courses into full-fledged businesses. He raised only $12.5 million in funding before selling to Hotmart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/edtech-notches-a-win-as-teachable-is-acquired-by-hotmart/">a deal reportedly worth a quarter-of-a-billion dollars</a>. Now, Nagpal wants to use his experience as a founder to help other founders scale their businesses.</p>
<p>Amid a proliferation of emerging fund managers, Nagpal’s “big pitch” is that founders want to take advice from people who feel like peers, are on their level and work at their speed. In other words, entrepreneurs want investments from people who have good vibes.</p>
<p>This ethos in mind, Nagpal announced today the official launch of <a href="https://vibe.vc/">Vibe Capital</a>, a $60 million fund to back pre-seed and seed startup founders working across all sectors, but especially those working on physical and mental health. The fund will raise another $10 million post-launch, from community and other LPs via the AngelList platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220988" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Yes, there are too many funds, and yes everyone is trying to start a fund, but that does mean that it’s more likely now that founders will find investors they get along with and can really connect with,” Nagpal said. He likened the trend to what he saw happening within Teachable, where the rise of more teachers led to more students connecting with their instructors.</p>
<p>Vibe Capital thinks it can differentiate from the steady drumbeat of new emerging fund manager funds by going out of its way to back talented founders. Literally.</p>
<p>Nagpal says that Vibe Capital will make roughly half of its investments in emerging markets, because there is a shortage of operator solo GP funds focused outside of the United States. Among its first 10 investments in the fund, Vibe Capital has companies in Portugal, Kenya, Zambia, Canada, Pakistan, India and Chile.</p>
<p>The international angle is one that is personal to the entrepreneur. Nagpal is a first-generation American who has lived all over the world. He plans to move, for three to four weeks, to geographies in which he plans to invest: in December he’s spending a month in India, in January he’s spending two months in Latin America and in the spring, he’ll find a new place to live.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A key investment area of Vibe Capital will be in the world of proactive wellness, further proven by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">rise of once-nascent hormonal health startups. </a></p>
<p>“Most healthcare dollars have traditionally been spent on sickness and when things go wrong. But we are entering a time where proactive wellness is finally coming of age,” Vibe Capital’s website reads. “We are extremely interested in businesses that proactively enable people to be their best physical and mental selves.”</p>
<p>Vibe is not Nagpal’s first foray into the world of investment. He debuted an <a href="https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal/status/1429783140961247232">$11.75 million fund</a> last spring before raising today’s chunk of cash. As the entrepreneur described in a Twitter thread, portfolio performance was well above expectations: 24 companies had a priced round mark-up, and another six had a substantial SAFE markup, leading to around 70% net internal rate of return (on paper).</p>
<p>Still, he admitted that he’s unsure how much of the growth is the portfolio, and how much is simply market conditions. The bizarreness of the market, and its impact on numbers, is a sentiment shared across any emerging fund manager operating today.</p>
<p>As a founder, Nagpal also joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spearhead-launches-100m-fourth-fund-to-transform-founders-into-top-notch-vc-investors/">Spearhead</a>, a program created by AngelList’s Naval Ravikant and Accomplice’s Jeff Fagnan to help promising founders become investors. The program gives founders between $200,000 and $1 million investable capital and sets them up with legal entities to invest. Now, Spearhead is an investor in his fund. It’s proof, in some ways, that emerging fund managers can raise more than a micro-fund, and actually create an institutionally backed investment vehicle.</p>
<p>Limited partners in Vibe Capital include Bessemer Venture Partners, Tribe Capital and Foundation Capital, as well as individuals including GSV Managing Partner Deborah Quazzo, Andresseen Horowitz’s Andrew Chen, Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot, Gumroad founder Sahil Lavinigia and Sounding Board’s Christine Tao.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Commerce has announced that it will ban the export of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">hacking</a> tools to authoritarian governments in an effort to curb violations of human rights and other malicious cyber activities.</p>
<p>The rule, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">The Washington Post</a> and later confirmed by the <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private">Commerce Department</a>, will effectively ban the export or resale of hacking software and equipment to China, Russia and other countries of concern, for national security reasons, without a license from the department&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).</p>
<p>The move comes after the Biden administration in March restricted the export of U.S. technologies — including advanced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a> and software that uses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> for information security — to China and Russia as it continues to take a hard-line national security approach toward the two countries.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220950" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest sanctions are due to go into effect in 90 days and will cover software such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pegasus/">Pegasus</a>, spyware developed by Israeli firm NSO Group that several authoritarian governments have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/03/digital-violence-nso-group-spyware/">used to hack into the phones of their most vocal critics</a>, including journalists, activists, politicians and business executives.</p>
<p>Software intended for cyber defense purposes, on the other hand, is exempt from needing an export license, since the new rule won’t prevent U.S-based cybersecurity researchers from collaborating with colleagues overseas or disclosing flaws to software makers. When BIS first published a proposed rule in 2015, it received almost 300 comments that raised &#8220;substantial concerns&#8221; about the impact it would have on legitimate cybersecurity research and incident response activities.</p>
<p>The rule brings the U.S. in line with the 42 European nations and allies that are members of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which sets voluntary export control policies on military and dual-use technologies.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to working with our multilateral partners to deter the spread of certain technologies that can be used for malicious activities that threaten cybersecurity and human rights,” said Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo. “The Commerce Department’s interim final rule imposing export controls on certain cybersecurity items is an appropriately tailored approach that protects America’s national security against malicious cyber actors while ensuring legitimate cybersecurity activities.”</p>
<p>The Commerce Department — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">which last year become one of the first victims of the Russia-linked SolarWinds hack</a> — is giving the public 45 days to comment on the rule, and is seeking comments on the potential cost of compliance and any impacts it could have on legitimate cybersecurity activities. The agency will have another 45 days to make changes before the rule becomes final.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what would be a blockbuster acquisition, PayPal is reportedly exploring the purchase of social media company Pinterest, according to </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paypal-weighs-purchase-of-social-media-firm-pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the publication, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Jose, California-based PayPal has “recently approached” Pinterest about a potential buyout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing an anonymous source, Bloomberg said PayPal could pay around $70 a share, which would value Pinterest at about $39 billion.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221000" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest declined to comment on the report. PayPal had not responded to requests for comment as of press time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest’s stock jumped by about 12% on the news, trading at just above $62 by midday Wednesday. That’s still down from a 52-week high of $89.90. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rumored purchase price would be in line with Pinterest’s current market cap of $40 billion. For its part, PayPal has a market cap of $308 billion.</span></p>
<p>Last month, PayPal announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an acquisition of Paidy</a>, a Japanese buy now, pay later (BNPL) service platform, for approximately $2.7 billion (300 billion yen), mostly in cash, to enhance its business in Japan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past 18 months or so, Pinterest has made a concerted effort to expand into an e-commerce platform, launching several new features. In April 2020, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/pinterest-adds-new-shop-tabs-connected-to-in-stock-inventory-style-guides-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a new way to shop</a> on its platform, giving Pinterest users the ability to browse in-stock inventory from newly added “Shop” tabs on Search and on Pinterest boards. The company also improved visual search to make more products shoppable from Pins.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Pinterest said it was rolling out new features for advertisers and brands to promote their products to users on its site. The launch marked the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest initiative</a> to grow online shopping and advertising on its platform.</p>
<p>On October 14, Pinterest announced that co-founder Evan Sharp was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/pinterest-co-founder-evan-sharp-is-joining-jony-ives-design-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exiting his full-time role with the company,</a> where he had served as chief design &amp; creative officer, in order to join Jony Ive at his new creative collective, LoveFrom. Sharp has moved into an advisory role with Pinterest, which will focus on company strategy, product, design, brand and culture. He will also continue to serve on Pinterest’s board of directors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve been on Twitter lately, you&#8217;ve probably seen the red flag meme that&#8217;s going around &#8212; you quote a phrase that would be a &#8220;red flag&#8221; for someone to say to you, then add a bunch of red flag emojis. <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1448007008670650370">Twitter itself</a> joined in on the fun, as well as brands like <a href="https://twitter.com/drpepper/status/1448324919008403464">Dr. Pepper</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MTV/status/1448307539368570884">MTV</a> and even the NFL&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/HoustonTexans/status/1448310174096179209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1448310174096179209%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2Fred-flag-meme-takes-over-tik-tok-twitter-facebook-instagram%2F8437407002%2F">Houston Texans</a>.</p>
<p>But for blind and visually-impaired people that use screen readers and voiceover technology, the red flag meme doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Every time I saw that meme come up, I would have voiceover saying &#8216;triangular flag on a post,'&#8221; said Steve Saylor, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/BlindGamerSteve">Blind Twitch gamer</a> and accessibility advocate. &#8220;That&#8217;s technically the description of the emoji, but it ruins the meme, because this is about the color of the flag.&#8221; IPhone&#8217;s voiceover will tell you the number of &#8220;triangular flag on post&#8221; emojis, rather than reading them one by one, but some screen readers do read out each individual emoji, which means you have to hear &#8220;triangular flag on post&#8221; 48 times unless you scroll down. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220259" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p class="p1">“Memes are quite important in communication, in terms of feeling included in the conversation and being able to respond when someone posts one,&#8221; said Amy Pavel, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who researches tech accessibility. &#8220;So it&#8217;s important you understand the meaning of the meme in order to fully participate in the conversation.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://tejkohlifoundation.com/">Tej Kohli Foundation</a>, an India-based nonprofit that treats blindness in poor and underserved communities, <a href="https://tejkohlifoundation.com/emoji-access/">analyzed 100,000 tweets</a> to learn more about how emojis are used online. From its data set, 10% of tweets with emojis contain more than three emojis, and 40% of tweets with emojis repeat those emojis. In particular, the &#8220;face with tears of joy&#8221; emoji is repeated 93% of the time it&#8217;s used. The foundation recommends that people place emojis at the end of sentences, never use emojis to replace words (i.e. saying &#8220;it is very <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2600.png" alt="☀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> today&#8221; instead of &#8220;it is very sunny today&#8221;) and don&#8217;t use more than three emojis in repetition.</p>

<p>The red flag meme sparked conversations about meme accessibility last week, but this is far from the first time that a meme has made its rounds on social media despite being a nuisance for people using screen readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/clap-emoji-%F0%9F%91%8F">clapping hands meme</a> can be really tedious to read. You have to have the clapping hands after each word, so it can be difficult to remember exactly what the full sentence was,&#8221; Pavel told TechCrunch. She also referenced a social trend where people use uncommon characters to simulate writing in a different font, as well as memes made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art</a>, like the &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/52956-in-this-house-we-ascii-house-posts">in this house</a>&#8221; meme or &#8220;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6331753/sign-bunny-meme-explained">bunny holding a sign</a>&#8221; meme. &#8220;They sound completely nonsensical, because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it reads out every character and then some of those are Cyrillic characters, Greek characters or Kanji.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pavel hopes that researchers and developers can look toward using artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify common tropes in digital communication, then explain them in simpler ways on a voiceover &#8212; instead of saying &#8220;clapping hands emoji&#8221; in between each word, for example, the screen reader could say the sentence, then note that there&#8217;s a clapping emoji in between each word. But this technology has a long way to go, so in the meantime, accessibility experts are working to educate people about how to make their memes more accessible, rather than <a href="https://adrianroselli.com/2021/10/blaming-screen-readers-red-flag.html">waiting for technology</a> to catch up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I totally get the point of the meme, especially the whole red flag thing,&#8221; said Saylor. &#8220;I never want to stifle anyone&#8217;s creativity. I never want to say to anyone, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want you to use that meme.&#8217; But I just want people to think about, hey, if you want as many people as possible to enjoy the meme, make it accessible for those who need it, whether it&#8217;s adding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/facebook-and-instagrams-ai-generated-image-captions-now-offer-far-more-details/">alt text</a> for screen readers, or adding captions in videos.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of emoji-based memes and ASCII art memes, one workaround is to screenshot the meme, post it as a photo, and add alt text to describe the photo. On Twitter, adding alt text is relatively straightforward &#8212; after you upload an image, you can click an &#8220;add description&#8221; button beneath the image to add alt text before you send the Tweet. But on Instagram, on the screen before you post an image, you need to scroll down to the bottom to click a small &#8220;advanced settings&#8221; button. Then, you scroll down to &#8220;accessibility,&#8221; where you can click on a button that says &#8220;write alt text&#8221; to add an image description.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s just not enough knowledge and education out there for digital marketers and professional communicators &#8212; part of the issue is that we just don&#8217;t know about accessibility,&#8221; said Alexa Heinrich, a social media manager and accessibility advocate. &#8220;When marketers, content creators and everyday users make content, it would be helpful if they took a second to remember that not everyone experiences the internet the same way.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Heinrich and Saylor told TechCrunch that they found Twitter to be one of the more accessible social media platforms &#8212; but the bar isn&#8217;t high (somehow, Clubhouse still doesn&#8217;t have live captioning). Last summer, Twitter piloted an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/twitter-begins-rolling-out-audio-tweets-on-ios/">audio tweets</a> feature, but the clips didn&#8217;t have captions, making the tweets inaccessible to deaf and hard of hearing users. When people with disabilities pointed out the massive oversight in rolling out an inaccessible feature, it was revealed that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/">didn&#8217;t have</a> a dedicated accessibility team &#8212; rather, their accessibility efforts were coordinated on a volunteer basis by full-time employees with many other responsibilities. Since then, Twitter has established an accessibility team.</p>
<p class="p1">“Twitter is definitely the platform that tries the hardest and is most transparent about its efforts with accessibility and the platform. They&#8217;re open to feedback, which is really great,&#8221; said Heinrich. Still, Twitter has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitters-web-redesign-isnt-as-accessible-as-it-should-be-experts-say/">unveiled major updates</a> that hampered accessibility. “Platforms themselves need to do a better job of educating the brands and marketers that they partner with on how they can create accessible content,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p class="p1">According to app researcher Jane Manchun Wong, Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440409247137746950">working on</a> a feature that lets users opt-in to pop-up notifications that would appear if they&#8217;re about to post an image without alt text. Twitter confirmed to TechCrunch that it&#8217;s working on this feature, and that it is expected to roll out by the end of the year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220447" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220447" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220447" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?w=680" alt="Two identical spidermans pointing at each other" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bekphnqftcb41.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220447" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spider-Man</p></div></p>
<p>But even when users know how to add alt text, it can be tricky to figure out the best way to describe an image, especially when it comes to memes. The Spider-Man pointing meme, for example, is straightforward &#8212; Saylor said he would describe it as &#8220;two identical Spider-Man pointing at each other.&#8221; But how would you describe a meme like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/galaxy-brain">galaxy brain</a> or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/15/17351806/is-this-a-pigeon-anime-butterfly-meme-explained">butterfly meme</a>?</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially in regard to memes, what really matters is what the subject is in context of the image itself. Sometimes, it&#8217;s a little more complicated, like in a photo or an animated GIF,&#8221; Saylor said. &#8220;But you don’t have to describe everything that’s in the photo &#8212; just enough information that gets the point across. In most cases, that extra information is completely superfluous to us. Describe what the subject is, what’s in the foreground, what the context of the photo is or why you’re posting that photo, and then that allows us to be short and to the point, so the screen readers can understand what the image is without having to listen to 1,000 characters of the entire photo being described.”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, in Saylor&#8217;s description of the Spider-Man pointing meme, he doesn&#8217;t say that Spider-Man is standing on a blue floor, and that in the background, there&#8217;s an NYPD truck with an open door next to a red wall and some wooden boxes. We don&#8217;t need those details to understand the meme.</p>
<p>But accessibility isn&#8217;t one size fits all, and not all disabilities are the same. Even people with the same disability will have different preferences on how they want to experience the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think each user knows best what they would prefer, especially for accessibility, because disability is a really individual experience,&#8221; Pavel said.</p>
<p>In October 2020, Pavel published a paper titled &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3373625.3417027">Making GIFs Accessible</a>.&#8221; In her research, she offered participants multiple ways to experience an animated GIF, surveying them about which way they preferred. Earlier that year, Twitter had added alt texts for GIFs.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/JFau5y7m9pkEU" width="480" height="269" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">“I think GIFs are pretty interesting because oftentimes, a lot of them are taken from existing media that has audio. For instance, a great one is, Michael from &#8216;The Office,&#8217; yelling, &#8216;No, no, no&#8217;, and it gets longer and louder,&#8221; Pavel said. In her experiment, one version of alt text simply explained the animation in the same way one would write alt text for an image. Another iteration used the literal audio from &#8220;The Office.&#8221; The third option had a voiceover explain that this was a GIF of Michael from &#8220;The Office,&#8221; then played the audio where he screams &#8220;no, no, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The main sentiment we got back was like, &#8216;Yes, I want all of these, but I don&#8217;t want to have to pick one that&#8217;s there all the time,'&#8221; Pavel said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s all about giving the user the option to customize what they want their screen reader to do. They might want to change their settings depending on how interested they are in a GIF.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, experts say that the most immediate way to make content more accessible is for the general public to improve their own posting practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;People want to have the discussion of, &#8216;Oh, is it going to get as much engagement?'&#8221; said Heinrich. &#8220;But my answer is I don&#8217;t care. If it&#8217;s not accessible, then that&#8217;s what I care about. I care about the people, not the numbers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meditation hardware is a tricky thing. Anyone who’s been frustrated in the pursuit of mindfulness has no doubt longed for some way to short circuit &#8212; or, at very least, jumpstart &#8212; a practice. I quite liked the original Muse headband’s addition to the category &#8212; affording an almost gamified approach to focusing (trust me, it’s better than it sounds).</p>
<p>Introduced at CES 2020, the Muse S promised something even more fundamental: better sleep. When I wrote about it at the time, I was still in the very early days of testing it and, frankly, having trouble getting to sleep with a gadget on my head. I wondered aloud whether I would be able to keep it up (spoiler: I wasn’t). Today, the company is introducing a follow-up, the  simply named, Muse S (Gen. 2)</p>
<p>This time out, the product is about staying asleep as much as getting to sleep in the first place. As someone who has more trouble with the former than the latter, I can appreciate this. Certainly it’s been a theme for me during the pandemic &#8212; passing out early and waking up for a couple (or several) hours in the middle of the night. Part of me firmly believes that we weren’t <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/u-magazine/our-ancestors-probably-didn-t-get-eight-hours-of-sleep-a-night-either">wired to sleep through the night</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220924" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Muse notes that according to the CDC, more than one-third of U.S. adults don’t get seven hours of sleep a night &#8212; and honestly, that sounds low to me. The new Muse utilizes something called Digital Sleeping Pills &#8212; an odd choice of a name that uses the band’s EEG readings to deliver sleep content on waking, in an attempt to lull the wearer back to sleep. There are a number of choices there, including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Original, Classic, and Adventure Sleep Stories that have a voice narration of some of your favorite childhood stories &amp; a variety of new original stories</li>
<li>Ambient Sleep Soundscapes that offer soothing ambient music and harmonized sounds without a voice narrative</li>
<li>Biofeedback Sleep Soundscapes that offer nature sounds and music that respond to biofeedback without a voice narrative</li>
<li>Guided Sleep Meditations that have a meditation teacher guide you through a relaxing sleep meditation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The content will also be coming to Gen 1 users via a software update. Beyond this, there are some slight tweaks to the new headband, including improved accuracy and better battery life. Pricing, I think is still a major obstacle here, at $400. I suspect plenty of people would be willing to give a sleep gadget a go at a fraction of that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise engagement company <a href="https://www.countable.com/">Countable</a> raised $12 million in Series A funding so that brands can more easily engage with customers, even in a way that shows a brand’s values and stance on issues.</p>
<p>Existing investor Canaan Partners led the round and was joined by Ulysses Management and Global Catalyst Partners. In total, the company has raised about $16 million since the company was founded in 2014, Bart Myers, CEO of Countable, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In fact, the San Francisco-based company started out in solutions-based journalism, providing content around communities and people who wanted to drive outcomes. When Countable pivoted in 2017, Canaan Partners invested in the seed round and assisted the company’s transition into an enterprise SaaS organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“A lot of things are changing quickly with social media, which has become more toxic in some ways and less trustful about safety and security of its users, as well as taking away some of the controls that brands had to engage with their audience on their terms,” Myers said. “It used to be that you had free viral reach and traffic, but that has gone away, and it is now pay-for-play, which is not so good for reaching people organically.”</p>
<p>Instead, Countable is taking a cue from the positives of social media to build technology that nurtures more authentic communication and facilitates business and social outcomes. Myers considered it “like what Shopify did with the shopping cart, we are doing for community engagement.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/">How engaged are your employees?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How engaged are your employees?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/embed/#?secret=RyhaQI4KMb" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here’s how it works: The company works with brands to establish the look of their site, including goals, timelines and feedback processes. After the site launches, brands can manage their audience of employees, consumers and partners. It can promote action items beyond a “like” button and leverage Countable’s “Causes” network of more than 190 million people.</p>
<p>The company then provides analytics to the brand on how the community is growing and insights on driving revenue, retention and innovation. On the community side, members can engage with the brand, even record video testimonials and attend events around the cause.</p>
<p>Countable has made over 120 “implementations” for brands like Starbucks, which uses it for employee engagement, Uber, Patagonia, Levi’s and PG&amp;E, which Myers said uses its site to provide tips and resources to homeowners and businesses on how to prepare for emergencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We give brands a lot of power to drive engagement and measure efficacy,” he added. “They can ask for feedback or encourage their audience members to share content with friends and tie it to incentives for deployment.”</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its revenue by nearly 300%; annual recurring revenue increased 277%, and it has more than doubled its customer acquisition and site usage.</p>
<p>To continue to meet that growth and scale its business operations, Myers expects to deploy the new funding into product development, go-to-market, expanding internationally and third-party integrations. It is also serving as a launchpad for social token community exchange.</p>
<p>“Brands increasingly want to have conversations with customers, and doing more of that bears fruit everywhere,” he added. “If you have your own community, it opens doors in terms of incentivization, is a way to quantify value and give customers ways to invest more in this experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has been trying to reposition its business as a home to creators, not just a shopping inspiration site. Today, the company revealed its latest efforts on this front, which include more Snapchat and TikTok-inspired features, including a vertical video feed and plans to invest $20 million in &#8220;Creator Rewards.&#8221; It&#8217;s also announcing a series of expanded creator tools, like the ability to respond to videos with &#8220;Takes,&#8221; support for Amazon Affiliates and more, as well as the launch of original content.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">earlier this year introduced Idea Pins</a>, a video-first feature aimed at creators which is something like a mix of both TikTok and Stories. These Pins allow Pinterest users to record and edit creative videos using tools similar to those you would find on other short-form video platforms &#8212; like background music, transitions and interactive elements. The Idea Pins can be up to 60 seconds in length, but unlike traditional short-form video, video can be just one part of what the Pin offers &#8212; it can also include up to 20 pages of content per Pin, which you tap through like in Stories. This could allow a creator to explain the various steps involved in recreating their recipe or DIY project, for example.</p>
<p>Now, Pinterest is giving its home page a redesign to better highlight these Pins in a more TikTok-like format. Users can choose to either &#8220;browse&#8221; or &#8220;watch&#8221; the Pins when looking for inspiration by selecting the associated tab on the home feed. The new Watch tab will launch users into a full-screen feed of Idea Pins which you scroll through vertically and can engage with, by leaving likes and comments, or by saving the Pin for later access. Though the experience of watching these video-enabled Pins feels a lot like browsing TikTok or Instagram Reels, you can still tap through to see more of the Pins&#8217; pages, as you would with Stories, when available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>(You&#8217;ll know if the Pin has more pages as the bottom progress bar will be dashed, instead of showing you the video&#8217;s progress.)</p>
<p>Overall, the design of this Watch feed is very much TikTok-inspired, as it showcases full-screen videos and interaction buttons stacked vertically on the right. While Pinterest is varying the format a bit by offering support for additional pages, the resulting content feels very much like a Pinterest-fied TikTok feed.</p>
<p>However, one area where Pinterest could have an advantage is that it lets viewers save the Pin and organize it into your Pinterest Boards. TikTok, meanwhile, is very lacking in terms of saving and organizing the content you liked and want to refer back to, leading many users to download videos to their phone instead. This oversight on TikTok&#8217;s part could become a competitive advantage if not addressed, as many users want to save things like beauty tutorials, recipes, cleaning tips, decorating ideas and other content that overlaps with Pinterest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (Takes)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another nod to TikTok &#8212; which allows creators to interact with each others&#8217; content through features like Duets and Stitches &#8212; Pinterest is also today introducing its own creator response feature called &#8220;Takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Takes, creators will be able to respond to someone else&#8217;s Idea Pin with one of their own, where the response is linked back to the original. Think: A creator could try someone&#8217;s recipe but then offer their own variation; they could attempt to replicate the project another creator suggested, and show their results; they could show off their Halloween costume ideas and invite responses. And so on.</p>
<p>To kick off &#8220;Takes,&#8221; Pinterest is pulling in celebs to participate, including Jennifer Lopez, Megan Thee Stallion and Storm Reid. (The company has before used celebs to promote its other creator-focused efforts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">including</a> Queer Eye&#8217;s Jonathan Van Ness, during a virtual creator event this year.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220940" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220940" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, creators can add a new &#8220;Try On&#8221; sticker to their Idea Pins, which allows viewers to virtually try on lip products using augmented reality. This is a fairly common use of AR these days, as even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business/services/virtual-makeup-snapchat">Snap</a> and other beauty apps and retailers have adopted the tech. Pinterest, which has offered lipstick try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">since last year</a>, expanded to include eyeshadow try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">in early 2021</a>. The new sticker will support more than 10,000 try-on enabled products, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company is also launching its own original content series, Creator Originals, featuring over 100 creators across 10 countries, which runs now through January 2022. The creators will teach Pinterest users new skills in areas like beauty, home décor, wellness, fashion, cooking and more. Participants include <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/priscillaono/_created/">Priscilla Ono</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kellywearstler/_created/">Kelly Wearstler</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/allymisslove/_created/">Ally Love</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ZerinaAkers/_created/">Zerina Akers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kahhspence/_saved/">Kahh Spence</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/joshuaweissman/_created/">Joshua Weissman</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kiadamon/_created/">Kia Cooks</a>,<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/thematfinish/_created/"> Mat Sanders</a> and others.</p>
<p>Beyond the new product announcements, the bigger news is that Pinterest will now try to seed its network with more creator content by paying creators directly.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s launching a $20 million Creator Rewards fund in the U.S. &#8212; its first-ever in-product creator monetization program &#8212; that will pay creators for participating in its challenges issued by Pinterest. This is an expansion on Pinterest&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/"> April announcement of its $500,000 Creator Fund,</a> which offered U.S. creators compensation with funds for content creation and advertising credits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220943" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220943" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220943" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (creator rewards)</p></div></p>
<p>Access to Creator Rewards is available through the new &#8220;Creator Hub&#8221; on Pinterest, where creators can manage their Pinterest presence. The company says it will also offer &#8220;micro-grants&#8221; to fund various projects. This could include things like a community garden, a wellness program or a new beauty look, the company suggests.</p>
<p>Creators will have other ways to make money, too. U.S. creators will now be able to tag their Pins using the existing product tagging tool with links from their Amazon Associates program. (The program already offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">support for affiliate programs</a> like Rakuten and ShopStyle as of this summer.)</p>
<p>And creators can now enable shopping recommendations powered by Pinterest&#8217;s visual search (its &#8220;shop similar&#8221; feature), which is being enabled for video for the first time &#8212; another attempt at catching up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">TikTok and its e-commerce feature set. </a></p>
<p>Combined, the products indicate a Pinterest that&#8217;s very much trying to reinvent itself for the TikTok era, largely by copying TikTok features then adding its own twists. It would not be alone in doing so. TikTok, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58155103">most downloaded app worldwide</a>, has been fueling clones across top social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Snap, Reddit and others. But for Pinterest, it&#8217;s a particular threat, as many of TikTok&#8217;s best videos are those that are instructive or inspirational and then lead directly to purchases &#8212; basically, Pinterest&#8217;s entire business model. The company&#8217;s hope is to recapture creators&#8217; interest with these new tools, while also providing them with ways to actually monetize their following beyond virtual tipping or brand engagements.</p>
<p>Pinterest says its new features will roll out starting today on iOS, Android, and the web.</p>
