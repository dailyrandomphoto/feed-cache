										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/04/facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-hit-by-outage">WhatsApp outage</a> is still sending shivers down the spine of its 2 billion users, the same is also true for the millions of businesses now using it to connect with their customers. As we now know, messaging across all platforms is a new area from which many startups are emerging.</p>
<p>One of the most recent is <a href="https://en.superchat.de/">Superchat</a>, which is building an all-in-one messaging platform for small and medium-sized businesses to contact their customers. And these things are needed: According to some <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/RightNow/2011-customer-experience-impact-report/6">surveys</a> 78% of customers giving up on a transaction because of a negative experience. And European companies <a href="https://www.majorel.com/future-customer/expert-view/why-bad-customer-service-is-expensive/">lose</a> €13 billion in revenues a year over bad customer service.</p>
<p>Superchat has now raised $15.6 million in a Series A round led by London-based VC <a href="https://www.blossomcap.com/">Blossom Capital</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.468cap.com/">468 Capital</a>. That means the startup has now raised a total of $18.8 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256903" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Alex Lim, managing partner at Blossom Capital, said: “Superchat has built a platform that empowers small and medium-sized businesses to leverage the benefits of digital channels and provide the very best service to even the most discerning customers. The founders and the team understand the unique pain points being felt by companies, many of which are still relying on email and phone calls despite the significant shift to digital seen in the wake of the pandemic.” </p>
<p>The startup says it pulls in conversations from WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Google Business, Telegram, webchat, email, and SMS – into a single inbox for the business. By doing this companies get data insights into their customers, helping them boost sales etc. All team members can see and reply to messages.</p>
<p>Founded by Yilmaz Köknar and Mika Hally, the platform has largely worked for customers in Germany to date.</p>
<p>Köknar said: “Today’s customers want and expect to be able to contact businesses wherever, and whenever suits them… this can prove to be a logistical nightmare for the companies, and results in poor experiences for the customers. No one wins within the current status quo, but with Superchat, everyone does.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Superchat is up against a number of well-funded players in this sphere including Rake, Messagebird, Smooch and others, so it will be interesting to see how it fairs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The internet loves an unlikely success story, and as we approached the new year, one came around the corner to delight us with a simple idea, and a short game to play it out: <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wordle</a>, where you guess a five-letter word in six tries, and then laugh and cry with others as you share your results and the grid charting your attempts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air in the tech industry, as we discussed with the game&#8217;s creator, Josh Wardle: no mobile app. Only one word every 24 hours. No advertising. No registration required. And you can even play it if your internet connection drops.</p>
<p>But perhaps, even more delighting than the game itself, is the origin story.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The short version is that British-raised New York resident Josh Wardle, who used to work at Reddit and is now a software engineer at Brooklyn art collective <a href="https://mschf.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mschf</a>, originally built Wordle last year <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">for his partner</a>, a word puzzle enthusiast, for them to play together.</p>
<p>Hosting it on a website he&#8217;s had for years as a home for his other creative efforts (<a href="http://powerlanguage.co.ul">powerlanguage.co.uk</a>, back from from his time in England), Wardle casually shared the game with family. Then he showed it to a few well-placed friends. But virality, as we know, doesn&#8217;t take much to get rolling when the stars are aligned. It was in the blink of an eye that all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>Over the space of weeks, the game grew from under 1,000 to 2 million players.</p>
<p>“What I built [at the start] is the game that everyone is playing today,&#8221; he said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;It was definitely not the intention when I started.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That rapid growth has surprised Wardle. At his day job at Mschf &#8212; the collective known for stunts like Lil Nas X&#8217;s controversial &#8220;<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/mschf-lil-nas-x-satan-shoes-caa-drop-viral-1235038051/">blood shoes</a>&#8221; &#8212; he says he occasionally finds himself &#8220;going down the rabbit hole&#8221; on Twitter looking at what people are saying about his creation.</p>
<p>But Wardle&#8217;s not an impresario, nor at this point particularly entrepreneurial (we mean that in a good way &#8212; he&#8217;s just natural in his approach) and that&#8217;s leading to some unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>People have suspected, and we&#8217;ve now confirmed, that Wardle has been getting approached by investors who want to take Wordle to the next level. (Sidenote: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wardle&#8217;s employer Mschf is backed by VCs like Founders Fund. So that could be an interesting template for one direction to go. Or not.) But Wardle isn&#8217;t trying to turn a profit on Wordle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;I don’t want Wordle to be my full time job, but I don’t want to invest in it or do any of that stuff. I’m very happy with where it’s at,&#8221; Wardle told TechCrunch. &#8220;I think that if [venture funding] were to happen, it would be more in the context of being an artist with a patron or something like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Wardle</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> considers what to do, if anything at all, his runaway game has found a ton of traction with other less salubrious types: numerous developers have started <a href="https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1480912762620547072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloning it,</a> taking advantage of Wordle&#8217;s static place on the web and building apps to profit off the interest. </span></p>
<p>While Wardle himself has not really had much of a chance to consider how or if to defend his IP, others have <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1480990948972658689?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken up his cause</a>, and now Apple <a href="https://twitter.com/sethsandler/status/1481067821186826248?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appears to be taking down Wordle clone apps</a> independently of any appeals from Wordle&#8217;s creator.</p>
<p>At the same time, ironically, Wardle’s also getting accused of stealing the Wordle concept from others. The host of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(British_game_show)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lingo</a>, a gameshow in the UK, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/adilray/status/1478635246237241345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly railing</a> about how he has given Lingo no credit, considering that the game “looks like ours, works like ours, smells like ours and basically is OURS.”</p>
<p>But Wardle didn&#8217;t build the game for money or viral fame. When you consider the impetus for making Wordle, and how few iterations it&#8217;s had since then, all of this seems to be missing the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel smart when I get a Wordle, even though I made the game,&#8221; Wardle told us. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the journey, especially on days like today where I&#8217;m like really stumped and I like have to think about it.&#8221; (The answer on the day we talked was &#8220;query&#8221;, which is quite perfect.) &#8220;It&#8217;s hard enough that it will hit, like, that sense of accomplishment that feels good.&#8221;</p>
<p>We sat down with Josh Wardle to hear more about his reasons for keeping it simple, and what he&#8217;s thinking about next.</p>
<p>+++++++++++++</p>
<p><em>[This interview has been condensed for clarity]</em></p>
<p><strong>Something that people love about Wordle is that you can only play once a day – it’s not comparable to past viral games like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/01/developer-behind-flappy-bird-the-impossible-game-blowing-up-the-app-store-says-he-just-got-lucky/">Flappy Bird</a>, which was eventually deleted by its developer because it got too addictive. How intentional were you about building a game that, by nature, can only take up a few minutes of your day?</strong></p>
<p>My partner and I play a lot of the New York Times word games, and they follow that one-a-day model. One thing that is interesting to reflect on, though, is that Wordle could be one a day, but if everybody was getting a different word on that day &#8212; if the word was random but you could still only play one &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t have caught on the way it has. Right? It’s something about the fact that it’s one puzzle, and everybody is solving it. In terms of games like Flappy Bird, I’m just kind of suspicious of apps and games that want your endless attention &#8212; like, I worked in Silicon Valley. I know why they do that. With Wordle, actually, I kind of deliberately did what you’re not meant to do if growth is your goal. And bizarrely, I think, those things have led to growth. But obviously, a ton of it is luck, and being in the right place at the right time. I think people have an appetite for things that transparently don’t want anything from you. I think people quite like it that way, you know?</p>
<div class="c-message_actions__container c-message__actions" role="group">
<div class="c-message_actions__group" role="group" aria-label="Message shortcuts" data-qa="message-actions"><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">You built this for you and your partner to play together, so how did the game go from that to viral sensation?</strong></div>
</div>
<p>Back in the UK over the summer, I shared it with my family, and they loved it so much that it derailed the family group chat, so we had to splinter off and create a Wordle channel. There wasn’t the emoji grids at that point, so you’d just come into the chat and say “I got the word in three” or whatever. I introduced it to a few friends in the states, and Andy Baio shared it on his <a href="https://waxy.org/">blog</a>. Then, a New York Times newsletter author included it as a footnote around Thanksgiving, like, “Hey, I’ve been enjoying this thing,” and that somehow led to it getting really popular in New Zealand, and then Australia, and then a Guardian journalist in Australia wrote about it, and that’s the first time I remember logging in the next day and seeing that 80,000 people had played the previous day. One of the early adopters in New Zealand came up with the emoji grid idea and was manually typing them out to share her results on Twitter, so I decided to integrate it into the app itself, and obviously that’s had a huge impact.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p><strong>You’re now seeing millions of people playing it, all off your Power Language site. How have you handled that traffic?</strong></p>
<p>It’s incredibly simple. It’s literally just a website and some javascript that downloads, and once it’s downloaded, it never needs to do anything again, like your phone could go offline and you could continue to play it. So there’s no backend. There’s some shortcomings to the way I did it, like right now, I have people looking at the source code, and they discover all the words are there and they can examine those things. But if I had to be scaling a backend, you know, every time you submitted a guess you had to go to a server, that would have been a huge headache. So because I just built it for my partner and me, I built it as simply as possible. For the people who look in the source for the solution, I’ve seen – which I quite like – on Twitter, people are saying it’s like if you’re doing the puzzle section in the newspaper, you can turn the puzzle upside down and read the answers. It’s more about like, who are you cheating if you’re doing that? You can open an incognito browser and take the puzzle again today if you really want, you know? It’s very low stakes.</p>
<p>[Originally the site was hosted by an independent company] and for a while there, I was waking up in the morning, hoping fewer people would have played because I was worried I was gonna hit my bandwidth limit. After Wordle went viral, close to the end of December, I still had enough breathing room where I had 100 gigabytes of bandwidth to play with. Then one of my good ex-Reddit friends, Kevin O&#8217;Connor [now the VP of Engineering at Kickstarter] helped me put Cloudflare in front of my website; then more recently, we migrated the hosting to Amazon S3, which can scale indefinitely as long as I&#8217;m happy to pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>So many venture capitalists are playing Wordle and posting their results on Twitter. Have any VCs reached out to you? What do you think about what some of them must be thinking, that this might have potential as an enterprise rather than just a fun game?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had a few people reach out in that very diplomatic and warm VC style. [Laughs.] I haven’t had any conversations yet. I don’t even know – I’ve never been in this position before, and I don’t know what that conversation would look like when I’m giving this thing away for free. I like giving it away for free – part of the point is it’s free.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to respond to them and see what happens?</strong></p>
<p>I think I’d be foolish not to, right? It seems like a unique opportunity. I don’t want Wordle to be my full time job, but I don’t want to invest in it or do any of that stuff. I’m very happy with where it’s at. But given that I work in tech, and I’ll probably continue working in tech, it seems like one of those things where it’s good to meet these people and at least have a discussion.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where it does cost me a bit to keep the servers up to run Wordle, but I can afford to do that.</p>
<p>It’s not like I think that everyone needs to give away the things they create online for free, it was just that because that’s how I started this, it’s made it easier for me to continue it this way. I made something that felt really authentic to me, and now when people are asking like, “Do you want to monetize it? Why aren’t you doing X, Y and Z?”</p>
<p>It’s really easy for me to say… No, I was really happy with it when it was just my partner and me playing together. It’s really easy to get seduced by all that stuff, but I try and instead be like… I was happy then, and I think I’ll be happy in the future if that’s where it ends. If at the end of the day with Wordle, it’s just her and me playing again, I think I’ll be totally happy for that to be the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>We noticed you did two pretty cool projects when you worked at Reddit, “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/reddit-button-n357841">The Button</a>” and “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/reddit-place-internet-experiment-579049">Place</a>.” What drives you to create these?</strong></p>
<p>My background is in art, and I’m just interested in making interesting things. The business side of things is not super interesting to me at all, and I can’t imagine anyone paying… like, the things that I’m interested in making are very weird or like not conventional, I think, and don’t really make sense as businesses. I think that if [venture funding] were to happen, it would be more in the context of being an artist with a patron or something like that.</p>
<p><strong>So many people on the internet are making memes and art around Wordle – do you have any favorites?</strong></p>
<p>I really like the creative interpretations of the emoji grids. There’s an account I started following recently that does green and yellow <a href="https://twitter.com/wordleinpaint">Microsoft Paint style pictures</a>. I saw someone who <a href="https://twitter.com/traceyfanclub/status/1479935207562092545">cross-stitches</a> her Wordle results, which is quite awesome. So it’s those things – that people enjoy and care enough about this thing that it gives them inspiration, and they want to express it, and it makes them feel good creatively. That’s really an amazing compliment. I like to create things myself, so seeing people respond to something I’ve made in that way feels amazing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><strong>It feels like chatter about the game is especially big on Twitter. Why?</strong></p>
<p>One thing I will say is that the majority of players are not actually posting their results on Twitter. There’s an account called <a href="https://twitter.com/WordleStats">Wordle Stats</a> that looks at Twitter, then collects all the grids people share, then posts it the next day and says, “Okay, 30% of people got it in four,” and I think it was two days ago that it collected 100,000-something, whereas at that time, close to 2 million people played Wordle.</p>
<p>There are Wordles being shared in WhatsApp groups, like my family group. For some people, Twitter is that family WhatsApp group. But the vast majority of people playing are off Twitter. I think they’re playing it with their friends and family. It’s hard for some families to see each other because of COVID, and sometimes it’s hard to come up with a topic of conversation. But Wordle is just such a low-effort way to check in, and sometimes you just post your result, sometimes you can respond to others’, but it’s this really comforting way of letting other people know that you’re thinking about them. It’s a shared experience.</p>
<p><strong>Why is your website called “powerlanguage”?</strong></p>
<p>That’s just a username I’ve used online for a long time, which originates from mishearing someone. Someone was berating my friends and me in my youth. We were being told off for swearing at each other. I thought he said, “power language.” In retrospect, he was saying “foul language,” and I misheard it, but I was so delighted by the idea of swearing being called “power language” and just kind of ran with it in a way you do when you’re 16 or whatever.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of all the Wordle clones? Would you ever want to make an app?</strong></p>
<p>People have asked me about the app thing a lot – one response is I don’t have the skills, and I’d have to invest the time to learn how to do it, which I could do, but it would be an investment of my time. And again, if I’m building a game for my partner… We can use a website every day. It’s not a problem. If my goal was to make Wordle my business or to monetize it, I can see why it would make sense, but then I would have to wrestle with a bunch of things like… Would I send you a push notification? I would definitely have to think about the contract I’m establishing with the player. Do you really want me to notify you? Is this the best way? Why don’t you just forget about Wordle for a little bit?</p>

<p>I will say, I did have one really nice thing happen to me where there was someone who built a game called Wordle on the App Store years ago, and it suddenly started getting a lot of traffic and downloads. He Googled it, found the New York Times article, and reached out to me on Twitter and was like, “Hey, I really like how you’re approaching this. I got some money from people downloading the app and I want to donate it, where should I donate it?” I need to get back to him, but he was like, “I think I would want it to go to a charity focused on literacy or something,” which I thought was amazing.</p>
<p>As far as the clones, I mean, there are some subtle things with Wordle that actually make it work. I actually put quite a lot of effort in – the solutions list, I actually invested a fair amount of time filtering those. A big one for me was if there were a bunch of five letter words you’ve never heard of, and if the solution was one of those words, I think that feels bad for people.</p>
<p><strong>The Ringer reported that “<a href="https://www.theringer.com/2022/1/7/22870249/what-to-do-when-playing-the-word-game-wordle-isnt-enough-solve-it">FARTS</a>” will never be a Wordle solution. Is there a reason for that? </strong></p>
<p>There is a reason for that, but I know part of the joy of discovering Wordle and playing it over a number of times… I know why it’s not included, but I don’t want to state that. I want to let people kind of discover it themselves. It’s an exercise to the reader. <em>(Note: We think we figured it out.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My husband and I plan to visit our daughter during her spring break. (She’s an F-1 international student at a U.S. university.) In between spending time with our daughter and sightseeing, we’d like to explore the feasibility of expanding our business in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do we need to get a special visa to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Multitasking Mom</strong></p>
<p>Dear Multitasking,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to me before your trip! Conducting business activities while in the United States on a tourist visa is one of the most common mistakes that founders make. I mention this and a few other situations in my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/105-immigration-pitfalls-for-startup-founders/">podcast episode</a> on immigration pitfalls that startup founders should avoid. Doing business while in visitor status can jeopardize your ability to live and work in the United States or to enter the U.S. in the future.</p>
<p>To answer your question, yes, you will need either a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/b-1-visa-visitors-business/">B-1 business visitor visa</a> or <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">ESTA</a> (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) Visa Waiver Program if you are not a citizen of either Canada or Bermuda. Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not need a visa to visit the U.S. for certain business visitor activities for less than 180 days.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Before I dive into the specifics of B-1 visas and ESTA, the Visa Waiver Program, as it relates to business, let me just say that it’s never too early to meet with an immigration attorney to discuss your long-term goals and immigration options. I recommend that international founders such as you and your husband talk with an immigration lawyer even before you make your first business-related trip to the United States.</p>
<p>Immigration issues will matter for you both and any international talent you hire should you decide to expand your business here. What’s more, your reasons for coming to the U.S., the visa you obtain, what you say to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers when you arrive in the U.S., what you do while you’re in the U.S., and when you leave could all affect future visits or stays in the U.S.</p>

The company&#8217;s latest round of funding follows its $5.2 million seed round <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/13/2229163/0/en/Medical-Prodigy-DeepScribe-Lands-5-2M-Seed-Funding-for-Life-Changing-AI-Assistant.html">announced</a> in May 2021. DeepScribe was founded in 2017 by Akilesh Bapu, Matthew Ko and Kairui Zeng with the aim of unburdening doctors from tedious data entry and allowing them to focus on their patients.</p>
<p>In 2019, DeepScribe launched its ambient voice AI technology that summarizes natural patient-physician conversations. The idea for DeepScribe was prompted by Bapu and Ko&#8217;s own experiences. Bapu&#8217;s father was an oncologist and he saw the toll that documentation had on his father&#8217;s work/life balance. On the other hand, Ko saw how the burden of clinical documentation was impacting patients&#8217; perception of care when he was the care coordinator for his mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>
<p>After being frustrated with the care his mother was receiving, Ko turned to Bapu and his father for help. The pair then began to understand the importance of clinical documentation and realized that recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and natural language processing were not being used to remedy the situation. They then decided to create a platform that would address the problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256775" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;After researching products in the space, we wondered why with over 75% of providers using documentation tools in the space, they were still spending nearly half their day writing notes,&#8221; Ko told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;After testing the products, our thesis was that the existing products in the space were not solving the problem, as they still required the physician to summarize the conversation. Speech-to-text solutions were only capable of translating exactly what you say to text on a computer screen. What doctors wanted and what would really solve the problem was an ambient AI that would be able to intelligently understand and summarize a natural patient conversation. With this insight, we set out to build what is now DeepScribe, the world&#8217;s first ambient AI scribe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once a physician starts the application, DeepScribe records, summarizes and integrates the conversation into the physician&#8217;s health record system of choice. The application records patient exams while it listens and prepares clinical notes. DeepScribe then uploads the notes directly into the fields of Electronic Health Records (EHR), enabling physicians to review and sign their fully-prepared notes in the appropriate EHR fields.</p>
<p>The application is compatible with small talk and only includes the medically-relevant information in the conversation. The company also notes that the AI-scribe continuously gets smarter by listening and learning about a physician&#8217;s conversation style, preferred phrasing and writing preferences.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, DeepScribe has scaled to over 400 physicians around the United States and processed over half a million patient-physician conversations. DeepScribe says its platform saves physicians an average of three hours a day and costs around one-sixth the cost of human medical scribes. To date, the company has saved physicians over 2.5 million minutes of documentation. In terms of reliability, DeepScribe says physicians encounter less than one correction per note on average after 20 days of usage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says this latest investment will accelerate DeepScribe’s growth, as it plans to continue to improve and transform medical documentation workflows and healthcare overall. DeepScribe aims to deploy its technology to multiple large health systems, grow its engineering team and get its AI in the hands of more physicians.</p>
<div>&#8220;While there are many things on our roadmap, what excites us the most are the possibilities outside of pure summarization,&#8221; Ko said. &#8220;We believe that voice will be the building blocks for the future of medicine and holds the ability to transform the diagnosis and treatment of care as we know it. We hope to leverage the data that we are harvesting through the delivery of our service to go beyond providing efficiencies for the physician and to begin improving outcomes for patients.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It would be easy to think PC sales dropped worldwide last year amid chip shortages, but that conventional thinking would be wrong. As it turns out, Canalys reports that PC shipments grew 15% year over year in 2021 and were up 27% over 2019, with a whopping 341 million units sold.</p>
<p>While the fourth-quarter numbers were up just 1% over the previous year, 2021 was still the best year since 2012, according to the firm.</p>
<p>As Canalys senior analyst Ishan Dutt pointed out, PCs had a great year in spite of chip supply issues, and he sees PCs as firmly entrenched as part of our work and leisure lives, with it becoming the norm to have multiple PCs in the same home in developed areas of the world.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256782" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;For the market to post double-digit growth over an impressive 2020, despite the constant cloud of supply constraints, speaks volumes about how strong PC demand has been over the last 12 months. Taking a long-term view, the most important developments in 2021 were the large increases in PC penetration and usage rates,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The big winners in 2021 were the Big 3 PC makers: Lenovo, HP and Dell, with Apple coming in fourth. It&#8217;s worth noting that while everyone had a good year, as the chart below shows, Apple had the largest growth number year-over-year at 28.3%, while Acer was second with 21.8% growth in spite of being fifth overall in terms of shipment numbers.</p>
<p>In terms of market share, Lenovo and HP were the clear winners with 24.1% and 21.7%, respectively. Dell was third with 17.4% with Apple fourth with 8.5%</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256784" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256784" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="Canalys PC shipments chart for 2021 organized by PC manufacturer" width="680" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg 1274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?resize=768,698 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?resize=680,618 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-12-at-10.36.46-AM.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256784" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Although chip shortages are expected to persist into the new year, and there is speculation that the education market may be saturated, Canalys still believes that 2022 will be a strong year for PC sales. In fact, Canalys analyst Rushabh Doshi said the market would likely have been bigger in 2021 if not for the supply issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary reason why we are in a shortage situation is that demand is outstripping supply. It is [definitely true] that had the supply situation been better, the PC industry would have grown faster, and be [even bigger],&#8221; Doshi told me.</p>
<p>He sees a market that will continue to expand into the future. &#8220;Looking at an unconstrained view, the demand for better and faster PCs is now more pronounced than ever, not just in work, but also at home. With the importance of PCs reinforced in the past two years, we believe that the growth is here to stay,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capitalists went hard in 2021.</p>
<p>Data collected from a number of sources indicates that last year set venture capital records around the world. From dollars invested to deal volume, sectors and geographies posted their strongest performance and excelled on essentially every continent.</p>
<p>Today’s startup boom, from a venture capital perspective, is a wide-ranging and incredibly expensive enterprise.</p>

<p>With a history of venture capital activity setting records in recent years, you may not feel like last year was all too special. It was. The total value of capital disbursed, and the pace at which those funds were put to work, is different than prior years and preceding eras.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The good news from that fact is that we’re seeing venture capital tallies rise across more markets than we did in previous startup boom cycles. This means that more founders in more places are raising capital, even if traditional hot spots like Silicon Valley and the larger U.S. market retain much of their historical heft.</p>
<p>Next week, The Exchange will dig into sectors, trends and particular regions of the world. Today, we’re talking big, high-level numbers and just how much busier last year was for the venture set. With <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-2021/">data from CB Insights</a>, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/">Crunchbase News </a>and a <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2021-pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor-first-look">first look from PitchBook</a> regarding a coming data set, we have plenty of numbers to parse.</p>
<p>So take a walk with us through what could be the most insane and busy year we’ll ever see for venture capitalists. (Unless, of course, 2022 manages to out-crazy last year. Don’t write off that possibility entirely; <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1481257794842079232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’re off to a busy start</a>.)</p>
<h2>A record year ‘round the world</h2>
<p>The top-line figures are astounding.</p>
<p>CB Insights reports that venture investment reached $621 billion in 2021, up 111% from 2020 levels. Recall that 2020 was effectively tied with 2018 as the largest year for global venture investment &#8212; until 2021 came and took its crown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is benefitting from TikTok&#8217;s ban in India, and has now reclaimed the top spot in terms of total global downloads as of the fourth quarter of 2021. According to <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/q4-2021-data-digest">new data</a> published by app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Instagram just had its best quarter since at least 2014, with app installs up 10% over Q3. The Meta-owned photo and video sharing app was also the first Meta app to take the No. 1 position on the top downloads chart since WhatsApp held that spot back in Q4 2019.</p>
<p>In fact, Q4 2021 was only the second time in the past two years that TikTok wasn&#8217;t the No. 1 app by worldwide downloads, the firm says.</p>
<p>The only other time TikTok dropped from its top position during that time was at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when Zoom beat TikTok to become the No. 1 app by downloads in Q2 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256772" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256788" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256788" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256788" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="545" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg 1646w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=768,616 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=680,545 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1232 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/global-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256788" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s move to the top of the global (non-game) app market comes from an increase in installs from Android users, specifically. For the second quarter in a row, Meta-owned apps claimed both the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the chart of the top Google Play apps by worldwide downloads. Instagram was No. 1 in the quarter, followed by Facebook. TikTok, meanwhile, was No. 3.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256786" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256786" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256786" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="541" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg 1648w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=680,541 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1221 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/google-play-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256786" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>On the chart showing the most downloaded apps on the Apple App Store, things look a lot different.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here, TikTok and YouTube continue to hold the No. 1 and No. 2 positions, respectively &#8212; spots they&#8217;ve held on to since Q2 2020. In Q4, TikTok surpassed 50 million App Store installs for the eighth straight quarter in a row, Sensor Tower says.</p>
<p>The rest of the top 5 was rounded out by Meta&#8217;s apps with WhatsApp (No. 3), Instagram (No. 4), and Facebook (No. 5). Meanwhile, an unusual appearance by China&#8217;s National Anti-Fraud Center app took the No. 6 spot, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">being promoted by in a state-sponsored campaign.</a> The rest of the list is filled out with the typical selection of social, chat and entertainment apps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256787" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256787" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256787" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=768,599 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=680,530 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=1536,1197 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/app-store-downloads-q4-2021.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256787" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>As an interesting side note, the quarter also saw Twitter reaching the top 20 most downloaded apps on the App Store for the first time since Q1 2020, and the fourth time since the start of 2020 when adoption jumped 34% quarter-over-quarter &#8212; growth that has mostly continued since. (Perhaps the flurry of product development activity is finally starting to pay off?</p>
<p>While TikTok is the No. 1 app by downloads in both the App Store and Google Play in the U.S., its fall from No. 1 globally can be at least partially attributed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">India&#8217;s decision to ban the app</a> in the country back in June 2020, along with others from Chinese firms, over &#8220;national security&#8221; concerns.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower told TechCrunch that, since the ban, Instagram has seen a steady increase in the share of its global downloads coming from India.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256785" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256785" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256785" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="532" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png 1700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=768,601 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=680,532 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=1536,1202 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tiktok-download-share.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256785" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>For example, in Q2 2020, approximately 21% of Instagram&#8217;s downloads were from India, and that share increased to 39% by Q4 2021. And when looking at the full-year totals, around 25% of Instagram&#8217;s downloads came from India in 2020 which then grew to about 36% in 2021.</p>
<p>Instagram has been working to address the TikTok threat by shifting its app&#8217;s focus to video and promoting its TikTok clone, known as Reels. The company in 2021 began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">offering huge bonuses to creators</a> posting on Reels &#8212; some payouts were as high as $10,000 &#8212; in an effort to regain traction in the face of the growing competition.</p>
<p>Though Instagram won the recent quarter, Sensor Tower data indicates TikTok was still the top app by global downloads for the full year (2021) across both app stores, followed by Facebook then Instagram.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, rival firm App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">shows</a> a slightly different set of rankings. It also has TikTok at the top by worldwide downloads, but sees it followed by Instagram then Facebook. The takeaway here is that Facebook and Instagram were likely close in terms of downloads, and the two companies&#8217; different methodologies for download estimates saw them ending up with different figures as a result.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic and dive deep. This week <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary Ann</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> came together to talk about the changing nature of due diligence in the startup market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The chat was loosely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/">centered around a piece that the three of us wrote</a> as 2021 was coming to a close, but the conversation quickly broadened to include a host of factors that are impacting how startups fundraise and build today.</p>
<p>Mary Ann talked about the power of FOMO, and how that particular social factor is impacting how startups raise. Natasha brought up the importance of back-channeling, and how founders talk to one another. And Alex tried to tease out the difference in how funds of various sizes will approach doing their own diligence, or letting others take on the work.</p>
<p>It was all very good fun! You can read the original backing piece on TC+ <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/3-views-how-due-diligence-will-change-in-2022/">here</a>, and we&#8217;re back Friday!</p>

Jitterbit plans to combine its <a href="https://www.jitterbit.com/platform/ipaas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API platform</a> with PrimeApps to build an end-to-end platform that will make it easier for non-technical users to build business apps, something that &#8212; almost by default &#8212; includes integrating different data sources. This new platform is scheduled to become available in April 2022.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the financial details of the transaction. Jitterbit CEO George Gallegos would only say that he believes it&#8217;s &#8220;a great deal compared to the billion-dollar opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jitterbit is on a bit of an acquisition spree. Last November, the company also acquired Wevo, an enterprise integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) provider that focuses on Latin America, while last May, it picked up eBridge, another iPaaS service that focuses on enabling data integration between on-premises and cloud e-commerce and CRM systems. In part, these moves were made possible by private equity firm Audax&#8217;s <a href="https://www.jitterbit.com/press-release/audax-private-equity-announces-investment-in-jitterbit-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 investment</a> in the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Jitterbit team recently identified this opportunity of layering a no-code/low-code service on top of its platform. As Gallegos noted, from the beginning, the company had focused on automating business processes. Often, the result of these integrations and new workflows is a user experience that a developer then has to create. &#8220;We just saw this coming up over and over &#8212; and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been looking for either building or finding someone like, in this case, PrimeApps, which was a wonderful combination that was a great fit [&#8230;],&#8221; Gallegos said. &#8220;This was key to accelerating our ability to deliver this capability to our customers in the market to allow them to have one end-to-end solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>PrimeApps never took any outside funding since it was founded by Serdar Turan <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/primeapps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2015</a>. Its 25 employees will all join Jitterbit. &#8220;We were already looking for ways to expand our footprint globally. But it&#8217;s not easy &#8212; it&#8217;s tough,&#8221; Turan said. &#8220;When Jitterbit approached us &#8212; and they were already pretty big in their area &#8212; they were completing what we were missing wonderfully. I saw the opportunity and now we join forces around growing together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PrimeApps brand is going away as part of this deal, Turan said, and the service will be fully merged into Jitterbit, with its customers moving to the new platform over time.</p>
<p>As Jitterbit&#8217;s Gallegos noted, the company so far competed with the likes of MuleSoft and Boomi in the iPaaS business. These don&#8217;t offer the kinds of end-to-end solution that Jitterbit now offers with the integration of PrimeApps, though I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw them make similar moves in the near future, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The promise of low-code development is now starting to come to life. By joining <span class="il">Jitterbit</span>, we are becoming a first-mover that will help usher in this revolution, which will dramatically change how work gets done,” said Turan. &#8220;With <span class="il">Jitterbit</span>’s advanced iPaaS and API management solutions, our platform will empower citizen developers, who are closest to their customers, to create new digital experiences that solve business challenges rapidly without having to rely on an army of IT engineers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we think about identity in the digital world, it usually involves a username and password, but <a href="http://merits.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merit</a> (originally called Sigma) wants to help governments issue digital credentials that link back to a government license database with the goal of bringing an end to flimsy paper cards.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a hefty $50 million Series B. Rose Park Advisors led the round with participation from prior investors a16z, Bow Capital and Govtech Fund, along with new investors Experian Ventures, Spike Ventures, InState Capital, Collier Fund, Metaplanet Holdings and other individual investors. Merit has now raised $80 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Tomer Kagan said that idea is to create a verifiable online digital identity. A driver&#8217;s license is proof that the state gives you the right to drive, but one that is delivered in the analog form of a plastic card. Merit wants to change that by moving these credentials into the digital realm and linking them to a government database.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256694" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You need to be empowered to share information about yourself with a third party that is programmatically verifiable, meaning it is just known to be true because I am passing along something that was given to me by an organization that you can verify came from that organization. So what we did is we built a platform over the last five years that actually handles this by allowing organizations to connect to other databases,&#8221; Kagan explained.</p>
<p>The company spent the last five years working with various governments to build connectors to these licensing databases to allow third parties to access the data and have it update automatically. So if you are a plumbing company, you can display your employees&#8217; plumbing credentials on the company website and have them update automatically when the license is renewed (or show that it wasn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>One of the higher-profile examples of this was a project Merit put in place last summer after the tragic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/miami-building-collapse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collapse of a building in Miami</a>. In just one month, the company built a system for verifying which vendors and personnel were allowed onto the site, a project that involved verifying the identities of more than 16,000 people, according to the company.</p>
<p>For now, at least, the company has to work directly with each government entity that it makes a deal with. Each project requires its own workflow and connectors, but Kagan said that each project also builds on the next, so it&#8217;s not like starting from scratch with each new customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company has around 70 employees with plans to get to around 100 by the end of the year. As he adds personnel, Kagan said that he has thought a lot about how to build a diverse and inclusive company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our non-engineering teams look pretty diverse today. But of course, like everywhere else, we&#8217;re always trying to increase, for example, our female representation in engineering. What&#8217;s really helped is that we&#8217;re fully remote. Getting out of the Bay Area has actually been really helpful in terms of diversity hiring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kagan said that fundraising during the pandemic was a pretty stressful exercise, and he had to convince some investors that his company&#8217;s business model, selling services to the government, was a viable strategy. Some investors wouldn&#8217;t invest in companies that deal primarily with government contracts by policy, but in the end, he raised $50 million, so there were plenty of investors willing to go that route.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest bit of regulatory woe for Big Tech in Europe, Google is trying to settle a German antitrust investigation into its news licensing product by offering not to expand the display of News Showcase &#8220;story panels&#8221; into general search results.</p>
<p>The German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2022/12_01_2022_Google_News_Showcase.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced today</a> that the company has proposed several measures in response to its antitrust concerns &#8212; which also include taking steps to put clear blue water between News Showcase contracts and ongoing negotiations with publishers related to copyright licensing obligations around so called neighbouring rights for news.</p>
<p>Under EU and German law Google must pay copyright fees to news publishers for displaying snippets of their content &#8212; following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">2019 EU copyright reform</a> which was transposed into German law in May 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256681" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unilateral attempts by German lawmakers &#8212; around a decade ago &#8212; to force Google to pay licensing fees to local publishers for displaying snippets of their content in Google News were easily thwarted by the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/21/google-makes-google-news-in-germany-opt-in-only-to-avoid-paying-fees-under-new-copyright-law/">switching to an opt-in model</a> for the aggregator in the market.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&#8217;s taken a pan-EU directive &#8212; combined with local antitrust intervention &#8212; to force Google&#8217;s hand on this issue so it can&#8217;t simply change how it operates to circumvent payments.</p>
<p>Although the tech giant&#8217;s compliance with EU copyright law remains a work in progress, to put it mildly. (Its activity in the region on this front has already attracted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a fine of over half a billion dollars in France</a>, for instance, where Google&#8217;s approach to news licensing also remains under close regulatory watch.)</p>
<p>Germany is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">scrutinizing Google&#8217;s negotiations with local news publishers</a> &#8212; as well as, as of today, extracting operational concessions from it on how it operates News Showcase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The FCO said it&#8217;s concerned that if Google integrates News Showcase into general search results, as Google has previously said it intends to, it will result in the company self-preferencing its own services or &#8220;impeding services offered by competing third parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also has focus on whether the News Showcase contractual terms &#8220;unreasonably disadvantage&#8221; the participating publishers &#8212; including by making it &#8220;disproportionately difficult for them to enforce their general ancillary copyright when participating in Google News Showcase&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulator also said it is reviewing Google&#8217;s conditions for access to Google’s News Showcase service &#8212; to examine whether non-discriminatory access is ensured for publishers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely no accident that just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">last week the FCO confirmed its ability to apply special measures</a> to Google&#8217;s business, under powers to tackle digital market giants which were passed by local lawmakers at the start of last year. That shrinks the time frame for regulatory action and squeezes how much room Google has to try to wiggle around any FCO orders.</p>
<p>Similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">Big Tech-focused copyright reforms are underway in the U.K.</a>, too. While ex ante rules for gatekeeping giants are well on their way to being adopted at an EU level (aka, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">Digital Markets Act</a>). So the operational leash for Big Tech in Europe is only set to shorten.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Germany&#8217;s antitrust probe of Google products steps up a gear&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/embed/#?secret=m6xvWb6MeY" data-secret="m6xvWb6MeY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As well as offering not to expand the showcasing of licensed content to general search results in Germany, the FCO said today that Google has &#8220;already changed some of the practices under examination and declared its willingness to address any remaining ambiguities and concerns by modifying the Showcase contracts and providing clarifying statements&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, Showcase contracts are to be clearly separated from the ongoing negotiations regarding other ancillary copyright payments between Google and the publishers or their collecting societies,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The tech giant announced the global<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/"> News Showcase</a> product back in October 2020 &#8212; when it said it would pay participating publishers $1 billion collectively to licence their news content to appear in so-called &#8220;story panels&#8221; (see below examples from <a href="https://news.google.com/news-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&#8217;s product marketing</a>) across Google products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256726" style="width: 2368px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256726" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256726 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png" alt="" width="2358" height="1182" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png 2358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=2048,1027 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2358px) 100vw, 2358px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256726" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>At the time Google was facing rising legal requirements in a number of jurisdictions over remuneration for displaying news content (Australia came up with its own legislative template targeting Google and Facebook to pay for news reuse in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">August 2020</a>, for example).</p>
<p>So the News Showcase gambit always looked like a naked attempt by Google to limit a looming revenue hit while simultaneously leveraging its market power to generate as much upside for its ad-monetizing internet content business as possible.</p>
<p>Closed-door commercial deals for News Showcase offered Google the chance to dangle a carrot of licensing payments and play publishers off against each other &#8212; pressuring them to agree to its terms and shrink legally mandated licensing fees.</p>
<p>Initially, Google said content licensed under News Showcase would appear in story panels on the Google News app on mobile devices. It went on to expand where participating publishers&#8217; content appeared to include its News aggregator product on the desktop and a personalized content feed on mobile devices, called Google Discover.</p>
<p>Evidently, it hoped to be able to further expand where across its online real-estate the licensed content appears &#8212; including by adding News Showcase into search results.</p>
<p>However, in Europe, where Google&#8217;s search engine remains dominant, its plan quickly landed it in regulatory hot water over competition concerns.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the News Showcase product provides the prospect of raised visibility for participating publishers by featuring their content to Google users across a number of touchpoints &#8212; including giving mobile users the ability to follow publishers so that more of their content gets threaded into personalized feeds. So there is a strong incentive for publishers to cut deals with Google &#8212; giving it leverage over content licensing negotiations.</p>
<p>For example, publishers may feel incentivized to cut deals with Google for News Showcase in order not to miss out on the prospect of extra traffic being sent their way (especially if competitors have already cut deals) &#8212; putting commercial pressure on them to agree to broad licensing terms that might waive or reduce copyright-based licensing fees.</p>
<p>The problem for Google is that European competition regulators have not been taken in by its attempt to use a proprietary news display product and commercial terms to smudge copyright compliance by co-mingling News Showcase negotiations and contacts with legally required licensing fees &#8212; and have instead listened to publisher complaints that Google is not playing fair. (The FCO probe, for example, was opened following a complaint filed by the collecting society Corint Media.)</p>
<p>Issuing a hefty sanction last summer, the French competition watchdog said Google had sought to unilaterally impose its global news licensing product in negotiations with publishers — pushing for the legal neighbouring right to be incorporated as “an ancillary component with no separate financial valuation”.</p>
<p>Its investigation continues &#8212; but has already landed Google with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a $592 million fine for breaching an earlier order</a>.</p>
<p>Germany hasn&#8217;t issued any sanctions yet, but with the FCO flush with new powers to tackle abusive digital giants, the threat is clearly there. Hence Google&#8217;s alacritous offer of tweaks to how it operates the News Showcase product in Germany (the FCO only began probing the T&amp;Cs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">last summer</a>).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s dominance in Europe in the market for general search means the company has faced a number of antirust enforcements in recent years &#8212; both at an EU and national level. But it&#8217;s fair to say that EU Member States&#8217; competition watchdogs have been quickest to respond to news publishers&#8217; concerns.</p>
<p>Germany was one of the first markets to get News Showcase which has likely fed the FCO&#8217;s relatively quick scrutiny of the product. Although France was faster to transpose the EU copyright reform into national law &#8212; and its competition watchdog has been keenly focused on Google&#8217;s compliance with the neighbouring right requirement, and with the detail of how it has negotiated fees with news publishers over reuse of their content.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">December</a>, the French regulator announced Google had made a series of commitments around negotiating in good faith &#8212; which it proposed should apply for a period of five years.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s watchdog is consulting on Google&#8217;s proposal until the end of this month &#8212; after which it will make a decision whether to accept them or require additional measures.</p>
<p>The German FCO is also now consulting locally on Google&#8217;s operational offers around News Showcase.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bundeskartellamt president Andreas Mundt said: “Google has proposed measures to respond to our competition concerns relating to Google News Showcase. The company no longer plans to include Showcase content in the general search results. The conditions for participating in Google News Showcase are not intended to prevent publishers from enforcing their general ancillary copyright. Access to Google News Showcase is based on objective criteria. We rely on the assessment of the market players affected to ensure that the measures proposed by Google are effective. In view of the wide variety of interests the publishers may have we are thus conducting broader consultations in the sector.”</p>
<p>He further noted that the regulator is keeping a close eye on how Google negotiates with publishers over copyright fees, adding:<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> “Parallel to the Google News Showcase proceeding we are closely monitoring the negotiations on ancillary copyright fees.”</span></p>
<p>In yet another recent regulatory intervention triggered by publisher (and adtech) complaints, Google&#8217;s plan to deprecate support for third-party tracking cookies and move to a suite of new ad targeting technologies (aka Privacy Sandbox) is under close supervision of the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; and that process has also led Google to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">propose a series of commitments in order to be allowed to proceed</a>.</p>
<p>Separately last summer, France&#8217;s competition watchdog hit Google with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">a $268 million fine for self preferencing its adtech</a> &#8212; leading to yet another behavioral offer from the tech giant, in that case a set of interoperability commitments.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> A Google spokesperson has now sent this statement on its News Showcase proposals in Germany:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Google News Showcase is the kind of licensing programs that had been demanded for years by publishers as well as policy makers. We are glad that more than 700 publications globally are already part of Showcase, with more than 90 publications in Germany alone. These are new services that bring value to consumers and we’re happy to work with the German competition authority on finding the right approach efficiently. We have already made some changes and proposed further measures for improvement and are looking forward to any further feedback. At the same time we continue this important work together with our publishing partners in order to support quality journalism in Germany and beyond.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s now 2022 and there are many, many apps out there that allow you to do cardio or build muscle by taking classes inside smartphone apps. We are all familiar with the success of platforms like Peloton (IPO’d), but there are of course new upstarts such as FiiT (raised £9 million) or Fitplan (raised $9.9 million). Plus there is <a href="http://Moxie.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moxie</a>, where coaches create their own courses. What has not quite been cracked yet is the celebrity fitness class. <a href="http://Masterclass.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MasterClass</a> has largely cornered the market in the higher arts, but celebrity fitness is a relatively undiscovered country. Yes, of course, there have been individual celebrities who made their own fitness app &#8212; but these have limited appeal and amount to a side-hustle for the celeb.</p>
<p>Now a new startup &#8212; in beta since 2021 &#8212; hopes to become that platform where elite athletes can train mere mortals such as myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mastersapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masters</a> (see what they did there?) is an app that lets users train with some of the world’s most famous athletes and learn the tricks of their trade via four-week guided, on-demand training programs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255587" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has now closed a $2.7 million seed funding round led by Sweet Capital (the King.com founders fund), with participation from Mucker Capital, Goodwater Capital and Luxor Capital. In addition, a number of athletes also threw in some angel cash, including Shaun White, Bam Adebayo, Kai Lenny and A’ja Wilson, as well as professional tech angel investors including Anton Gauffin, Jakob Joenck, Henrik Kraft, Greg Tseng, Prerna Gupta, Hank Vigil, Janis Zech and Andreas Mihalovits.</p>
<p>The company has signed-up world-famous athletes such as X Games and three-time Olympic snowboarding champion Shaun White; World and nine-time U.S. champion in 3,000 meter steeplechase, Emma Coburn; surfing world champion, Kai Lenny; soccer superstar and Golden Ball winner, Ada Hegerberg; and two-time Wimbledon tennis champion, Petra Kvitova &#8212; among many others.</p>
<p>Greg Drach, CEO and co-founder of Masters said: “The future of learning is ‘learning from the best,’ and in that same vein the future of training is training with the best. If 10 people can go to an in-person group exercise class led by a very good trainer, then why can’t 1,000 people, or 10,000 people take a virtual class led by an Olympic champion or NBA legend?… Our goal is to translate those winning methods into actionable programs that anyone can adopt.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256197" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2256197" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png" alt="Masters app" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256197" class="wp-caption-text">Masters app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Masters</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Masters is live now as an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/masters-train-with-the-best/id1535052326?_branch_match_id=959268345108113932&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=marketing&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT08t0ctNLC5JLSpOLCjQS87P1ffPCA%2FLDvavqMxKAgDvSt2HJgAAAA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> app, with each course being cohort-based, meaning that those participating are doing so alongside peers who are on the same journey. Each course is presented in high-quality video.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2021 by Greg Drach and Christian Dorffer &#8212; the founders of Midnight Runners, urban running communities, along with Daniel Taschik, the former CTO/co-founder of Dubsmash, the video-sharing app acquired by Reddit in 2020 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/reddit-is-shutting-down-dubsmash-and-integrating-video-tools-into-its-own-app/">shut down by same last year</a>.</p>
<p>Riccardo Zacconi of Sweet Capital commented: “I always wanted to know what the best professional athletes do to reach the top. Like, what do they actually do when they go to the gym? Masters has managed to distill their routines into tangible programs that anyone can do, and they’ve struck a powerful chord with a lot of people.”</p>
<p>Capital from this round of funding will be deployed by Masters to sign new athletes, launch an Android app and improve the product.</p>
<p>Dorffer told me: “People love to follow their sports idols on TV, social media, print and audiobooks… Masters represents a brand new publishing format, we call it ‘interactive training documentaries’. We believe this premium educational format is the future and that traditional lean-back video formats will struggle to compete.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro showed off Wednesday one of the final pieces of its commercial autonomous delivery strategy.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised more than $2.13 billion since former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">founded the company in June 2016</a>, unveiled a third-generation electric autonomous delivery vehicle designed for commercial operations and manufactured in partnership with BYD North America.</p>
<p>Nuro has dropped the alpha-numeric nomenclature (R1 and then R2) for this delivery bot that is designed to haul packages, not people. Instead, the vehicle is called &#8220;Nuro&#8221; — a self-titled album of sorts meant to introduce the robot to the masses and a name that illustrates where this flagship model sits within the company. If it&#8217;s not clear, the &#8220;Nuro&#8221; is at the top.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Nuro bot is not a sidewalk delivery bot. This new generation, and all of Nuro&#8217;s previous iterations, are meant for the road.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256493" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Modular-Compartments-GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256493" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Modular-Compartments-GIF.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="698" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>The new &#8220;Nuro&#8221; bot, which has twice the cargo volume of the previous model, customizable storage and temperature-controlled compartments to keep items warm or cool, is an automotive production-grade vehicle. This means the bot is designed and produced to handle the toils one might expect a delivery vehicle to endure, including weather, potholes, human abuse and long hours on the road.</p>
<p>The Nuro delivery bot also contains safety features, which are designed to protect people like pedestrians and cyclists who might encounter the vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with several types of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar and thermal cameras to provide a 360-degree view that has built-in redundancy in case one fails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One notable item is an exterior airbag that will deploy if the vehicle were to come into contact with a person or other object.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256606" style="width: 4106px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256606" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256606 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png" alt="Nuro autonomous delivery bot airbag" width="4096" height="2160" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=680,359 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=1536,810 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=2048,1080 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4096px) 100vw, 4096px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256606" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<h2>Bot history</h2>
<p>Initially, the company used modified Toyota Prius sedans for testing as well as for pilot grocery deliveries in Arizona and Texas.</p>
<p>The company transitioned in December 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/nuros-self-driving-vehicle-is-a-grocery-getter-and-errand-runner/">to the R1</a>, its first step toward a vehicle designed exclusively for packages.</p>
<p>Its second-generation vehicle, called the R2, was introduced in February 2020. The R2, which was designed and assembled in the U.S. in partnership with Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, was equipped with lidar, radar and cameras to give the &#8220;driver&#8221; a 360-degree view of its surroundings.</p>
<p>However, it was missing a few features typically required by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. After three years of working with regulators, Nuro received a driverless exemption from NHTSA for its R2 vehicle. The exemption allows the vehicle to operate even though it doesn&#8217;t have side-view mirrors, a windshield and a rear-view camera that shuts off when driving forward.</p>
<p>Nuro has also received all of the necessary approvals and permits to operate an autonomous vehicle delivery service — that can charge customers — in California.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;Nuro&#8221; bot is the final step, at least for now, toward its commercial goals.</p>
<h2>Building bots in the desert</h2>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t quite ready to unleash its Nuro en masse just yet. Although it&#8217;s getting close.</p>
<p>Nuro has raised an abundant amount of capital, piloted its vehicle with high-profile partners and grown to more than 1,200 employees.</p>
<p>In less than five years, the company has attracted high-profile private and institutional investors, including Greylock Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Its latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">$600 million fundraising round</a> announced just a few months ago was led by new investor Tiger Global Management and included Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Gaorong Capital, Google, Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital.</p>
<p>Nuro has also landed several high-profile partners, including 7-Eleven, CVS pharmacies, Domino&#8217;s, FedEx, Kroger grocery stores and Walmart.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s using some of that capital to build a new $40 million end-of-line manufacturing facility and closed-course test track in southern Nevada. The company is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/the-station-rivian-makes-its-ipo-move-nuro-pushes-into-nevada-and-waymo-scales-up-in-sf/">taking over 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a> to build a closed-course testing facility that will allow the development and validation of its autonomous on-road vehicles. The testing track will measure bot performance in a broad range of scenarios, from avoiding pedestrians and pets to giving bicycles space on shared roadways, as well as environmental tests and vehicle systems validation, the company has previously said.</p>
<p>Its supplier partner BYD North America will assemble the hardware components of the new model; it will then be completed at Nuro&#8217;s new facility, where the bots will be readied for deployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;BYD attaches great importance to this collaboration with Nuro,&#8221; Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD Co. Ltd. and president of BYD Motors Inc., said in a statement. Li added that BYD will use the manufacturing capacity of its Lancaster facility to support Nuro and bring more jobs to California.</p>
<p>Nuro wouldn&#8217;t provide specific production capacity figures; the company says the facility has the capacity to manufacture and test &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of delivery vehicles per year. And it didn&#8217;t give a timeline except to say its Nevada facilities will be fully operational this year. Construction began at the site in November 2021.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t say where these commercial-grade bots will be deployed first. The company did confirm that it has reached a formal agreement with existing partner Kroger to use the new Nuro delivery bots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.eureka.security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eureka</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that provides enterprises with tools to manage security risks across their various data stores, today announced that it has raised an $8 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YL Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Liat Hayun (CEO), a former VP of Product Management at Palo Alto Networks, and Asaf Weiss (CTO), who was formerly a director of Engineering at Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks. During their time at these companies, they noticed the need for better cloud data security and management tools as businesses continued to amass more data spread across a wider range of clouds and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is a valuable asset for helping businesses operate and compete. However, it has spiraled well beyond the feasible control and management of enterprise security leaders, leaving it exposed and at risk of leaks and loss as well as destruction and exfiltration by bad actors,&#8221; Hayun said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A lot of companies are only now realizing the magnitude of this problem, she noted, in part because they are still going through their transitions to the cloud and because sensitive data is often the last asset to make this move.</p>
<p>The idea behind Eureka then is to give these businesses insights into all the cloud data stores that are connected to their systems and help them manage access policies and discover configuration issues and policy violations. While many organizations have clear ideas about how they think about data protection, implementing those policies across different data stores, all with their own settings and capabilities, is often a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security leaders are especially excited about Eureka’s policy translation engine,&#8221; Hayun explained. &#8220;The engine automatically translates data protection policies around privacy, risk, compliance and security into platform-specific controls that can be implemented into each cloud data store. It is currently very difficult to translate one into the other, especially as these translation results will vary across different data stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team tells me that it believes products from competitors like Imperva and IBM are mostly trying to apply an on-prem approach to a cloud-native problem, while platform-specific solutions aren&#8217;t able to address the larger problem of managing access across data environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By offering security leaders the operational powers they require without causing friction to business interests, Liat and Asaf are ushering in an entirely new kind of digital transformation in the coming years,&#8221; says John Brennan, partner at YL Ventures. They’re enabling companies to leverage any cloud data store they wish while ensuring that security teams maintain full visibility and understanding into the organization’s entire cloud footprint and can easily evolve and manage policy whenever needed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeekOut, which aims to help enterprises hire from a more diverse talent pool, announced it has raised $115 million in a Series C round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values the Seattle-based startup at over $1.2 billion and brings its total raised to $189 million since its 2017 inception. It follows a year of 300% growth in revenue, bringing its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to the $25 million to $50 million range. For some context, SeekOut was valued at $500 million when it raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $65 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March of 2021 &#8212; also led by Tiger Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of former Microsoft executives and engineers —  </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/anoop-gupta-b16d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anoop Gupta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aravind-bala-f211" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aravind Bala</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-tippett-4a54" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> John Tippett</span></a> and<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vikas-manocha-7c7e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vikas Manocha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — came up with the foundation of what would eventually become <a href="http://www.seekout.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeekOut</a> in 2016 when they began building a messaging platform that provided a deep level of information about people that others might be emailing. When the quartet realized that what customers really were after was the information they were uncovering, and not so much the messaging capability, the company pivoted in 2017.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, SeekOut’s goal is to help talent acquisition teams recruit “hard-to-find and diverse talent.” It’s a problem faced by many companies, and increased demand for its offering is evidenced by the fact that over the last 11 months, SeekOut has grown its customer base from 500 to more than 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen very high retention and huge growth with existing customers,” said Gupta, the company’s co-founder and CEO. He declined to name names, but said that SeekOut is working with six of the 10 “most highly valued companies” by market cap in the U.S. Its customers hail from a range of industries, from technology to pharmaceutical to aerospace and defense to banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last two years, we’ve seen a seismic shift in the world of work and how companies are engaging with employees,” Gupta told TechCrunch. “There is a lot at stake and how companies hire, retain, grow and develop their people will make a difference between companies surviving or thriving, or dying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, SeekOut has built out a database with hundreds of millions of profiles using its AI-powered talent search engine and “deep interactive analytics.” It finds talent by scouring public data and using natural-language and machine-learning technologies to understand the expertise of each candidate to build a complete 360-degree view of each potential employee. Specifically, it blends info from public profiles, GitHub, papers and patents, employee referrals, company alumni and candidates in ATS systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While SeekOut initially focused strictly on technical talent, it has since broadened its base to helping recruiters and sources find more diverse candidates in general, as well as people with simply “hard-to-find” skill sets. And it claims to do it with “unprecedented speed and precision” via a blind hiring method designed to reduce bias by doing things like giving companies or individuals the ability to filter out things like an applicant’s name, photo or school attended. SeekOut then gives recruiters a way to engage with candidates instantly by getting access to the right contact information in a “single click.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gupta said SeekOut’s platform (dubbed Talent-360) helps companies not only find diverse talent, but helps them improve retention by finding the “right” candidate to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, enterprises are essentially flying blind when it comes to building and maintaining their workforces. The balance of power is shifting to the employees and the employees care about purpose, flexibility, compensation and their growth,” Gupta said. “And when not done right, it leads to employees walking with their feet and so the great resignation, the great reshuffle is becoming a big challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s also a huge opportunity, the executive believes. And so perhaps it’s not a surprise that SeekOut is emphasizing efforts to help companies not just hire quality talent, but also retain it as part of a new talent optimization offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a logical move for the company, which has demonstrated strength in talent acquisition.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256550" style="width: 2670px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256550" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256550 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2660" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg 2660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,1039 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1386 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2660px) 100vw, 2660px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256550" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SeekOut</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How companies can develop their internal talent and what they can do, or how they broaden the aperture of hiring, becomes more important with remote and hybrid work and diversity becoming critical to hiring great talent,” Gupta said. “These are all becoming basically very fundamental things that enterprises need to do. To get ahead, given these seismic shifts in technology and innovation, companies can go from being leaders to laggards in a short time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, SeekOut has seen its headcount tripled to about 120 and will likely triple again in 2022, according to Gupta. It is close to break-even in terms of cash flow, but Gupta says that the company’s “revenue growth has been so rapid” that it is supporting its investment growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest financing also included participation from Founders Circle Capital, and other existing backers including Madrona Venture Group and Mayfield. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Circle’s participation in particular was notable in that it led to SeekOut being able to support a secondary for its employees. Since Founders Circle was willing to buy common shares from employees, some were able to sell a small portion of their vested shares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m really delighted that our employees are able to realize some of the benefits of their hard work and the success they have created for SeekOut,” Gupta said. “This is something we intentionally sought out to give to our employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Tiger Global Partner John Curtius acknowledges that there is a clear shift in the way companies are thinking about hiring and retaining talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SeekOut is at the forefront of this change, delivering a best-in-class solution for talent optimization that enables businesses to hire, grow and retain their workforce like never before,” he said in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with them as they continue to reshape the industry and provide companies with data, insights, and actions that drive results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gupta believes that talent recruitment and retention is no longer the problem of an HR department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right talent is key to success and that’s why this is becoming a CEO and board of directors Top of Mind issue rather than just something for HR leaders to worry about,” he said. “Data is everywhere in the enterprise, except where you need it most, which is informing the decisions about people you need and the people you have.”</span></p>
<p>In fact, SeekOut&#8217;s data-focused strategy was a big factor in attracting <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/s-somasegar/">S. Somasegar, Managing Director at Madrona</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Their deep technology approach of building the most comprehensive profile of people and a semantic search engine to enable hiring managers and recruiters to be able to clearly define what they are looking for in talent, and being able to generate the right pool of candidates to look from is both unique and highly effective in talent sourcing,&#8221; he wrote via email. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments company <a href="https://www.checkout.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkout.com</a> isn’t just a unicorn — it has closed a $1 billion Series D funding round. Following today’s round, the company is now valued at $40 billion.</p>
<p>That’s a stark increase compared to last year’s valuation. With its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">Series C round</a>, the company raised $450 million at a $15 billion valuation — it represents a 167% valuation jump in 12 months, which is not too bad.</p>
<p>Checkout.com is building a full-stack payments company — it acts as a gateway, an acquirer, a risk engine and a payment processor. The company lets you process payments directly on your site or in your app, but you can also rely on hosted payment pages, create payment links, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It supports card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Alipay, bank transfers, SEPA direct debits and even cash payments through various local networks.</p>
<p>Last year, the company also added the ability to issue payouts. Checkout.com customers can send money to a bank account. It also supports payouts to a card on the Mastercard or Visa network. For instance, TikTok and MoneyGram have been using Checkout.com’s payouts feature.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>, Checkout.com focuses specifically on large global enterprise merchants with a high volume of transactions. Some of the company’s clients include Netflix, Farfetch, Grab, NetEase, Pizza Hut and Shein. The company also contributes to the payments stack of several fintech unicorns such as Klarna, Qonto, Revolut and WorldRemit.</p>
<p>When it comes to today’s funding round, fasten your seatbelt, as the list of investors is quite long. Investors who participated in the round include Altimeter, Dragoneer, Franklin Templeton, GIC, Insight Partners, the Qatar Investment Authority, Tiger Global, the Oxford Endowment Fund and “another large west coast mutual fund management firm,” the company writes in its announcement.</p>
<p>Some of the company’s existing investors are also participating, such as Blossom Capital, Coatue Management, DST Global, Endeavor Catalyst and Ribbit Capital.</p>
<p>Why did Checkout.com raise so much money? Because they can. The company says it has been profitable for several years, which means that investors are just adding money to the balance sheet for long-term growth. Checkout.com only had to hand out 2.5% of the company&#8217;s shares in exchange for $1 billion.</p>
<p>“By combining an elegant technology stack with industry expertise and an &#8216;extra-mile&#8217; approach to service over the past decade, we&#8217;ve built deep partnerships with some of the world’s most innovative companies,” founder and CEO Guillaume Pousaz said in a statement. “Our Series D is validation of that work—but given we’re still in ‘chapter zero’ of our journey, it will also fuel our efforts to unlock the enormous untapped opportunity ahead.”</p>
<p>The company processed hundreds of billions of dollars in payments in 2021 alone. It has tripled its transaction volume for the third year in a row and it now has 1,700 employees across 19 countries.</p>
<p>Up next, Checkout.com wants to focus specifically on the U.S. market. With its headquarter in London, the company originally focused on the EMEA region. And yet, as it tries to work with global enterprise merchants, having a solution that works across all markets could be a big selling point for future clients.</p>
<p>“Much like our approach in EMEA, we will maintain our focus on the enterprise — especially fintech, software, food delivery, travel, e-commerce and crypto merchants. We’re looking to help our U.S. customers grow domestically and internationally, and to help our non-US customers expand into the market here,” Checkout.com’s CFO Céline Dufétel said in a statement.</p>
<h2>The web3 opportunity</h2>
<p>With today’s funding round, Checkout.com will most certainly hire more people and sign new clients. But the company doesn’t plan to stand still, as it wants to launch new products.</p>
<p>The ability to issue payouts has created new opportunities. In particular, Checkout.com plans to support marketplaces and payment facilitators later this year. It’ll be a full end-to-end solution with identity verification and the ability to split payments so that marketplace operators can keep a cut on each transaction.</p>
<p>Marketplace customers will also be able to hold funds directly on a marketplace thanks to a new treasury-as-a-service feature. It opens up a ton of possibility as marketplaces can embed financial services directly in their products.</p>
<p>Stripe announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">Stripe Treasury</a> last year. Shopify has been using the feature for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify Balance</a>. It proves once again that both Stripe and Checkout.com want to cover a bigger chunk of the payment chain.</p>
<p>In addition to new products, Checkout.com has realized that web3 represents a market opportunity. The company already powers some of the payments features of several cryptocurrency companies, such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, FTX, MoonPay and Novi from Meta.</p>
<p>But creating bridges between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies is just one part of the web3 equation. Checkout.com is also beta-testing a solution that could let its customers settle transactions for merchants using digital currencies. In other words, the Checkout.com of web3 could very well be Checkout.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of us are moving around these days a lot less than we used to &#8212; because of COVID, we&#8217;re working from home instead of an office; and we are traveling and going out less. Now, as we shift back into more &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior, a startup that&#8217;s helping to better understand where and how we are getting around has picked up a significant round of funding. <a href="https://www.placer.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Placer.ai</a>, which has built a platform to track and understand footfall in a variety of venues, has raised $100 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its platform. Placer has confirmed that the round values it at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is coming from an interesting mix of strategic and financial investors. It&#8217;s being led by Josh Buckley (the CEO of Product Hunt), with participation from WndrCo (Disney/Dreamworks&#8217; supremo Jeffrey Katzenberg&#8217;s investment firm), Lachy Groom, MMC Technology Ventures LLC, Fifth Wall Ventures and Array Ventures, as well as a swathe of real estate names, including J.M. Schapiro (CEO of Continental Realty Corp), Eliot Bencuya and Jeff Karsh of Tryperion Partners, Daniel Klein of Klein Enterprises/Sundeck Capital and Majestic Realty. This round is coming less than a year after Placer.ai&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/location-data-analytics-startup-placer-ai-raises-50m-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Placer has around 1,000 customers across real estate and property, retail, consumer packaged goods and municipalities &#8212; some of the names include JLL, Regency Centers, Taubman, Planet Fitness, BJ’s Wholesale Club and Grocery Outlet &#8212; which are using it to determine anonymized crowd movement, size and sentiment to help with their decision making and strategic planning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256646" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The plan is to invest both in building out that user base further and in the platform itself, by bringing in more physical and digital data sets &#8212; for example vehicle traffic, planned construction data, web traffic and purchase data to augment the 50+ data sets that it aggregates today &#8212; which in turn will lead to more use cases for Placer&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>Given how much our movements have been curtailed in the last couple of years, it&#8217;s somewhat ironic that a company whose currency is physical presence in open places would be growing, much less raising money on the back of its potential. In actual fact, Noam Ben-Zvi, Placer&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, tells me that business has been stronger in recent years than ever before.</p>
<p>Growth is largely coming in two areas. First, people were still shopping, and going to other places, so existing customers were using it to figure out how, where and why people were moving around when they were (indeed Placer.ai created a <a href="https://www.placer.ai/the-square/recovery-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery dashboard</a> to track specifically around this idea and how it related to COVID-19). Over time, that core business has gotten smarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been around for five years working with early adopters giving us feedback,&#8221; Ben-Zvi said. &#8220;They pass us known information about their properties and we can use that to retrain and calibrate our models so they get more accurate.&#8221; A lot of this to date has been about historical data but now the company is shifting into providing more predictive insights as well, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, the pandemic gave rise to a new set of reasons to need this kind of data, whether it was to determine crowds at testing or vaccination sites, or because the changing economy was precipitating real estate dealmaking, or something else. This meant new customers were, for example, using Placer&#8217;s tools for M&amp;A due diligence, or to help determine interesting opportunities for investment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he notes that one salient point that Placer has determined is that even with the rise of virtual experiences, physical is not quite dead yet. &#8220;Everywhere the rebound is impressively fast,&#8221; he noted. This is in marked contrast to when the pandemic first descended on the world in early 2020. &#8220;When COVID hit we were concerned. We froze our hiring, and waited since some of our customers weren&#8217;t even opening anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of the data that Placer is able to pass on to customers &#8212; who essentially construct their own parameters for searching using a self-service tool &#8212; has traditionally been out of their reach despite their best efforts. Katzenberg&#8217;s previous work in the entertainment industry gave him first-hand experience of those black holes in consumer behavior and sentiment, which is one reason why he has gravitated to a company building technology to solve that now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Placer provides instant, simple and actionable insights to questions we&#8217;ve been asking as operators for over 30 years. The pace of innovation, the unique trust that the company has developed, and the massive market demand all point to the magnitude and scale of what this team can achieve,” said Katzenberg in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have long felt like the disruption Placer can bring is massive, but the market demand has far exceeded our initial expectations,&#8221; added Josh Buckley. “We see a powerful opportunity to continue partnering with Placer to improve the way decisions are made in the physical world, fundamentally improving the way these businesses and organizations operate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.headspace.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headspace Health</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.sayana.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sayana</a>, an AI-powered mental health and wellness company, for an undisclosed amount. Headspace Health says the acquisition of the San Francisco-based company will expand its ability to provide personalized self-care to its users. The acquisition comes as Headspace and Ginger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/">merged last year</a> to form Headspace Health, which is valued at $3 billion. The merger brought Ginger&#8217;s therapy and coaching offerings together with Headspace&#8217;s mindfulness and meditation services.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 and backed by Y Combinator in 2020, Sayana leverages chat-based sessions with an AI persona that encourages users to track their moods. The app personalizes users&#8217; experiences based on their mood trends and suggests self-care and breathing exercises. The company&#8217;s sleep app helps users get restful sleep sessions based on their mood and sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Headspace Health CEO Russel Glass told TechCrunch in an interview that Sayana&#8217;s apps will continue to operate for a period of time while Headspace Health integrates their core capabilities into the Headspace and Ginger experience. Once the integration is complete, the company will turn off Sayana as a separate experience and move users over into Headspace Health.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Sayana created a unique, member-driven experience and as we think about the future of what we&#8217;re trying to do, it fits elegantly into the Headspace Health vision of a world where you can support the full continuum of care, regardless of where somebody is in the mental health continuum,&#8221; Glass said. &#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve seen during the pandemic is just how many people continue to need support, so we have to keep focused on innovation. We have to ensure that we can automate parts of the mental health continuum and deliver personalized self-care content to people that have a need, and that&#8217;s where this acquisition is so exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Headspace Health is focused on creating an integrated experience to offer mental health help ranging from prevention to clinical care, all from one platform that is backed by AI and data science. With the addition of Sayana, Headspace Health plans to advance its capability to personalize experiences by offering help and services based on users&#8217; check-ins.</p>

<p>Glass stated that Headspace and Ginger are already leveraging AI to support their team of behavioral health coaches, therapists and psychiatrists to ensure quality interactions with users, comprehensive tracking of services and close collaboration among care providers. He outlined that adding Sayana&#8217;s capability to understand a user&#8217;s needs in a completely automated way via a robust chatbot experience will destigmatize experiences and offer more personalized and effective care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the acquisition, Sayana founder and CEO Sergey Fayfer is joining Headspace Health and is taking on a product leadership role within the company.</p>
<p>“Since our inception, we’ve been on a mission at Sayana to put accessible self-care in everyone’s pocket,” Fayfer said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to bring together our technology, engineering and design expertise to help advance Headspace Health’s efforts to democratize high-quality, affordable mental healthcare around the world.”</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Glass says Headspace Health plans to continue to expand to meet the growing needs of care for mental health. The company&#8217;s goal is to be the most accessible and comprehensive platform by reducing the cost of care as much as possible. He outlined that Headspace Health will continue to innovate to ensure that it can reduce the cost of care, while keeping the quality of care as high as possible. Glass noted that this is going to require Headspace Health to be aggressive in terms of how it thinks about both inorganic growth strategies and organic growth strategies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to focus on the employer landscape. You&#8217;ll see us continuing to announce new health plan and provider partnerships, there will be a number of those in the coming months,&#8221; Glass said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to focus on youth as an expansion area for us. You&#8217;ll continue to see us innovate. We&#8217;re spending a lot on research and development and will continue to be acquisitive as we see opportunities to add platforms like Sayana to our platform over time.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jakarta-based investment app <a href="https://pluang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pluang</a> announced that it has raised $55 million led by Accel. This is a follow-on to its Series B and brings that round’s total to $110 million. The funding will be used to make Pluang available in more Southeast Asian countries, increase its asset classes and on hiring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Pluang’s last round of funding was a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pluang-receives-over-us3m-in-funding-led-by-go-ventures-300915718.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 million Series A in 2019</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Other participants in the newest round include Trung Nguyen, Andy Ho, Aleksander Leonard Larsen, Jeffrey Zirlin, Alexa von Tobel, Pismo CTO Daniela Binatti, Monzo COO Sujata Bhatia, <a href="http://Public.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s1">Public.com</span></a> co-CEOs Jannick Malling and Leif Abraham, FalconX CEO Raghu Yarlagadda, Flink CEO Sergio Jimenez, The Chainsmokers and BRI Ventures. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Existing investors</a> Square Peg, Go-Ventures and Openspace Ventures also contributed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1">Launched in 2019, Pluang started with gold and has since grown its range of asset classes, so investors can diversify their holdings and decrease risk. Investments can start as low as IDR 10,000 (or less than $1 USD) in gold, indexes, mutual funds and crypto assets. The app is also launching new features that will allow users to invest in fractional U.S. stocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Affordability is an incredibly important thing to address for our new retail investors,” said co-founder and co-CEO Claudia Kolonas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Pluang is integrated in Indonesian super apps like Gojek, DANA, Tokopedia and Bukalapak, and now claims 3.5 million registered users in Indonesia, and says that from January 2020 to November 2021, it marked 22x growth in monthly transacting users and 28.5x growth in users with an active balance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Kolonas said the new interest in investment is driven by the country’s high rates of smartphone penetration and savings per capita. “Because of this, there are millions of potential first-time investors just starting to establish money management habits and practices that were previously impossible where they live. Until very recently, most of the asset classes that can be accessed through Pluang were only available to the privileged and wealthy while most others were faced with low financial literacy and very limited investing options.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Like many other investment apps in Indonesia, Pluang includes financial literacy features, which Kolonas said it is “laser-focused on” improving. The new funding will enable Pluang to “provide the tools, resources and education necessary to set our users up for long-term wealth creation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In a statement to TechCrunch, Accel partner Ethan Choi said Pluang is Accel’s fourth investment in consumer-focused investment apps globally, after the United States’ <span class="s1">Public.com</span>, Europe’s Trade Republic and Latin America’s Flink. “We were looking for the leader in Southeast Asia,” he said, adding that “after meeting Claudia and Richard [Chua, Pluang’s other co-founder and co-CEO], we were deeply impressed by the traction they have achieved on minimal capital and the fact that they were the only player that had the licenses and product to offer multiple asset classes including equities, indexes, and crypto &#8212; which we believe is critical to building a big business in the region.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ecommerce Brands aims to differentiate itself from the crowded aggregator space by being the technology force for DTC brands to scale while operators focus on running their businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ecommercebrands.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecommerce Brands</a> is one of the newest consumer brand aggregators to emerge in a crowded space and aims to integrate with Cart.com to support the backend needs of brands as they scale.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based company officially kicked off in September 2021, helmed by founder and CEO Mark Bickenbach, who previously served as a business unit president of The Home Depot and CFO of its website, and board chairman Jim Jacobsen, former CEO of RTIC Outdoors and co-founder of Cart.com.</p>
<p>Today, it announced a $40 million investment, with $10 million in equity led by Bearing Ventures, and $30 million in debt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256392" style="width: 496px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256392" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2256392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?w=486" alt="Mark Bickenbach, Ecommerce Brands" width="486" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg 1654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256392" class="wp-caption-text">Mark Bickenbach, founder and CEO of Ecommerce Brands. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ecommerce Brands</p></div></p>
<p>Cart.com, a company providing end-to-end e-commerce services, brought in its own funding round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/e-commerce-as-a-service-platform-cart-com-picks-up-98m-to-give-brands-scaling-tools/">$98 million Series B</a> last August for its software, services and infrastructure for businesses to scale online.</p>
<p>Bickenbach told TechCrunch that Ecommerce Brands plans to acquire direct-to-consumer brands, integrate them on Cart.com and grow them in revenue and profitability, something that previously would have only been done on marketplaces.</p>
<p>“Direct-to-consumer brands are limited in a number of ways, including scaling their operations and technology,” he said. “They run on thinner margins and focus on a single channel, so if you are trying to cover the fixed costs of business, putting money across channels is hard to do. That is where we see the opportunity to take a business, add the technology and let the operators deal with running a business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He believes that is what differentiates his company from the e-commerce aggregators acquiring successful brands from the likes of Amazon and Shopify.</p>
<p>Overall, e-commerce aggregators have gained traction across the world in the past few years, with successful companies securing billions of venture-backed capital in recent years. Most recently we saw Merama in Latin America become a unicorn after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/e-commerce-aggregator-merama-gets-its-horn-after-just-12-months-in-business/">raising $60 million</a>, while Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will be used to acquire the businesses and get them moving on Cart.com for their back-end operations. Ecommerce Brands also will be building out its own tools to manage growth and operations, while also doing some hiring in the area of supply chain. Bickenbach expects those new tools to be ready by March.</p>
<p>Ecommerce Brands has since acquired five brands, together with annual gross sales of more than $150 million. It is mainly looking at businesses that are EBITDA positive.</p>
