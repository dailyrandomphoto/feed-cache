</div><p id="speakable-summary">Content marketers today face a constant struggle between keeping up with the volume of content they’re expected to produce and getting creative to produce rich, quality work that deeply impacts their audience.</p>
<p>Content marketing is recognized as a powerful tool, driving higher conversions than traditional marketing. However, the teams creating that content are using an outdated playbook that focuses on serving algorithms before audiences by constantly churning out posts targeting bots over brains.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An amplified marketing strategy fosters a connection between your audience and the expertise they’re seeking.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/content-marketing/biggest-content-marketing-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accenture survey</a> of more than 1,000 marketing executives across the globe, respondents were unanimous: Content overload is a top challenge. And 50% said they currently have more content than they are fully prepared to manage.</p>
<p>The strategies that made content marketing so riveting at its start haven’t evolved to meet the challenges of today’s marketers as they compete for their audience’s attention in a vast landscape of newsletters, podcasts, video series, blogs and social media.</p>
<p>With too much content to create or manage and too little time to measure its success or repurpose what they’ve already created, marketers need a new plan of action that puts creativity before quantity, audience before engine, and sets connection as the top priority. They need an amplified marketing strategy.</p>
<h2>What is amplified marketing?</h2>
<p>The amplified marketing approach puts captivating conversations at the center of your content strategy. Those conversations — with industry experts, customers, internal thought leaders, influencers and decision-makers — serve as the source material for all your marketing assets, streamlining your content creation, aligning your teams across channels and giving your audience the insights they’re seeking.</p>
<p>Amplified marketing turns to powerful metrics to identify what resonates with an audience and what’s not catching on. By extracting more value from the content they create and assessing its success, marketers can work more efficiently, effectively and creatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Start with a conversation</h2>
<p>Amplified marketing starts with a good conversation with someone who knows what they’re talking about on a topic your audience wants to explore. How do you do that? Bring the focus back to the audience.</p>
<p>Consider what questions they need answered, what new ideas they’re missing out on and what subjects excite or inspire them. Instead of developing a list of topics for content marketers to research and write about, put together a list of people who can offer your audience those answers, insights and big ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, the company <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/expedite-conversation-design-with-the-automated-chatbot-designer-in-amazon-lex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Amazon Lex in preview</a>, a new tool that simplifies the chatbot training and design process by bringing a level of automation to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to announce the Amazon Lex automated chat bot builder, a new capability that reduces bot design from weeks to just hours,&#8221; Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of Amazon AI told the audience at the AI and machine learning keynote today.</p>
<p>It does this by taking advantage of advanced natural language understanding powered by deep learning techniques. In fact, he said that developers can now create a foundational chatbot designed using historical call transcripts in just a few clicks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[The Lex] automated chat bot designer can typically analyze 10,000 lines of transcripts within a couple of hours to identify intents such as &#8216;file a new claim&#8217; or &#8216;check claim status.&#8217; It makes sure these intents are well separated and there is no overlap between them, eliminating the need for a trial and error approach,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He said that without this automation, it&#8217;s a highly manual and tedious developer task. &#8220;The organizational design of a chatbot is highly complex, manual and prone to errors. It requires understanding the nuances of a spoken language and human interactions, and without this specific expertise, developers spend hundreds of hours combing through all the historic called transcripts to find things like common user requests and the required information to to solve this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you think about a common use case for AI, chatbots certainly come to mind. They may be designed for in-house use to answer questions about how to order a new computer or get your newborn child on the company health insurance, or they may act as a customer service front end to collect vital information and answer simple questions, while funneling more complex questions to a human customer service agent.</p>
<p>Many startups have launched to make it easier to create more accurate chatbots, but it&#8217;s also low-hanging fruit for a company like Amazon, whose customers may be looking for a solution on the platform to go with their other AI and machine learning projects.</p>
<p>Amazon Lex is available starting today in preview. Developers can use Lex for free during the preview phase, but will be charged based on the time it takes the tool to analyze a transcript and identify the intents once it is generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2021/">re:Invent conference</a>, AWS today rolled out a slew of new features for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker,</a> the company&#8217;s managed service for building, training and deploying machine learning (ML) models. Swami Sivasubramanian, the vice president of machine learning at Amazon, said the new features aim to make it easier for users to scale machine learning in their organizations.</p>
<p>Firstly, AWS launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-ground-truth-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Ground Truth Plus</a> service that uses an expert workforce to deliver high-quality training datasets faster. SageMaker Ground Truth Plus uses a labeling workflow including machine learning techniques for active learning, pre-labeling and machine validation. The company says the new service reduces costs by up to 40% and doesn&#8217;t require users to have deep machine learning expertise. The service enables users to create training datasets without having to build labeling applications. It also allows you to manage the labeling workforce on your own. SageMaker Ground Truth Plus is currently available in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>The company also rolled out a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-inference-recommender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Inference Recommender</a> tool to help users choose the best available compute instance to deploy machine learning models for optimal performance and cost. AWS says the tool automatically selects the right compute instance type, instance count, container parameters and model optimizations. Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender is generally available in all regions where SageMaker is available except the AWS China regions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, AWS released the preview of a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/12/amazon-sagemaker-serverless-inference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SageMaker Serverless Interface</a> option that allows users to easily deploy machine learning models for inference without having to configure or manage the underlying infrastructure. The new option is available in Northern Virginia, Ohio, Oregon, Ireland, Tokyo and Sydney.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of additive manufacturing is not immune from the SPAC craze. Desktop Metal, Shapeways, Markforged and Velo3D have all either completed or announced plans to go public through the process. Austin-based Essentium <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211201005494/en/Essentium-A-Disruptive-Advanced-Manufacturing-Ecosystem-Provider-to-Become-A-Public-Company-Through-Merger-with-Atlantic-Coastal-Acquisition-Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week highlighted plans</a> to add its name to the growing list, courtesy of a reverse merger with Atlantic Coastal Acquisition Corporation.</p>
<p>The deal would value the combined companies at $974 million, including $345 million in cash, courtesy of Atlantic Coastal. Essentium cites ongoing supply chain issues as a motivating factor in growing interest around additive manufacturing/3D printing.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcoOrNKCWTc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241681" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Fundamental deficits in our existing global supply chain models are being exacerbated by escalating obstacles such as trade imbalances and the global pandemic — all leading to protracted distribution bottlenecks,” CEO Blake Teipel said in a release. “Today’s announcement represents a major milestone in our efforts to provide long-term, sustainable solutions for a new manufacturing paradigm that can meet these global challenges head-on.”</p>
<p>We spoke to Teipel back in 2017, when Essentium detailed a plasma-based system that fuses together plastic 3D-printed material as it prints, resulting in a stronger object than the traditional FDM process. Essentium also utilizes a High Speed Extrusion process, one it claims is 5x to 15x faster than standard extrusion. The company’s existing clients include the U.S. DoD, Lockheed Martin and Ford.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in Q1 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.soundingboardinc.com/">Sounding Board</a>, which started as a platform to connect leaders to coaches through a marketplace, realized early in the pandemic that mentorship needs a refresh.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve always delivered coaching in this traditional services format,” said<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christineptao-leadership-coaching"> Christine Tao</a>, Sounding Board CEO and co-founder.” “Well, we&#8217;re not in the office anymore so we actually have to speak differently about how we&#8217;re developing our talent and our leaders.” The insight led to the launch of a software platform that let users not only connect with coaches, but also track goals on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2241675 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/desktop_mobile_roadmap.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/sounding-board-raises-cash-as-startups-wake-up-to-executive-coaching/">Now, nearly a year after landing a Series A</a> with this vision, Sounding Board has closed a<a href="https://www.soundingboardinc.com/"> $30 million Series B </a>led by Jazz Venture Partners, and joined by Gaingels as well as angel investors such as theBoardlist’s Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Ancestry.com’s Deb Liu, Udemy’s Yvonne Chen and Engage VC’s Tammy Aguiloon. Previous investors in the company include Canaan Partner and Precursor Ventures.</p>
<p>The round also saw JAZZ Venture Partners’ John Spinale join the board, an addition to Sounding Boards’ all-female team (and all-female board). ‘The joke is that we actually had to add diversity to our board…a man,” Tao laughed.</p>
<p>The fundraise comes off of solid growth for Sounding Board, which touts that it has had sequential growth for the past seven quarters. While Tao wouldn’t share specifics on revenues, the company said revenue was in the ‘multi-millions’ in the past and annual bookings have increased more than 350% year over year. Looking at stickiness, Sounding Board claims that net revenue retention is over 200%, meaning that existing customers continue to pay for the platform as time goes on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.betterup.com/?hsLang=en">BetterUp</a>, one of Sounding Board’s largest competitors, has been<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/executive-coaching-for-employees-is-complicated-and-emotional/"> on a recent acquisition spree </a>that illustrates a similarly shifting focus on the software behind coaching. It bought Motive to help BetterUp clients understand the emotional context behind data that they already aggregate, through engagement surveys or polls. The unicorn also scooped up Impraise, which uses technology to help managers better support their direct reports, through real-time performance reviews and more seamless feedback channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tao thinks BetterUp’s growth has helped elevate the importance of executive training to investors, but still sees room for more leadership-focused services instead of a broad-based coaching tool. Over the last year, the co-founder said she’s seen a lot of solutions that are focused on helping individuals manage their capacity through supporting mental and emotional state (<a href="https://www.betterup.com/solutions/betterup-care?hsLang=en">i.e. BetterUp care</a>).</p>
<p>“But alongside that you actually also need to have real skills and capability to be able to manage and effectively communicate,” she said. Sounding Board is more interested in solving for the capability side of executive training, and for now, has no plans to focus on the mental health aspect of it. Of course this could cause competitors to win market share from Sounding Board if they offer both sides in a rich way. For now, Sounding Board’s customers don’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>“If you think about your company&#8217;s benefits [with mental health], it’s a bit more hands off… it’s kind of there and then you choose whether or not you opt into it but it’s really meant to be there for employees &#8221; she said. “Whereas I think for capability-building there is this business need, investment they want to mke, and a level of responsibility that they have.”</p>
<p>Sounding Board currently has 100 customers, including Plaid, Chime and Bill.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space startup <a href="https://www.phasefour.io/">Phase Four</a> will be rolling out the next generation of its Maxwell radio-frequency plasma propulsion system next year, which the company says offers key performance improvements to allow spacecraft using it a wider range of maneuverability in orbit.</p>
<p>In general, when moving a satellite around in the vacuum of space, one cares about two key performance metrics: thrust and “specific impulse” (ISP), a measure of the system’s efficiency in how much thrust it provides per unit of propellant.</p>
<p>These trade-offs are especially salient for small spacecraft manufacturers. Systems with high thrust require carrying a lot of fuel – a costly choice for a satellite that could be the size of a mini-fridge. But propulsion tech that offers high ISP isn’t ideal either, especially if the satellite is heading to space in a rideshare mission and must reach its final orbit on its own. Often, traditional electric thrusters maximize specific impulse but at the expense of thrust – so while the thruster could be very efficient, maneuvers can take months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Phase Four’s Maxwell thrusters have gotten rid of this trade-off, allowing customers to operate at a relatively high thrust mode or at a high ISP, explained CTO Umair Siddiqui. That means being able to perform both fast maneuvers when required or to enter a high ISP mode to save propellant.</p>
<p>The company introduced these innovations in its first product, the Maxwell Block 1 thruster. The new iteration of the Maxwell thruster, Maxwell Block 2, offers a performance improvement in these metrics of around 85%. “This is significant,” he said. “[An] 85% improvement in ISP or thrust means that much less propellant usage or that much less time you’re maneuvering in orbit.”</p>
<p>Phase Four’s Maxwell thrusters have a few other innovations as well. The traditional plasma thruster, called the Hall-effect thruster, generates thrust using cathode materials that are difficult to manufacture. The systems are also bulky, which isn’t ideal for many customers. To solve these problems, Phase Four’s thrusters use radio-frequency plasma sources, rather than a cathode and anode, to generate thrust. That means a smaller thruster that’s easier to manufacture and that can accept any gaseous propellant – not just expensive Hall-effect thruster propellants like xenon or krypton.</p>
<p>The aim is to maintain production runs of under four months for the Block 2, an approximate timeline that the company first hit with the Block 1 thruster. The ability to keep such a quick turnaround is due, in part, to the modular design of the products. The Maxwell engines use a “chassis” style that borrows, at least in philosophy, from the auto industry. “We can still use the same production line to fold in next generation developments, and that&#8217;s the requirement for the product,” Siddiqui said. “It’s a plasma thruster with manufacturability thought at the outset.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2015, has delivered ten Maxwell Block 1 systems to customers so far. This summer, Phase Four raised a $26 million Series B led by New Science Ventures LLC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its re:Invent conference, AWS today announced <a href="https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/">SageMaker Studio Lab</a>, a free service to help developers learn machine learning techniques and experiment with the technology. Studio Lab provides users with all of the basics to get started, including a JupyterLab IDE, model training on CPUs and GPUs and 15 GB of persistent storage.</p>
<p>In addition, Amazon also today launched the AWS AI &amp; ML Scholarship Program. The company is committing $10 million oer year to this program, which it runs in collaboration with Intel and Udacity. 2,000 students will receive Udacity Nanodegree scholarships through this program every year, in addition to mentorship from Amazon and Intel employees.</p>
<p>“The two initiatives we are announcing today are designed to open up educational opportunities in machine learning to make it more widely accessible to anyone who is interested in the technology,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Amazon Machine Learning at AWS. “Machine learning will be one of the most transformational technologies of this generation. If we are going to unlock the full potential of this technology to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems, we need the best minds entering the field from all backgrounds and walks of life. We want to inspire and excite a diverse future workforce through this new scholarship program and break down the cost barriers that prevent many from getting started with machine learning.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>To get started with Studio Lab, developer can sign up for a free account, which needs to get approved before you can use the service. It&#8217;s unclear what the requirements for getting access are, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission at AWS is to make machine learning (ML) more accessible. Through many conversations over the past years, I learned about barriers that many ML beginners face,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Antje Barth writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;Existing ML environments are often too complex for beginners, or too limited to support modern ML experimentation. Beginners want to quickly start learning and not worry about spinning up infrastructure, configuring services, or implementing billing alarms to avoid going over budget. This emphasizes another barrier for many people: the need to provide billing and credit card information at sign-up.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the reasons artificial intelligence is such an interesting field is that pretty much no one knows what it might turn out to be good at. Two papers by leading labs published in the journal Nature today show that machine learning can be applied to tasks as technically demanding as protein generation and as abstract as pure mathematics.</p>
<p>The protein thing may not sound like much of a surprise given the recent commotion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">around AI&#8217;s facility</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/researchers-match-deepminds-alphafold2-protein-folding-power-with-faster-freely-available-model/">in protein folding</a>, as demonstrated by Google&#8217;s DeepMind and the University of Washington&#8217;s Baker Lab, not coincidentally also the ones who put out the papers we&#8217;re noting today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04184-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The study from the Baker Lab</a> shows that the model they created to understand how protein sequences are folded can be repurposed to essentially do the opposite: create a new sequence meeting certain parameters and which acts as expected when tested in vitro.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241241" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t necessarily obvious — you might have an AI that&#8217;s great at detecting boats in pictures but can&#8217;t draw one, for instance, or an AI that translates Polish to English but not vice versa. So the discovery that an AI built to interpret the structure of proteins can also make new ones is an important one.</p>
<p>There has already been some work done in this direction by various labs, such as <a href="https://blog.einstein.ai/progen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ProGen</a> over at SalesForce Research. But Baker Lab&#8217;s RoseTTAFold and DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold are way out in front when it comes to accuracy in proteomic predictions, so it&#8217;s good to know the systems can turn their expertise to creative endeavors.</p>

<h2>AI abstractions</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepMind captured the cover of Nature</a> with a paper showing that AI can aid mathematicians in complex and abstract tasks. The results won&#8217;t turn the math world on its head, but they are truly novel and truly due to the help of a machine learning model, something that has never happened before.</p>
<p>The idea here relies on the fact that mathematics is largely the study of relationships and patterns — as one thing increases, another decreases, say, or as the faces of a polyhedron increase, so too does the number of its vertices. Because these things happen according to systems, mathematicians can arrive at conjectures about the exact relationship between those things.</p>
<p>Some of these ideas are simple, like the trigonometry expressions we learned in grade school: It&#8217;s a fundamental quality of triangles that the sum of their internal angles adds up to 180 degrees, or that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. But what about for a 900-sided polyhedron in 8-dimensional space? Could you find the equivalent of a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup> for that?</p>

<p>Mathematicians do, but there are limits to the amount of such work they can do, simply because one must evaluate many examples before one can be sure that a quality observed is universal and not coincidental. It is here, as a labor-saving method, that DeepMind deployed its AI model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Computers have always been good at spewing out data at a scale that humans can’t match but what is different [here] is the ability of AI to pick out patterns in the data that would have been impossible to detect on a human scale,&#8221; explained Oxford professor of mathematics Marcus du Sautoy in the DeepMind news release.</p>
<p>Now, the actual accomplishments made with the help of this AI system are miles above my head, but the mathematicians among our readers will surely understand the following, quoted from DeepMind:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defying progress for nearly 40 years, the combinatorial invariance conjecture states that a relationship should exist between certain directed graphs and polynomials. Using ML techniques, we were able to gain confidence that such a relationship does indeed exist and to hypothesize that it might be related to structures known as broken dihedral intervals and extremal reflections. With this knowledge, Professor Williamson was able to conjecture a surprising and beautiful algorithm that would solve the combinatorial invariance conjecture.</p>
<p>Algebra, geometry, and quantum theory all share unique perspectives on [knots] and a long standing mystery is how these different branches relate: for example, what does the geometry of the knot tell us about the algebra? We trained an ML model to discover such a pattern and surprisingly, this revealed that a particular algebraic quantity — the signature — was directly related to the geometry of the knot, which was not previously known or suggested by existing theory. By using attribution techniques from machine learning, we guided Professor Lackenby to discover a new quantity, which we call the natural slope, that hints at an important aspect of structure overlooked until now.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conjectures were borne out with millions of examples — another advantage of computation, that you can tell it to rigorously test your hypothesis without buying it pizza and coffee.</p>
<p>The DeepMind researchers and the professors mentioned above worked closely together to come up with these specific applications, so we&#8217;re not looking at a &#8220;universal pure math helper&#8221; or anything like that. But as Ruhr University Bochum&#8217;s Christian Stump notes in the Nature summary of the article, that it works at all is an important step toward such an idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither result is necessarily out of reach for researchers in these areas, but both provide genuine insights that had not previously been found by specialists. The advance is therefore more than the outline of an abstract framework,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Whether or not such an approach is widely applicable is yet to be determined, but Davies et al. provide a promising demonstration of how machine-learning tools can be used to support the creative process of mathematical research.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years ago at AWS re:Invent, then AWS CEO Andy Jassy made it clear that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/aws-is-sick-of-waiting-for-your-company-to-move-to-the-cloud/">he was tired of the slow pace of change</a> and he wanted to find ways to get companies to move to the cloud faster. At yesterday&#8217;s opening keynote, in fact, new AWS CEO Adam Selipsky stated that the pace is still pretty pokey with only between 5 and 15 percent of workloads having moved to the cloud thus far.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for the slow pace of change is that in spite of the recognized advantages of moving to the cloud, migrating data from on-premises to the cloud is a labor-intensive task, and it&#8217;s not easy to get your data from your on-prem legacy database to a shiny new cloud database.</p>
<p>Companies with multiple types of databases face an even bigger challenges when it comes to moving that data to the cloud and finding the right database service to match up with whatever you have been using on prem. Amazon recognized all of this and wanted to make it easier for customers to move to the cloud.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, the company introduced AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) Fleet Advisor, a tool specifically designed to help make it easier and faster to get your data to the cloud and match it with the correct database service.</p>
<p>&#8220;DMS Fleet Advisor automatically builds an inventory of your on-prem database and analytics service by streaming data from on prem to Amazon S3. From there, we take it over. We analyze [the data] to match it with the appropriate amount of AWS Datastore and then provide customized migration plans. All of this now just takes hours instead of what used to be weeks or months,&#8221; Swami Sivasubramanian, VP for Amazon AI told the AWS re:Invent audience at the AI and machine learning keynote today.</p>
<p>Sivasubramanian pointed out that this approach is not only faster, it&#8217;s also cheaper because you no longer have to rely on a third-party consultant to move the data for you. &#8220;This is going to make it a lot easier for you to modernize your data infrastructure with powerful relational and purposeful databases,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-menon-0b87b141/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vijay Menon</a>, a statistician by trade, began his career at Microsoft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was there that he realized there was an astounding number of subscriptions that failed to renew or even go through to begin with due to payment-related issues. He became intrigued by the problem, and solving it. Ultimately in 2016 alone, he helped the company recover over 10 million Xbox Live subscriptions, which resulted in over $100 million in recovered revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his subsequent roles at Dropbox and Scribd, Menon realized the problem of accidental payment churn was not exclusive to Microsoft. It was a challenge that plagued all B2B subscription and SaaS businesses.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241578" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every subscription company deals with this black hole,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment failure, in fact, is the among the biggest causes of customer churn and represents nearly half of all subscription churn. Even more alarming, Menon came to understand, the companies weren’t even aware of what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">False declines are estimated to be a $443 billion problem by the end of this year, according to </span><a href="https://www.cardinalcommerce.com/content-hub/industry-news/false-declines-heres-the-true-story" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), resulting in millions of lost subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accidental churn is often not just due to problems with renewals, where people get frustrated by failed attempts to charge their credit card, for example. It is also largely a problem at the sign-up process, especially in countries outside the U.S., where charges are often falsely declined due to being attempted in another country. To Menon, it was a massive market severely underserved by traditional payment service providers such as Stripe who are strong domestically, but in his view, were poor at clearing international payments in growing markets like Brazil, India and Mexico. Menon estimates that on average, 4% of subscription customers are lost monthly to legitimate payments failing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers outside the U.S. might be clicking submit on a given transaction, but if they&#8217;re using a card form that&#8217;s configured for the U.S., they could be getting rejected, and “no one&#8217;s really checking on what happens after the user drops off,” Menon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2020, he teamed up with venture studio Atomic to found </span><a href="https://www.butterpayments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup aimed at helping companies retain existing customers and sign on new ones by preventing this accidental payment churn. Using machine learning, Butter aims to end the churn by preventing drop-off from legitimate payments.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9XzM6KQFdt"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/talking-atomic/">Atomic has launched 14 startups in the last 12 months (and they&#8217;re getting funded); here&#8217;s how it works</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Atomic has launched 14 startups in the last 12 months (and they&#8217;re getting funded); here&#8217;s how it works&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/talking-atomic/embed/#?secret=9XzM6KQFdt" data-secret="9XzM6KQFdt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus on two problems that can affect any subscription business, which is basically ‘how do I check out a payment upfront and make sure that payment actually goes through?,’ ” Menon told TechCrunch. “The other part is, what do we do when a payment fails?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based startup has raised $7 million, largely from Atomic, to tackle the problem. In a year’s time, it has also signed on about a dozen consumer subscription companies, including some large names (which he declined to reveal publicly), doing $10 million to $500 million in revenue &#8212; many of which have an international user base. It claims that it helps these companies find, on average, $1 million of revenue per year.</span></p>
<p>Its revenue-sharing model is designed to align incentives with those of its customers. It charges a percentage of what it saves for its customers. For example, Menon estimates that a $100 million ARR company would be able to see $1 to $4 million in ARR lift which is a lot, and a $500 million ARR company, around $2.5 to $5 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economy increasingly reliant on subscription models places new challenges on existing payment systems that are typically out of date, complicated, vary by country and constantly changing based on new fraud rules, according to Menon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even massive companies like Netflix and Spotify who have invested significant internal resources &#8211; payments engineering teams &#8211; in this problem, struggle because the payment landscape changes so frequently,” Menon told TechCrunch. “The Butter payments intelligence platform was built to scout through obscure payments networks to find what is broken.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Butter plans to use its new capital to do “top of the funnel optimization,” according to Menon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a consumer checks out, there are about 128 different data elements that can be presented with every payload, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re investing into the capabilities that will be able to make decisions [around those elements] in real time so that these folks coming in through the funnel will have a much higher likelihood of that payment going through,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long term, he said, the company aims to build an AWS, or operating system, for payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">trying to build a connective tissue for the entire payments ecosystem. We sit above what we call the payment service providers so we’re not Stripe, we’re not Braintree, we’re sitting above them,” Menon explained. “We want to work with any company, regardless of what your payments stack is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also, naturally, plans to do more hiring. Recently, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billhoppin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Hoppin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined the company as a co-founder and COO. Butter expects to have about 50 employees by the end of Q1 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Abraham, CEO and managing partner of Atomic, described Menon as an “exceptional” founder with unique firsthand experience inside the payments systems of some of the largest global consumer subscription businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We co-founded Butter with Vijay and the team to solve some of the most critical conversion and churn issues that all businesses face, large or small, and a short time in the company is off to an incredible start,” he wrote via-email.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-devops-guru-for-rds-to-detect-diagnose-and-resolve-amazon-aurora-related-issues-using-ml/">announced</a> a new service that makes it easier for its users to detect, diagnose and resolve issues in their relational databases. DevOps Guru for RDS, AWS&#8217;s fully managed relational database platform, is part of AWS&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/">DevOps Guru</a> family, which launched last year with a service for detecting issues with machine learning services.</p>
<p>As Swami Sivasubramanian, VP, Amazon AI, argued in his keynote today, being good at managing databases is not a differentiating factor for most businesses, so a lot of them naturally gravitate toward managed services in the cloud. But even so, these customers would still like to see more automation tools for managing these services, especially around diagnosing performance issues, Sivasubramanian noted.</p>

<p>DevOps Guru for RDS helps these users detect issues when performance metrics spike for some reason. The service looks at the activity in the database and flags anything unusual. But what&#8217;s probably most important is that the service then also performs a root cause analysis to recommend changes and &#8212; whenever possible &#8212; it will even automatically remediate issues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dating app giant Match has settled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/14/tinder-match-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> with a group of Tinder founders and executives for $441 million. The suit, filed in 2018, <a href="https://www.tindercase.com/">had alleged</a> that IAC and its then-subsidiary Match Group had manipulated financial data in order to create a false, &#8220;lowball valuation&#8221; of the dating app when Tinder was merged into IAC in 2017. The employees also said they had been unlawfully stripped of their Tinder stock options. The suit had sought &#8220;billions of dollars&#8221; in damages at the time of its filing.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case included Tinder&#8217;s co-founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen, as well as  James Kim, the vice president of finance, and Rosette Pambakian, the vice president of marketing and communications.</p>
<p>Match, naturally, had dismissed the allegations as &#8220;meritless,&#8221; noting that Tinder&#8217;s valuation had been determined in a contractually-defined valuation process that involved two independent global banks. It had vowed to vigorously defend itself against the allegations in court.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the case proceeded, the court dismissed some of the plaintiffs&#8217; claims, like those that alleged the merger was not lawful, that product releases were wrongfully delayed, and those requesting damages for wrongful contract beyond breach of contract.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000891103/000089110321000093/mtch-20211201.htm">an SEC filing</a> published today, Match Group announced its settlement agreement. The company has agreed to pay the plaintiffs $441 million and in return, the plaintiffs will dismiss all claims on trial and in arbitration related to the 2017 Tinder valuation. Match Group said it will pay the settlement from cash on hand. The company had about $510 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the third quarter, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Match+Group+%28MTCH%29+Tinder+Settlement+Removes+Major+Overhang+-+Truist/19294670.html">per</a> Truist analyst Youssef Squali. (The quarterly <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/ef9ecaab-bd08-4a79-b068-a216debc0c02.pdf">filing</a> shows $511.3 million as of Sept. 30).</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement also offered a media statement from the parties, which read: &#8220;The parties are pleased to announce that they have settled the valuation lawsuit presently on trial in New York Supreme Court and the related valuation arbitration.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the settlement didn&#8217;t result in the billions in damages that the plaintiffs had originally wanted, $441 million is not exactly a small number &#8212; especially for a case that Match had repeatedly dismissed as &#8220;meritless.&#8221; However, going to trial can also be expensive for a company and this suit has been hanging over Match&#8217;s head for years, costing tens of millions of dollars, Squali noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is deepening its commitment to operate a vertically integrated battery supply chain with the announcement that it would form a joint venture with South Korea-based POSCO Chemical to build a new cathode active material facility in North America by 2024.</p>
<p>Cathode active materials comprise around 40% of the cost of electric vehicle batteries, and the majority of both cathodes and anodes (the other building block of lithium-ion batteries) are produced in China, according to <a href="https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/china-controls-sway-of-electric-vehicle-power-through-battery-chemicals-cathode-and-anode-production/">Benchmark Mineral Intelligence</a>. This latest announcement brings the automaker one step closer to its goal of moving the majority of its battery production footprint to North America by 2025 &#8212; a huge geographical shakeup compared to where the battery supply chain exists today.</p>
<p>“We need to control our own destiny, especially when it comes to battery production,” GM executive Doug Parks said in a call with reporters Wednesday. “That’s why we’re pursuing a North America-focused vertical integration strategy for our proprietary platform.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241556" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GM has already aggressively pursued control of the remainder of the battery supply chain, including battery cell production with Ultium, its JV with LG Energy Solution, and its battery recycling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/">agreement with Li-Cycle</a>. The materials from this facility will go straight into the production of new Ultium battery cells &#8212; a nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum (NCMA) battery that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">forms the bedrock</a> of the automaker’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion electrification strategy</a>.</p>
<p>While company executives declined to specify where the plant will be located or the size of the investment, it’s almost certain to be significant. That’s because the materials produced by the new facility will supply “most” of the cathode active material needed for all four of the battery manufacturing facilities GM has planned under its Ultium JV. That will eventually bring the automaker to a total of 140 gigawatt-hours of cell manufacturing capacity in the United States.</p>
<p>The joint venture will have to move quickly if it wants the new facility to be up and running by 2024. The two companies said a site location could be announced as early as the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>GM’s vertical integration strategy comes amid the ongoing chip shortage, which continues to affect industries from auto to consumer electronics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If anything, the semiconductor crisis has taught us that we need to have agility,” Parks said.</p>
<p>He added that moving more of the supply chain &#8212; including raw materials sourcing &#8212; to North America could help address some of the more painful realities of battery production, like human rights abuses in cobalt sourcing or environmental impacts.</p>
<p>“We think that the supply chain can be improved from what it is today, both from a security standpoint &#8212; a locational security, I&#8217;ll call that the North American approach &#8212; as well as environmental,” Parks said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’d be forgiven if the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1">AirPeak S1</a> slipped your mind. It’s been a long, weird 13 or so months since Sony first teased the pro-level drone. After a November 2020 reveal, the company offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-unveils-airpeak-its-camera-carrying-video-drone/">some more information on its first profession UAV</a> way back this year’s all-virtual CES in January and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8KA55Vu07c">an official &#8220;launch&#8221; in June</a>. Since then, it’s been mostly radio silence.</p>
<p>That is, until this morning, when Sony announced the AirPeak will be hitting a 2021 launch – just under the wire. Pre-orders on the product open today, with an estimated ship date of December 24 – so a slightly belated Christmas arrival for the cinematographer in your life who has everything (we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">somehow missed that gift guide this year</a>).</p>
<p>As anticipated, Sony’s enter won’t come cheap, with a suggested retail price of $9,000. Along with a quadcopter designed to fly around Sony’s extremely good mirrorless cameras, that price gets you two pairs of propellers, two batteries, a charger and a remote.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241552" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8KA55Vu07c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The aforementioned cameras, lenses – and the gimbal for said cameras – are both sold separately. The gimbal runs another $2,200. While you’re at it, might as well toss in another $300 for a year of “Airpeak Plus,” for cloud storage of projects, geofencing and the like.</p>
<p>Sony’s not quite ready to go head to head with DJI, which currently controls an estimated 70% of the global drone market. But the play here is clear, as it looks like to capitalize on the success of its imaging line by designing a custom rig specifically for its cameras.</p>
<p>The Airpeak S1 is compatible with the Alpha 1, Alpha 7S, Alpha 7R s, Alpha 9 and FX3 cameras, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Missouri resident Garrett Endicott, 22, became the sixth member of the hacking group to be sentenced. He was given 10 months in prison for his part in the campaign — which saw millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims — and was ordered to pay $121,549 in restitution.</p>
<p>SIM hijacking, also known as SIM swapping, is a technique whereby an attacker takes control of a target’s phone number, allowing them to receive text messages and other forms of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) codes that can then be used to log into the victims&#8217; email, cloud storage, and ultimately their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange accounts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241518" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the case of The Community, the SIM hijacking campaign “was often facilitated by bribing an employee of a mobile phone provider”, according to prosecutors. “Other times, SIM hijacking was accomplished by a member of The Community contacting a mobile phone provider’s customer service — posing as the victim — and requesting that the victim’s phone number be swapped to a SIM card (and thus a mobile device) controlled by The Community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scheme resulted in the theft of tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. Individuals from across the U.S, including California, Missouri, Michigan, Utah, Texas, New York and Illinois, lost cryptocurrency valued (at the time of the theft) from under $2,000 to over $5 million.</p>
<p>The DOJ said the sentenced defendants were involved in total thefts ranging from approximately $50,000 to over $9 million.</p>
<p>Endicott was given a lighter sentence than other members of The Community. Florida resident Ricky Handschumacher was handed four years in prison and fined more than $7.6 million; Iowa resident Colton Jurisic is serving 42 months in prison and was ordered to pay more than $9.5 million; and South Carolina resident Reyad Gafar Abbas was sentenced to two years in prison and fined more than $310,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Irish citizen Conor Freedman was previously sentenced to three years in prison by an Irish court, while Connecticut resident Ryan Stevenson was sentenced to probation. Both were ordered to pay some form of restitution.</p>
<p>Endicott’s sentencing comes just weeks after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/fcc-proposes-new-rules-to-combat-sim-swapping-scams/">FCC proposed new rules to help combat SIM hijacking scams</a>. The federal regulator wants providers to adopt more secure methods in authenticating a person’s identity before agreeing to transfer their service to a new phone or to another carrier. It has also proposed a rule that would require providers to notify customers whenever a SIM switch or a port-out request is made on their accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/static/media/press/AWS%20Announces%20Four%20New%20Storage%20Services%20and%20Capabilities.pdf">announced four new storage services</a> and capabilities aimed at delivering more choice, reducing costs and helping customers better protect their data.</p>
<p>The first option is a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-s3-glacier-instant-retrieval-storage-class/">Amazon S3 Glacier storage</a> class that is designed to offer milliseconds access for archived data. AWS says that with this storage class, customers can achieve the lowest-cost storage in the cloud for data that is stored long-term and rarely accessed, but requires immediate retrieval when requested.</p>
<p>AWS has also launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-fsx-openzfs/">Amazon FSx for OpenZFS</a> service to make it easy to move data residing in on-premises commodity file servicers to AWS without changing application code. AWS says the new service eliminates the need to perform lengthy qualifications and change existing tools. Amazon FSx for OpenZFS is said to deliver up to 1 million IOPS with latencies of hundreds of microseconds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241527" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In order to address the cost of archiving snapshots, AWS has launched a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ebs-snapshots-archive/">Amazon EBS Snapshots Archive</a> to deliver a new storage tier that saves customers up to 75% of the cost for Amazon EBS Snapshots that need to be retained for a month or years. AWS notes that customers can now move their snapshots to EBS Snapshots Archive with a<br />
single application programming interface.</p>
<p>Lastly, the company is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-backup-vmware-workloads/">extending AWS Backup’s capabilities</a> to more cloud and on-premises workloads with support for Amazon S3 and VMware workloads. Now, with AWS Backup support for S3, users are able to replace the custom scripts they used to centrally manage backups of their entire applications. With AWS Backup support for VMware workloads, customers can now protect their VMware workloads whether they run on-premises or in the VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>
<p>“Every business today is a data business. One of the most important decisions that a business will make is where to store their data,” said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, vice president of block and object storage at AWS, in a statement.</p>
<p>AWS says that the new storage services will provide customers with greater flexibility in how they manage storage. The new options also aim to improve data management and protection capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s hardly an exaggeration to say that Blue Origin had a banner year in 2021 — the company flew people to space for the first time using its reusable New Shepard launch vehicle. The company has now sent up passengers (including Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, and Captain James T. Kirk) on two separate launches, and it has another planned for next week.</p>
<p>A lot of hard work and preparation has gone into making Blue Origin effectively the first private spaceflight company offering regular service to paying customers. But one of the more interesting and novel aspects of the business has to be actually selling the expensive tickets for the spectacular suborbital views that a ride on New Shepard provides. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to be hosting Blue Origin&#8217;s Senior Director of Astronaut &amp; Orbital Sales Ariane Cornell at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space this December 14-15</a>.</p>
<p>Cornell came to Blue Origin from the Space Generation Advisory Council in Support of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications, where she focused on representing the organization at the UN and industry conferences all over the world, as well as handling its operations, policy and strategy activities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240979" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At Blue Origin, she&#8217;s spent the past seven years building the company&#8217;s approach to developing and selling products across its government, enterprise and private individual spaceflight customers. We&#8217;ll hear from her what the company&#8217;s success this past year has meant for the business, and how it envisions its product offerings evolving and growing in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. The countdown is on, and your time is running out. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>before December 3</strong>, and you’ll save $100.</p>

<p>Purchasing records seen by TechCrunch and <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/military-buys-lorex">video surveillance news site IPVM</a> show the agencies collectively spent thousands of dollars on purchasing video surveillance equipment manufactured by Lorex, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dahua Technology. Dahua is one of several China-based companies banned from selling to the federal government under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/new-defense-bill-bans-the-u-s-government-from-using-huawei-and-zte-tech/">a 2019 defense spending law</a> over fears that the technology could help the Chinese government conduct espionage.</p>
<p>Dahua was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/">added</a> to the U.S. government’s economic trade restriction list in 2019 after the company was linked to China’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/">ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities</a> in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live. The U.S. says Beijing relies on technology manufactured in part by Dahua to supply the surveillance equipment to surveil the Uighur population. The Biden administration called the human rights abuses in Xinjiang a “genocide,” and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list">blamed the technology makers</a> of being &#8220;implicated in human rights violations and abuses&#8221; in China’s surveillance, repression and mass detention of more than Uighurs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2241348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After the ban came into effect, purchasing records show the agencies bought Lorex equipment from federal contractors.</p>
<p>According to the records, the Drug Enforcement Agency bought nine Lorex hard drives for surveillance systems in May 2021 through a Washington DC-based tech supplier called I. S. Enterprises. DEA spokesperson Katherine Pfaff said the purchases were made through the government&#8217;s shopping portal run by the General Services Administration — known as GSA Advantage — and deferred comment to the GSA, but declined to say if the Lorex equipment had been pulled from service.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes in an emailed statement: &#8220;GSA has multiple means to vet vendors and products sold on GSA Advantage in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) &#8220;Moreover, contractors must comply with the clauses and provisions found in the FAR requiring them to state whether they sell covered technology. Products confirmed to be non-compliant are removed from GSA Advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>GSA would not say why the banned products were available for purchase after the ban came into effect, but said that it&#8217;s in the process of making improvements, including launching a new verified products portal aimed at ensuring commercial off-the-shelf products are compliant with the 2019 ban.</p>
<p>The 2019 ban was signed into law as a specific provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) called Section 889, which made it illegal for federal agencies to procure or buy electronics manufactured by certain China-based companies including Huawei, Hikvision, and Dahua, as well as their subsidiaries, like Lorex. Section 889 also prohibits federal contractors from selling banned electronics to federal agencies. The Department of Defense was granted a waiver allowing for some exceptions under Section 889 to purchase low-risk items like food and clothing, but <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/2319990/ellen-m-lord-undersecretary-of-defense-for-acquisition-and-sustainment-briefs-m/">not electronics</a> or surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>Purchasing records also show that the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, a DOD agency tasked with the department&#8217;s financial management and paying servicemembers, bought Lorex video surveillance cameras through a New York-based store called Focus Camera in July 2021.</p>
<p>“In July 2021, one of our DFAS sites identified a need for a security camera to monitor an isolated area in a building. Being aware of Section 889(a)(1)(A) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and the restrictions associated with certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment, we performed due diligence by utilizing a GSA contract. In addition, we requested the supplier provide information certifying that the product and/or components purchased was not restricted by the FY19 NDAA. Based on your communication, out of an abundance of caution, we have removed the camera and controller from service until further analysis can be performed. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention,&#8221; said DFAS spokesperson Steve Lawson in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>The records also show that the Department of the Army bought Lorex video surveillance cameras and recording equipment between 2019 and 2021 from three vendors, I. S. Enterprises, Focus Camera, and a Glendale, Calif.-based company called JLogistics.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, the Army implied that the responsibility is with the contractors that supplied the equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Aug. 13, 2020, the Department of Defense implemented the prohibitions for Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and Public Law 115-232. Companies that propose on federal contracts are required to assert their compliance with various Federal Acquisition Regulation and Defense supplement provisions and clauses, including those required by P.L. 115-232 in the System for Award Management website. Title 18 of the United States Code, or civil liability under the False Claims Act, is applicable if a company misrepresents itself,&#8221; said Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Brandon Kelley.</p>
<p>In a statement, Monica Matoush, Democratic spokesperson for the House Armed Services Committee, said that the committee &#8220;expects the Department of Defense to take appropriate action to investigate these reports and, if substantiated, to take action to mitigate harm and prevent future problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The purchasing records also showed that several other federal and military agencies purportedly bought Lorex equipment after the ban came into effect. TechCrunch contacted those agencies prior to publication. Of the agencies that responded, their spokespeople were unable to immediately confirm or provide comment when they were provided purchasing records. One military agency said a response would take &#8220;weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told TechCrunch: “While I haven’t heard the specifics of this case, I believe that we need to get better at understanding the origin of commercial equipment purchased by government departments and agencies, and we need to ensure that those making these purchasing decisions are aware of the risks involved. This is the very reason Congress included these provisions in the 2019 legislation. Simply put, we should never use our federal purchasing power to support companies that may pose security risks, or that have been deemed to be actively engaging in human rights abuses, including facilitating the PRC’s campaign of repression against Uighurs and other minorities. If this allegation is true, we need to make sure it never happens again.”</p>
<p>When asked about the purchases, I. S. Enterprises co-founder Eddie Migues said the company was looking into the matter. Focus Camera and JLogistics did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Contractors that supply banned equipment to the government can lose their contracts. But industry groups have argued that federal contractors were given little time to comply with the ban before it took effect. &#8220;Because of the extended time it took to roll out rules for these far-reaching requirements, contractors may not be able to consistently meet the law’s objectives,&#8221; the Information Technology Industry Council <a href="https://www.itic.org/news-events/news-releases/iti-responds-to-enactment-of-major-government-acquisition-supply-chain-law">said</a> last year.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, an unnamed Lorex spokesperson told TechCrunch: &#8220;Lorex products are designed for consumer and business use only and not for U.S. federal government agencies, federally-funded projects or contractors subject to NDAA. Lorex does not market directly to any person or organization subject to the NDAA and we encourage purchasers to familiarize themselves with and adhere to those regulations.&#8221;</p>
