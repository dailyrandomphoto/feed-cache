<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I want to point to two Extra Crunch articles before jumping into the rest of the news and analysis. Yes, Extra Crunch requires a subscription. We&#8217;re ramping up the transportation analysis and features in EC and I hope you find it worthwhile.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re ramping up our founder Q&amp;A series. The first one was an interview with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/revels-frank-reig-shares-how-he-built-his-business-and-what-hes-planning/"><strong>Revel</strong> founder and CEO Frank Reig</a>. This time, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/arrivals-denis-sverdlov-on-the-new-era-of-car-manufacturing/"><strong>Arrival</strong> founder Denis Sverdlov</a>, who founded his first company at 22 selling IT consulting software to enterprise customers. Since then, he has built and exited multiple companies, most notably telecommunications operator Yota Group. He also founded Roborace.</p>
<p>We have two more interviews coming up with <strong>Veo</strong> co-founder and CEO Candice Xie and <strong>Refraction AI</strong> co-founder Matthew Johnson-Roberson.</p>
<p>Finally, we published a piece that examines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/the-battle-for-voice-recognition-inside-vehicles-is-heating-up/">voice recognition in vehicles</a>, a marketplace that has tech giants like Google and Amazon competing for space with a few up and comers and established suppliers like Cerence.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Dott</strong>, <strong>Lime</strong> and <strong>TIER</strong> have won the long-awaited, much-coveted bid to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/">operate e-scooter shares in London</a>. The pilot, which will run for up to 12 months, will begin June 7 in some of London&#8217;s boroughs, including Canary Wharf and the City of London. More neighborhoods are expected to join as the year progresses, according to TfL. Lambeth and Southwark are also seeking participation. Between 60 to 150 scooters will be available initially in each borough.</p>
<p>This announcement is significant not only because London is one of the biggest targets for micromobility shares, but also because Transport for London is very keen on collecting data from the scooter companies that will help determine how e-scooters could be integrated into a sustainable transport pandemic recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Can micromobility address the racial wealth gap?</h3>
<p>The Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation released a report entitled <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:cdef00e5-a376-4223-ad27-4d242abcbee8#pageNum=1">Cementing an Equity Framework for Micro Mobility</a> that talks about next steps for its NYC Better Bike Share Partnership and outlines goals for fostering equity and opportunity for communities of color through public transportation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creating a truly equitable bikeshare system is about more than just placement of stations and the price of fares. It requires deep partnerships with the community and empowering the voices of those who have been traditionally underserved,&#8221; said Laura Fox, General Manager of Citi Bike. &#8220;We are grateful to the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation for their leadership and ongoing efforts to create a culture of cycling, particularly by addressing street safety. As this progress report highlights, we have many accomplishments to be proud of and we look forward to continued partnership to build on these successes.&#8221;<br />
Accessible mobility is one of the major drivers of wealth, and I&#8217;m a big proponent of the potential for active forms of mobility, from e-scooters to push bikes and everything in between, to both help cities cut emissions and help residents stay healthy.</p>
<p>From a startup&#8217;s perspective, can you even contribute to this equitable goal and also make money? I&#8217;ll be discussing this in a few weeks at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/announcing-the-agenda-for-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Mobility Event on June 9</a> with advocate and consultant Tamika Butler, CEO and co-founder at Remix, Tiffany Chu, and CEO and co-founder of Revel, Frank Reig.</p>
<h3>Spinning tales of SPACs&#8230;</h3>
<p>The aftereffects of Bird going SPAC last week is that now we&#8217;re all wondering which micromobility company is going to go SPAC next. Will it be Lime? TIER? Or maybe Spin? Bloomberg reported<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin"> Ford is considering divesting Spin</a>, according to &#8220;people familiar with the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, we have a lot of whisperings and speculation and not a lot of facts. Rumors circulating involve Spin spinning off from Ford or merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Spin did not want to comment, and I think that&#8217;s fair given the nebulous shape of this &#8220;news.&#8221;</p>
<h3>While we&#8217;re on the subject of Bird&#8230;</h3>
<p>Bird is working with IT Asset Partners (ITAP) to give its batteries a second life. So, when a scooter reaches the end of its life, it&#8217;s broken down for parts, with batteries shipped over to ITAP. Then ITAP breaks down each battery module to the cellular level to get as many reusable battery bits as possible.</p>
<p>This is not only an eco-friendly way to do business, but it&#8217;s also increasingly necessary in a world that&#8217;s going electric faster than supply can keep up with.</p>
<p>&#8220;The circular economy is where the world is going, and it will help determine how global businesses function over the next 10 years,&#8221; said Robert Mullaney, Director of Business Development at ITAP, in a <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/how-bird-itap-reducing-battery-waste-through-advanced-recycling/">Bird blog post announcing the partnership</a>. &#8220;As battery technology has improved year over year, their second life potential has increased as well, allowing them to be used in broader and more advanced applications. This includes things like computers and computer chargers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Is it me or am I seeing more activity in the aviation/eVTOL sector these days? We&#8217;ve had three SPACs — Lillium, Archer and Joby — plus a smattering of other funding news in the past four months.</p>
<p>And now, there&#8217;s one more to add to the list. Electric aviation startup <strong>Beta Technologies</strong> closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/beta-technologies-adds-368-million-in-series-a-funding-for-its-electric-aviation-ecosystem/">$368 million Series A funding round</a> with investments from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund. The new capital is the second round of funding announced by the company this year, after the company raised $143 million in private capital in March. Beta&#8217;s valuation is now at $1.4 billion, putting it in a small circle of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) unicorns.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with undisclosed additions from Amazon&#8217;s Climate Pledge Fund, a $2 billion fund established in September 2019 to advance the development of sustainable technologies. The Climate Pledge fund has also made contributions toward electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian, battery recycler Redwood Materials and ZeroAvia, a hydrogen fuel cell aviation company.</p>
<p>Beta is a bit different from other high valuation eVTOL startups. The Vermont-based company isn&#8217;t primarily focused on air taxis. Instead, it&#8217;s been targeting defense applications, cargo delivery and medical logistics, as well as building out its network of rapid-charging systems in the northeast U.S. Its debut aircraft, the ALIA-250c, was built to serve these various solutions by being capable of carrying six people or a pilot and 1,500 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mile Auto</strong>, insurance tech startup, raised $10.3 million in a seed funding round that includes investment from Ulu Ventures, Emergent Ventures, Thornton Capital, and Sure Ventures. The company said it will use the funding to expand availability of its insurance offering to half of the U.S. auto insurance market by the end of 2021, as well as hiring, adding new distribution channels, onboarding of white-label partners and expanding its automaker network. Mile Auto has also partnered with Ford Motor to offer auto insurance to owners. Mile Auto launched a similar program with Porsche Financial Services in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Portside</strong>, an aviation startup that is building a platform for managing the backend of a corporate flight department, charter operation, government fleet and fractional ownership operation, today announced that it has raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/portside-raises-17m-for-its-business-aviation-management-platform/">$17 million funding round</a> led by Tiger Global Management, with participation from existing investors I2BF Global Ventures and SOMA Capital.</p>
<p><strong>Twaice</strong>, the German battery analytics software company, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/twaice-raised-26m-to-scale-its-battery-analytics-software/">$26 million in Series B funding</a> led by Chicago-based Energize Ventures. The company, which primarily works in the mobility and energy storage industries, now has a total financing of $45 million.</p>
<p><strong>Virtuo</strong>, a Paris-based startup that lets people rent a car for a few days, or up to a few months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/virtuo-raises-96m-for-its-streamlined-take-on-car-rentals/">has raised $96 million</a>. The funding money will be using to invest in its tech and to expand to more markets beyond France, U.K. and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Waybridge</strong>, a company that has created a supply chain platform for raw materials, raised $30 million in a Series B funding round co-led by Rucker Park Capital and Craft Ventures, with participation from Venrock. The company has developed a digital platform that lets customers track inventory and shipments. Waybridge&#8217;s pitch is that its product can help companies navigate disruptive events like the Suez Canal traffic jam and COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>WeaveGrid</strong> raises <a href="https://www.weavegrid.com/blog">$15 million Series A round</a> to enable widescale adoption of EVs on the electric grid. Coatue and Breakthrough Energy Ventures will join existing investors to drive software innovation at intersection of utility and automotive sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Wejo</strong>, the British automotive-data startup backed by General Motors, is in talks to go public through a merger with Virtuoso Acquisition Corp., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-21/gm-backed-wejo-said-to-be-in-spac-merger-talks-with-virtuoso?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>

<p>Welcome back to Policy Corner! A decision from a little-known but very powerful California regulator caught my eye this week. The <strong>California Air Resources Board</strong>, which regulates air quality in the state, adopted new rules on Thursday that will require 90% of ride-share trips to be completed by electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft have both vowed to go 100% electric fleets by that year, but this is the first time that a state has adopted EV requirements for ride-share companies. In written comments submitted ahead of the hearing, both Uber and Lyft urged the Board to create EV rebates that are specifically targeted at high-mileage drivers and fleets, and to install EV chargers in &#8220;urban and traditionally underserved areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;California&#8217;s EV incentive programs and EV infrastructure investments over the past decade have served an exclusive population―wealthy, white, homeowners―that does not reflect Lyft&#8217;s driver population,&#8221; Paul Augustine, Lyft&#8217;s senior manager of sustainability, <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/lists/com-attach/7-cleanmilesstandard-VzZTIFQyAiQGcwF1.pdf">said in submitted comments</a>.</p>
<p>Back over in Washington, there was a hearing at the <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-promises-and-perils-the-potential-of-automobile-technologies">House Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> about the ways in which new automotive technologies (like autonomous driving) might enhance vehicle safety and help cut down on the many thousands of automotive deaths that occur on U.S. roads each year.</p>
<p>AV proponents like the Self Driving Coalition point to the many possible safety benefits of AVs. Electrical engineer Ragunathan Rajkumar, who testified at the meeting, urged lawmakers to advance a policy framework to support innovation to ensure America stays competitive against foreign rivals in AV technology.</p>
<p>However, the committee also heard testimony from people who urged a careful and pragmatic approach to AVs. Greg Regan, in testimony representing the AFL-CIO, argued that transportation workers should have a place at the table in conversations about AV deployment. He also said that the government should enact policy to ensure that the AV manufacturing industry yields secure jobs for American workers. Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, argued that other safety and design upgrades, as well as improved vehicle performance standards, could do much to save lives in the near-term.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that tens of thousands of unproven and unregulated AVs deployed quickly and without oversight, or a significant upgrade in highway and road infrastructure, will automatically be safer than what we have now may make for a good talking point in a quarterly earnings report &#8212; but is not good transportation policy,&#8221; he said in his testimony.</p>
<p>The issue of forced arbitration also came up during the hearing. Below is an exchange between Congressman Rush and Jason Levine, who is the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety.</p>
<p><strong>RUSH</strong>: As you know, even pedestrians may lose their right to seek justice in the courts if there is a continued proliferation of forced arbitration clauses. These clauses are often buried in terms of service agreements that waive a consumer&#8217;s right to sue in court, participate in a class action, or appeal the arbitrator&#8217;s decision. Do forced arbitration clauses related to AVs pose a danger to pedestrians? If so, why?</p>
<p><strong>LEVINE</strong>: They pose a real threat. The threat is this, as we discussed earlier, the ability to make sure you&#8217;re holding any manufacturer, AV or otherwise, responsible for something defective, a defective vehicle, is critical to safety, it is a backstop to our entire system. And so, if you are a pedestrian who has entered into an agreement unknowingly, when you downloaded an app to order a pizza maybe, and you get hit by a pizza delivery vehicle, and you said, &#8220;well I&#8217;m going to do everything from a legal standpoint through binding arbitration,&#8221; you have now lost your ability to go to court. That sounds outlandish, but it&#8217;s not actually that far from where we are in terms of binding arbitration removing our ability to hold manufacturers accountable. So that&#8217;s something that we do not want to see in an AV context.</p>
<p>Station readers: what do you think?</p>

<p>Lots to get to this week.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>May Mobility</strong> announced it is launching a new autonomous shuttle service in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The free shuttle service called A2GO will be available to the public starting Oct. 11, 2021. May Mobility said it will operate a fleet of five autonomous, shared, on-demand vehicles as part of the A2GO deployment. Four hybrid-electric Lexus RX 450h vehicles, which can carry three passengers, and one Polaris GEM fully electric vehicle that has capacity for one wheelchair passenger will operate in a service area that connects Kerrytown, the University of Michigan campus and the State Street corridor.</p>
<p>Chinese robotaxi startup <strong>Pony.ai</strong> has been given permission by California regulators to pilot its autonomous vehicles <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/">without a human safety driver behind the wheel</a> in three cities. While dozens of companies &#8212; 55 in all &#8212; have active permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver, it&#8217;s far less common to receive permission for driverless vehicles. Pony is the eighth company to be issued a driverless testing permit in the state, a list that includes Chinese companies <strong>AutoX</strong>, <strong>Baidu</strong> and <strong>WeRide</strong> as well as U.S. businesses <strong>Cruise</strong>, <strong>Nuro</strong>, <strong>Waymo</strong> and <strong>Zoox</strong>. Only Nuro has been granted a so-called deployment permit, which allows it to operate commercially.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p>It was a big week for EVs, and not just because of the Ford F-150 Lightning reveal. Although that was certainly the biggest EV reveal.</p>
<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong> had a fun and brief look at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/a-brief-look-at-electric-vehicles-from-the-dawn-of-the-automobile-age/">electric vehicles in the beginning of the automotive age</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong> gave a few more details of its electric microbus-slash-van, which will be available to buy in 2022 at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/">base price of $34,750</a> before tax incentives or add-ons. The Los Angeles-based company, which debuted on the Nasdaq public exchange earlier this year, now taking preorders in the United States for the &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. While Canoo did not release pricing for the other two vehicles, it said that deliveries for the pickup and production for the delivery van are slated to start as early as 2023. Customers can reserve a model by placing a $100 deposit per vehicle with the company.</p>
<p>The company also disclosed in a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoo-is-being-investigated-by-the-sec/">it is being investigated</a> by the <strong>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, just months after its merger with special purpose acquisition company <strong>Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp</strong>. The investigation is broad, covering the Hennessy&#8217;s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company&#8217;s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company&#8217;s officers, according to its first quarter earnings report. Canoo learned of the investigation on April 29. Canoo noted in the regulatory filing. The company added that it does not consider the investigation or other lawsuits it is facing to be material to its business.</p>
<p><strong>ElectReon</strong>, an inductive in-road charging technology for commercial and passenger electric vehicles, is joining the &#8220;Arena of the Future&#8221; project in Brescia, Italy where it will integrate its wireless technology to charge two Stellantis vehicles, and an IVECO bus while driving. The project aims to demonstrate contactless charging for a range of EVs as they drive on highways and toll roads as a potential pathway to decarbonizing our transportation systems along motorway transport corridors.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> had a a few EV news items coinciding with the F-150 Lightning reveal. First, there was the truck&#8217;s debut, which is arguably its most important new product in years and a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $22 billion investment into electrification. This is a challenging vehicle for Ford. As I noted in my coverage, the truck will need everything that has made its gas-powered counterpart the best-selling vehicle in North America as well as new benefits that come from going electric. That means torque, performance, towing capability and the general layout has to meet the needs of its customers, many of whom use it for commercial purposes. The vehicle specs suggest that Ford has delivered on the torque and power, while keeping the same cab and bed dimensions as its gas counterpart.</p>
<p>We ran a poll the night of the reveal asking folks &#8220;which electric truck is for you?&#8221; The choices and results were 37% picked the Ford F-150 Lightning, 19.6% choose <strong>Rivian</strong> R1T and 43.4% said they&#8217;ll hodl the <strong>Tesla</strong> Cybertruck.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Ford is offering one item that some customers might find appealing. Ford said its new F-150 Lightning truck, which will come to market in spring 2022, can provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-can-power-your-home-in-an-outage/">energy to a customer&#8217;s home</a> in the event of an outage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford also announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with <strong>SK Innovation</strong> to establish a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/"> joint venture to manufacture batteries</a> for electric vehicles in the United States. The new venture, dubbed BlueOvalSK, will produce around 60 GWh annually starting mid-decade. The MOU is the latest sign that Ford intends to vertically develop its battery capabilities.</p>
<p>Finally, the Verge interviewed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview">Ford CEO Jim Farley</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <strong>Ford</strong> revealed Monday morning the 2022 F-150 Lightning Pro, a version of the truck designed with <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">commercial customers in mind</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kia</strong>, which held its U.S.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/kias-fast-charging-ev6-electric-crossover-is-coming-to-the-u-s-in-early-2022/"> reveal of the the Kia EV6</a>, an all-electric crossover that is supposed to kick off the automaker&#8217;s Plan S strategy to shift away from internal combustion engines and toward EVs. The EV6, one of 11 electric vehicles that Kia plans to deliver globally by 2026. will come to the U.S. early next year. It&#8217;s also the first dedicated battery-electric vehicle to be built on its new Electric-Global Modular Platform, which is shared with Hyundai and Genesis as part of the <strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Lamborghini</strong> announced it is going to eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/lamborghini-is-kicking-off-its-electrification-plan-with-two-gas-powered-super-sports-cars/">electrify its portfolio</a>, although it is taking a slow road to get there. The will first pay homage to combustion engines with the introduction of two new V12 luxury sports cars this year before it makes a push into electrification. The aim is to switch its full lineup of vehicles to hybrids by the end of 2024 and launch of an all-electric Lamborghini in the second half of the decade. The company said it plans to invest 1.5 billion euros ($1.82 billion) over four years to make the transition to hybrid vehicles, the largest allocation in its history.</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p><strong>Volocopter</strong> revealed a new electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft targeting the suburban-to-city commuter. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/volocopter-debuts-a-bigger-evtol-aimed-at-the-city-suburban-commute/">four-seater VoloConnect</a>, which is designed to have a range of 62 miles, is a significant departure from short urban trip aircraft called VoloCity. The two-seat VoloCity, which has to be certified, has a 22-mile range.</p>
<p>VoloConnect&#8217;s longer range indicates that the company has its sights set on markets outside of major city centers, and that it is looking to more directly compete with rival eVTOL startups. VoloConnect&#8217;s aircraft specs are in line with that of competitors <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> and <strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, which each have eVTOL designs with an anticipated range of around 60 miles.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Wisk Aero</strong>, the startup filed a motion for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">preliminary injunction</a> in its ongoing lawsuit with rival electric air travel startup Archer Aviation. The injunction could put a wrench in Archer&#8217;s operations should the courts approve it. Wisk has asked the court to immediately prohibit Archer from using 52 trade secrets that it alleges were stolen by former employees who were later hired by Archer. The trade secrets &#8220;span the gamut of systems within the aircraft and processes for development,&#8221; a Wisk spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p>The <strong>Google I/O developer conference</strong> contained a few vehicle related announcements, including that it is extending its Android for Cars App Library, which is available as part of Jetpack, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-it-easier-to-bring-android-apps-to-your-car/">support the Android Automotive operating system</a>. This is good news for developers who can now create an app that is compatible with two different, but sometimes overlapping platforms: Android OS and Android Auto. It also means developers can create one app that should work seamlessly between various makes and models of vehicles. The company is already working with so-called Early Access Partners, which includes <strong>Parkwhiz</strong>, <strong>Plugshare</strong>, <strong>Sygic</strong>, <strong>ChargePoint</strong>, <strong>Flitsmeister</strong>, <strong>SpotHero</strong> and others to bring apps in these categories to cars powered by Android Automotive OS.</p>
<p>Google also announced it is working with <strong>BMW</strong> and other automakers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/with-android-12-google-will-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-car-key/">develop a digital key</a> that will let car owners lock, unlock and start a vehicle from their Android smartphone. The digital car keys will become available on select Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones later this year. Google didn&#8217;t name the other automakers that it is working with, but the folks there tell me it will be available in some 2021 models and a number of 2022 model vehicles. My educated guess, based on the companies it is already working with, is that Volvo and GM brands will get the digital key.</p>
<p><strong>HERE Technologies</strong>, the location data and technology platform, will power the in-vehicle Human-Machine Interface (HMI) navigation solution in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232153/0/en/Arrival-selects-HERE-SDK-for-its-Electric-Vehicles.html">Arrival&#8217;s upcoming electric vehicles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Holoride</strong>, the Audi spinoff that&#8217;s creating an in-vehicle XR passenger entertainment experience, is deploying <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/holoride-deploys-elrond-blockchain-and-nfts-in-prep-for-2022-market-launch/">blockchain technology and NFTs</a> as the next stage in its preparation for a 2022 market launch. The company said it is integrating Elrond blockchain into its tech stack to bring transparency to its ecosystem of car manufacturers and content creators. The aim is to use NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, to incentivize developers into creating more content on holoride&#8217;s platform for the promise of more money earned off token purchases, and to attract passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis </strong>and <strong>Foxconn</strong> have <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22698&amp;mid=1">formed a joint venture</a> called Mobile Drive to supply in-car and connected-car technologies. The non-binding agreement is meant to speed up the time it takes to develop and deploy in-vehicle user experiences enabled by advanced consumer electronics, HMI interfaces and services, according to the companies.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>After a somewhat quiet weekend, things are kicking off in rapid-fire fashion this week. Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cryptocurrency selloff that was in full-swing on Friday continued over the weekend. Though bitcoin and ether managed to recoup some of their losses since they set new local minima, the value of popular cryptos is vastly depressed compared to recent highs.</li>
<li>Looking ahead, it&#8217;s the final day of arguments at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/">Epic Games vs. Apple trial</a>. And we&#8217;re seeing a smaller company try to crack some of the hold that a major tech incumbent enjoys over a huge piece of the digital economy. So, if you like startups, you might want to put aside your Apple fandom for a minute.</li>
<li>More than a few funding rounds are cracking off this morning, including neat rounds from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">African fintech Mono</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-unicorn-softbank/">India-and-UAE-based Zeta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/emitwise-raises-an-extra-3-2m-from-arctern-ventures-for-its-greenhouse-gas-emissions-platform/">Emitwise raising $3.2 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/aurora-solar-aims-to-power-the-growing-solar-industry-with-a-250m-round-c/">Aurora Solar raising $250 million</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a busy funding market and a yet-busy IPO cycle, it should be yet another busy week. Strap in!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;AI is eating the world of education,&#8221; <a href="https://company.riiid.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riiid</a> co-founder and CEO YJ Jang notes in his biographical description on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yj-young-jun-jang-6b4a3111/?originalSubdomain=kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a>, and today his startup &#8212; which builds AI-based personalized learning, including test prep, for students &#8212; is announcing a major funding round to help it position itself as a player in that process.</p>
<p>Seoul-based Riiid has closed a funding round of $175 million, an equity round coming from a single backer, SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2.</p>
<p>The funding is coming at a high-watermark moment for edtech &#8212; with the shift to remote learning in the last year of pandemic living highlighting the opportunity to build better tools to serve that market, and a number of startups in the category subsequently raising hundreds of millions of dollars to tackle the opportunity. Riiid plans to use the investment both to expand its footprint internationally, a well as to expand its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Riiid is not disclosing its valuation, but this round is its biggest yet and brings the total raised by the startup to $250 million, a significant sum in the world of edtech.</p>
<p>Riiid has primarily made a name for itself through Santa, a test prep app geared towards people in non-English-language countries to practice and prepare to take the TOEIC English language proficiency exam (often a requirement to apply to English-language universities if you&#8217;re not a native English speaker), which has been used by more than 2.5 million students in Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>It has also been partnering with third parties to expand into test prep for other exams. These have included the GMAT (in partnership with Kaplan) for Korean students; an app, in partnership with <a href="https://connecme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConnecME Education</a> (a company that tailors educational services specifically to cater to international audiences) to help people in Egypt, UAE, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan <a href="https://www.intelligentcio.com/me/2021/03/26/riiid-labs-and-connecme-launch-ai-enabled-act-test-preparation-mobile-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepare for the ACT</a>; and a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riiid-labs-signs-usd-three-million-contract-with-latin-american-education-leaders-grupo-inicie-and-casa-grande-to-deliver-personalized-ai-powered-learning-301255767.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> deal</a> to build AI-based tools for students in Latin America to prepare for their college entrance exams. The ACT development comes after Riiid said that the former CEO of ACT, Marten Roorda, was joining its international arm Riiid Labs as its &#8220;executive in residence,&#8221; so that could point to more ACT prep applications for other markets, too.</p>
<p>Beyond university entrance tests, Riiid has also been building apps for vocational education, with Santa Realtor for preparing for real estate agency exams, and a test preparation tool for insurance agent exams, both in Korea.</p>
<p>The company has been growing at a time when edtechs are seeing more business and a rise in overall credibility and urgency to fill the gap left by the temporary cessation of in-person learning. The extra element of bringing artificial intelligence into the equation is not unique: a number of companies are bringing in advances in computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning to bring more personalized experiences into what might otherwise appear like a one-size-fits-all model. What is notable here is that Riiid has also been anchoring a lot of its R&amp;D in IP. The company says it has applied for 103 domestic and international patents, and has so far had 27 of them issued.</p>
<p class="p1">“Riiid wants to transform education with AI, and achieve a true democratization of educational opportunities,” said Riiid CEO YJ Jang in a statement. “This investment is only the beginning of our journey in creating a new industry ecosystem and we will carry out this mission with global partnerships.&#8221;</p>
<p>For SoftBank, this is one of the firm&#8217;s bigger edtech investments &#8212; others have included Kahoot (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/kahoot-picks-up-215m-from-softbank-for-its-user-generated-gamified-e-learning-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$215 million</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unacademy</a> in India, and <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/PressRelease/67234/MoFo-Advises-SoftBank-On-Investment-In-Brazilian-EdTech-Company-Descomplica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Descomplica</a> in Brazil. Riiid said that this round is SoftBank&#8217;s first specifically in the area of AI built for educational applications.</p>
<p>“Riiiid is driving a paradigm shift in education, from a ‘one size fits all’ approach to personalized instruction. Powered by AI and machine learning, Riiid’s platform provides education companies, schools and students with personalized plans and tools to optimize learning potential,” said Greg Moon, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers. “We are delighted to partner with YJ and the Riiid team to support their ambition of democratizing quality education around the world.”</p>

<p>Little Birdie says this brings its valuation to $130 million AUD (about $100 million USD).

Users can use Little Birdie to track and compare products, and look for price drops, sales and offers. The SKUs come from a combination of brand partnerships and scraping e-commerce sites, with the majority from retailers’ product feeds.</p>

<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Jon Beros told TechCrunch that “Australia’s e-commerce market is very competitive and quite fragmented with a lot of retailers fighting for market share. The pandemic accelerated online adoption and saw many retailers switch on an online presence, or shift their focus online. With so many players fighting for the attention of shoppers and driving up the cost of acquisition, Little Birdie can genuinely help retailers by providing a new marketing channel that delivers qualified customers leads.”</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank will be able to access Little Birdie’s catalog of shopping content to create targeted offers for customers, including features that link savings goals to specific items through its money management tools. Beros said that Little Birdie will also seek two different types of brand partnerships: “Firstly with retailers who come on board to promote their exclusive offers and products on Little Birdie and secondly with major brands and media companies that look to integrate our shopping content into their apps or websites. These integration partners ultimately deepen the value Little Birdie offers its retail partners by helping to amplify the reach of their offers to a wider audience.”</p>
<p>The company is looking at expansion into Southeast Asia and the United States, but Beros said there is not a firm timeline for its international growth yet, since it depends on the COVID-19 pandemic situation and when borders start to reopen.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Commonwealth Bank group executive Angus Sullivan said, “We believe customers should have access to the world’s best digital experience and our partnership with Little Birdie will give customers access to exclusive industry leading deals via the CommBank app.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/call-analytics-platform-invoca-expands-into-sales-e-commerce-and-customer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding</a> its marketing call analytics platform last year to provide more insights to help those in sales, e-commerce and customer experience, <a href="https://www.invoca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invoca</a> is making its first acquisition to widen the net of companies that it targets. The company has acquired <a href="https://www.dialogtech.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DialogTech</a>, a startup that builds tools for marketers to analyze inbound phone calls and other contacts, in what TechCrunch understands to be a $100 million deal.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Santa Barbara-based Invoca will be divesting Swydo, a company that Chicago-based DialogTech <a href="https://www.swydo.com/swydo-acquired-dialogtech-strengthen-position-leading-omni-channel-reporting-dashboarding-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired in 2018</a>. Swydo &#8212; originally from The Netherlands &#8212; will remain a partner of Invoca&#8217;s, the company said.</p>
<p>Invoca has up to now focused on larger consumer-facing enterprises &#8212; its customers include the likes of ADT, AutoNation, DISH, TELUS, and The Home Depot &#8212; providing them with an AI-based platform that lets their marketing, sales and other teams analyze calls from consumer customers and provide call tracking, coaching, and other insights in real time and in the form of post-call reports to help those teams do their jobs more easily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gregg Johnson, Invoca&#8217;s CEO and one of growing pool of Salesforce veterans that are reinventing the marketing and sales technology landscape, described DialogTech as &#8220;complementary&#8221; to what Invoca does, but will specifically help Invoca better target mid-market companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The opportunity that both Invoca and DialogTech have identified is that, despite the growth of digital media advertising, social media and other channels for brands to connect to would-be customers, inbound calls remain a very key part of how companies sell goods and services, especially when the sale is of a complex item. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;About 40% to 80% of revenues come through contact centers,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;Brands can do all the retargeting they want but the same strategies in digital don&#8217;t work there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those working at the other end of the line, the need for tools to do their jobs better became even more pressing in the last year, a time when customers stayed home and away from physical stores, shifting all of their interactions to virtual and remote channels. Subsequently, they demanded and expected better levels of service there.</span></p>
<p>“This move enables us to be an even better partner to enterprises and agencies looking to optimize their marketing and drive sales,” said DialogTech CEO, Doug Kofoid, in a statement. “Together as Invoca, our combined company will deliver an unrivaled solution for conversation intelligence, with the most innovative technology, expertise, experience, and resources in our industry.”</p>
<p>The combined business will become one of the bigger &#8220;martech&#8221; startups focusing on conversational insights, with 2,000 customers, over 300 employees and on track to make more than $100 million this year in revenue. This is, however, just the tip of the iceberg: the conversational intelligence market was <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/conversational-ai-market-49043506.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to be worth some $4.8 billion in 2020</a> and is expected to balloon to nearly $14 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>Given how many startups we&#8217;ve seen launch in the name of better sales intelligence, it&#8217;s likely that this will not be the last piece of consolidation in the area. Combining to expand the functionality of a platform, or to expand the scale and reach of a business, or simply to bring on interesting tech that is easier to acquire than build from scratch, are three areas that will likely drive more M&amp;A.</p>
<p>Invoca last raised funding in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invoca-raises-56m-to-help-marketers-turn-conversational-insights-into-revenue-300940456.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2019</a>, a $56 million round just ahead of the world shifting into Covid-19 pandemic mode. Johnson confirmed that Invoca &#8212; which has to date raised $116 million from Accel, Upfront Ventures, H.I.G. Growth Partners, Morgan Stanley, Salesforce Ventures and others &#8212; is in a strong enough position as a business not to need to raise more for this acquisition.</p>
<p>However, I suspect that scaling up like this will help it bid for bigger money and a bigger valuation when it does, as will the fact that peers in the market like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gong</a> (which Johnson described as the &#8220;B2B version of Invoca&#8221; to me) have seen their valuations catapult in the last year, spurred by the changes in how customers interact with businesses, and sales and marketing can work to better serve them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From time to time, we see a Chinese app climbing to the top of Google Play and App Store in a host of Western countries. It might be a utility tool like a selfie beautifier or some casual video game, which has universal appeal and require little localization effort. But most of them tend to be a blip on the radar.</p>
<p>The latest Chinese app to top the overseas charts is from TikTok owner ByteDance. Called CapCut, the video editing app allows users to not only add a trove of stickers, filters and effects, it also has a simple-to-use green screen function, a zooming feature that works like a Ken Burns effect, and many more &#8212; which make the app like an accessible Final Cut on the go.</p>
<p>Users won&#8217;t have to worry about paying for music, as CapCut has a library of licensed sound clips that they can use to spice up their content. Over the past year, TikTok has been beefing up its music arsenal through efforts like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/tiktok-music/">scouting for musicians</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">signing deals with major labels</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Chinese tech giants are adept at attracting a large user base first by offering their services for free, and then exploring monetization models after users become sticky to the products. CapCut appears to have the same playbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">CapCut&#8217;s Chinese sibling Jianying has already had success among Douyin (TikTok for China) users. Now that pattern is repeating outside China, with TikTok users taking advantage of CapCut to make their videos look sleek and professional with a few taps on their phones. </span></p>
<p>Since May 21, CapCut has been the <a href="https://sensortower.com/ios/rankings/top/iphone/us/all-categories?app_id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&amp;app_name=capcut-video-editor&amp;publisher=bytedance-pte-ltd&amp;start_date=2021-02-24&amp;end_date=2021-05-24&amp;countries=US&amp;chart_type=free&amp;hourly=false&amp;selected_tab=charts&amp;date=2021-05-24&amp;search=">No. 1 free app</a> on the U.S. App Store, according to analytics company SensorTower, and it ranks <a href="https://sensortower.com/android/US/bytedance-pte-ltd/app/capcut-video-editor/com.lemon.lvoverseas/category-rankings?selected_tab=charts&amp;start_date=2021-04-25&amp;end_date=2021-05-24&amp;countries=US&amp;category=all&amp;chart_type=free&amp;device=android&amp;hourly=false&amp;date=2021-05-24">9th on Google Play</a> in the U.S. as of writing. Across the globe, it comes in first among free iOS apps in 33 countries, according to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/apps/ios/app/1500855883/app-ranking?app_slug=1500855883&amp;market_slug=ios&amp;device=iphone&amp;type=ranks&amp;date=2021-05-22">App Annie</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the app has exceeded 250 million installs globally to date from across the App Store and Google Play, and nearly 9.5 million from U.S. app stores, SensorTower says.</p>
<p>CapCut&#8217;s rise is reminiscent of the Chinese photo editor Meitu. The app was so popular that it became synonymous with a selfie beautifier in China, but it also had a solid base of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/meitu-app-collects-personal-data/">loyal users abroad</a>. The difference is CapCut&#8217;s rise is built on its sibling TikTok&#8217;s global dominance, whereas Meitu&#8217;s early attempt to foster a social network around its photo tool to increase user stickiness never really took off.</p>
<p>CapCut probably won&#8217;t be ByteDance&#8217;s last viral app. TikTok&#8217;s sprawling content empire will spawn more offshoots, whether it&#8217;s a video editor or an e-commerce service for creators to make money and for users to buy the products endorsed by their favorite influencers.</p>

The <a href="https://flat6labs.com/funds/fac/">fund</a> had a target for EGP50 million (~$3.2 million) but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closed at EGP207 million ($13.2 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2011, Flat6Labs is a regional seed accelerator with offices in Egypt and Tunisia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The accelerator launched i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ts Cairo programme </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2017 to invest in more than 100 startups across Egypt over the course of five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups that get into the accelerator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with office space, legal and marketing help, and access to mentorship and networking, among other perks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also receive between EGP500,000 and EGP750,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the close of this round, Flat6Labs has increased the check sizes to EGP1.5 million (~$95,000) and up to EGP3 million (~$191,000) in post-programme follow-on funding for selected startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC), the <a href="https://www.msme.eg/ar/Pages/default.aspx">MSME Development Agency</a>, <a href="https://egyptventures.com/">Egypt Ventures</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eaefund.org/">Egyptian American Enterprise Fund</a> are the anchor investors in Flat6Labs&#8217; seed fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sawari Ventures, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently closed its $71 million fund, also participated in this second close, and i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t comes as no surprise because the firm, which is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affiliated with the accelerator, said it would set aside 10% of its fund for Flat6Labs seed-stage companies when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/sawari-ventures-finally-closes-71m-fund-for-north-african-startups/">covered</a> them in April</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Sawari Ventures, our fund strategy has always been to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allocate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a percentage of our fund to the seed stage, which is a completely different proposition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process, culture, and support needed,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wael Amin, managing Partner at Sawari Ventures, said in a statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As investors in Flat6Labs Accelerator Company, we get the opportunity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitably</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Egyptian companies at a very early stage, get early indicators on ecosystem trends, and visibility into the ecosystem.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zeta, a startup that helps banks and fintech firms launch products, is the newest to attain the coveted unicorn status after closing a financing round.</p>
<p>The banking tech firm, co-founded by veteran Indian entrepreneur Bhavin Turakhia, said on Monday it has raised $250 million in a <s>Series D</s> Series C round led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, confirming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/banking-tech-zeta-fundraise-sb/">a TechCrunch report from mid-April</a>. Existing investor Sodexo also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The new round valued the startup, which has offices in Bangalore and Dubai, at $1.45 billion. That’s up from the $300 million valuation that Zeta reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/zeta-300m-sodexo/">in the second half of 2019</a>. (Turakhia said the startup incorrectly called the previous round Series C.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="http://zeta.tech">Zeta</a> has developed a technology stack that helps it engage with both banks, fintech startups, as well as other online consumer platforms. The thesis is that banks &#8212; largely operating on antiquated technologies &#8212; today don’t have the time and expertise to offer the best experience to hundreds of millions of customers and fintech firms they serve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks are still stuck in the &#8217;80s. Many of them still use COBOL programming language. They offer poor user experience,&#8221; said Turakhia in a press briefing Monday, adding that to make up for it, banks end up working with dozens of vendor and technology partners. &#8220;Nobody thought of building the bank stack from the ground up. Until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banks, which have licenses to offer financial services to customers, use Zeta’s cloud-native API and SDKs to launch credit cards, debit cards, loans and offer improved experience to customers, and also work with fintechs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any financial service you can think of, Zeta provides it today,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup today serves 10 banks and 25 fintech firms, and plans to deploy the fresh capital to reach more clients and increase its headcount.</p>

(Image: Zeta)</p></div></p>
<p>Zeta is SoftBank Vision Fund 2&#8217;s latest investment in India. The Japanese conglomerate, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/indian-social-commerce-meesho-raises-300m-at-2-1b-valuation-softbank/"> minted another unicorn in social commerce Meesho</a> last month, is in advanced stages of talks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/softbank-in-talks-to-invest-up-to-500-million-in-swiggy/">invest up to $500 million in food delivery giant Swiggy</a> and is also <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/tiger-global-in-talks-to-lead-50-75-mn-funding-round-in-whatfix/articleshow/82144685.cms?from=mdr">engaging with SaaS startup WhatFix</a>.</p>
<p>“Banking software is a $300 billion industry globally. Most banks still employ technology which is significantly older than their customers, impacting user experience and engagement,” Munish Varma, a managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Zeta is the 14th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year as Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, and SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">accelerate their pace of funding in India</a>, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Turakhia, with his brother Divyank, started his first venture in 1998. Along the way, they sold four web companies to Endurance for $160 million. Zeta is the third startup Bhavin has co-founded since then — the other being business messaging platform Flock and Radix.</p>
<p>&#8220;The increasingly digital world represents evolving security, privacy and data protection challenges to banks. The industry needs systems reinvented with security, privacy, scalability and reliability as the core foundations. Zeta&#8217;s Omni Stack answers that need,&#8221; said Ramki Gaddipati, co-founder and chief technology officer of Zeta, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora Solar had one of those pitches that seemed obvious in retrospect. Instead of going to a house and measuring its roof manually for a solar panel installation, why not use aerial scans and imagery of the whole region? That smart play earned them <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/aurora-solars-computer-generated-installation-maps-pull-in-a-20m-series-a/">a $20M A round</a>, a $50M B round, and now only six months later a massive $250M C as they aim to become the software platform on which the coming solar power expansion will be run.</p>
<p>The idea is simple enough to explain, but difficult to pull off. There&#8217;s lots of data out there about the topography, physical and infrastructural, of most cities. Satellite imagery, aerial lidar scans, light and power lines and usage data, and of course where and how the sun hits a given location — this information is readily available. Aurora&#8217;s innovation wasn&#8217;t just using it, but assembling it into a cohesive system that&#8217;s simple and effective enough to be used widely by solar installers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aurora&#8217;s core value proposition is the fact that you can do things remotely much faster and more accurately than could if you traveled to the site,&#8221; explained co-founder and CRO Sam Adeyemo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having developed algorithms that ingest the aforementioned data, the service they offer is a very quick turnaround on the tricky question of whether a solar installation makes sense for a potential customer, and if so what it might cost and look like, down to the size and angle of the panels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156160" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156160" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png" alt="An interface showing a solar roof design and power savings." width="1024" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png 1760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=768,319 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=1536,639 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-interface-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aurora Solar</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not uncommon for the acquisition cost for a customer to be thousands of dollars,&#8221; said Adeyemo&#8217;s co-founder, CEO Chris Hopper. That&#8217;s partly because every installation is custom. He estimated that half the price tag of any setup is &#8220;soft cost&#8221; — that is, over and above the actual price of the hardware.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the quote is for $30K, what actually goes on your roof might be $15K, the rest is overhead, design, acquisition cost, yada yada yada,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s the next frontier to make solar cost-competitive, and that&#8217;s where Aurora comes in. Every time we shave a few dollars off the price of an installation, it opens it up for new consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company doesn&#8217;t do its own lidar flights or solar installations, so the $250M in funding may strike some as rather high for a company making software. Though I did my best to tease out any secret skunkworks projects under way at Aurora, Adeyemo and Hopper patiently explained that enterprise-scale software isn&#8217;t cheap, and the funding is proportional to their ambitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount we raised speaks to the opportunity ahead of us,&#8221; said Hopper. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more solar to put on roofs.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Solar roof-tile and energy startup SunRoof closes €4.5M led by Inovo Venture Partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/solar-roof-tile-and-energy-startup-sunroof-closes-e4-5m-led-by-inovo-venture-partners/embed/#?secret=VLV46t1E9k" data-secret="VLV46t1E9k" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Aurora has been used for evaluating about 5 million solar projects so far, about a fifth of which end up being built, Adeyemo estimated. And that&#8217;s just a fraction of a fraction. Solar makes up about two percent of the U.S.&#8217;s power infrastructure, right now, but that&#8217;s on track to increase by an order of magnitude in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The new administration has thrown fuel on the fire of the industry&#8217;s optimism, and whether or not something like the Green New Deal comes to fruition, the fundamentally different approach to environmental and energy policy mean there are more eyeballs directed at clean energy and consequently a lot of checks being written.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156159" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156159" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2156159" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg" alt="Aurora Solar co-founders Samuel Adeyemo (left) and Chris Hopper (right)." width="400" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg 1330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=290,300 290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=768,795 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=657,680 657w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-founders.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156159" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aurora Solar</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It counts for a lot. With heightened awareness about climate change there will be more interest in ways to mitigate it,&#8221; said Adeyemo. He gave the example of Texas, which after the recent storms and blackouts had more inquiries per capita than anywhere else in the country. Renewables may be a charged issue in some ways, but solar power is bipartisan and broadly popular across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>The $250M round, led by Coatue and with participation from previous investors ICONIQ, Energize Ventures, and Fifth Wall, allows the company to go both broad and deep with their product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically we&#8217;ve been more of a design solution; the next phase is to broaden that into a platform that covers more of the process of going solar,&#8221; said Hopper. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe this is going to be a niche market — going from 2 to 20 percent and beyond, that&#8217;s a huge endeavor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-founders would not be more specific than that scaling a SaaS company requires significant cash up front, and during the push to come they can&#8217;t be worried about whether or when they&#8217;ll need to get more capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first five years of the company were quasi-bootstrapped&#8230; we&#8217;d raised like a million bucks. So we know what it&#8217;s like to grow a company from that perspective, and now we know what it&#8217;s like to really need the capital to scale the business,&#8221; said Adeyemo. &#8220;If you want to be the platform for a significant percentage of the energy capacity of the country&#8230; you gotta tool up.&#8221;</p>
<p>What exactly tooling up comprises we will soon find out — the company is planning to announce more news at its <a href="https://empower.aurorasolar.com/">upcoming summit</a> in June.</p>

<p>Mauro Cozzi, Emitwise Co-Founder and CEO, said in a statement: “With leaders set to ratchet up global climate ambition at the upcoming COP26 climate summit, there’s never been more certainty amongst corporates and investors: carbon equals cost and risk. A net zero-aligned model is a proxy for profit, efficiency and resilience and we’re committed to helping firms realize the major economic upsides of the transformation.”</p>
<p>Marc Faucher, ArcTern Ventures, said: “Enterprises face mounting pressure from customers, investors, and regulators to disclose accurate environmental data. Emitwise gives a clear line of sight to supply chain carbon which is critical for instilling effective mitigation strategies and incentives. Here at ArcTern Ventures, we believe Emitwise’s software platform is a game-changer that sets new standards in universal carbon footprint reporting.”</p>
<p>Emitwise competes to some extent with other startups in this space including Watersheds and Plan A, which also recently raised a round of funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Nigerian fintech startup <a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a> announced its acceptance into Y Combinator and, at the time, it wanted to build the Plaid for Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three months later, the startup has a different mission: to power the internet economy in Africa and has closed $2 million in seed investment towards that goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment comes nine months after the company raised $500,000 in pre-seed last September and two months after receiving $125,000 from YC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono&#8217;s total investment moves up to $2.625 million, and investors in this new round include Entrée Capital (one of the investors in Kuda&#8217;s seed round), Kuda co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi; Gbenga Oyebode, partner at TCVP; and Eric Idiahi, co-founder and partner at Verod Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York but Africa-based VC Lateral Capital also invested after taking part in Mono&#8217;s pre-seed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a region where more than half of the population is</span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">either unbanked or underbanked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, open finance players like Mono are trying to improve financial inclusion and connectivity on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open finance thrives on the notion that access to a financial ecosystem via open APIs and new routes to move money, access financial information and make borrowing decisions reduces the barriers and costs of entry for the underbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August 2020, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he company streamlines various financial data in a single API for companies and third-party developers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono allows them to retrieve information like account statements, real-time balance, historical transactions, income, expense and account owner identification with users&#8217; consent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we covered the company early in the year, it had already secured partnerships with more than 16 financial institutions in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to having</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a little over a hundred businesses like Carbon, Aella Credit, Credpal, Renmoney, Autochek, and Inflow Finance access customers bank account for bank statements, identity data, and balances</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mono has also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connected over 100,000 financial accounts for its partners and analysed over 66 million financial transactions so far</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono has done impressively well in a short period. While it appears to have figured out product-market fit, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijbkid/">Abdul Hassan</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is quick to remind everyone that the burgeoning API fintech space is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an entry point to its pursuit of being a data company &#8212; a case he also made in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way I see it, our market is not that big. Compare the payments market now with 2016, when Paystack and Flutterwave </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payments space in 2016 was very small and the number of people using cards online was very small,&#8221; said Hassan, who co-founded the company with <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/whoisprakhar">Prakhar Singh</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the same thing for us right now. That&#8217;s why our focus isn&#8217;t only on open banking but data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re thinking of how we can power the internet economy with data that isn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> financial data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, think about open data for telcos. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine where you can move your data from one telco to another instead of getting a new SIM card and making a fresh registration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That&#8217;s where I see the market going, at least for us at Mono.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that the company is taking an approach of building a product one step at a time until it can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> diversify from financial data offerings, including connecting with payment gateways (Paystack and Flutterwave) and other fintechs like wealth management startups Piggyvest and Cowrywise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you&#8217;re able to connect to all the systems, a lot of use cases will come up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is how can we connect to all available data and open it up for businesses and developers,&#8221; he continued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mono will use the funding to reinforce its current financial and identity data offerings and launch new products for diverse business verticals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a long-overdue pan-African expansion to Ghana and Kenya is top priority</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time I spoke with Hassan, the end of Q1 looked </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">feasible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get into at least one of the two markets but it didn&#8217;t turn out that way</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the wait seems to be over as the company said it&#8217;d be going live in Ghana next month with a handful of existing customers from Nigeria and new ones in Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these partners include five banks (GTBank, Fidelity Bank and three unannounced banks) and the mobile money service arm of MTN Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our expansion is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inspired by our customers looking to expand to other markets, same with some of our products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We work with our customers to give them the right tools to build new experiences for their customers,&#8221; Hassan stated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156233" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156233" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2156233" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?w=680" alt="Mono" width="680" height="361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png 820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?resize=680,361 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/png.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156233" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mono</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono is one of the three API fintech companies to have raised a seed investment this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, another Nigerian fintech Okra <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/nigerian-fintech-okra-raises-3-5m-backed-by-accenture-ventures-and-susa-ventures/">closed $3.5 million</a> while Stitch, a South African API fintech, launched</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with $4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to back investments like this show that investors are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimistic about the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Avil Eyal, managing partner and co-founder of Entrée Capital, one of such investors, had this to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are very excited to be working with Abdul, Prakhar and the entire Mono team as they continue to build out the rails for African banking to enable the delivery of financial services to hundreds of millions of people across the African continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">British artificial intelligence (AI) company, Faculty has raised £30 million ($42.5M) in growth funding from the Apax Digital Fund (ADF). The startup has now raised a total of £40m ($56.6M) to date.</p>
<p>In April this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/ai-startup-faculty-wins-contract-to-predict-future-requirements-for-the-uks-nhs/">announced</a> it had won a contract to work with the UK&#8217;s NHS to better predict its future needs. It has also picked up at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/vote-leave-ai-firm-wins-seven-government-contracts-in-18-months">seven other</a> UK government contracts. Its customers include the UK’s National Crime Agency, Red Bull, Virgin Media, and Moonpig.</p>
<p>The company says it now expects to create over 400 new jobs across its engineering, product and delivery teams. The investment will also be put toward the rollout of Faculty’s new learning and development programme. Founded in 2014 by Dr Marc Warner, Dr Angie Ma and Andrew Brookes, the company is noted for its fondness for hiring swathes of maths and data science PhDs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Far from being an aloof R&amp;D AI operation, Faculty pitches more as an “AI as a Service”, applying its platform to real-world data for the purposes of real-world outcomes, such as optimizing a company’s marketing spend or forecasting demand for consumer goods. That said, Faculty became briefly notorious after applying its platform to the cause of Vote Leave during the UK referendum.</p>
<p>After helping the campaign win that fight, it’s ironically now been <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/faculty-ai-brexit-fishing">awarded</a> a public contract to help the British government apply machine learning to Britain’s post-Brexit fishing waters, even as the fishing industry <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1427654/brexit-news-uk-eu-fishing-british-boats-crew-boris-johnson-trade-deal">comes under considerable strain</a>&#8230; because of Brexit.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call (a longer interview will be available later) Marc Warner, CEO, and co-founder of Faculty told me the company has no plans to work in the political sphere again: “Never again. It&#8217;s very controversial. I don&#8217;t want to make out that I think politics is unethical. Trying to make the world better, in whatever dimension you can, is a good thing… But from our perspective, it was, you know, ‘noisy’, and our goal as an organization is, despite current appearances to the contrary, is not to spend tonnes of time talking about this stuff. We do believe this is an important technology that should be out there and should be in a broader set of hands than just the tech giants, who are already very good at it.”</p>
<p>Of the investment, he said: &#8220;This is about doubling down on the UK first and then international expansion. We have learned what it takes to do important, impactful AI at scale. And we just don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s actually much of it out there. Customers are rightly sometimes a bit skeptical. There&#8217;s been hype around this stuff for years and years. We figured out a bunch of real-world applications that actually deliver value. And so, ultimately, the money [we’ve raised] is really just about being able to build out all of the pieces to do that incredibly well for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Faculty plans to continue to take advantage of the UK&#8217;s talent pool: &#8220;The UK is a wonderful place to do AI. It has brilliant universities and a very dynamic startup scene. It&#8217;s actually more diverse than San Francisco. There&#8217;s government, there&#8217;s finance, there&#8217;s corporates, there&#8217;s less competition from the tech giants, so there&#8217;s a bit more of a heterogeneous ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Mark Beith, partner at Apax Digital, who joins Faculty’s board of directors, said: “Faculty is a world-leading AI company with cutting-edge technology, inspiring people and culture, and with phenomenal customer feedback. They enable customers to realize the tremendous value of AI quickly but responsibly, providing robust, fair, and explainable AI, with advanced data privacy. We have seen the power and impact of their solutions first-hand, as a client, and are thrilled to partner with Marc, Angie, Andy, and the team to support their global expansion.”</p>
<p>The Apax Digital Fund joins Faculty’s existing investors, including Guardian Media Group Ventures, LocalGlobe, and Jaan Tallinn, one of Skype’s founding engineers.</p>
<p>The Estonian investor <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/11/13/jaan-tallinn-ai-safety-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-elon-musk/">gave</a> Faculty 350 units of Ether in January 2018, worth about $434,000 at the time, and 50 Bitcoins in March 2020, worth about $316,000, according to Faculty’s financial filings at the U.K. business registry Companies House.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">These days, the path of least resistance in laptop design is straight-up knocking off the MacBook. We’ve certainly seen our share of egregious cases over the years. Microsoft, however, has defiantly forged its own path with industrial design across the board. Its products are largely interesting and innovative &#8212; something not every hardware manufacturer can say these days.</p>
<p>The company doesn’t always get it right. It swung for the fences with the Surface Duo, for example. While certainly innovative, the product came up short in enough categories that made it extremely hard to recommend. The Surface Laptop, on the other hand, while not the most groundbreaking product in the line, has pretty consistently been one of the best, marrying a Windows-ready touchscreen with a more standardized notebook design.</p>

<p>The last few models have been solid, and this year’s &#8212; perhaps predictably &#8212; doesn’t present a big change. The big upgrades after about a year and a half are new chips (your choice of AMD Ryzen or an Intel Core i5 or i7) and enhanced battery life that offers a beefy additional 8.5 hours. Essentially, it&#8217;s the sort of thing you&#8217;d expect &#8212; or hope for &#8212; from a regular system refresh.</p>

<p>The design language remains largely unchanged. The Surface Laptop is nothing if not unique on that front, with its tapered sides and felt-covered palm rests. The material has a nice feel to it &#8212; one that bests just straight-up metal on a cold day, though I’ve already noticed a bit of wear after some light use.</p>
<p>The keyboard remains on the soft side, with a surprising amount of give to it. Not the best keyboard I’ve seen on a laptop, but certainly not the worst (who can forget that rough run for Apple?), and like anything else, it takes a bit of getting used to.</p>
<p>You’d think I’d have learned my lesson by now. Maybe it’s the fact that Microsoft’s Surface Laptops keep coming out when the weather is nice that I always feel inclined to take them outside. But jeez is that display reflective. Almost distractingly so. Plenty of laptop screens are glossy, of course, but Microsoft’s really leaned in here, to the point I wouldn’t recommend using it in any sort of sunshine &#8212; even at full brightness, the screen can’t counteract that reflection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156069" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156069" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156069" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CMC_9258.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156069" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>When you can see it, the display looks great. Microsoft sent along the smaller of the two. At 13.5-inches, the screen clocks in at 2256 x 1504 at 201 ppi (you get the same pixel density on the 15-inch version, as well). Ours was the new Ice Blue color. It’s subtle, though. Honestly, I read it more as a silver/gray. The speakers sound great, and the webcam is just fine, but it’s safe to say it’s probably time to upgrade to 1080p across the board as teleconferencing remains front of mind.</p>
<p>The 13.5-inch system starts at $1,000, which gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, along with the AMD Ryzen 5 4680U process. As configured, our system runs $1,700, which doubles the RAM and storage and swaps the AMD in for an Intel Core i7. Another $600 will double the RAM and storage yet again (same processor). Geekbench scored the processor at a solid 1378 on single-core and 4876 on multi-core. Performance was solid throughout &#8212; though after spending a fair amount of time using Apple’s M1, it’s clear that Intel has its work cut out for it.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2156063,2156069,2156068,2156067,2156066,2156064,2156062,2156061,2156060"]</p>
<p>Microsoft is still hanging onto its magnetic proprietary charging port here. I know it still has its diehard fans, but I’d much prefer to see the company go with something more universal, like adding another USB-C port &#8212; though that impacts the system’s compatibility with a slew of different Surface accessories. Around the other side you get USB-A, USB-C and a headphone jack. It’s a nice mix, but more ports would certainly be a step up.</p>
<p>I was fairly disappointed with the various corners the company cut on the Surface Laptop Go last year. Of course, the entry-level 13.5-inch Laptop is $300 more than the 12-inch Laptop Go. But if you’re looking to do more than just the basics, this is probably is a wise investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three months after air transport data giant SITA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/sita-airline-passenger-breach/">reported a data breach</a>, we are still learning about the damage.</p>
<p>Air India said this week that personal data of about 4.5 million passengers had been compromised following the incident at SITA, Indian flag carrier airline’s data processor. The stolen information included  passengers’ name, credit card details, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance and Air India frequent flyer data, Air India <a href="http://www.airindia.in/images/pdf/Data-Breach-Notification.pdf">said in a statement</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>CVV/CVC data of credit cards were not held by SITA, said Air India as it urged passengers to change passwords “wherever applicable to ensure safety of their personal data.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The attack compromised data of passengers who had registered with the Indian airline over the past decade, between August 26, 2011 and February 3, 2021, Air India said in a statement.</p>
<p>The revelation comes months after SITA said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/sita-airline-passenger-breach/">suffered a data breach</a> that involved passenger data. At the time, SITA said it had notified several airlines &#8212; Malaysia Airlines, Finnair, Singapore Airlines, Jeju Air, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand, and Lufthansa &#8212; of the breach.</p>
<p>The Geneva, Switzerland-headquartered firm &#8212; which is said to serve 90% of the world’s airlines &#8212; had declined to reveal the specific data that had been compromised at the time of disclosure in early March, citing an investigation &#8212; which is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Air India said that it was first notified about the cyber attack by SITA on February 25, but the nature of the data was only provided to it on March 25 and April 5.</p>
<p>The struggling Indian airline, which has been surviving on taxpayer’s money, claimed that it had investigated the security incident, secured the compromised servers, engaged with unnamed external specialists, notified the credit card issuers, and had reset passwords of its frequent flyer program.</p>
<p>Air India is the latest Indian firm to disclose a data breach in recent quarters. Payments giant MobiKwik said in late March that it was investigating claims of a data breach that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/mobikwik-investigating-data-breach-after-100m-user-records-found-online/">allegedly exposed private information of nearly 100 million users</a>.</p>
<p>Alleged records of nearly 20 million BigBasket (a top grocery delivery startup in India that is now owned by local conglomerate Tata) customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/hacker-publishes-alleged-records-of-20-million-bigbasket-users/">leaked on the dark web</a> for anyone to download in late April. A security lapse at Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/jio-coronavirus-security-lapse/">exposed results of some users</a> who had used its tool to check their coronavirus symptoms. Indian state <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/india-west-bengal-health-covid-security/">West Bengal</a> and giant blood test firm Dr Lal PathLabs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/dr-lal-pathlabs-exposed-patient-lab-data/">suffered similar breaches</a>. Air India&#8217;s peer, Spicejet, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/spicejet-breach-millions-passengers/">confirmed a data breach last year</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups used to be obsessed with billboards. It was the first thing I noticed when I moved to San Francisco: venture-backed companies including Eaze, Airbnb, and notoriously, Brex, would post large billboard advertisements all over the city to grab attention and eyeballs. When I dug into it more, I learned this type of old school, outdoor advertising was a response to the increasingly crowded online channels, such as Facebook and Instagram advertisements.</p>
<p>Well, folks, years later, we have a new response to crowded marketing channels: Ditch the billboards and just buy a media company instead. There has been a recent push for startups and venture capital firms to acquire or create media companies, which I’d argue is them finding a creative way to position content marketing. This past week, Axios discovered that <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-media-editor-crypto-682b8dca-11dd-4efc-93ef-ecb50ecdda35.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">Coinbase is launching a media operation</a> about cryptocurrency. At the same time, Clubhouse wants to <a href="https://twitter.com/lexinisita/status/1395091872578686980">hire freelance writers</a>, while its biggest lead investor to-date, Andreessen Horowitz, has ambitions to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-looks-to-launch-opinion-publication-as-its-media-ambition-grows">open up an opinion desk.</a> Other news bits like The Skimm exploring a potential sale and Hubspot acquiring the Hustle also add to the narrative of broader media ambitions across tech.</p>
<p>We got into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/linkedin-is-the-reason-apple-made-the-m1-chip/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the impact of a venture-backed media push</a> on Equity, our award-winning (!) podcast, this week. My take, as you can tell by this introduction, is that it’s not a rush to compete with journalism. It’s a rush to compete with a noisy world, and rebrand advertisements to media operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I could talk about journalism and tech and media forever, but that is all on that topic today. In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll get into new IPOs, startups providing upfront revenue to other startups and tactical advice on building versus buying a tech stack. As always, you can find me podcasting <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">@Equitypod</a> and tweeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a>.</p>
<h2>IP(Oats)</h2>
<p>Oatly went public this week, and there entirely weren’t enough jokes or puns about it. (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarthakgh/status/1395514832154243072">Although I did appreciate this one</a>). My complaint aside, <strong>i</strong>t’s been a busy week for the public markets.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Marqueta, which is focused on card issuing and payments tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">has a fascinating S-1 filing</a> — including what I’d say it’s a Peloton-Affirm relationship with Square.

<h2>Build or buy?</h2>
<p>Telemedicine needs to prepare for a post-pandemic world, which comes with its own upfront costs, risks, and, as Marcela points out, opportunities. Around $3.1 billion in funding flowed into the sector in 2020 — about three times what we saw in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/">according to her latest story.</a> In order to get money and impact out, startups have some work to do.</p>

<h2>Pipe’s get burst</h2>
<p>Everyone is paying attention to Pipe, which just raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation. As Mary Ann puts it, the company is claiming to be the Nasdaq for revenue, and it gives SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by “pairing them with investors on a marketplace who will pay a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> That wasn’t the only check that went into startups providing other startups with upfront revenue this week. Uncapped, which is the European equivalent of Pipe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/uncapped-which-provides-upfront-revenue-to-digital-companies-raises-80m-in-funding/">raised $80 million in funding</a>. Put differently, in less than 24 hours, TechCrunch reported that nearly $330 million went into backing the concept of startups providing other startups with upfront revenue.</p>
<p><em>Other dollar signs to pay attention to:</em></p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/">Bain Capital Ventures raised $1.3 billion to fund young startups, and young VC firms, too</a></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>The huge sale of Utah-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">Divvy to Bill.com</a> is still bouncing around my head this week, not only because the $2.5 billion exit was huge for both the company and its local scene, but also because its target market is exciting to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Divvy competes in what we call the corporate spend market with a few other unicorns, including Ramp and Brex. Now with Divvy taken off the table, the pair of competitors are differentiating in a few ways that matter.</p>
<p>And Brex is getting back on its billboard game.</p>
<p>This week Brex <a href="https://www.brex.com/posts/integrated-marketing/">announced</a> that it is rolling out IRL advertising in a few American cities. Residents of San Francisco back when Brex was a baby will recall how the startup plastered its brand all over the city. Essentially, it was a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brex-corporate-card-for-startups-covers-san-francisco-with-billboards-2018-8">cheap way</a> to get a lot of impressions.</p>
<p>Now the startup is taking the strategy to Houston and Miami and D.C. Why? The Exchange caught up with Brex CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/hdubugras">Henrique Dubugras</a> this week to chat about the matter. Per the executive, his company has two goals for its renewed meatspace marketing push. First, Brex wants to talk up its software game over its initial branding as a corporate card for startups. And, second, it wants business owners to know that it works with all types of companies now, not merely those with Sand Hill Road on speed dial.</p>
<p>The push to get the Brex name out in markets less known for their startup activity than overall business climate makes sense, if the unicorn wants to attract more nonstartup customers. But it’s the software element of its efforts that unsurprisingly caught our attention.</p>
<p>That’s because Brex recently rolled out Brex Premium, a package of software services that it charges around $600 per year for. Brex and rivals like Ramp and Divvy have spent lots of energy and money in recent quarters building out increasingly sophisticated software around their traditional corporate card products. The result thus far are codebases more and more able to supplant other pieces of enterprise software, like expense software.</p>
<p>But as Brex looks to double down via an advertising push on its decision to charge for Brex Premium &#8212; which Dubugras says is performing better than his company had initially anticipated &#8212; competitor Ramp is pushing its free software as an edge.</p>
<p>Ramp CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/eglyman">Eric Glyman</a> pointed The Exchange to his company’s refreshed pricing page, which <a href="https://ramp.com/pricing">highlights</a> its zero-cost software. And, he said in an email, the new page was “powering the fastest growth month we’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Broadly, what we’re seeing with Ramp and Brex and Divvy &#8212; along with Airbase and others that also compete in the space &#8212; is a cohort of startups attacking an aged corporate issue with more nimble, lower-cost products. And proving while doing so that there was huge untapped demand for something different and better. The various players competing for the startup crown in the corporate spend world wouldn’t all be growing as rapidly as they are if that weren’t the case.</p>
<p>If you want more, here’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/"> our dig into the Divvy-Bill.com deal</a>.</p>
<h2>More from startup-land</h2>
<p>The Exchange was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">lathered up</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/">SPACs this week</a>, which means that we missed a host of interesting news that we otherwise would have loved to poke into. For example, here are some very neat venture rounds that it would have been fun to dig into more deeply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ProducePay raised a $43M Series C:</strong> LA-based <a href="https://producepay.com/">ProducePay</a> helps <em>food growers</em> access capital, software and market data, linking them to <em>food demanders (importers, etc.)</em>. Per its website, ProducePay funded a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bajio">Bajío, Mexico</a>-based asparagus growing operation to the tune of a half million dollars to hire labor and invest in its growing operation. Repayment, again per the company, starts when product ships.</li>
<li>Farming is hard, fickle, expensive and not always aligned with traditional banking requirements. Throw in an increasingly global production/consumption food network, and you can see why G2VP and IFC co-led the round.</li>
<li>Oh, and The Exchange learned that ProducePay’s reported 2020 doubling was measured in GAAP revenue terms. The startup’s gross margins “grew by over 75% from 2019 to 2020, thanks to improved underwriting policies and a more attractive cost of funds as volume scaled,” per its PR team. That’s super cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another neat company that raised this week was <a href="https://www.panther.co/">Panther</a>, which put together a $2.5 million round. Panther wants to help companies hire in 160 different countries. Our read of the company and its round is that, as more companies go remote-first, this sort of service is going to become a must-have. Gusto also competes in the market, so it should be an active one to watch from both VC <em>and</em> M&amp;A perspectives.</p>
<p>Panther is based in Florida, and raised funds from, per its release, “Tribe Capital, Eric Ries, Naval Ravikant and Carta Ventures.”</p>
<p>One more round: <a href="https://www.lancebank.co/">Lance</a>, a freelancer-focused neobank, raised $2.8 million this week. The round was led by, per the company, “Barclays, BDMI, Great Oaks Capital, Imagination Capital, Techstars, DFJ Frontier, New York Venture Partners” along with some angels.</p>
<p>Now that the fintech world has created Chime and other broad-remit neobanks, it’s not surprising to see more targeted efforts get put together. And Lance CEO Oona Rokyta is betting that the freelance world is set to grow further. Given how the labor market has evolved in the last few years, I’d hazard she’s making an intelligent bet.</p>
<p>To close out today, a quick note on <a href="https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca</a>. It’s a startup that TechCrunch has dug into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/alpaca-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-api-powered-equities-trading-service/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/alpaca-stock-trading-api/">there</a>, as it fits into both our general focus on API-delivered services (on-demand pricing is hot), and it exists in the consumer fintech world (powering other companies’ equities trading services). We caught up with CEO Yoshi Yokokawa this week to chat about what’s been going on at his company since we last tracked its growth rates.</p>
<p>After all, whatever we can learn about the world of consumer investing &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">and Robinhood told us quite a lot this week</a> &#8212; is useful given the somewhat global savings/investing boom that we’ve seen in the last year or so.</p>
<p>Per Yokokawa, Alpaca has global plans, including rolling out with new partners on a few continents in the coming months. The company is handling 1,000 new accounts daily outside the United States, which Yokokawa expects to rise sharply in the coming months. And the company recently built out a broker API to make onboarding users simpler for its partners.</p>
<p>Sounds like growth to us. More when we can milk it out of, er, the alpaca.</p>

<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week we&#8217;re reviewing Google&#8217;s I/O developer event, rounding up the latest from Snap&#8217;s partner summit and taking a look at how Parler got back on the App Store, among other things.</p>

<p><em>Sorry, sorry</em>. But it&#8217;s true. Without any new hardware announcements, the software-only event just didn&#8217;t feel as big and buzzy as it has in the past &#8212; which is kind of a bummer, since I/O was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/20/google-cancels-i-o-developer-conference-in-light-of-covid-19-crisis/">canceled entirely</a> last year due to COVID-19. There was no announcement of an <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/pixel-5a-pixel-buds-a-were-no-shows-at-google-io-so-when-will-they-launch">affordable Pixel 5a</a> or 6 smartphone, no <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-watch">rumored Pixel Watch</a>, no news <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html">on Pixel chips</a>, no new smart home devices, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-io-2021/">no update on Google Stadia,</a> and not even the Pixel Buds A-Series, which <em>Google<a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"> accidentally tweeted</a> about</em> ahead of schedule. What gives? Instead, Google I/O was filled with a lot of product news that could have been announced as blog posts &#8212; like <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-io-2021/">Google Workspace improvements</a> or neat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/google-maps-to-add-more-detailed-maps-crowd-indicators-better-routing-and-more/">Google Maps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-photos-update-adds-new-memories-and-a-locked-folder-previews-cinematic-moments/">Photos</a> features. I mean, sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">a life-size 3D video calling booth</a> is cool, but it&#8217;s not exactly going to be in your living room next year.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not to downplay Google&#8217;s technical advancements, but if you&#8217;re sitting through a long live-ish (??) event, you don&#8217;t only want to hear about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/">more conversational AI</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442515/google-camera-app-inclusive-image-equity-skintones">less racist cameras</a> (much less from the company that just fired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/">multiple</a> AI ethics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired">researchers</a>).

<p>When all was said and done, what stood out was Android 12.</p>
<p>The updated version of Google&#8217;s mobile OS with its new personalization features targets a current iPhone weakness: customization.</p>

<p>While iOS finally added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets/">support for widgets with iOS 14</a> and an App Library to clean up home screen clutter, Apple seemed almost caught off guard by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/how-to-make-the-most-of-ios-14-widgets-and-iphone-home-screen-customization/">personalization madness</a> that ensued after widgets went live. It had to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets/"> quickly fix how app shortcuts worked</a> &#8212; a workaround people had been using to tediously customize their home screen icons to match their wallpaper and widgets.</p>
<p>Android 12 addresses this demand for its own users and takes things a step further. Now, when Android 12 users set a new wallpaper the system can automatically create a custom palette of colors as the Android theme, including both the dominant and complementary colors. This is applied across the OS, including in the Quick Settings under the Notification Shade, in buttons on the lock screen, widgets and more. Google calls this &#8220;Material You,&#8221; which is a bit silly but gets the point across. The phone can really start to feel like yours.</p>
<p>Material You also introduces refreshed widgets with interactive controls and easier personalization options, smoother transitions, more animations and a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/android-security-and-privacy-recap.html">privacy dashboard</a>, where you can check in on which apps are accessing your location, mic and camera, for instance. But what sells it is how all those parts come together to present a new version of Android that actually feels fresh.</p>

<h3>Snap&#8217;s Partner Summit: AR and e-commerce and more</h3>
<p>Snap, an app with now with 500 million MAUs, this week hosted an event for its partners, where the company unleashed a host of news about what&#8217;s next for its platform, including developer tools, AR updates, shopping features and more.</p>
<p>Among the highlights was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Snap&#8217;s computer vision-enabled Scan product,</a> which will analyze content in the camera feed to pull up matching products, similar to efforts by Pinterest and Google. Meanwhile, AR updates and partnerships with brands like Farfetch and Prada will make possible virtual try-on of clothes using AR. (Honestly, sometimes it feels like Snap&#8217;s tech is being lost in an app that&#8217;s mainly used by teenagers and young adults for socializing. Are they really Prada shoppers?)</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/media/snapchat-spotlight/">also gave an update</a> on its creator funding efforts, saying it had doled out more than $130 million to more than 5,400 creators making content for its TikTok rival, Spotlight, since November.

Now, posts that are labeled hate, (yes, &#8220;hate,&#8221; &#8212; this app doesn&#8217;t take down hate speech), won&#8217;t be visible on iPhone. The &#8220;hate&#8221; posts, which may include things like racial slurs, will be visible on other platforms and on the web version.</p>
<p>Apple had insisted that Parler must follow Apple&#8217;s App Store guidelines in order to return to its app marketplace, which meant Parler had to moderate its content. Parler however, would rather the option to view hate speech be a toggle, not hidden entry, saying it would prefer to put tools in the hands of it users. The company also dismissively referred to the sanitized version of Parler for iOS as &#8220;Parler PG.&#8221; The app is now No. 10 in the News category on iPhone.</p>

<p>AAPI, female-founded <a href="https://www.silkandsonder.com/">Silk + Sonder</a> was created by Meha Agrawal, a software engineer and PM for companies including Goldman Sachs, Stitch Fix, The Muse, and others to take an analog-first approach to mental wellness. Now, the company is launching its first mobile app after growing its me business to tens of thousands of subscribers and<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/silk-and-sonder-seed-funding/"> raising $4+ million</a> in seed funding.</p>
<p>The new app offers curated self-care experiences, daily affirmations, a community club, a private memories feature and others meant to complement the company&#8217;s analog journal/planners that are shipped to member&#8217;s doorstep monthly. In calming shades of pinks and whites, the app guides users through their wellness journey and helps them stay accountable to their goals.</p>
<p>Since the app&#8217;s soft launch this month, it&#8217;s added thousands of users, more than 50% of whom engage regularly.</p>
<p>The new app is initially available only to active subscribers, but other users will be able to join a waitlist.</p>

<p>Female-founded <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/link/v2?aid=1988&amp;lang=en&amp;scene=bio_url&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fherd-social%2Fid1564603157">Herd</a> has been building demand for its non-toxic Instagram alternative <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@herd.social?lang=en">via TikTok</a>. Now the app is live on iOS as a beta.</p>
<p>The goal of Herd is to give users a safer, social space focused on community, not influence, clout-chasing or data collection.</p>
<p>Users can customize their home feed by interest and use sliders to control what they want to see more of less of, while also posting their own photos, saving favorites, and staying private, if they choose. At present, Herd offers a basic photo-sharing experience. There are no Stories or photo filters or videos or much of anything that could lure users away from more advanced, feature-rich social apps. But what it does have is a mission that users feel connected with &#8212; and that pushed the app to No. 18 in the Social category on the App Store on launch day, May 18. It&#8217;s now still sitting in the top 50 a few days later.</p>
<p>But ultimately, all the marketing and social buzz can&#8217;t prop up an app forever. Herd needs to capitalize on the goodwill it&#8217;s built by leaning into quickly upgrading the UI/UX so the app itself feels as fresh as the ideas it espouses.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Full disclosure: the second time I worked at a startup founded by Mark Pincus, his dog Zinga slept behind my desk and I was one of her favorite dog-sitters.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For this morning&#8217;s edition of The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm studied <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">information recently released by mobile gaming studio Jam City</a> as it prepares to go public in a $1.2 billion blank-check deal with DPCM Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jam City is a bit like Zynga, but unless you are a mobile-gaming aficionado, you might not have heard of it,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Jam City has raised upwards of $300 million, including a $145 million round in 2019. At the time, the company was riding high after signing a deal with Disney to adapt some of the media giant&#8217;s intellectual property, which includes brands like Marvel, Fox and Pixar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Almost half of all Americans play mobile games, so Alex reviewed Jam City&#8217;s investor deck, a transcript of the investor presentation call and a press release to see how it stacks up against Zynga, which &#8220;has done great in recent quarters, including posting record revenue and bookings in the first three months of 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: the second time I worked at a startup founded by Mark Pincus, Zinga slept behind my desk and I was one of her <em>favorite</em> dog-sitters.)</p>

<p>The ability to effectively communicate can make or break your launch. It will play a role in determining who wins a new space — you or a competitor.</p>
<p>So how do you make a splash? How do you stay relevant?</p>
<p>For one, you have to stop thinking that what you are up to is interesting.</p>

<p>Whether you’re building a company or thinking about investing, it’s important to understand your strategic advantage.</p>
<p>In order to determine one, you should ask fundamental questions: What’s the long-term, sustainable reason that the company will stay in business?</p>

<p>The global pandemic has changed the way we work, including how and where we work. For those involved in the mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) industry, a notoriously relationship-driven business, this has meant in-person boardroom handshakes have been replaced by video conference calls, remote collaboration and potentially less travel in the future.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also accelerated digital transformation, and deal-makers have embraced digital tools to help them execute effectively.</p>
<p>The quickening pace of digital transformation is no longer about ensuring a competitive edge. Today, it’s also about business resilience. But what’s on the horizon, and how else will technology evolve to meet the needs of companies and deal-makers?</p>
<p>There are still many inefficiencies in managing M&amp;A, but technologies such as artificial intelligence, especially machine learning, are helping to make the process faster and easier.</p>

<p>Lew Cirne, New Relic’s founder and CEO, is stepping into the executive chairman role. He will be replaced by Bill Staples on July 1.</p>
<p>Cirne spent the last several years rebuilding the company’s platform and changing its revenue model, aiming for what he hopes is long-term success.</p>
<p>TechCrunch decided to dig into the company’s financials to see just what challenges Staples may face as he moves into the corner office. The resulting picture is one that shows a company doing hard work for a more future-aligned product map and business model, albeit one that may not generate the sort of near-term growth that gives Staples ample breathing room with public investors.</p>

<p>At long last, the Monday.com crew dropped an F-1 filing to go public in the United States. TechCrunch has long known that the company, which sells corporate productivity and communications software, has scaled north of $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The countdown to its IPO filing — an F-1, because the company is based in Israel, rather than the S-1s filed by domestic companies — has been ticking for several quarters.</p>
<p>The Exchange has been riffling through the document since it came out, and we’ve picked up on a few things to explore.</p>

<p>Until recently, integrating affordable voice-recognition software into an automobile was something from science fiction.</p>
<p>But last year, the percentage of vehicles offering in-car connected services reached 45%. By 2024, analysts predict cars with voice recognition will comprise 60% of the market.</p>
<p>Considering how much time many of us spend behind the wheel, there’s an infinite number of applications for the technology. For our latest Extra Crunch market map, we sized up the general market opportunity before creating a roster of major players and reaching out to investors to see where they’re placing bets.</p>

<p>Bright Machines is going public via a SPAC-led combination that will see the 3-year-old company merge with SCVX, raising gross cash proceeds of $435 million in the process.</p>
<p>After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Bright Machines news indicates that the great SPAC chill was not a deep freeze. And the transaction itself, in conjunction with the previously announced Desktop Metal blank-check deal, implies that there is space in the market for hardware startup liquidity via SPACs. Perhaps that will unlock more late-stage capital for hardware-focused upstarts.</p>
<p>We took a look at what Bright Machines does, and then the financial details that it shared as part of its news.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it takes 7-8 years for a successful startup to achieve an exit. But there’s a simple way to speed up the clock: Bring in one or more founders who have previous executive experience.</p>
<p>According to data gathered by Rob Olson, partner and head of data strategy at venture engine M13, startups that have two or more experienced founders tend to exit 33% faster and raise 34% less capital.</p>
<p>“Combined, these two improvements can nearly double an investor’s rate of return,” says Olson.</p>

<p>Digital health in the U.S. got a huge boost from COVID-19 as more people started consulting physicians and urgent care providers remotely in the midst of lockdowns. So much so that McKinsey estimates that up to $250 billion of the current healthcare expenditure in the U.S. has the potential to be spent virtually.</p>
<p>The prominence of digital health is undoubtedly here to stay, but how it looks and feels from provider to provider is still a debate among sector startups.</p>
<p>But for providers who want to deliver care virtually across the country, it’s not as simple as adding a Zoom invite to an annual check-up. The process requires intention every step of the way — right from the clinicians delivering remote care to the choice of payment processor.</p>

<p>When a company chooses supervised learning, it needs to have a strategy that allows it to label data as quickly as it acquires it.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is currently the most practical approach for most ML challenges, but it<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> requires the crucial additional step of making raw data smart by labeling it.</span></p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The influence of a founder on their company’s culture cannot be overstated. Everything from their views on the product and business to how they think about people affects how their company’s employees will behave, and since behavior, in turn, informs culture, the consequences of a founder’s early decisions can be far-reaching.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising that Expensify has its own take on almost everything it does when you consider what its founder and CEO David Barrett learned early in his life: “Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.”</p>
<p>As we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">part 1 of this EC-1</a>, this led him to the revelation that it’s easier to figure things out for yourself than finding advice that applies to you. Eventually, these insights would inform how he would go about shaping Expensify.</p>

<p>Marqeta, long a darling of the fintech market though less well known than some companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature, filed to go public late last week</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Marqeta, it powers the payment card tech behind products that you use, like Square, a key customer and driver of the unicorn’s growth. Marqeta exhibits a number of fascinating fintech characteristics (majority revenue from interchange, a rabidly competitive market) that make it very interesting to unspool.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">When a founder has a work history that includes the name of the parent company of one of their key investors, you probably assume that was one of the first deals to come together. Not so with May Mobility and Toyota AI Ventures, which connected for the company’s second seed round after May went out and raised its original seed purely on the strength of its own ideas and proposed solutions.</p>
<p>That’s one of the many interesting things we learned from speaking to May Mobility co-founder and CEO Edwin Olson, as well as Chief Product Officer Nina Grooms Lee and Toyota AI Ventures founding partner Jim Adler on an episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>

<p>WalkMe is the second Israel-based technology company to file to go public this week: No-code startup Monday.com is also pursuing an American IPO.</p>
<p>WalkMe’s software provides visual overlays on websites that help users navigate the product in question. Per the company’s F-1 filing, other elements of its service that matter include its onboarding system, Workstation, or its “single interface to the applications within an enterprise and simplifies task completion through a natural language conversational interface and automation.” We’re including that last feature because it says “automation,” which, in the wake of the UiPath IPO, is a word worth watching. Investors are.</p>

<p>Squarespace&#8217;s reference price has been set at $50 per share.</p>
<p>We went over Squarespace’s recently disclosed Q2 and full-2021 guidance and asked how its expectations compare to its reference-price-defined pre-trading valuation. Then, we set some stakes in the ground regarding historical direct-listing results and what we might expect from the company as it adds a third set of data to our quiver.</p>
<p>Let’s get into the numbers!</p>

<p>Emeritus, which is part of the Eruditus group, announced this week that it plans to acquire iD Tech, a STEM education service for children. The acquisition, which has not yet closed, is estimated to be around $200 million and leaves iD Tech operating as an independent brand for now.</p>
<p>ID Tech brings a whole different set of customers to its umbrella: The startup offers courses for elementary through high-school students across the globe taught by college students in the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>Why? When will things be back on track? We have a few employees who are waiting for green cards, and a few F-1 visa holders who will be extending their OPT to STEM OPT.</strong></p>

<p>Electric vehicle company Arrival wants to break the current auto manufacturing model. Instead of one giant factory and an assembly line, Arrival’s commercial electric vans, buses and cars are robotically built in small, regional microfactories, of which the company wants to open 31 by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve something radically more efficient, you have to go deeper, into complex, high-level computational algorithms that are not normally used in consumer-facing products.</p>
<p>The London-based company, founded in 2015, joined the ranks of EV companies going public via SPAC, merging with blank-check company CIIG Merger Corp. in March. UPS has already ordered 10,000 of Arrival’s robotically engineered vans, and the company recently signed a deal with Uber to create purpose-built EVs for ride-hail drivers.</p>
<p>Arrival founder Denis Sverdlov has been at the intersection of technological advancement and societal change before.</p>

<p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) spreads faster than wildfire and often overwhelms rational decision-making.</p>
<p>In the VC community, investors look for lessons from disruptive startups they can use to identify other potential winners. But hype leads to bad decision-making, rushed due diligence and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>When and if those startups actually do well, “irrational FOMO takes over” because the initial assessment was based on bad information, says Victor Echevarria, a partner at Jackson Square Ventures. &#8220;Trends are addictive; to remain disciplined and avoid hype is to deny our innate instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s natural for investors to follow the crowd, but in the race to the bottom, FOMO can be high-octane fuel.</p>

<p>The Exchange explores Robinhood&#8217;s financial results using the lens of payment for order flow (PFOF) income, which the company said during a congressional hearing constitutes the majority of its revenues.</p>
<p>This particular revenue growth — or the lack thereof — is a good way to understand not only Robinhood’s own results but also its larger market. If Robinhood is seeing rapid growth and strong trading volumes, we can infer with some confidence that others in its space are enjoying a related, if not similar, level of interest.</p>
<p>For Public.com, eToro and others like Freetrade (as well as our own understanding), how Robinhood performed recently is key. So, let’s explore the data.</p>

<p>A little over a decade has passed since The Economist warned us that we would soon be drowning in data. The modern data stack has emerged as a proposed life-jacket for this data flood — spearheaded by Silicon Valley startups such as Snowflake, Databricks and Confluent.</p>
<p>Today, any entrepreneur can sign up for BigQuery or Snowflake and have a data solution that can scale with their business in a matter of hours. The emergence of cheap, flexible and scalable data storage solutions was largely a response to changing needs spurred by the massive explosion of data.</p>
<p>Currently, the world produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily (there are 18 zeros in a quintillion). The explosion of data continues in the roaring ‘20s, both in terms of generation and storage — the amount of stored data is expected to continue to double at least every four years. However, one integral part of modern data infrastructure still lacks solutions suitable for the Big Data era and its challenges: Monitoring of data quality and data validation.</p>

<h2>Investors help Procore build a decacorn valuation in public debut</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2155624" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155624" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2155624" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg" alt="Cranes of a construction site against blue sky" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1201812085.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2155624" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=the_burtons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the_burtons <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Watching construction tech software company Procore go public Thursday after pricing above its range makes the IPO slowdown look like the deceleration that wasn’t.</p>
<p>Investors quickly bid up the company’s value in trading, giving Procore a higher valuation than it might have anticipated, along with a boost of confidence for the IPO market in general.</p>
<p>Construction tech may not be as glamorous as space travel, but it’s a massive industry that’s fraught with inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Procore initially set an IPO range of $60 to $65 per share before pricing at $67 per share Wednesday night. Its debut was worth gross proceeds north of $600 million and a fully diluted valuation of $9.6 billion. As of early afternoon Thursday, shares were trading at a solid $85.25.</p>
<p>In light of Procore’s debut, TechCrunch is digging quickly into the company’s new valuation and its resulting revenue multiples.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.</p>
<p>Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges such as meeting HIPAA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits. But when COVID-19 began raging across the globe and people had to stay home, both the insurance and healthcare industries were forced to adapt.</p>
<p>Now that people see the benefits and conveniences of “dialing a doc” from the kitchen table, healthcare has changed forever.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Daily Crunch for May 21, 2021. Closing out the week, bitcoin dropped sharply today on (more?) news from China about possible restrictions on cryptocurrencies more broadly. Depending on your priors, the most recent news is purely FUD, or it’s indication that Bitcoin and friends are terrible inflation hedges. Pick your poison! Regardless, we have a grip of startup news to get to, so off we go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snap spends a half billion on AR: </strong>Yesterday’s news from consumer photo giant Snap didn’t stop with the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/snap-acquires-ar-startup-waveoptics-which-provides-tech-for-spectacles-for-over-500m/">plunking down $500 million for WaveOptics</a>, which we reported “makes the waveguides and projectors used in AR glasses.” That sure sounds like Snap gearing up for eventual mass production? Right?</li>
<li><strong>Startups heart farming:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/">TechCrunch covered a huge $65.5 million Series B</a> for Indonesian startup TaniHub Group today. Part of what it does is loan capital to farmers ahead of their harvests. In related news, ProducePay raised $43 million earlier this week to do something similar in Latin America. There’s notable startup activity, then, at the intersection of agtech and fintech.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile gaming is bigger than you thought:</strong> Did you know that former gaming darling Zynga is in the midst of a comeback? Mobile gaming, its core focus, had a huge 2020, leading to the company posting record Q1 results. Riding the same way is Jam City, another mobile gaming shop is going public. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/as-zynga-impresses-rival-mobile-gaming-shop-jam-city-looks-to-list-via-spac/">More here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>To round out the week, how about a few smaller venture capital rounds? We have a number from today that are well worth our time:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/rakuten-and-beyond-next-invest-1m-seed-funding-in-farm-to-table-startup-secai-marche/"><strong>Secai Marche raises $1.4M for farm-to-table food distribution</strong></a><strong>:</strong> We don’t cover enough Japanese startups, frankly, but here’s to doing better. Tokyo-based Secai Marche is building a B2B “logistics platform for farmers that sell to restaurants, hotels and other” food and beverage companies, and we think it’s neat. Rakuten and Beyond Next supplied the capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/"><strong>Mio raises $1M to bring social commerce to rural Vietnam</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Quickly growing e-commerce market Vietnam is seeing rising penetration in major cities. Mio wants to bring e-commerce to smaller cities and rural areas. Per our reporting, it is “building a reseller network and logistics infrastructure that can offer next-day delivery to Tier 2 and 3 cities.” Our present may be someone else’s future, so it’s swell to see startups bring the latest to more folks.</p>
<p>To round out our round coverage today, a slightly larger deal for a mental-health focused service:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/mental-health-app-wysa-raises-5-5m-for-emotionally-intelligent-ai/"><strong>Wysa raises $5.5M for AI-powered mental health</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This is at a minimum cool on paper. We’ll have to get some time with the service as it evolves through time, but TechCrunch reports that “Jo Aggarwal, the founder and CEO of Wysa, is hoping you’ll find it easier to confide in a robot. Or, put more specifically, &#8220;‘emotionally intelligent’ artificial intelligence.” I, for one, welcome our robot mental-health overlords. Jokes aside, there is a therapist shortage in the world, and if Wysa can help more folks handle their mental health better, we’re all for it.</p>
<h2>5 predictions for the future of e-commerce</h2>
<p>The United States is one of the world&#8217;s most advanced economies, but until quite recently, South Korea and China had much higher e-commerce penetration.</p>
<p>American consumers and companies are closing that gap. In 2016, the percentage of total retail spend where the goods were bought and sold online in the U.S. was about 8%. Today, that figure is closer to 17%.</p>
<p>Despite the last two decades of disruption, we&#8217;re still in the early days of e-commerce. But as more merchants of every size start making their goods and services available online, we&#8217;ve reached an inflection point.</p>
<p>In an exclusive report for Extra Crunch, Ethan Choi, a partner at Accel, offers five well-researched predictions about where e-commerce is heading in terms of D2C and the overall enablement landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re entering what we at Accel believe is &#8216;the golden age of D2C e-commerce,'&#8221; says Choi.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today we have to stretch the Big Tech portion of this newsletter to include entities even larger than the largest technology companies, namely governments.</p>
<p>The Indian government is mad at tech companies yet again. This time it’s Twitter’s turn. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/">Per TechCrunch</a>, New Delhi “has expressed strong objection to Twitter for classifying tweets by Indian politicians as ‘manipulated media,’ and separately asked social media firms to remove posts that refer to an ‘Indian variant’ of the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>A few thoughts here: One, Twitter is going to have to navigate an increasingly complicated global climate for free speech in general. And figure out how to handle governments&#8217; reactions to its decisions on labeling content. That’s going to be hard. And asking a social service to blanket-ban a particular phrase is going to be essentially impossible. After all, even in China, where banned phrases on social media are common, individuals have found <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-20/want-circumvent-chinas-great-firewall-learn-these-9-phrases-first">myriad ways around the restrictions</a>. So, good luck, Indian government.</p>
<p>On a related note, if you are interested in privacy more generally, what’s going on in the European Union regarding data protection <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/european-parliament-amps-up-pressure-on-eu-us-data-flows-and-gdpr-enforcement/">is fascinating</a>.</p>
<p>Moving back to the world of corporate news, Spotify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/spotify-brings-offline-listening-to-the-apple-watch-at-last/">finally bringing offline listening to the Apple Watch</a>. For runners, this is big news. Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> is hype about the update.</p>
<p>To close us out today, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/linkedin-is-the-reason-apple-made-the-m1-chip/">Equity podcast team has thoughts</a> on the growth in corporate “media” and what it means for unicorns and other large technology companies.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every company wants to be innovative, but innovation comes with its share of difficulties. One key challenge for early-stage companies that are disrupting a particular space or creating a new category is figuring out how to sell a unique product to customers who have never bought such a solution.</p>
<p>This is especially the case when a solution doesn’t have many reference points and its significance may not be obvious.</p>
<p>My view is simple — some buyers could use a walkthrough of the buying process. If you are building a singular product in a nascent market that necessitates forward-looking customers and want to drastically shorten sales cycles, I have a proposal: Create a buyer’s guide.</p>

<p>A buyer’s guide is essentially a prescriptive summary that provides an understandable overview of how a customer may buy your solution. What does your product actually do? Is it secure? How would you implement the technology? What does it replace, if anything? It should be short, simple and speak the customer’s language. It also acts as a sales-enabling tool. Sales teams, especially at smaller startups, can review the guide quarterly and analyze what is and isn’t working as the company goes to market.</p>
<p>Here is how to put together a buyer’s guide, including what to sort out before you type a single word.</p>
<h2>Know your audience</h2>
<p>From the start, it&#8217;s important to think about who the stakeholders are for your product’s buying cycle. One typical issue with early-stage startups is they meet with an enthusiastic buyer — a CIO, CTO or VP of product — but neglect to include the other stakeholders who should be part of the conversation. More importantly, a lot of companies don’t realize the impact of their product on a group or team that they would not typically sell to.</p>
<p>For example, target the security team as an early stakeholder, because they&#8217;re probably going to review your product. If the solution is focused toward, say, integration, then hone in on who would be owning the integration process on the buyer&#8217;s team.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling a martech solution, on a business level, you have to consider a finance business partner for marketing. Think about the problems your customers face and also how others in their company relate to them.</p>
