	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Building, scaling and launching new tools and products is the lifeblood of the technology sector. When we consider these concepts today, many think of Big Tech and flashy startups, known for their industry dominance or new technologies that impact our everyday lives. But long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for these innovations, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.</p>

			Long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for innovation, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As an industry, we’ve developed a notion that working in government, the place where the groundwork was laid for<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/personalized-assistant-that-learns"> the digital assistants we use every day</a>, is now far less appealing than working in the private sector. The immense salary differential is often cited as the overwhelming reason workers prefer to work in the private sphere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the hard truth is the private sector brings far more value than just higher compensation to employees. Look no further than the boom in the tech sector during the pandemic to understand why it’s so attractive. A company like Zoom, already established and successful in its own right for years, found itself in a situation where it had to<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"> serve an exponentially growing and diverse user base</a> in a short period of time. It quickly confronted a slew of infrastructure and user experience pivots on its way to becoming a staple of work-from-home culture &#8212; and succeeded.</p>
<p>That innate ability to work fast to deliver for consumers and innovate at what feels like a moment’s notice is what really draws talent. Compare that to the government’s tech environment, where decreased funding and partisan oversight slow the pace of work, or, worse, can get in the way of exploring or implementing new ideas entirely.</p>
<p>One look (literally, see our graph below) at the trends around R&amp;D spending in the private and government sectors also paints a clear picture of where future innovations will come from if we don’t change the equation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133385" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133385" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2133385 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?w=680" alt="Chart of Facebook R&amp;D spending vs. DARPA annual budget" width="680" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133385" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Josh Mendelsohn/Hangar</p></div></p>
<p>Look no further than the U.S. government’s own (now defunct) Office of Technology Assessment. The agency aimed to provide a thorough analysis of burgeoning issues in science and technology, exposing many public services to a new age of innovation and implementation. Amid a period of downsizing by a newly Republican-led Congress, the OTA was defunded in 1995 with a peak annual budget of just $35.1 million (adjusted for 2019 dollars). The authoritative body on the importance of technology to the government was deemed duplicative and unnecessary. Despite<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/12/18/congress-should-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment-heres-how-to-do-it/"> numerous calls for its reinstatement</a>, it has since remained shuttered.</p>
<p>Despite dwindling public sector investment and lackluster political action, the problems that technology is poised to help solve haven’t gone away or even eased up.</p>
<p>From the COVID pandemic to worsening natural disasters and growing societal inequities, public leaders have a responsibility to solve the pressing issues we face today. That responsibility should breed a desire to continuously iterate for the sake of constituents and quality of life, much in the same way private tech caters to the product, user and bottom line.</p>
<p>My own experiences in government have shaped my career and approach to building new technologies more than my time in Silicon Valley. There are plenty of tangible parallels to the private sector that can attract driven and passionate tech workers, but the responsibility of giving government work realistic consideration doesn’t just fall at the feet of talent. The governments that we depend on must invest more capital and pay closer attention to the tech community.</p>
<p>Tech workers want an environment where they can thrive and get to see their work in action, whoever the end user may be. They don’t want to feel hamstrung by the<a href="https://time.com/longform/america-innovation/"> threat of decreased funding</a> or the red tape that comes as a result of government partisanship. Replicating the unimpeded focus of Silicon Valley’s brightest examples is a must if we’re serious about drawing talented individuals into government or public-sector-focused work.</p>
<p>A great example of these ideas in action is one of the most beloved government agencies, NASA. Its continued funding has produced technologies developed for space exploration that are now<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/08/space-race-inventions-we-use-every-day-were-created-for-space-exploration/39580591/"> commonplace</a> in our lives, such as scratch-resistant lenses, memory foam and water filters. These use cases came much later on, only after millions of dollars were invested without knowing what would result.</p>
<p>NASA has continued to bolster its ability to stay nimble and evolve at a rapid pace by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/30/how-nasa-is-evolving-through-partnerships-with-private-space-companies.html"> partnering with private companies</a>. For talent in the tech sphere, the ability to leverage outside resources in this way, without compromising the product or work, is a boon for ideation and iteration.</p>
<p>One can also point to the agency when considering the importance of keeping technology research and innovation as apolitical as possible. It’s one of the few widely known public entities to prosper on the back of<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-nasa-authorization-bill-clears-senate"> bipartisan support</a>. Unfortunately, politicians typically do all of us a disservice, particularly tech workers in government, when they too closely connect themselves or their parties to a particular program or platform. It hinders innovation &#8212; and the ensuing mudslinging can detract from talented individuals jumping into government service.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of extremely capable tech workers who want to help solve the biggest issues facing society. Will we give them the legitimate space and opportunity to conquer those problems? There’s been some indication that we can. These ambitious and forward-looking efforts matter today more than ever and show all of us in the tech ecosystem that there’s a place in government for tech talent to grow and flourish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://consensys.net/">ConsenSys</a>, a key player in crypto and a major proponent of the Ethereum blockchain, has raised a $65 million funding round from J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and UBS AG, as well as major blockchain companies Protocol Labs, the Maker Foundation, Fenbushi, The LAO and Alameda Research. Additional investors include CMT Digital and the Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund. As well as fiat, several funds invested with Ethereum-based stablecoins, DAI and USDC, as consideration.</p>
<p>Sources told TechCrunch that this is an unpriced round because of the valuation risk, and the funding instrument is “full”, so the round is being closed now.</p>
<p>The fundraise looks like a highly strategic one, based around the idea that traditional institutions will need visibility into the increasingly influential world of ‘decentralized finance’ (DeFi) and the Web3 applications being developed on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement on the fundraise, ConsenSys said it has been through a “period of strategic evolution and growth”, but most outside observers would agree that this is that’s something of an understatement.</p>
<p>After a period of quite a lot of ‘creative disruption’ to put it mildly (at one point a couple of years ago, ConsenSys seemed to have everything from a VC fund, to an accelerator, to multiple startups under its wing), the company has restructured to form two main arms: ConsenSys, the core software business; and ConsenSys Mesh, the investment arm, incubator, and portfolio. It also acquired the Quorum product from J.P. Morgan which has given it a deeper bench into the enterprise blockchain ecosystem. This means it now has a very key product suite for the Etherum platform, including products such as Codefi, Diligence, Infura, MetaMask, Truffle, and Quorum.</p>
<p>This suite allows it to serve both public and private permissioned blockchain networks. It can also support Layer 2 Ethereum networks, as well as facilitate access to adjacent protocols like IPFS, Filecoin, and others. ConsenSys is also a major contributor to the Ethereum 2.0 project, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fundraise, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and co-founder, Ethreum said in a statement: “When we set out to raise a round, it was important to us to patiently construct a diverse cap table, consistent with our belief that similar to how the web developed, the whole economy would join the revolutionaries on a next-generation protocol. ConsenSys’ software stack represents access to a new automated objective trust foundation enabled by decentralized protocols like Ethereum. We are proud to partner with preeminent financial firms alongside leading crypto companies to further converge the centralized and decentralized financial domains at this particularly exciting time of growth for ConsenSys and the entire industry.”</p>
<p>With financial institutions able to see, ‘in public’ DeFi happening on Ethereuem, because of the public chain, they can see how much of the financial system is gradually starting to merge with the blockchain world. So it&#8217;s becoming clearer what attracts these major institutions.</p>
<p>Mike Dargan, Head of Group Technology at UBS said: “Our investment in ConsenSys adds proven expertise in distributed ledger technology to our UBS Next portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>For MasterCard this appears to be not just a pure investment &#8211; Consensys has been working with it on a private permissioned network.</p>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships at Mastercard said: “Enterprise Ethereum is a key infrastructure on which we and our partners are building payment and non-payment applications to power the future of commerce… Our investment and partnership with ConsenSys helps us bring secure and performant Enterprise Ethereum capabilities to our customers.”</p>
<p>Colleen Sullivan, Co-Founder and CEO of CMT Digital said: “ConsenSys is the pioneer in bridging the gaps across traditional finance, centralized crypto, and DeFi, and more broadly, between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. We are proud to participate in this funding round as the ConsenSys team continues to pave the way for global users  — retail and institutional — to easily access the crypto ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands that the fundraise was started around the time of the Quorum acquisition, last June. The $65 million round is in majority fiat currency as opposed to cryptocurrency and is an adjunct to the round done with JP Morgan last summer.</p>
<p>The presence of significant crypto players such as Maker Protocol Labs shows the significance of the fund-raise, beyond the simple transaction.  The announcement also comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO, which makes for interesting timing.</p>
<p>ConsenSys’ products have become highly significant in the world where developers, enterprises, and consumers meet blockchain and crypto. In its statement, the company claims MetaMask now has over three million monthly active users across mobile and desktop, a 3x increase in the last five or six months, it says. This is roughly the same amount of monthly active customers as Coinbase.</p>
<p>The ConsenSys announcement comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO. While Coinbase is acting as an exchange to turn fiat into crypto and vice versa, it has also been getting into DeFi of late. Where there are also resemblances with ConsenSys, is that Coinbase, with 3 million users, is used as a wallet, and MetMask, which also has 3 million users, can also be used as a wallet. The comparison ends there, but it’s certainly interesting, given Coinbase’s $100 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As Jeremy Millar, Chief Development Officer, told me: “Coinbase has pioneered an exchange, in one of the world&#8217;s was regulated financial markets, the US. And it has helped drive significant interest in the space.  We enjoy a very positive relationship with Coinbase, trying to further enable the ecosystem and adoption of the technology.”</p>
<p>The background to this raise is that a lot of early-stage blockchain and crypto companies have been raising a lot of money recently, but much of this has been through crypto investment firms. Only a handful of Silicon Valley VCs are backing blockchain, such as Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this announcement is that these incumbent financial giants are not only taking an interest, but working alongside ConsenSys to both invest and build products on Ethereum.</p>
<p>It’s ConsenSys’ view that every payment service provider, banks will need this financial infrastructure in the  future, especially for DeFI.</p>
<p>Given there is roughly $43 billion collateralized in DeFi, it&#8217;s increasingly the case that major investors are involved, and there are increasingly higher returns than traditional yield and bond or bond yields.</p>
<p>The moves by Central Banks into digital currencies is also forcing companies and governments to realize digital currency, and the ‘blockchain rails’ on which it runs, is here to stay. This is what is suggested by the Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund’s (a Shenzhen / Hong Kong joint partnership) decision to get involved.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this story is that ConsenSys is sitting on some extremely powerful products. Consensys has six products that serve three different types of people.</p>
<p>Service developers who are building on Ethereum are using Truffle to develop smart contracts. Users joining the NFT hype are using MetaMask underneath it all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oWAC94df6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/">ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/embed/#?secret=oWAC94df6j" data-secret="oWAC94df6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The MetaMask wallet allows users to swap one token for another. This has proved quite lucrative for ConsenSys, which says it has resulted in  $1.8 billion in volume in decentralized exchange use. ConsenSys takes a 0.875 percent cut on every swap that it serves.</p>
<p>And institutions are using Consensys’ products. The company says more than 150,000 developers use Infura’s APIs, and 4.5 million developers create and deploy smart contracts using Truffle, while its Protocols group — developer of Hyperledger Besu and ConsenSys Quorum — are building Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for six central banks, says Consensys.</p>
<p>Consensys is also making hay with the NFT boom. Developers are using Consensys products for the nodes and infrastructure on Ethereum which stores the NFT files.</p>
<p>Consensys is also riding two waves. One is the developer eave and the other is the financial system wave.</p>
<p>As a spokesperson said: “Where the interest in money and invention started happening was on public networks like Ethereum. So we really believe that these are converging and they will continue to, and every one of our products offers public main net compatibility because we think this is the future.”</p>
<p>Millar added: “If we want to help the world adopt the technology we need to meet it at its adoption point, which for many large enterprises means inside the firewall first. But similarly, we think, just like the public Internet, the real value &#8211;  the disruptive value &#8211; changes the ability to do this on a broader permissionless basis, especially when you have sufficient privacy and authentication available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning officially announced the limited U.S. release of its first hardware device, the oddly named <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a>, aimed at Spotify Premium subscribers. The new device &#8212; which Spotify is surprisingly offering for free plus shipping &#8212; has evolved substantially from the version <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">that first began testing in 2019</a>. This upgraded model has a touchscreen, a big, grippable knob for navigation, voice control features, and four preset buttons at the top for favorite music, podcasts or playlists, similar to Spotify on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The company explained its interest in Car Thing is about solving a need for customers who want a &#8220;more seamless&#8221; and personalized in-car listening experience. Although many cars today support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, Spotify points out that the average age of a car in the U.S. is actually 11 years old and the average lifetime of cars is 18 years. That means there are still a large number of cars on the road that don&#8217;t support modern, in-car infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Car Thing is being introduced to serve this market &#8212; and likely, to give Spotify the opportunity to explore future business models where it has a more direct relationship with customers inside the vehicle, though the company isn&#8217;t speaking to its longer-term ambitions at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The new Car Thing itself is a lightweight (3.4 oz.), thin (4.6&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 0.7&#8243;) music and podcast player that offers a combination of voice control, knobs, buttons, and a touchscreen display for navigating its menus and selecting the media you want to hear. You can choose to use set up the device to work via Bluetooth or an AUX or USB cable, depending on how you usually connect your phone to your car stereo to play music.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also able to mount Car Thing to your dash in a variety of ways as the device ships with three different types of dash and vent mounts to choose from, along with a car charger and USB-C cable.</p>

<p>At launch, Car Thing will walk you through a quick tour where it explains how to get started. The user interface recalls the Spotify mobile app, so it isn&#8217;t difficult to get used to for first-time users. Here, you can tap, swipe and use your voice to interact with the screen. The knob lets you quickly move through your choices &#8212; an experience that may be more comfortable to those used to interacting with knobs on their car&#8217;s built-in stereo.</p>
<p>Across the top of the device are four preset buttons that let you save your favorite content for easy access. By default, these are configured with your Liked Songs and Spotify&#8217;s Daily Drive and Morning Commute playlists, with the last preset empty. Many users may just keep these selections, but you can change them at any time, Spotify says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137347" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137347" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137347" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png 3708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=768,360 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=1536,720 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=2048,960 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-3.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137347" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Ahead of the device&#8217;s launch, Spotify quietly began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/spotify-stays-quiet-about-launch-of-its-voice-command-hey-spotify-on-mobile/">rolling out support for its &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command</a>, which Car Thing leverages, too. This lets you speak your requests directly to Spotify, by asking for a song, album, artist, playlist, station or podcast, which Car Thing &#8220;hears&#8221; by way of its four microphones at the top. (Four, because Spotify wants Car Thing to respond even if you&#8217;re blasting your music or have the windows down, which creates additional noise.)</p>
<p>On mobile devices, using &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; is an opt-in option that you can shut off from the app&#8217;s settings. But Car Thing represents a smarter, not to mention more safety-focused, use case for voice control. Instead of fiddling with the screen or knobs, you can speak your commands &#8212; or allow your kids to shout out their options from the backseat, perhaps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137357" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137357" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137357" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png" alt="" width="1024" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=1536,586 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137357" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/"> policy regarding its use of voice data</a> explains the company will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you, and may use the data to improve the feature over time. The company told us that beyond the voice data, the device isn&#8217;t collecting any more information that it does already in the mobile app. Still, Car Thing does give Spotify a more direct window into what people listen to during commutes and longer road trips, which could inform its future products, programmed playlists and other features.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a typical year, Americans spend over 70 billion hours in their cars and there are 250 million cars on America&#8217;s roads today,&#8221; noted Spotify&#8217;s Head of Global Culture and Trends, Shanon Cook. &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of time spent on the road. So what you do and what you listen to, to help you get through those hours in the car really matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Car Thing is being made available during this limited release period for free, as selected users will just pay the cost of shipping &#8212; a choice Spotify made because Car Thing is still somewhat experimental.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Spotify&#8217;s first hardware, and we obviously want to get things right,&#8221; said Spotify&#8217;s Head of Hardware Products, Andreas Cedborg. &#8220;And we want to learn quite a lot here in the beginning, so it&#8217;s a natural way for us to start,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify says the current retail price for the device is $80. It doesn&#8217;t know if or when it will begin to retail the device, however. But it can roll out updates to its software so at least the device won&#8217;t be immediately obsolete, if Spotify decides to go in a different direction one day.</p>
<p>Despite Spotify&#8217;s exploration into hardware, the company stressed it doesn&#8217;t aim to be a hardware company. If anything, it&#8217;s seems more likely that Spotify is toying with the idea of becoming the next SiriusXM by way of a specialized in-car experience &#8212; although one that&#8217;s even more of an add-on than SiriusXM is as you physically have to attach the thing &#8212; the Car Thing &#8212; to your dash. Longer-term, it&#8217;s not clear it makes much sense to develop a Car Thing product line as cars get smarter every year and infotainment systems become more standard.</p>
<p>Car Thing will only be offered on an invite-only basis via <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">carthing.spotify.com</a> to U.S. Spotify Premium subscribers with a smartphone. The company declined to say how many units would be shipped, so you&#8217;ll probably want to jump on the waitlist sooner rather than later if such a device interests you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are you 100% sure that your children are brushing their teeth properly? A New York-based startup called <a href="https://www.willo.com">Willo</a> has been working for several years on a device that should transform the tooth-brushing experience for children.</p>
<p>Willo isn’t a new toothbrush — electric or not. It’s an oral care device that doesn’t look like a toothbrush at all. The startup has worked with dental professionals to start from scratch with oral care in mind.</p>
<p>The device can be quite intimidating when you don’t see it in action as it takes quite a bit of shelf space and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do. But when you see it in action, it looks easier than expected. Willo specifically targets children because they tend to struggle to reach every tooth and brush properly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQGJAOzQVJo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Kids are supposed to grab the handle and put the mouthpiece in their mouth. They can start brushing by pressing the button and that’s it. They don’t have to do anything else. The silicone-based mouthpiece also features soft bristles. It starts vibrating in your kid’s mouth when they press the button.</p>
<p>The handle is connected to a bigger home station that contains a water tank with a special rinse liquid. Kids don’t have to use toothpaste and don’t have to rinse their mouth. Everything is handled by the device.</p>
<p>Finally, Willo is a connected device, which means that parents can track oral care in a mobile app. You can also set up multiple users — your kids will have to swap the mouthpiece before using the device.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137669" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137669" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" class="size-full wp-image-2137669" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5N8A9590-yes.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137669" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Willo</p></div></p>
<p>If you’re thinking about buying a device for your children, Willo costs $199. You then have to pay $13 per month to receive rinse pods as well as new mouthpieces that always fit.</p>
<p>While the product is going live today, the startup has already tested it with real families. These children rated the device 4.73/5 and parents gave an NPS of 70+. They’ve all kept using Willo after the testing phase.</p>
<p>Behind this product, there’s a team of 33 people in France and the U.S. They have filed over 50 patents over the past 7 years — 30 of them have been granted so far. The company has raised $17 million in total funding from Kleiner Perkins, Bpifrance and Matt Rogers’ fund Incite.</p>
<p>It’s true that the concept of a toothbrush hasn’t changed at all. Making a device that changes the way you brush your teeth is an ambitious bet. But it’s clear that the startup has made a lot of efforts to tackle this challenge. Now let’s see if they manage to convince parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://meroxa.com/">Meroxa</a>, a startup that makes it easier for businesses to build the data pipelines to power both their analytics and operational workflows, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Drive Capital. Existing investors Root, Amplify and Hustle Fund also participated in this round, which together with the company&#8217;s previously undisclosed $4.2 million seed round now brings total funding in the company to $19.2 million.</p>
<p>The promise of Meroxa is that can use a single platform for their various data needs and won&#8217;t need a team of experts to build their infrastructure and then manage it. At its core, Meroxa provides a single Software-as-a-Service solution that connects relational databases to data warehouses and then helps businesses operationalize that data.</p>

<p>&#8220;The interesting thing is that we are focusing squarely on relational and NoSQL databases into data warehouse,&#8221; Meroxa co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devarispbrown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://links91.mixmaxusercontent.com/uZQSMtfp48vTf5ZbA/l/SgV2zDZ5qqX8hm6Wn?messageId%3DR0PKO0lHL11Oy9F7k%26rn%3D%26re%3DgIt92Yug2YuVncjh2YlRHQjlmclRWZyZmI%26sc%3Dfalse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618356851469000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuYNMbxt1-Fd_7f_mLmHhLVtHJEA">DeVaris Brown</a> told me. &#8220;Honestly, people come to us as a real-time FiveTran or real-time data warehouse sink. Because, you know, the industry has moved to this [extract, load, transform] format. But the beautiful part about us is, because we do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture">change data capture</a>, we get that granular data as it happens.&#8221; And businesses want this very granular data to be reflected inside of their data warehouses, Brown noted, but he also stressed that Meroxa can expose this stream of data as an API endpoint or point it to a Webhook.</p>
<p>The company is able to do this because its core architecture is somewhat different from other data pipeline and integration services that, at first glance, seem to offer a similar solution. Because of this, users can use the service to connect different tools to their data warehouse but also build real-time tools on top of these data streams.</p>

<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t a point-to-point solution,&#8221; Meroxa co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahamidi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://links95.mixmaxusercontent.com/uZQSMtfp48vTf5ZbA/l/BVqT3wBs8wVQG6E7N?messageId%3DR0PKO0lHL11Oy9F7k%26rn%3D%26re%3DgIt92Yug2YuVncjh2YlRHQjlmclRWZyZmI%26sc%3Dfalse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618356851469000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxO0-uAY3XP0yMRk9eoYQiRAN-SA">Ali Hamidi </a>explained. &#8220;When you set up the connection, you aren&#8217;t taking data from Postgres and <em>only</em> putting it into Snowflake. What&#8217;s really happening is that it&#8217;s going into our intermediate stream. Once it&#8217;s in that stream, you can then start hanging off connectors and say, &#8216;Okay, well, I also want to peek into the stream, I want to transfer my data, I want to filter out some things, I want to put it into S3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of this, users can use the service to connect different tools to their data warehouse but also build real-time tools to utilize the real-time data stream. With this flexibility, Hamidi noted, a lot of the company&#8217;s customers start with a pretty standard use case and then quickly expand into other areas as well.</p>
<p>Brown and Hamidi met during their time at Heroku, where Brown was a director of product management and Hamidi a lead software engineer. But while Heroku made it very easy for developers to publish their web apps, there wasn&#8217;t anything comparable in the highly fragmented database space. The team acknowledges that there are a lot of tools that aim to solve these data problems, but few of them focus on the user experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137512" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png" alt="" width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png 1351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meroxa</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk to customers now, it&#8217;s still very much an unsolved problem,&#8221; Hamidi said. &#8220;It seems kind of insane to me that this is such a common thing and there is no &#8216;oh, of course you use this tool because it addresses all my problems.&#8217; And so the angle that we&#8217;re taking is that we see user experience not as a nice-to-have, it&#8217;s really an enabler, it is something that enables a software engineer or someone who isn&#8217;t a data engineer with 10 years of experience in wrangling Kafka and Postgres and all these things. [&#8230;] That&#8217;s a transformative kind of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Meroxa uses a lot of open-source tools but the company has also committed to open-sourcing everything in its data plane as well. &#8220;This has multiple wins for us, but one of the biggest incentives is in terms of the customer, we&#8217;re really committed to having our agenda aligned. Because if we don&#8217;t do well, we don&#8217;t serve the customer. If we do a crappy job, they can just keep all of those components and run it themselves,&#8221; Hamidi explained.</p>
<p>Today, Meroxa, which the team founded in early 2020, has over 24 employees (and is 100% remote). &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really think we’re building one of the most talented and most inclusive teams possible,&#8221; Brown told me. &#8220;Inclusion and diversity are very, very high on our radar. Our team is 50% black and brown. Over 40% are women. Our management team is 90% underrepresented. So not only are we building a great product, we&#8217;re building a great company, we&#8217;re building a great business.&#8221;  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is understandably positioning the latest additions to its Surface line as productivity devices. Laptop sales, in particular, have jumped amid the pandemic, as many have scrambled to shift to a work from home setting. With that in mind, the latest version of the Surface Laptop is far and away the headline item amid a new batch of devices.</p>
<p>The Surface Laptop 4 doesn’t seem to mark a massive upgrade to the line, arriving about a year and half after the previous model. Of course, the product has been one of the better received among the company’s proprietary hardware offerings, swapping the more creator-focused convertible models for a more straightforward approach. Sometimes the classics are classics for a reason.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Available with either a 13.5- or 15-inch touchscreen, the new Laptop sports either an 11th Gen Intel Core or AMD Ryzen processor. The system’s lowest configuration will run $999, but Microsoft has yet to break down the pricing from there. The company is promising improved performance and increased battery life, over the 11.5 posted hours on the Laptop 3. The below video puts the new time at &#8220;up to 19 hours,&#8221; which big if true &#8212; and nice for when we all start traveling again.</p>

<p>The system builds on its predecessor’s HD webcam with the addition of improved low-light capabilities. That’s paired with a studio mic array. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but it’s nice to see companies paying attention to this stuff in the age of COVID-19, when a concerning percentage of our interpersonal communication occurs via webcam.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbImHy6X8eM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The design language is similar to earlier versions, though the company has swapped in a new Ice Blue color option. Microsoft is keeping that proprietary charging port around (fast charging will get you up to 80% in an hour). That&#8217;s coupled with USB A and C. There are a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers on board and the touchscreen works with the Surface Pen.</p>
<p>The Laptop is available for preorder today in the U.S., Canada and Japan, and starts shipping on April 15. The 13.5-inch AMD Ryzen with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage runs $999. On the high end, the 15-inch Intel Core i7 with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is $2,399 (plus another $100 if you want to upgrade Windows 10 Home to Pro). The company is tossing in Surface Earbuds for early preorders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new Surface Laptop was the marquee arrival in today’s Microsoft announcement, but boy howdy, the company also dropped a whole bunch of new accessories. It’s a pretty broad range of new devices, including some small updates to existing products and entirely new entries. But there’s one clear through line across them all: Teams.</p>
<p>Microsoft is, after all, a software company at heart. That’s always fueled the company’s hardware products. So it’s really not a major surprise that its productivity software is the driving force here. After all, this is the company that was pushing Office integration on its earbuds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Matter of fact, the company’s actually debuting a slight upgrade to its Surface Headphone line. The Headphones 2+ for Business. The big distinction here is the addition on-ear Teams control. The other additions to the well-received over-ear headphones are fairly minor (hence the telling “2+” name), including improved remote calling. They also run a bit of a premium at $299 to the Headphone 2’s $250. They’re shipping later this month.</p>

<p>The remainder of the new products fall under the “Modern” line, which currently also includes the Modern Mouse. Joining the Headphones are the Microsoft Modern USB and Wireless Headsets. Here the products get a dedicated Teams button for joining calls on MS’ platform. They’ll ship in June for $50 and $100, respectively.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also adding a 1080p webcam to the mix. The Modern Webcam has a 78-degree field of view and can shoot in HDR. There’s a privacy shutter on board, as well as software settings for things like auto white balance and facial retouching, if you’re so inclined. And yes, Teams certification. Can’t help but think this would have been a big hit this time last year, but for many working from home will be the new normal, going forward. That will ship in June for a reasonable $70.</p>

<p>The oddest addition is probably the Microsoft Modern USB-C Speaker. With Cortana seemingly dead in the water, Teams is once again the driving force here. It’s a desktop speaker with dual microphones designed for Teams calls and some light music listening. That one is also arriving in June, priced at $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku today is unveiling new hardware and software, including the latest version of its Roku OS media software, Roku OS 10, which expands support for AirPlay 2 and Apple&#8217;s HomeKit, and adds a variety of new features and optimizations focused on helping users get to content and stream faster. It&#8217;s also introducing its latest 4K player, the Roku Express 4K+; an updated version of its combo media player and soundbar; and an upgraded voice remote with a rechargeable battery and hands-free voice support via the &#8220;Hey Roku&#8221; command.</p>
<p>Of the three new devices, the Roku Voice Remote Pro ($29.99) may actually be the more interesting addition as it pushes Roku into the &#8220;smart speaker&#8221; space, so to speak &#8212; except in this case, the &#8220;speaker&#8221; is a TV remote equipped with a mid-field microphone that&#8217;s always listening for the &#8220;Hey Roku&#8221; command. From a practical standpoint, that means you can leave the remote laying on your coffee table and instead speak <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694">commands</a> like &#8220;Hey Roku, launch Netflix&#8221; or &#8220;search for free movies,&#8221; or &#8220;show me comedies,&#8221; or whatever else it is you want to watch &#8212; without having to first pick up the device and press the push-to-talk voice search button.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This feature, of course, also comes with concerns. Consumers may be wary of bringing more voice assistants into their home, after it was discovered that tech giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">Apple</a> had initially dropped the ball on respecting consumer privacy when it came to how users&#8217; voice data was being stored and utilized. Though they&#8217;ve all made changes since, the experience may have left its mark on consumers&#8217; minds.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Roku says it will retain some of the audio recordings it receives for technical support and to improve the quality of its service, much like the others in the market. And users can opt out of that data collection (via Roku.com/account/voice). The company notes that voice recordings are disassociated from the consumer&#8217;s account within 30 days, and it only allows access to Roku employees, not contractor workforces.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, the remote offers a mute button for the microphone if you want to upgrade for its other features, and not use the hands-free listening.</p>
<p>The other features still make for a worthwhile upgrade, however, as this is Roku&#8217;s first remote with a rechargeable battery, for example. The device charges via a micro-USB cable, which is more environmentally friendly. It also offers preset buttons with access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and, for the first time, Apple TV+. And it offers a lost remote finder feature (which works via voice, too); private listening via the built-in headphone jack; a push-to-talk voice button if you don&#8217;t want hands-free; and two personal shortcuts for favorite voice commands.</p>
<p>The voice remote is on sale today via Roku&#8217;s website and will be available in retail stores in May.</p>

<p>Another new device announced today is the Roku Express 4K+ ($39.99) which will replace the older Roku Premiere.</p>
<p>This digital media player is targeted towards first-time streamers and secondary TVs &#8212; which are now more often becoming 4K TVs, but where consumers don&#8217;t need the full specs of Roku&#8217;s top-of-the-line players. The Express 4K+ has a faster processor than the Premiere and more storage, as well as support for dual-band Wi-Fi. It works with third-party micro-USB and Ethernet adapters, which is a plus as hardwiring your device was previously a feature only available on the pricier Roku Ultra.</p>
<p>The device also brings HDR 10+ to the Roku platform for the first time, though this support will soon make its way to the Roku Ultra through the upcoming Roku OS 10 software update. It additionally supports HD, 4K, HDR, and HDR 10 and ships with a standard voice remote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137104" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137104" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137104" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137104" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>The device goes on sale in the U.S. in mid-May online and in retail stores. Walmart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/roku-to-launch-low-cost-versions-of-its-soundbar-and-subwoofer-under-walmarts-onn-brand/">a Roku partner</a>, will have an exclusive version of the Roku Express 4K+ called Roku Express 4K ($35) which offers a better value by dropping the voice remote for the basic one.</p>
<p>Along with the launch of the media player and remote, Roku is updating its Roku Smart Soundbar in mid-May. The device is being rebranded to the Roku Streambar Pro ($179.99), and will feature both 4K streaming and cinematic sound, but now ships with the same voice remote that comes with the Ultra, which means it supports private listening on headphones. And it adds support for a new Roku OS 10 feature called Virtual Surround, which aims to simulate a surround sound setup for Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Streambar Pro owners, who don&#8217;t have another set of speakers to offer true surround sound.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137112" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137112" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137112" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="389" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?resize=768,439 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Streambar-Pro-with-packaging.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137112" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to Virtual Surround and HDR 10+ support, Roku latest OS will roll out Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support to more HD devices, including the Roku Express and some HD Roku TVs.</p>
<p>It will also add a customizable Live TV Channel Guide with favorites; automatic Wi-Fi network detection during setup (and it tells you which of your multiple channels is better to use); and an &#8220;instant resume&#8221; feature which takes you back to where you left off when you relaunch a supported channel.</p>
<p>At launch, there are over 15 channels that support &#8220;instant resume,&#8221; including AT&amp;T TV, FilmRise, FOX Business Network, FOX News Channel, Fubo Sports Network, HappyKids TV, Plex.tv, STARZ, and The Roku Channel.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137108" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137108" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137108" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Live-TV-Channel-Guide.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137108" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>For gamers, a new automatic game console configuration feature, which automatically configures preferred settings, could be useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the capabilities of the console and the TV, it can also mean turning on things like HDR gaming, variable refresh rates, high frame rate gaming like 120Hz, or maybe THX Certified Game Mode. So, without having to go through complex menus, a user just plugs in their console, and we know exactly how to give them the best experience on the game side,&#8221; noted Roku VP of Retail Product Strategy, Mark Ely. The feature works with both Xbox and PlayStation consoles and will also update the input on the Home Screen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137107" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137107" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137107" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Automatic-game-console-configuration.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>Roku OS 10 is rolling out to select Roku players now and is expected to roll out to all supported streaming players, including the all-new Roku Express 4K+ and Roku Streambar Pro, and all Roku TV models in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The new devices and software arrive after a year of increased at-home streaming due to the coronavirus pandemic, which forced users indoors and under lockdowns. Roku in Q4 2020 reported 51.2 million active accounts, <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-tops-50-million-active-accounts-2020-1234879467/">up 39% for the year</a>, and 58.7 billion streaming hours, while its free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, saw roughly 200% growth between just June and August 2020 when it added live linear viewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business and streaming, in general, continues to grow and accelerate just because there&#8217;s such a shift from people that are getting rid of cable and moving over to streaming. And we saw, of course, with theater shutdowns, more people streaming first-run movies at home,&#8221; Ely noted. &#8220;So, streaming hours increased, and the volume of our products and the popularity of streaming devices increased, as well,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s continued momentum, however, cannot rely on pandemic impacts alone. Amazon remains a top competitor, and just rolled out its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-redesigned-fire-tv-interface-rollout-more-devices-110003449.html">updated Fire TV interface months ago</a>. There are also now rumors that Apple is planning an updated player of its own, with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/12/bloomberg-apple-developing-connected-tv-box-with-integrated-speaker-and-facetime-camera/">an Apple TV-HomePod combo of sorts</a>, similar to the existing Roku Streambar. That will leave Roku with plenty of competition to keep it on its toes for months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is giving its Kids’ profiles a revamp, the company announced today. While adults’ profiles are personalized with horizontal rows of recommendations that appear as they scroll down, the Kids profiles’ redesign is more visual in nature. When kids now log in to their account on a TV, they’ll be greeted with their favorite titles and characters right at the top of the screen, Netflix says.</p>
<p>Previously, the layout for the Kids profile was similar to an adult’s, with rows that showed Trending shows and other suggestions from Netflix’s library (See below). Now, the top row will feature the kid’s most-watched content &#8212; and for early readers, the characters will help direct kids to the show they want to watch.</p>

<p>To customize this row for each user, Netflix uses information about what was watched to improve its <a href="http://www.netflix.com/recommendations">recommendations.</a> It notes that the favorite shows featured at the top of the screen will come from the full Netflix catalog, not just its original programming. For the title to appear in their row, a child must watch a show at least once, Netflix says. When selected, the background updates to reflect the chosen show, as well.</p>
<p>Younger kids often navigate Netflix visually. Even toddlers can be found using iPads or TV remotes, moving through Netflix like a pro, at times. And during the COVID era where parents were stuck at home trying to both entertain their little kids while homeschooling older ones and somehow also finding time to work, it makes sense to update one of the most popular “TV babysitter” apps to make it something that younger children could use on their own without parental assistance. The need to serve the overwhelmed parent was part of the thinking behind the upgrade, pitching how the update would give parents who &#8220;need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time to knock out some work&#8221; time to do so. (Uninterrupted time during the pandemic? What&#8217;s that?)</p>
<p>Netflix says the new profiles are rolling out now to TV devices globally, but will be tested on tablets and mobile devices in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Workflow automation has been one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">the key trends this year</a> so far, and <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho</a>, a company known for its suite of affordable business tools has joined the parade with a new low code workflow product called <a href="https://www.qntrl.com/">Qntrl</a> (pronounced control).</p>
<p>Zoho&#8217;s Rodrigo Vaca, who is in charge of Qntrl&#8217;s marketing says that most of the solutions we&#8217;ve been seeing are built for larger enterprise customers. Zoho is aiming for the mid-market with a product that requires less technical expertise than traditional business process management tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We enable customers to design their workflows visually without the need for any particular kind of prior knowledge of business process management notation or any kind of that esoteric modeling or discipline,&#8221; Vaca told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vaca says, Qntrl could require some technical help to connect a workflow to more complex backend systems like CRM or ERP, it allows a less technical end user to drag and drop the components and then get help to finish the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly expect that when you need to connect to NetSuite or SAP you&#8217;re going to need a developer. If nothing else, the IT guys are going to ask questions, and they will need to provide access,&#8221; Vaca said.</p>
<p>He believes this product is putting this kind of tooling in reach of companies that may have been left out of workflow automation for the most part, or which have been using spreadsheets or other tools to create crude workflows. With Qntrl, you drag and drop components, and then select each component and configure what happens before, during and after each step.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Qntrl provides a central place for processing and understanding what&#8217;s happening within each workflow at any given time, and who is responsible for completing it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen bigger companies like Microsoft, SAP, ServiceNow and others offering this type of functionality over the last year as low code workflow automation has taken center stage in business.</p>

<p>This has become a more pronounced need during the pandemic when so many workers could not be in the office. It made moving work in a more automated workflow more imperative, and we have seen companies moving to add more of this kind of functionality as a result.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that Zoho is attempting to remove some the complexity from this kind of tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;It handles the security pieces to make sure the right people have access to the data and processes used in the workflows in the background, so regular users can drag and drop to build their flows and processes without having to worry about that stuff,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>Zoho Qntrl is available starting today starting at just $7 per user month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt disrupted the transportation industry, one of the thorns on their sides has been traffic congestion and pollution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ride-hailing-climate-risks">has shown</a> that trips from ride-hailing cars have more emissions than those from personal cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce their carbon footprint and solve the latter problem, both companies have floated the idea of ridesharing and other transportation models, like bike and scooter-sharing services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have toyed with integrating public transportation scheduling and providing drivers with incentives to switch to electric cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these models have found little or no success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2018, Lyft decided to go a step further by promising to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carbon neutrality. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/all-lyft-rides-are-carbon-neutral/558443/">The Atlantic</a>, the company planned to execute this by purchasing carbon credits from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3Degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sustainability company based in San Francisco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/a-year-of-carbon-neutral-lyft-rides">Lyft said</a> it had eliminated the amount of carbon that would take 2.4 million acres of trees to remove in a single year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It achieved this by purchasing 2,062,500 metric tons of carbon offsets, but the company reverted to its old ways in 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the program made Lyft rides carbon neutral, it was an expensive process. The company claimed that net emissions from its rides would still increase in the long run. So Lyft promised to offer rides only in electric vehicles by 2030. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same with most car companies worldwide, each promising to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carbon neutrality via electric cars in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Planet, a car company based in South Africa wants to achieve carbon neutrality now, not later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Planet42 isn&#8217;t a ride-hailing company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a car subscription product that buys second-hand cars from dealerships and rents to customers via a subscription model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Polestar &#8216;will have to question everything&#8217; in order to build the first climate-neutral EV&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/polestar-will-have-to-question-everything-in-order-to-build-the-first-climate-neutral-ev/embed/#?secret=t1SzIxKf0I" data-secret="t1SzIxKf0I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Marten Orgna and Eerik Oja, Planet42 targets individuals in emerging markets but has a presence only in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has bought </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,000 cars in South Africa and plans to increase this number to 100,000 in the next few years &#8212; and 1 million cars globally by 2025</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite not being a ride-hailing company and having a huge positive social impact because it gives cars to people who otherwise would not have them, there is a limited negative environmental impact Planet42 has due to the emissions produced by its cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most car companies seem lethargic toward becoming carbon neutral, Planet42, studying how it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indirectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributes to emissions, decided to act last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Few people would argue that becoming carbon neutral is not a worthwhile goal, but it seemed to us that the world is not moving towards carbon neutrality fast enough,&#8221; Oja told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So instead of introducing a vacuous grand plan of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 or something like that, we decided to become carbon neutral now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137648" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137648" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Planet42" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Planet42-team-1024x684-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Planet42</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there are hardly any electric vehicles in Africa for mass consumption and planting trees can be costly, how has the company gone about it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before helping Lyft embark on its tree-planting project, 3Degrees engaged in a couple of wind farms and captured greenhouse gases from landfill projects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Planet42 chose to neutralize its carbon emission through the former; however, it works with local companies in South Africa to reach this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its first project is a wind farm in Northern Cape, South Africa; with the money from carbon offset credits, Planet42 has been able to finance the farm for months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power produced from wind turbines offsets other, more harmful energy production methods like burning coal and supporting a low carbon global economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are offsetting this negative impact by investing into carbon offset projects in the markets we operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it another way, the investments we make into carbon neutrality represent a self-imposed tax</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are leading by example and hope that companies in Africa and beyond will follow us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company, which has raised $20 million in debt and equity, first launched, attaining carbon neutrality wasn&#8217;t even an afterthought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, not only is it certified as a carbon-neutral company by Natural Capital Partners, its investors feel enthused about the project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oja says what&#8217;s next for the company will be to achieve carbon neutrality via electric cars ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that might be a reach. The adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electric vehicles in Africa faces </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problems different from what the U.S., Europe and even other emerging markets face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top of mind is the dire power situation where unreliable power supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at high electricity prices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is a general lack of tax incentives, subsidies and policies, and the sole fact that they are too expensive for the average African car owner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, there are <a href="https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx">more than a million electric vehicles</a> on U.S. roads and <a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7480/CBP-7480.pdf">over 317,000 on U.K. roads</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In South Africa &#8212; Planet42&#8217;s main market and Africa&#8217;s top electric car market, this number <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-11-17-electric-cars-will-take-off-in-sa-when-the-state-incentivises-them-says-report/">is just about 1,000</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, until electric cars become mainstream, wind farms will remain vital to the company&#8217;s carbon-neutral efforts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we could be doing is for our cars to be electric, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re planning for the future. When we do that, there wouldn&#8217;t be any need for offsets on a day to day side but we&#8217;re not there right now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone understands that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electric cars will be ideal; however, that future is not now and we need to act right now,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not feeling well and your doctor asks you to get labs drawn, you know that can increase the time between a diagnosis and care. But <a href="https://getlabs.com/">Getlabs</a>, a company that brings the lab to you with its at-home, blood-drawing service, is aiming to eliminate that friction, and today announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $3 million seed round led by PivotNorth Capital. The funding will be used to launch in Phoenix, Philadelphia, and Dallas, all of which have been soft launches so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seventy percent of all medical decisions are based on lab results, yet 30% of patients are non-compliant and skip their lab orders,” Getlabs said in a statement. For many, getting their labs drawn is just one more tedious step in getting the care they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Getlabs, once a phlebotomist draws your blood, it can get processed in any lab of your choice, though the company has partnerships with Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company charges for drawing the labs, but insurance pays for the blood work to be processed, as it normally would. To get your blood drawn at home, Getlabs charges the patient between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$29-$49, and it’s based on when you want them to come to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Brick and mortar] labs usually charge a $25 blood drawing fee, which isn’t covered by insurance, so the $29 fee charged by Getlabs is only a couple more dollars,” Kyle Michelson, Getlabs founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137491" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2137491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg 5080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137491" class="wp-caption-text">Kyle Michelson, founder and CEO, Getlabs. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getlabs</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getlabs is the result of a challenge Michelson himself faced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I needed my labs done all the time while I was in Y Combinator [for another idea],&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was there for three months, and you’re scrambling to build a business, and I had no time, and the little time I had I spent driving to the lab and waiting for an hour. So it was just a miserable experience,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started looking into why people didn’t get their labs done, and the top reason was inconvenience,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting healthcare today often includes four trips: going to the doctor, the lab, back to the doctor and then the pharmacy. But with the massive growth of virtual care and with companies like Capsule, Amazon Pharmacy and PillPack (owned by Amazon) offering prescription delivery to your door, Michelson saw a gap in the market for a more convenient lab service, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getlabs, which is fully remote and has 37 employees, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to use the funding to expand to Phoenix, Philadelphia and Dallas and also to expand to other verticals of home health. Other investors in the round include Tusk Venture Partners, Rosecliff Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, CityLight Capital, Karlin Asset Management and angel investor Matthew Dellavedova.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe Getlabs is the final step in delivering at-home healthcare that will be so crucial as more organizations and individuals see the benefits of telemedicine,&#8221; said Tim Connors, founder and managing partner at PivotNorth Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not all ailments can be treated virtually, when possible, “The end goal for Getlabs is to fully partner with telemedicine services so patients never have to leave the home,” the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Edvard Engesaeth, co-founder of Nurx, “Getlabs could play an important part for healthcare companies like Nurx to treat more complex conditions where in-person blood draws are required by providing remote care in the home.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing and delivery company Grab has <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">announced</a> plans to go public in the U.S. Based in Singapore, the company has evolved from a ride-hailing app to a Southeast Asian super app that offers several consumer services, including food delivery, financial services, such as an e-wallet so that you can send and receive money.</p>
<p>It operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grabtaxi/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, the company has raised over $10 billion, including from SoftBank’s Vision Fund.</p>
<p>In order to go public, Grab has chosen to merge with a SPAC named Altimeter Growth Corp. A SPAC is a publicly-traded blank-check company based in the U.S. Going public through this process should be much easier for Grab — especially because it’s a foreign company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the deal goes through, it would be the world’s largest SPAC merger. Grab would be listed on NASDAQ under the symbol ‘GRAB’.</p>
<p>A part of the announcement, Grab has shared some metrics and some big numbers. In 2020, the company managed to generate around $12.5 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV). The merger would value Grab at $39.6 billion and the company would keep $4.5 billion in cash.</p>
<p>The company thinks there’s still a lot of room to grow when it comes to food delivery and on-demand mobility in Southeast Asia. It expects to see the total addressable market jump from $52 billion to $180 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>“This is a milestone in our journey to open up access for everyone to benefit from the digital economy. This is even more critical as our region recovers from COVID-19. It was very challenging for us too, but it taught us immensely about the resiliency of our business,” Grab co-founder and CEO Anthony Tan said <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">in the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“Our diversified superapp strategy helped our driver-partners pivot to deliveries, and enabled us to deliver growth while improving profitability. As we become a publicly-traded company, we’ll work even harder to create economic empowerment for our communities, because when Southeast Asia succeeds, Grab succeeds,” he added.</p>
<p>Altimeter has agreed to a three-year lockup period for its sponsor shares, which means that Altimeter should remain committed to the company for a while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.joinpapa.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the elder tech company that offers care and companionship to seniors, today announced a $60 million Series C led by Tiger Global Management, bringing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/papa-raises-18-million-to-expand-its-business-connecting-older-adults-with-virtual-and-in-person-companions/">total raised to date to $91 million.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money will be used to propel the company’s growth this year, building on 600% year-over-year growth as of the start of 2021, the company said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Parker, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the company&#8217;s founder and CEO, </span>launched Papa as a consumer product in 2017. Seniors signed up for the service and a college student, called a Papa Pal, would show up at their </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">door to help with anything from taking them to doctor appointments, helping around the house, providing tech support and offering companionship. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea was always to spend about six months collecting data and feedback and to then approach insurance companies. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Miami-based company has since partnered with 80 insurance providers who offer Papa nationwide as a benefit to their members. Employers can also offer Papa as a benefit. And while i</span>ndividuals can still sign up for the service, it is largely available through insurance.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have about 1 million eligible members on the platform, and about 15% use Papa every month,” Parker told TechCrunch. The company expects there to be between 5-6 million members on the platform starting January 2022.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been able to prove that we improve the lives and health outcomes of older adults and families,” Parker said. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Most of all they’re trying to reduce loneliness and isolation to seniors.&#8221; The pandemic has only exacerbated loneliness and so Papa started offering virtual services, too.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has expanded its core offering to also include Papa Health, a suite of benefits that includes care navigation, virtual primary care and chronic care management, all of which are offered through the Papa platform. Additionally, the company’s services are now offered to families through Medicaid Managed Care, Parker said. “For example, maybe there’s a single mother with children who is trying to get a job &#8211; a Papa pal can help her out,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Papa came from a personal need within the Parker family. “I started Papa originally to help my grandfather &#8211; who we called Papa &#8211; who came from Argentina. He needed support and help and companionship, but he didn’t need bathing and toileting,” Parker said. To get help for his grandfather, Parker put an ad on Facebook asking, “Who wants to be a pal to my Papa?” </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted someone young and energetic who would also benefit from my grandfather’s life experiences,” Parker said. While the company originally focused on students, it now works with anyone from the age of 18-45, though Parker reinforced that the company is stringent in who it accepts and has an acceptance rate below 10%. The company gets about 20,000 applications per month from people wanting to be pals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who do work with Papa, Parker said their main role is to provide a sense of, “Hey, I’m here, and I care about you, and I’m here to support you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s so much nuance to older adults’ lives, and 50% of older adults consider themselves lonely,” Parker added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://bilo.ba">Biloba</a> has <a href="https://medium.com/biloba/biloba-is-raising-a-1-4m-seed-round-led-by-agla%C3%A9-ventures-and-id4-36049fb2e5cb">raised</a> a $1.7 million funding round (€1.4 million) a few months after launching its pediatrics app that lets you chat with a doctor whenever you have a question. In addition to raising some money, the startup also recently added <a href="https://medium.com/biloba/biloba-r%C3%A9invente-les-ordonnances-elles-sont-enfin-lisibles-%C3%A9ducatives-et-infalsifiables-42f7d1f9f44">in-app prescriptions</a>.</p>
<p>Biloba’s concept is surprisingly simple. It’s a mobile app that lets you reach a general practitioner and a nurse whenever you have a medical question about your child. The service is available from 8 AM to 10 PM.</p>
<p>When you start a conversation, it looks like a messaging app. You can send and receive messages but also send photos and videos. There’s no real-time video conversation, no appointment. The company says that you usually get an answer in less than 10 minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, Biloba raised a €1.2 million pre-seed round. This year’s €1.4 million’s seed round is led by Aglaé Ventures and ID4. Existing investors Calm/Storm Ventures, Inventures, Acequia Capital and several business angels are also participating once again.</p>
<p>A text conversation will never replace a visit to the pediatrician. And there are many medical interactions and milestones after a baby is born. But you may have questions and you don’t want to wait for the next appointment.</p>
<p>And if it’s a relatively harmless issue that doesn’t need an in-person appointment, Biloba can now issue prescriptions. You receive the prescriptions in the app and it is accepted in all French pharmacies. The startup uses <a href="https://www.ordoclic.fr">Ordoclic</a> for that feature.</p>
<p>Biloba thinks people shouldn’t pay per consultation — even though people are particularly well covered by the French national healthcare system and private health insurance. Instead, the startup has opted for a subscription model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small businesses in Africa need digital banking services including plenty of credit. Although these businesses drive economic growth and contribute up to one-third of the continent’s GDP, they are often financially excluded from credit and other financial services due to their size and informality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such company tackling this challenge in the eastern part of Africa is Ugandan fintech startup</span><a href="https://www.numida.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Numida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And today, the company is announcing the close of its $2.3 million seed round.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/minashahid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mina Shahid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/catherinedenis"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Catherine Denis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminbest"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Best</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded Numida in 2017 and capitalized on the opportunity to build one of East Africa&#8217;s first digital fintechs targeting semi-formal micro and small businesses. Typically, these businesses access credit from family, loan sharks and informal money lenders that offer poorly designed consumer credit. They can also get loans from a traditional microfinance institution, although with ridiculous interest rates.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the founders didn&#8217;t set out to offer credit to businesses when they first started. An initial pilot in 2016 was centered around a bookkeeping tool that enabled traditional microfinance institutions (MFIs) to provide unsecured credit to semi-formal businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the major reasons why financial institutions don&#8217;t give loans to these businesses is because they don&#8217;t have good financial track records and cash flow history,&#8221; Shahid said to TechCrunch. &#8220;That was the problem we set out to solve &#8212; to create the mechanisms to get that cashflow data and present it in a form that can be used and incorporated into the underwriting processes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders thought that these microfinance institutions would begin to use the data obtained from months of bookkeeping to serve these businesses. But they didn&#8217;t envisage what happened after nine months. Shahid stated that even though the MFIs claimed to love the data that Numida could bring out, they were unwilling to adjust their underwriting practices. In turn, they rejected all Numida&#8217;s customers who applied for loans on the platform because they lacked collateral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we thought among ourselves that if our mission is to unlock access to resources that these mom and pop shops need in order to grow their businesses, we&#8217;re not going to do that by partnering with these traditional MFIs; we had to do that ourselves,&#8221; he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via a proprietary credit score, Numida offers risk-based pricing on an applicant&#8217;s first loan. After that, businesses can access unsecured working capital loans of up to $3,500 in less than two hours, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137614" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137614" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2137614 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?w=680" alt="Two business people using Numida" width="680" height="524" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg 4244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=680,524 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=1536,1184 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=2048,1579 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hillary-and-James.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137614" class="wp-caption-text">Numida business owners</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From May 2017, when it pivoted to September 2019, Numida kept its outstanding portfolio very small and iterated on its underwriting process and credit risk algorithm. After making several iterations, the company went full on to the market in October 2019, and the CEO says the company has grown 6x in lending volumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, it has provided more than $2 million in unsecured credit to 3,000 micro and small businesses in Uganda, disbursing around $250,000 per month. This is with outstanding collections, repayment rates and client retention, the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the consumer digital lending space in East Africa has seen an abundance of transactions in recent years, the same cannot be said for startups targeting the micro and small business segment. As one of the few facing this segment, the business has faced issues around getting relevant data to improve its model but doesn&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collate data it thinks isn&#8217;t necessary (social media activities, SMS or mobile money transactions) for the sake of aggregating data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look at the business fundamentals, the cash flow of the business, and some demographic data about the applicants. We&#8217;ve had to build our own data set because there are no readily available cashflow data on semi-formal, micro and small businesses in Africa,&#8221; remarked Shadid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its underwriting model was built off 15,000 loans, which took a long time to execute, and this timing puts some strain on how fast it can onboard customers and serve them. However, the pandemic helped in accelerating this model, and with this new investment, Numida is poised to grow further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African payments company MFS Africa led the seed round. There was also participation from firms like DRK Foundation, Equilibria Capital and Segal Family Foundation alongside angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time MFS Africa was in the news regarding an investment dates back to June 2020, when it <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/06/30/mfs-africa-beyonic-acquisition/">acquired Ugandan fintech startup Beyonic</a> for an undisclosed amount.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rising African venture investment powers fintech, clean tech bets in 2020&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/embed/#?secret=iLfycjC8PN" data-secret="iLfycjC8PN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numida is another Ugandan fintech, and a similar play might be in the cards. According to Shahid, the most obvious acquisition path for any successful lending startup to small businesses in Africa is a payments platform. His reason? Because credit is one of the core financial products that will create loyalty and retention to a specific payments platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that MFS is a strategic investor in Numida and not the typical VC. He sees the Pan-African company as owning infrastructure, which his company can ride on as a solid foundation for scale. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s an opportunity we see in the future. We were concerned about scaling across the continent and who would be the best partner for this. We thought MFS has a lot of expertise and footprint on the continent that will allow us to scale moving forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new financing, Numida plans to expand aggressively in Uganda and pilot in a new market, preferably in West Africa. There are some parallels between Uganda and Ghana, Numida&#8217;s primary choice in the region. They both have similar mobile money penetration, issues with traditional financial service providers and similar businesses that Shahid says make an enticing market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per plans, Numida will introduce additional financial services like payments, micro-insurance and deposits to its customers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“You wanted me to record this?” asks Saul Klein, LocalGlobe founding partner.</p>
<p>“Just in case you say anything interesting,” I quip back.</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t be doing most of the talking, so maybe someone will say something interesting,&#8221; Klein replies poker-faced, before grinning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve agreed to an ensemble-style interview with multiple members of the <a href="https://localglobe.vc/">LocalGlobe</a> investment team: Klein, George Henry, Suzanne Ashman, Julia Hawkins, Mish Mashkautsan and Remus Brett. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Unlike in 2015, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/beyond-the-klein-brand/">when I visited the early-stage VC&#8217;s then offices in Tileyard Studios</a>, the interview is taking place over Zoom, rather than the firm&#8217;s new Phoenix Court premises in the King&#8217;s Cross area of London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Also in contrast to last time, when I wanted to scoop LocalGlobe&#8217;s latest fundraise and Klein rather I didn&#8217;t, this time it&#8217;s the other way round: I&#8217;ve been invited to write a piece partly anchored on news of two new funds that were quietly raised last year.</span></p>
<p>LocalGlobe, the entity that invests at seed stage, has an additional $150 million of capital to deploy in the U.K. and Europe (and further afield). Running alongside is Latitude, a growth-stage fund now with $220 million more to invest, which allows the LocalGlobe team to take a fresh look at breakout portfolio companies that have proven their growth potential or to back other scale-ups, which, for myriad reasons, didn&#8217;t take or weren&#8217;t offered LocalGlobe&#8217;s cash earlier.</p>
<p>“Latitude was born out of the idea of building continuity,” says LocalGlobe general partner George Henry. &#8220;When it comes to existing LocalGlobe companies, Latitude is very much building on top of what we&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s giving us the capital to continue to invest more into those companies”.</p>
<p>However, the firm doesn’t think of Latitude as follow-on funding, in the classic sense. Not only is it able to back companies that LocalGlobe hasn&#8217;t previously invested in, but even for those it has, the LocalGlobe team, including Julian Rowe, who heads up Latitude, uses the opportunity to take a fresh look before writing a Latitude cheque.</p>
<p>“I think 80% of Latitude companies have at least one LocalGlobe partner fully engaged,” says Klein.</p>
<p>Internally, whichever fund the firm is investing from and at what stage, LocalGlobe frames its strategy as &#8220;insights and access&#8221;. Though no one explicitly explains what this means, I interpret it as having the expertise in the team (and wider LocalGlobe network) to understand a problem space and its addressable market, and having the access to see and then get in on a deal, should it want to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s easier to have insight and access when you&#8217;ve already been inside the company from pre-seed or seed,” explains Henry. “But we&#8217;ve [also] seen opportunities where we feel we had the insight and access because we know the founders already, we know the theme, we know the market [and] we know the investors really well. And then it puts us in a position where we feel confident to participate at Series B or beyond&#8221;.</p>
<p>LocalGlobe isn&#8217;t the only European early-stage VC firm to launch a separate later-stage fund, either to avoid too much dilution for the most promising portfolio companies or to opportunistically back companies later when there&#8217;s arguably less risk. Yet I can&#8217;t help wonder what the conversation is like when Latitude wants to invest in a company that LocalGlobe previously turned down.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/monzo-series-f/">One example is Monzo</a>, the popular U.K.-based bank with its instantly recognisable hot coral pink-coloured debit card. &#8220;We were very aware of Monzo from the earliest days,&#8221; says Klein. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t big believers at the time in consumer neobanks. We thought the neobank was something that would work for SMEs or for business banking, where the incumbents were really not focused&#8230; but also it&#8217;s kind of typically a better business than consumer retail banking. And we took the view that consumer neobanks weren&#8217;t going to be a thing”.</p>
<p>Instead, LocalGlobe invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/cleo-series-b/">Cleo</a>, a financial assistant chatbot and app that runs on top of consumer bank accounts, and Tide, a business bank account for SMEs.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cleo, the AI-powered &#8216;financial assistant&#8217;, raises $44M Series B led by EQT Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/cleo-series-b/embed/#?secret=DyJPWmsRwP" data-secret="DyJPWmsRwP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“And it turns out, you know, we were wrong,” admits Klein, before revealing that LocalGlobe general partner Suzanne Ashman was the outlier in the team. After becoming an early customer of Monzo, she backed the challenger bank’s equity crowd fund in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>“When we had an opportunity later on through Latitude to get involved with Monzo, we felt it&#8217;s an exceptional company,” continues Klein. “We love the investors, we work very closely with General Catalyst, and they were getting involved with the business at the time, and with Accel. And we thought it was a great opportunity to enter”.</p>
<p>Another example of missing out first time around is Cazoo, the used car retailer founded by Alex Chesterman. Klein and Chesterman go way back to their time at Lovefilm, and LocalGlobe was an early investor in Zoopla, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/11/silver-lake-makes-a-3b-offer-to-buy-property-portal-zoopla-the-zillow-of-the-uk/">the proptech company</a> Chesterman took all the way to IPO. Access, therefore, wasn&#8217;t a problem. Instead, a perceived conflict of interest was.</p>
<p>LocalGlobe had invested in Motorway (curiously, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/05/motorway/">as had Chesterman</a>), which at the time looked like a potential Cazoo competitor. No longer deemed as such, Latitude would go on to write a later-stage (and more expensive) check. Then, last month, Cazoo announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">SPAC its way to going public</a> with a valuation of $7 billion, proving that conflicts of interest can be costly.</p>
<p>These near misses are the exception, says Klein, underlining that Latitude&#8217;s core thesis is to be able to support LocalGlobe portfolio breakouts. &#8220;LocalGlobe is about that startup phase of pre-seed and seed. Latitude is the breakout phase where things are really starting to hit an inflection point,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>That is, of course, true, but it can also be argued that having a later stage fund does provide additional optionality and I posit that this could make LocalGlobe less risk-taking. With Latitude potentially able to mop up deals that didn&#8217;t happen at seed, LocalGlobe can take a wait and see approach for investments where early insights are less forthcoming.</p>

<p>Henry shakes his head ferociously, prompting Klein to suggest he takes this question.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to get in as early as possible, because that&#8217;s the way you build the relationship&#8230; There&#8217;s nothing that gives you more credit than to be the first believer in a team,” says Henry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, in the market we&#8217;re in, you don&#8217;t want to make a bet on something that looks exciting, but you&#8217;re not sure and say, ‘it&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll get into Series B’. Because the reality is, the more you wait, the harder it gets to get into a great company”.</p>
<h2>In LocalGlobe&#8217;s own (interesting) words&#8230;</h2>
<h3>On capital going into private markets</h3>
<p>&#8220;The amount of capital that is now in the private markets looking to invest in tech, it&#8217;s not just extraordinary, but, arguably, it&#8217;s necessary and important, because this is where growth comes from and this is where innovation comes from. I&#8217;ve been doing this for 20-25 years, and it took 20 years to get to the starting line. Now it gets interesting.&#8221; &#8212; Saul Klein.</p>
<h3>On investing in regulated industries</h3>
<p>&#8220;Opportunities in the highly regulated industries are just massive. And they were largely untouched by wave one of VC, and even five years ago, we tended not to see that many founders building in heavily regulated spaces. So it feels to me that, yes, while the base of capital has gotten much larger, the opportunity in all of these segments is now much larger.&#8221; &#8212; Suzanne Ashman</p>
<h3>On healthcare opportunities</h3>
<p>&#8220;We think overall, obviously, healthcare is one of the largest markets, and we are very, very bullish on that, on the opportunity at large. We&#8217;ve doubled down on specific themes within healthcare. So, for example, developing communication rails for healthcare, improving how patients get connected with hospital systems&#8230; Mental health is another enormous market and opportunity, not just in terms of market, but in terms of impact.&#8221; &#8212; Julia Hawkins</p>
<h3>On successful exits</h3>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just the supporting cast, and obviously, you are delighted for them. But you&#8217;re never the main show. What&#8217;s lovely about being a seed investor, and then supporting with Latitude, is it is not a quick journey, and you get to know people over time, you get to know their friends, their partners. And honestly, it&#8217;s just a privilege to sit on the sidelines.&#8221; &#8212; Suzanne Ashman</p>
<h3>On fintech&#8217;s longevity</h3>
<p>&#8220;Over the next five years, on all dimensions, from payments to core banking to insurance, you know, we&#8217;re going to see many more interesting companies. Just when you think the market map is pretty clear, and the winners are emerging, you&#8217;ll still see these companies that emerge and completely destroy the market.&#8221; &#8212; Remus Brett</p>
<h3><strong>On frontier tech need for more capital</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Proper frontier tech, and foundational tech, requires even more patience and focus on what&#8217;s beyond the horizon&#8230; The available capital for proper frontier tech startups is much more limited than startups in general. And that&#8217;s something we all know and feel daily.&#8221; &#8212; Mish Mashkautsan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto industry as a whole has seen a momentous year of growth, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spurred on by the entrance of institutional investors adopting bitcoin due to its store of value properties</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 spike bitcoin experienced was also accelerated by its global adoption as the number of global cryptocurrency users</span><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cambridge-universitys-third-crypto-study-records-101-million-cryptocurrency-users-worldwide/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">surpassed 100 million in Q3 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For <a href="https://www.luno.com/en/ng">Luno</a>, a U.K.-based crypto company founded by Marcus Swanepoel and Timothy Stranex in 2013, it grew to 6 million customers from January 2020 to January 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, that number</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has since gone up to 7 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the company, headquartered in London, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 400 employees across London, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria and Singapore, with customers in 40 countries globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Swanepoel, Luno&#8217;s numbers have been increasing month-on-month over the last seven years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this is the first time it is observing an acceleration of this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">magnitude.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a couple of reasons for Luno&#8217;s surge in numbers (like any other crypto exchange startup)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, despite talks of bitcoin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in everyday life by crypto enthusiasts and interests from institutional entrants like BNY Mellon, <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/">Mastercard</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-1-5b-in-bitcoin-may-accept-the-cryptocurrency-as-payment-in-the-future/">Tesla</a>, it is a long shot before becoming mainstream</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, crypto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serves investment purposes. This singular factor has particularly made it very popular with Africans &#8212; a demographic that has been a major part of Luno&#8217;s growth and the huge traction it is witnessing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the company surveyed the markets in which it currently operates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It featured 15,000 respondents from South Africa, U.K., France, Italy, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria; the answers helped Luno understand how the pandemic influenced attitudes towards the current financial system</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the survey, 54% of Africans were ready to adopt a single global digital currency, compared to 41% for Asia and 35% for Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Luno raises $9M to bring its bitcoin wallet, exchange and services to Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/luno-raises-9m-bitcoin/embed/#?secret=4UDp7IAvzT" data-secret="4UDp7IAvzT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s dominance also shows in its numbers. Out of the 7 million customers it has globally, 4.7 million people are in Africa. This number was 2.3 million in January 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luno&#8217;s app installs across the continent have increased by 271% within this time frame, and trading volumes skyrocketed 12x, from $555 million to $7 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For context, Luno did $8.3 billion in total trading volume.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a large part of this growth is down to Luno&#8217;s early play in the market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last few years, infrastructure in parts of the world that could not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support the crypto market has improved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luno has played a vital role as one of the first platforms to improve the crypto marketplace experience by including local currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also helped to lay the groundwork for educating people on digital currencies.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The last time bitcoin went up as it did during the past year was in 2017 and 2018, and it was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven by retail, but it was still very difficult to buy crypto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were trust issues; it would take days to get your account verified and even set up a wallet,&#8221; Swanepoel told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, over the last three years, companies like ours, especially in Africa, have built up this infrastructure, KYCs, new payment methods, customer experience and support. The experience is much better and education levels are a lot higher</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To me, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s played a large role in crypto adoption in the continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September last year, Luno got acquired by</span><a href="https://dcg.co/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Currency Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DCG), an investment firm that builds, buys and invests in blockchain companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of its portfolio companies include Coindesk, Genesis and Grayscale Investments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before acquiring Luno, BCG first invested in the company&#8217;s seed round in 2014. Then last year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swanepoel said he saw the opportunity to take Luno to a larger scale after noticing the immense growth and adoption on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The first five to six years for us was on a small scale and now, we want to go big. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it helps to have a global platform like DCG to do it from because they have large amounts of capital and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to investing in Africa as well as outside the continent,&#8221; he remarked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds that DCG has more visibility on the crypto industry and trends. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Luno to leverage DCG&#8217;s insights and stay ahead of the curve, which looks to have paid off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the acquisition, Luno has seen the number of active users increase by 167%. As of January, the average user held more than $7,000 in their wallet, up 56% from December 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing lasts forever, but if the crypto market bull run is anything to go by, crypto isn&#8217;t the fad people once thought it was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 2021, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">Coinbase</a> (going public Wednesday) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/crypto-trading-on-robinhood-spiked-to-9-5m-customers-in-first-quarter/">Robinhood</a> experienced monster numbers showing strong growth projections</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Luno, it expects to continue growing exponentially, a trajectory that sets the company on track to reach 1 billion customers by 2030.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The race is on for companies building e-commerce empires by rolling up smaller, promising businesses that sell via Amazon and other marketplaces and growing by using some economies of scale to operate them as one. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.berlin-brands-group.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> has raised $240 million that it says it will be using to acquire smaller but promising enterprises in Europe and North America &#8212; specifically the U.S. &#8212; that are already making between $1 million and $100 million in sales via marketplaces like Amazon.</p>
<p>The funding is coming in the form of debt, not equity, and it is coming specifically from UniCredit, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, BBG founder and CEO Peter Chaljawski said in an interview. BBG is profitable and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year it committed more than $300 million off its balance sheet</a> for buying up and operating companies, and so with this debt round (which we reported earlier this year was in the works), it now has $540 million for that purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a wonderful situation with a proven business model, and this is the cheapest money you could get,&#8221; he said of the decision to go for debt, a choice often made by startups that are in capital-intensive modes but either reluctant or do not need to give up equity to raise capital to scale if they are generating cash. In the case of BBG it&#8217;s the latter, since the company is profitable. &#8220;This is better than equity. BBG does not have any debt as of 2020, and we had cash on hand for our first acquisitions, 20 brands that we bought in cash from our balance sheet. Now we want to accelerate that even more.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chaljawski said that BBG may well tap an equity round in the near future to bring on investors to shape its own growth and set a valuation for the company. (For a point of comparison, competitors like Thrasio are now valued in the multiple billions of dollars.)</p>
<p>BBG has to date mostly built its business around starting up and scaling its own in-house brands that sell on Amazon and elsewhere &#8212; starting first with home audio equipment, coming out of Chaljawski&#8217;s own interests in sound technology from a previous life as a budding dance music DJ. Its brands include Klarstein (kitchen appliances), auna (home electronics and music equipment), Capital Sports (home fitness) and blumfeldt (garden).</p>
<p>In a big move to scale and build out what it&#8217;s established itself, last year BBG shifted over to the roll-up model: leveraging a more buying power to cut better deals with manufacturers and other suppliers, consolidating some of the other functions like marketing, and providing a more comprehensive set of analytics around what is selling best, who is buying, how best to market an item, and more. It says it has 1.3 million square feet of warehouse space in Europe, Asia and the U.S. and is one of the biggest Amazon sellers in Europe today.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The basic idea of rolling up businesses that sell on the Amazon platform with FBA (</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">) has been around for years in fact, but the notable and more recent shift is that it has taken on a startup profile in part because of how some of the latest entrants are leveraging big data analytics, the latest innovations in manufacturing and logistics technology and a founder-led, e-commerce ethos to grow the model.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without data, you would go nowhere in this business,&#8221; Chaljawski said. &#8220;But on top of that, there is something you can’t pull from market data &#8212; a toolbox of manufacturing and engineering expertise that we use to evaluate products.&#8221; He says that BBG&#8217;s data scientists build algorithms that millions of products, and hundreds of thousands of sellers, to produce the data that it uses both to source potential acquisitions and to run the business.</p>
<p>U.S. players like Thrasio &#8212; which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed a $1.2 billion Series C</a> for the same purposes: rolling up and scaling &#8212; have led the charge. But in recent months we&#8217;ve seen a number of others also move into the space, buoyed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from investors very keen to ride the e-commerce wave and the vision of tapping into some of the economies of scale and the marketplace model that have been such a juggernaut for Amazon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a two-sided marketplace, and Amazon has focused primarily on earning money from operating the marketplace itself and sales to consumers, so that leaves a huge opportunity on the table for someone else (or as it happens, many others) to tackle the opportunity to address the needs and services of the other side of that marketplace: the sellers.</p>
<p>In addition to BBG and Thrasio, others in the same space include Branded, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding</a> earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroes</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perch</a>, among several others. Even removing the very-highly capitalized Thrasio and BBG from the equation, these companies have collectively raised or committed from their own balance sheets hundreds of millions of dollars to buy up small but promising third-party merchants.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a crowded market, well, it probably is. These are also startups, after all, and so the chances that some of these roll-up consolidators will not be that skilled at running multiple companies &#8212; with their disparate supply chains, customer bases, replacement cycles and marketing strategies &#8212; are as risky as in any other area of e-commerce startup interest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, there are a lot of opportunities to play for here.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one estimate</a>, there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon today, a number that appears to be growing exponentially, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Out of those, Thrasio estimates that there are probably 50,000 businesses selling on the Amazon platform with FBA (<a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>) that are making $1 million or more per year in revenues.</p>
<p>We have pointed out before that within that bigger number of merchants, there are a huge amount of clones and companies of questionable quality. What is interesting is that there are distinct companies, built around more originality and flair, swimming in that sea: some of them have broken through and floated, while others that have not.</p>
<p>So for a company like BBG, the opportunity lies in the fact that for many of these smaller but promising merchants, they have not been built with longer-term growth visions in place. The merchants might not be prepared for the kind of scaling, investment or operational commitment that would need to be made to keep their businesses going, or they simply don&#8217;t have the appetite for it. BBG&#8217;s selling point &#8212; as it is with others in this space &#8212; is that they do.</p>
<p>And BBG&#8217;s added pitch is that they can help open another door, to Europe. In the region, Amazon on average has about a 10% market share of marketplaces, BBG estimates, with regional players accounting for more marketplace activity than in the U.S. BBG not only has the links into selling on these other marketplaces, but the promise is that it can help improve how a brand will sell on Amazon itself in the region, given its traction in the market already. Conversely, it hopes to do the same for European brands by giving them a better window into selling in the U.S.</p>
<p>Chaljawski is however realistic about the profusion of companies like his, and is &#8220;sure&#8221; there will be some casualties down the road. He also believes that we may start to see some emerge around specific verticals as an alternative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure consolidation will happen, but I also think that we&#8217;ll see some specialization, with roll-ups focusing on one vertical or another. I think it will be a mix,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pine Labs said on Tuesday it has acquired Southeast Asian startup Fave in a deal valued at $45 million as the Indian firm looks to strengthen its consumer-focused offerings in the domestic and international markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://myfave.com/">Fave</a> helps an offline <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/fave-raises-20m/">merchant connect and retain customers</a> by using gift cards and vouchers. The startup allows merchants to accept digital payments by having a customer scan a QR code. Once the payment is made, the customer automatically receives a cashback / loyalty point through the Fave app that can only be redeemed at that specific business during future transactions.</p>
<p>“Customers love us because they get safe money, cashback and rewards for being on the platform. And merchants love us because they get a lot of new and repeat customers,” explained Joel Neoh, co-founder and chief executive of Fave, which like Pine Labs, is backed by Sequoia Capital India. Five-year-old Fave, which started as a fitness subscription service, raised over $32 million prior to being acquired.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This offering has especially proven useful to merchants in the pandemic as they scramble for ways to drive sales from existing customers, said Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, in an interview. “Consumers, too, were looking for ways of cost-savings or ways to optimize their purchases.”</p>
<p>Pine Labs &#8212; which offers businesses payments terminals, invoicing tools, and working capital, and acquired a gift cards solution provider Qwikcilver in 2019 &#8212; made its first investment in Fave last year.</p>

Mastercard and PayPal have backed Pine Labs, which is now valued at $2 billion.</p></div></p>
<p>Rau drew comparisons between Fave and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">Honey</a>, saying the Southeast Asian startup is doing to offline businesses what the PayPal-owned business has achieved in the online world. “For the first time with QR, what I realized was you can do a wonderful job when it comes to loyalty, rewards, and the redemption in the offline world,” said Rau.</p>
<p>Leadership of Fave will continue to work at the startup post the acquisition and Rau said the team is working to bring Fave&#8217;s offering to customers in 3,700 Indian cities. (This is one of the rare times when a Southeast Asian startup is launching its offering in India.) Neoh said in the interview that Fave, which will be hiring an additional 100 employees, also plans to launch a buy now and pay later product in the next one to two months.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has the digital advantage with young demography, growing aspirational middle class with rising disposable income and increasing digital savviness. We are confident that the APAC e-payments landscape will continue to achieve exponential growth in the coming decade. Together, we will be stronger, faster and better,&#8221; said Neoh.</p>
<p>Within the next 30 days, Fave Pay will launch in India with QR code transactions, and then Rau said, the team will work with Pine Labs&#8217; merchants community to deliver rewards, coupons, and redemption programs to Indian consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;After looking at the business for nine-ten months, I thought it was time for us to do something more important and strategic,&#8221; said Rau, who added that the acquisition will help Pine Labs make further inroads in the consumer space.</p>
<p>Rau said Pine Labs is exploring more merger and acquisition opportunities and broadly focusing on two themes: Bridging the gap between offline and online payments, and business applications where Pine Labs&#8217; prepaid cards offerings could be leveraged.</p>
