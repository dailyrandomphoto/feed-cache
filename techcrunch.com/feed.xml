					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 20, 2022! Today’s theme is <em>more</em>. Sure, the creator economy grew last year, but this year more major platforms are working to help power individual artists. And sure, last year was one of the best for crypto startups, but now even more big companies are getting into the mix. Oh and Peloton is having a terrible day. Let’s talk about it! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260431" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>P.S. Early Stage is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/techcrunch-early-stage-2022-is-back-live-in-san-francisco/">back in San Francisco this year</a>, so <em>see you there!</em></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/peloton-reportedly-pauses-bike-and-treadmill-production-amid-slowed-demand/">Peloton reportedly halts production</a>: Remember when you couldn’t buy a Peloton bike because there wasn’t enough supply? The company is having the opposite issue now, with more supply than demand. Shares of the 2019 IPO were down sharply today. It appears clear that the pandemic trade, once a key influencer of corporate value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">is over</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/twitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature/">Twitter rolls out NFT support</a>: If you’re a member of Twitter’s subscription service, you will soon have the ability to connect a crypto wallet and use an NFT that you own as your profile picture. This is going to make some of you happy and some of you angry. Regardless of what you think of the news, that Twitter took the time to build the feature is indicative of where the market is likely heading this year. Speaking of which, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/facebook-and-instagram-may-help-you-create-and-sell-nfts/">Facebook and Instagram are apparently also getting into the NFT game</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">Plaid buys Cognito</a>: After the huge Plaid-Visa deal fell through over regulatory hurdles, the fintech API company has been busy. It raised more money, pushed its valuation above $13 billion, and has since been busy building and buying other companies. Today’s news is that the company bought Cognito for around a quarter billion dollars to layer more services atop its core API business.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before the news deluge, a few notes. First, <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> wrote something lovely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/dont-underestimate-first-time-founders/">about first-time founders</a> and how market fetishization of serial founders could be leading to new entrepreneurs not getting their due. Given that a number of recent unicorns were founded by new builders instead of those going around the block for the second, third or 10th time, she may be onto something.</p>
<p>And after dodging drops in startup investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/changes-to-corporate-investing-rules-could-diminish-chinas-resilient-venture-landscape/">the Chinese venture capital market could be facing new stress</a>. Perhaps this time, really, we’ll see the declines that many anticipated.</p>
<p>And now, the newsroll:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/berlins-cherry-ventures-launches-fourth-fund-at-340m-for-early-stage-tech-and-web3/">Cherry Ventures lands $340M</a>: The German venture capital firm with an interest in early-stage tech has new capital for its third fund. It also invests in blockchain tech, Mike Butcher reports. With prior funds, the group put capital into Flink and SellerX, among other startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/2fa-compromise-led-to-34m-crypto-com-hack/">How the Crypto.com hack went down</a>: It turns out it was a 2FA compromise that caused the heavily advertised cryptocurrency firm to lose customer funds and temporarily halt withdrawals. This sort of hack might seem, well, standard at this point in time, but it’s still not? It’s still very bad? And perhaps even surprising given that bitcoin was first discussed back in 2008. I wonder what Matt Damon thinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tbd-launch/">Sexual health is a growth industry</a>: That’s our lesson from our writeup of TBD Health, which provides “ a fresh new approach with at-home [STI] testing made available for vagina-havers.” It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/25/infinite-revenue-multiples/">reminds me of Juna</a>, which means that the at-home STI testing market has a neat competitive landscape to track.</li>
<li>Remember no-code? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/prophecy-raises-25m-for-its-low-code-data-engineering-platform/">It’s everywhere again</a>. When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/softrs-series-a-is-a-reminder-that-the-no-code-boom-continues/">covered the Softr round the other day</a>, we asked internally what had happened to all the no-code rounds. Well, here they are. Today it’s Prophecy raising $25 million for its “low-code data engineering platform.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/weavits-new-app-wants-to-be-a-shazam-for-your-thoughts/">Shazam for your thoughts</a>: Startup Weavit wants to “offer people a different way to quickly capture their thoughts in a note-taking tool with the press of a button, which are then matched to other content in a broader knowledge base” TechCrunch writes. Does the world need another note-taking tool? Apparently, the answer is yes. I kid, my brain is a colander with extra-large holes; I need all the help I can get.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/codesee-pulls-in-a-7m-secondary-seed-to-build-out-code-visualization-platform/">CodeSee does what it says on the tin</a>: There’s a startup in the market called CodeSee. What does it do? Help you <em>see</em> your <em>code</em>. Hell yeah obvious startup names. In this case, code visualization is the name of the game. Why does that matter? As Ron Miller explains, it helps folks see how code fits together. Given that my C++ never compiled I am not one to talk, but this does seem like a pretty neat idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/south-koreas-agtech-startup-greenlabs-raises-140m-series-c-to-accelerate-global-expansion/">Green Labs raises $140M</a>: Perhaps we need to hire a few agtech reporters. The space really does seem to be heating up. (Just like the planet! Heyo!) The company has now raised a total of $170 million for its digital services for the farming world, including, we write, “an app that aggregates reliable data using AI, giving more than 500,000 farmers insight into crop lifecycle.” Farming is hard, so 1.5 cheers for food growers getting new tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>And to close us out, quantum computing. Very much akin to self-driving cars, quantum computing has always felt a little <em>not quite yet</em>. And yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/terra-quantum-raises-60m-for-its-quantum-as-a-service-platform/">Terra Quantum, a Swiss company, is now offering quantum as a service in the market</a>. Yes, you can access early quantum systems. I suppose our real question is when mainstreamization will occur. Terra, we bet, would answer that with a “soon.”</p>

<p>Whether it’s done informally via a Reddit AMA or a Twitter Space, it’s never a bad idea to directly engage with the people who use your products and services.</p>
<p>Customer personas are useful, but talking to a customer is better if you want to understand what delights them — and what they’re willing to pay for.</p>
<p>With a product advisory council (PAC), early-stage startups can tap into their customers’ hive mind. The benefits are many: PACs can validate everything from marketing campaigns to future product planning.</p>
<p>But to build one, founders must first define clear goals and create value for participants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A major Senate bill that would prevent tech companies from giving preference to their own products and services just passed a significant hurdle in Congress, bringing it one step closer to becoming law.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee voted today on the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992/text"> American Innovation and Choice Online Act,</a> moving the prominent antitrust bill toward a vote before the full Senate. The bill passed its committee vote 16-6 Thursday, with five Republicans joining Senate Democrats to press forward with the legislation.</p>
<p>The bill would prohibit tech platforms from &#8220;favoring their own products or services, disadvantaging rivals, or discriminating among businesses that use their platforms in a manner that would materially harm competition on the platform.&#8221; It would also forbid dominant platforms from preventing interoperability with other services and from leveraging another company&#8217;s data on the platform to compete against them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To accomplish its goals, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would empower antitrust enforcers with &#8220;strong, flexible tools,&#8221; including &#8220;civil penalties, authority to seek broad injunctions, emergency interim relief, and potential forfeiture of executive compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, hailed the legislation as the first major tech competition bill to head toward the Senate floor “since the dawn of the internet.” The bill could still see changes from a handful of amendments that didn&#8217;t impede its progress Thursday but may still impact its final language.</p>
<p>While it still has an uphill slog to make it into a crowded and mostly stalled out legislative agenda, the bill&#8217;s momentum was significant enough to prompt Google and Apple to both weigh in with comments earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, millions of Americans use online services like Google Search, Maps and Gmail to find new information and get things done,” Alphabet Global Affairs President and Chief Legal Officer Kent Walker <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;&#8230;Legislation being debated in the House and Senate could break these and other popular online services, making them less helpful and less secure, and damaging American competitiveness.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple also sought to intervene,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-18/apple-tells-senate-that-big-tech-bills-will-harm-iphone-privacy"> penning a letter</a> to Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, the committee’s ranking Republican Chuck Grassley as well as Antitrust Subcommittee Chair Amy Klobuchar that subcommittee’s ranking member Mike Lee.</p>
<p>“After a tumultuous year that witnessed multiple controversies regarding social media, whistle-blower allegations of long-ignored risks to children, and ransomware attacks that hobbled critical infrastructure, it would be ironic if Congress responds by making it much harder to protect the privacy and security of Americans’ personal devices,” Apple Senior Director of Government Affairs Tim Powderly wrote. “Unfortunately, that is what these bills would do.”</p>
<p>Both companies argued that the bill along with another piece of legislation, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">Open App Markets Act</a>, would be a detriment to consumer security. The latter bill would force companies that control operating systems to allow third-party apps and app stores and allow developers to tell consumers where they could find the same software at better prices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="a31mBn9QfD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/">A new Senate bill would totally upend Apple and Google&#8217;s app store dominance</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A new Senate bill would totally upend Apple and Google&#8217;s app store dominance&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/open-app-markets-act-app-stores-apple-google/embed/#?secret=a31mBn9QfD" data-secret="a31mBn9QfD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=8EFB46FB-24A6-4BC9-8540-26686F72EF96">group of tech companies</a> that included Yelp, DuckDuckGo, Sonos, Spotify, Proton, Match Group and the startup accelerator Y Combinator along with the venture capital firm Initialized Capital spoke out in favor of the anti-self preferencing legislation earlier this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Findings from the United States and governments around the world reveal the many anticompetitive self-preferencing tactics dominant technology companies use to attain and entrench their gatekeeper status in the market to the detriment of competition, consumers, and innovation,&#8221; the companies wrote. &#8220;The American Innovation and Choice Online Act&#8230; targets self-preferencing to help restore competition in the digital marketplace and remove barriers for consumers to choose the services they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regulating the tech industry is a rare issue that inspires bipartisan cooperation in Congress — another sign that the tech industry should expect new restrictions on its business, even if those proposals still progress at a crawl.</p>
<p>The bill was introduced by by Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and is co-sponsored by Dick Durbin (D-IL), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Kennedy (R-LA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mark Warner (D-VA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Steve Daines (R-MT).</p>
<p>The House version of the bill, led by House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI) and Ranking Member Ken Buck (R-CO), is already out of committee and ready for a vote.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last summer, Samsung announced that – for the first time in a decade – it wouldn’t be releasing a new Note. The future of the well-loved phablet was a big, open question, as the hardware giant acknowledged a shift in focus to foldables, a form factor it felt was finally ready for a truly mainstream push.</p>
<p>Further muddying the waters is the Galaxy S line – Samsung’s primary flagship, which has steadily been blurring the line separating itself from the Note. “Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around,” the company’s president wrote at the time, “we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.”</p>
<p>That’s meant a fairly steady increase in the S series’ screen sizes over the years, culminating with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/samsungs-galaxy-s21-line-arrives-with-camera-bumps-price-drops-and-s-pen-compatibility/">addition of S-Pen functionality for the S21 Ultra last January</a>. In August, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/samsungs-latest-galaxy-fold-adds-stylus-support-waterproofing-and-an-underdisplay-camera/">also brought its proprietary stylus to the Galaxy Fold line</a> leaving some wondering whether the Note was quietly being phased out.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260480" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Coming fresh off CES and staring down the face of MWC, we find ourselves entering Unpacked territory – the time of year when the company announces the latest additions to the S series. Roh is back with another somewhat vaguely worded post that celebrates the life of the Note’s life, pointing out how its 5.3-inch display caused a minor stir back in 2011. It seems quaint now, though it’s worth pointing out for those who weren’t at the IFA unveiling, that big screens meant much larger and thicker devices than they do now.</p>
<p><a href="https://smsng.news/3566pVH.">The post</a> strongly suggests a proper merging of the two flagships to make more room for its foldables.</p>
<p>“With every fresh evolution of Samsung Galaxy devices, we have introduced features that redefine the entire mobile category,” the executive writes. “And we’re about to rewrite the rules of industry once again. At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most <strong>noteworthy</strong> S series [emphasis added by TC] device we’ve ever created. The next generation of Galaxy S is here, bringing together the greatest experiences of our Samsung Galaxy into one ultimate device.”</p>
<p>“Noteworthy” could mean a lot of things in this context. The most obvious seems to be an S22 Ultra becoming the S22 Note. Does that mean a proper stylus slot? Could we be seeing further S Pen integration across the lines? I&#8217;d say most likely not to that one, if only because the carefully worded post uses the singular &#8220;noteworthy device.&#8221; There are still some big questions in the lead up to the event – which may or may not be answered early, given the frequency of leaks surrounding these devices. Also on-tap for the line are improved night/low-light photos and a more sustainable design, which has become a priority for the company in recent years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung is once again betting that consumer excitement and brand loyalty will be enough to get users on-board, sight unseen as it gets set to open reservations for the new smartphone and an unnamed Galaxy tablet tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Music streaming is continuing to grow around the world. According to a new <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/music-subscriber-market-shares-q2-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report from MIDiA</a>, an entertainment research firm, 523.9 million people subscribed to a music streaming service globally as of the second quarter of 2021. This marks a 109.5 million (26.4%) increase since the previous year.</p>
<p>Though Spotify remains the most-subscribed streaming service, owning 31% of the market, its dominance is very slowly decreasing &#8212; it held 33% of the market in 2020, and 34% in 2019. Spotify added more total subscribers in the year leading up to Q2 2021 than its competitors, but while Spotify grew by 20%, Amazon Music grew by 25%. Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s YouTube Music grew by more than 50% over the year leading up to Q2 2021, making it the only Western streamer to have increased its overall share of the global market. The Chinese gaming giant Tencent, which operates Tencent Music, owns the same percent market share as Amazon Music.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260393" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2260393 size-large" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?w=680" alt="A pie chart showing the percent market share of music streamers: Spotify has 31%, Apple Music 15%, Amazon Music has 13%, Tencent has 13%, and Youtube Music has 8%." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/cover_image-1642508252.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIDiA</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market share of Amazon Music and Apple Music may continue to grow &#8212; because this report only covers up to Q2 2021, it won&#8217;t show the impact of lossless audio coming to both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">Apple</a> in May. Nearly a year ago, Spotify teased that it would launch a high-end subscription called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify Hi-Fi</a>, which would give subscribers their music in a &#8220;CD-quality, lossless audio format.&#8221; But Spotify <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/All-Platforms-Music-HiFi-Quality-Lossless-Streaming-16bit-44/idi-p/700006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still hasn&#8217;t said</a> when this product might become available.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Tidal, which has historically targeted consumers who seek a higher-quality audio experience. Though Tidal&#8217;s lossless audio tier is $9.99 per month &#8212; the same cost as Apple Music, and just two dollars a month more than Amazon Music &#8212; Tidal owns less than 2% of global market share, according to MIDiA&#8217;s report. Founded by Jay-Z and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/square-buys-majority-of-tidal-adds-jay-z-to-its-board-in-bid-to-shake-up-the-artist-economy/">acquired</a> by Block, Tidal markets itself as a service that helps artists share their music &#8220;precisely as the artist intended&#8221; (i.e. with extremely good audio quality).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2260463" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260463" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2260463 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?w=336" alt="Tidal fan centered royalties interface" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png 1746w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=768,1553 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=760,1536 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=1013,2048 1013w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fancentered-Ambre.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2260463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Tidal</p></div></p>
<p>But under Block&#8217;s ownership, the idea of an artist-friendly streaming service isn&#8217;t just about sound &#8212; now, the company is experimenting with ways to make music streaming more profitable for artists. At the start of this year, Tidal introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/tidal-is-investing-direct-artist-payments-a-step-toward-fair-streaming-payouts/">fan-centered royalties</a> to its top HiFi Plus tier ($19.99/month), which means that 10% of a user&#8217;s subscription will go directly to their most-listened-to artists.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Will this move help Tidal earn new subscribers who care about paying artists more than master-quality audio? It&#8217;s a worthy try &#8212; after all, the user-centric payment streamer Deezer has a full 2% of the pie, which is more than Tidal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://foundationcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation Capital</a>, an early-stage venture firm with offices in Palo Alto and San Francisco, has been around for 27 years, in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/foundation-capital-now-24-years-old-just-closed-its-ninth-fund-with-350-million-in-capital-commitments/">many iterations</a>. It has been sprawling, it has been small, it has thrived, it has teetered.</p>
<p>In 2022, it&#8217;s in expansion mode once again. Three years after closing its ninth fund with $350 million in capital commitments with three general partners, the firm is announcing that it has secured $500 million for its tenth flagship fund. It now has six general partners, having promoted two of its investors to general partner and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/foundation-capital-hires-rhode-island-based-angus-davis-as-its-newest-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired</a> former founder Angus Davis. And it has a lot of deals in its portfolio that undoubtedly continue to excite its investors.</p>
<p>Among these is the fast-growing NFT marketplace OpenSea, the buzzy public blockchain platform Solana (Foundation was its first institutional investor) and Cohesity, a data management vendor that confidentially filed to go public last month and is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/softbank-backed-cohesity-files-confidentially-for-ipo?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> seeking a valuation of between $5 billion and $10 billion. (For context, Cohesity was valued by its private investors last March at $3.7 billion.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>How to explain Foundation&#8217;s rebound? Strong connections to founders and their various networks would seem to explain part of it. It&#8217;s a benefit enjoyed by any firm that has been around the block a few times and treated people well en route.</p>
<p>Foundation has also more aggressively embraced the unknown, moving away from metrics and toward individuals who haven’t started a company yet but are on the cusp of making the jump. These might be operators inside big companies, or founders who are preparing to do battle in the startup arena again, or teams preparing to spin out of academia and into the business world. As explains Ashu Garg, who joined Foundation in 2008 and is now one of its longest-serving general partners, “Our goal is to have a handshake deal with someone as they&#8217;re ready to start the company. That&#8217;s the business that we&#8217;re in. There is no company. <em>That</em> is our business model.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CY0tgdP5Nm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/joanne-chen/">Joanne Chen just became the first woman GP at Foundation Capital since founder Kathryn Gould</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Joanne Chen just became the first woman GP at Foundation Capital since founder Kathryn Gould&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/joanne-chen/embed/#?secret=CY0tgdP5Nm" data-secret="CY0tgdP5Nm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It almost sounds comical. Yet it&#8217;s no joke. Given the amount of capital in the market today &#8212; all of it driving valuations sky high for even fledgling companies &#8212; Foundation is joined by a growing number of venture firms that now zero in on individuals rather than wait on actual products or teams to form. As VC Mark Suster of Upfront Ventures in LA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/vc-mark-suster-the-bet-were-making-now-is-on-founder-skills-not-customers-or-products/">recently told us</a> of his own team, &#8220;We’ll even take a risk on you want to leave your company . . . We will back you at formation — at day zero.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of Foundation&#8217;s go-earlier strategy centers on incubating companies. Some of the startups to rise up inside of Foundation in recent years include Cerebras, an AI chip and system startup company that was valued at more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/artificial-intelligence-chip-startup-nabs-4-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$4 billion</a> in a November round; the digital title, escrow and closing company Doma (formerly States Title), which went public last year after merging with a blank-check company (it has been a <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/doma-goes-public-but-investors-cash-out-early/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bumpy ride</a> since); and Turing, an outfit that helps source, vet and connect developers with tech companies that need them, and which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/turing-books-87m-at-a-1-1b-valuation-to-help-source-hire-and-manage-engineers-remotely/">$87 million</a> in Series D funding last month.</p>
<p>Foundation, like other firms, is also plugging more money not just into startups but emerging venture firms that give it access to new networks and ideas. Steve Vassallo, another longtime general partner at the firm, says it has committed roughly $15 million in recent years into at least 53 different venture outfits that serve as &#8220;beacons&#8221; for Foundation deals.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YU2b847Hhj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/">Bain Capital Ventures raised $1.3 billion to fund young startups, and young VC firms, too</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bain Capital Ventures raised $1.3 billion to fund young startups, and young VC firms, too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/embed/#?secret=YU2b847Hhj" data-secret="YU2b847Hhj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not last, Foundation has evolved the way that it learns what&#8217;s bubbling up. Joanne Chen, a longtime member of the team who was promoted to general partner last year and is very focused on artificial intelligence, engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm has partners who spend 10 hours a day trying to figure out which projects on GitHub are taking off,&#8221; says Vassallo. The team &#8212; which is very focused on the &#8220;automation of the enterprise&#8221; and fintech &#8212; is also spending far more time these days in Discord channels. &#8220;That&#8217;s for sure where our crypto team is,&#8221; says Vassallo, adding that &#8220;it&#8217;s not a fabulous platform, but it&#8217;s the best of what exists&#8221; for those hunting down web3 and DeFi deals.</p>
<p>If Foundation feels pressured to become even more inventive in this go-go market, it isn&#8217;t admitting as much.</p>
<p>Asked about crazy acts that Foundation has either seen or committed to land a deal, Vassallo says he is aware of &#8220;extensive love letters&#8221; that certain Foundation portfolio companies have received between financings, but he says his partners are content for now to walk and talk with founders around Stanford&#8217;s campus or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/the-floating-utopia-of-salesforce-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salesforce Park</a> in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p>Garg echoes the sentiment, saying that he thinks &#8220;some of the crazier things folks are doing to get the attention of founders will be tempered as markets settle down a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He insists that Foundation would never engage in such antics either way. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking with founders before they&#8217;ve changed their LinkedIn. If we&#8217;re talking with someone at the same time as Tiger [Global], then we&#8217;ve failed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been pretty astonishing to see what robotics researchers have been able to accomplish with legged robots over the past few years. Oregon State University taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/cassie-the-bipedal-robot-runs-a-5k/">Cassie for a 5K back in July springs to mind</a>. This week researchers at ETH Zurich announced that they were stretching their own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/the-anymal-inspection-robot-gives-spot-some-four-legged-competition/">ANYmal robot’s</a> physical capabilities in similar fashion by <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2022/01/how-robots-learn-to-hike.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">training it climb a nearby mountain</a>.</p>
<p>The team trained the quadruped (which bears more than a passing resemblance to Boston Dynamics’ work) to walk up nearby Mount Etzel, a modest summit that stands some 1,098 meters (3,600 feet) above sea level. The team says the robot was able to make the 120 vertical meter hike in 31 minutes &#8212; a full four minutes faster than is standard for human hikers. Doubly impressive is that the robot apparently accomplished the task without stumbling or mis-stepping &#8212; more than a lot of humans can probably say.</p>

<p>Researchers say the feat was accomplished by way of a control scheme recently highlighted in a scientific journal that combines imaging with tactile feedback. The pairing makes it easier for the robot to operate on uneven terrain and in low visbility &#8212; both frequent issues while hiking. Based on the feedback, the robot determines, among other things, how cautiously it needs to make its steps. The tech was initially tried in a virtual environment before the quadruped went up the mountain.</p>
<p>“The robot has learned to combine visual perception of its environment with proprioception – its sense of touch – based on direct leg contact,” lead researcher Marco Hutter says in a release. “This allows it to tackle rough terrain faster, more efficiently and, above all, more robustly,” Hutter says. In the future, ANYmal can be used anywhere that is too dangerous for humans or too impassable for other robots.</p>
<p>The ability to maintain steady footing on uneven terrain is a key feature roboticists have been working to develop in quadrupeds. Utilizing such real-time processing could ultimately prove useful for robots sent into dangerous situations to keep humans out of harm’s way.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year set a new record for public exits, with more than 844 U.S. companies going public via an initial public offering (IPO), a direct listing, or through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). That’s 105% higher than 2020, which saw 410 similar companies go public, according to PitchBook.</p>
<p>The 20 largest U.S. IPOs generated an estimated $41 billion in pre-tax value for employees who held stock options in those companies.</p>
<p>Record public exit activity is good news for founders and investors, but what about the employees who were granted stock options in those companies?</p>
<p>We dove into our proprietary data as well as publicly available data filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to uncover defining trends for employees from late-stage unicorns in 2021.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of what we found:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Employees could have paid less in taxes by exercising their stock options before their company went public.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their stock options post-exit, rather than pre-exit.</li>
<li>On average, Secfi clients paid $543,254 in 2021 to exercise their pre-exit stock options (roughly double their annual household income), with taxes accounting for 73% of the cost.</li>
<li>Employees at companies that went public in 2021 saved nearly $415,000, on average, by exercising before an IPO.</li>
<li>Pre-exit stock option exercise rates vary widely from company to company, from as little as 2.4% on the low end to more than 77% on the high end, which could represent an indication of employee confidence in their company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>$11 billion in unnecessary taxes paid in 2021</h2>
<p>In 2021, employees working at VC-backed U.S. startups that went public paid an estimated $11 billion in extra taxes because they waited to exercise their stock options post-exit, per a Secfi estimate of 172 U.S.-based, VC-backed public exits.</p>
<p>Employees could have paid less in taxes by exercising their stock options before their company went public. Doing so could have also maximized their gains when selling their shares. In 2021, high stock option exercise costs remained a major barrier to people exercising their stock options early.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sexual health isn&#8217;t the taboo it once was, but that doesn&#8217;t mean everything is all roses and unicorns in the land of STI testing. <a href="https://www.tbd.health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBD Health</a> is taking a fresh new approach with at-home testing made available for vagina-havers. The company has been offering <a href="https://www.tbd.health/products/the-5-panel-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a five-panel &#8220;check yourself out&#8221; kit for at-home testing</a>, and recently opened an in-person clinic in Las Vegas. I spoke to the two co-founders to find out why there&#8217;s a need for at-home sexual health services.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/prevalence-incidence-cost-2020.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STI rates in the United States have continued to climb over the last several years</a>, reaching a sixth consecutive all-time high per data reported in 2021. One in five people in the U.S. has an STI, half of them among young people aged 15-24, costing $16 billion in direct medical costs. Suffice to say, TBD is going after a market that ought to be shrinking, but isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that access to screening is key, and people have less access today than they did before. This is in part because of COVID &#8212; people don&#8217;t want to go to the doctor&#8217;s office &#8212; and a lot of federal funding has made it trickier. We built this company to provide empowering STI screening that really works in people&#8217;s routines, starting with our at-home kit. We took a very different approach to how most other medical companies do, so it doesn&#8217;t feel clinical or high-stakes,&#8221; shares Stephanie Estey, co-founder at TBD Health. &#8220;We really wanted to make a screening feel as though it was on your terms. We launched a pilot earlier this year in six states.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TBD Health&#8217;s at-home testing services are available in Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts, Florida and Connecticut &#8212; and the company is planning to roll out to more states, but there are regulatory challenges on the path to full 50-state coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone tests positive, we can provide treatment for almost everything. Our clinician will set up a time to talk to you about your personalized care plan &#8212; it&#8217;s not an ananonymous &#8216;here&#8217;s a generic care plan you need to follow to go figure it out with your provider&#8217;. For the most part, the vast majority of infections, the ones that require antibiotics, for instance, is something that we can get you that prescription to make sure that you have treatment,&#8221; explains Estey. Of course, the clinician requirement means that the team needs a home base in every state in which they operate. &#8220;We do have a medical team in each state, so you have a clinician reviewing all the results, signing off on the lab request and then processing results or doing the prescribing. Right now it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re in six states, but we are expanding quickly in 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company suggests that they can test for all the same STIs that your usual doctor could test for, but relies on a self-collection protocol. There&#8217;s a self-collect vaginal swab, a urine sample and a blood sample. The latter, in particular, piqued my interest, as my mind went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venipuncture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">venipuncture draws</a> &#8212; but it turns out that it&#8217;s possible to do a finger-prick test, let some blood fall on a collection card, which then can be used by the team to run the assays and determine if treatment is required.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use what&#8217;s known as a dried blood spot card. It&#8217;s basically a piece of paper that has a few circles that you saturate with your blood using a finger prick lancet &#8212; similar to what diabetics do on a daily basis to test themselves. Through this card, we can test you for all major blood-based STIs, including HIV, syphilis. It&#8217;s actually kind of an incredible tool; I think it was developed for testing babies in hospitals because it&#8217;s hard to do draws on a baby,&#8221; explains Estey. &#8220;It lends itself really well to at-home testing because it stays stable throughout transport.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2260292" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2260292" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2260292" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TBD260.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2260292" class="wp-caption-text">The in-person clicic TBD Health opened in Las Vegas, with its at-home testing boxes on the wall in the background. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TBD Health</p></div></p>
<p>The company claims it retains the accuracy of more traditional STI testing protocols.</p>
<p>&#8220;In lab testing there are two main metrics for accuracy, and that&#8217;s sensitivity and specificity, and so we did a lot of vetting of a lot of labs. Our lab partners have comparable sensitivity and specificity, and that means it&#8217;s just as accurate. And you can do it from the privacy of your own home,&#8221; says Estey. &#8220;You&#8217;re supported through telemedicine with our clinical care team.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to have in-person care, too, <a href="https://vegas.tbd.health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBD opened a care hub in Las Vegas</a>, with the goal of creating an environment where the company can get a deeper view of the needs of its customers, with the hope of translating the learnings to better service for the other side of the business.</p>
<p>For now, the team is focusing on vagina-havers. The team tells me this is mostly because they carry not just the burden of STIs, but there&#8217;s also a fertility angle to consider. In order to give the best possible service, they&#8217;ve chosen to focus their attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really focused on serving women and vagina owners right now. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re ready to say where serving penis-owners falls on our roadmap. Penis-owners are absolutely a contributor in terms of transmissions. But for women, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the burden is not just in terms of cost and stigma, but also fertility in many cases. STIs are actually the number one preventable cause of infertility in the U.S.,&#8221; Estey points out. &#8220;When we think about expanding what our focus is, we want to make sure that we are serving those people correctly. There have been so many examples of companies that get it wrong. The equivalence would be to make something for women by turning it pink &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t work like that. I think TBD is really excited to be going deep because we know vagina owners so well and we know how to best serve them. When we think about offering something to penis owners, we want to make sure that we are being as thoughtful and as deep, so we are doing justice just as we have done that for people with vaginas.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Calling an event after it has happened is lazy newswriter cliche, but it is fair today to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">the pandemic trade</a> is over.</p>
<p>The concept was pretty simple: As COVID-19 spread across the planet, lockdowns and a general desire by many to avoid infection led to huge changes to how people lived and worked. The impact was wide-reaching.</p>
<p>First, the stock market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/saas-stocks-drop-over-8-reaching-bear-market-territory/">did its best impression of a falling rock</a>, crashing lower and lower as fears about economic decline spread. Even the ever-ebullient venture capital class took a brief pause from normal levels of investing exuberance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But then folks realized that, yes, some businesses were going to suffer thanks to the new economic landscape that COVID brought, but not all. So they bid up the value of those assets above their perhaps fair value, as many other investments were risky. This made the value of some firms escalate into orbit.</p>
<p>Software, in particular, was a winner, with the valuations of tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/in-public-and-private-markets-cloud-earnings-and-valuations-heat-up/">rising sharply in the back half of 2020</a> through much of 2021. Then, as last year reached its final weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">that began to change</a>.</p>

<p>The worth of publicly trade software companies fell sharply enough that, on the year, all gains for cloud firms were wiped out. The selloff continued into 2022, with further declines now cutting into software valuation gains from even 2020.</p>
<p>The pandemic trade for software is over, and valuations are coming back to Earth. The same thing is happening to other companies, including those who made a mint in the home exercise markets, like Peloton. The value of Peloton, which went public in 2019, shot higher and many people were very stoked.</p>
<p>But the shine has come off the silver:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If it’s possible for a first-time founder to build a billion-dollar company, why don’t we talk about it more often?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French payroll startup PayFit is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">now valued at $2.1 billion</a> after raising a $289 million Series E round. It&#8217;s not France&#8217;s only recent unicorn, though: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/spendesk-is-the-fifth-french-startup-to-reach-unicorn-status-this-month/">Spendesk</a> also joined the club this month.</p>
<p>If you add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market</a>’s $510 million Series E round valuing the company at $5.7 billion, things are shaping up well for French tech in 2022.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the pace of new unicorn creation and fundraising generated plenty of press coverage in France, but there&#8217;s an article in particular that caught my attention: A <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/portraits/french-tech-ces-4-patrons-qui-ont-fonde-une-licorne-des-leur-coup-dessai-1377044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portrait</a> of PayFit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/firmin-zocchetto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firmin Zocchetto</a>, OVHcloud&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/octave-klaba-3a0b3632/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Octave Klaba</a>, Shift Technology&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-jawish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Jawish</a>, and Contentsquare&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathancherki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Cherki</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260211" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As French financial newspaper Les Echos pointed out, these four French Tech founders have another thing in common: They founded a unicorn on the first try.</p>
<p>If it’s possible for a first-time founder to build a billion-dollar company, why don’t we talk about it more often?</p>
<p>Sure, entrepreneurs sometimes get press for being under 30, as Zocchetto is. But even 20-somethings aren&#8217;t always first-time founders – Glovo&#8217;s <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/oscarpierremi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Pierre</a> isn&#8217;t, for instance.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t about young founders. It&#8217;s about remembering that regardless of their age, first-time founders can build huge companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Weirdly, this seems underrated in the startup ecosystem. This fact reminded me of a funny outburst from Expensify CEO David Barrett when I first interviewed him for my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">deep dive</a> into his company, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">since gone public</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think the whole idea of the serial entrepreneur is a weird concept. The only time there&#8217;s a &#8216;serial anything&#8217; is &#8216;serial killer.&#8217; </em></p>
<p><em>Imagine a &#8216;serial parent.&#8217; I find someone, I fall in love, I have a bunch of kids. And then I leave, and I do it all over again. And then I say I started seven families. You&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re a monster.&#8221; But if you do that as a CEO, we celebrate that! &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s great, what a great job.&#8221; </em></p>
<p><em>There are so many weird incentives in Silicon Valley, and all the hero stories of Silicon Valley are wrapped up in this really morbid concept of serial entrepreneurs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Expensify isn&#8217;t Barrett&#8217;s first startup, but as someone who set out to &#8220;build a company that [he] wanted to work at forever,&#8221; praise of the &#8220;serial founder&#8221; concept is a pet peeve of his. He has a point: There&#8217;s nothing wrong with long-term commitment, and there&#8217;s something inherently wrong about glamorizing serial entrepreneurs for the sake of it.</p>
<p>This is not to say that experience has no value, but that it comes in many forms. Having founded another company brings lessons, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. However, it is perhaps equally valuable for a founder to have relevant industry experience, especially if it is directly related to the problem that they are tackling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to VC checklists, years of industry experience at unsexy companies don&#8217;t tick a box in the same way as having had a C-level role at a former startup. This is especially true in places such as Latin America, where the market is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">split into two tiers</a> – hot or not.</p>
<p>Latin American VC <a href="https://twitter.com/hernanharo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hernan Haro</a> confirmed my perception: &#8220;Most Latin American VCs are chasing the same entrepreneurs, those &#8216;proven&#8217; by a track record as founders or past leadership roles at unicorns. Granted, they are more successful at raising capital, but that&#8217;s more of a self-fulfilling prophecy than anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pattern matching is part of what VCs do, but when they are looking at the wrong signals, they are doing a disservice to themselves and to their LPs. &#8220;VCs looking only at &#8216;proven&#8217; founders are seeing correlation, not causality, and missing out on opportunities,&#8221; Haro said.</p>
<p>That VCs are missing out on opportunities doesn&#8217;t keep me awake at night. After all, it creates space for others, such as Haro&#8217;s seed fund <a href="https://mrpink.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MrPink</a>. My concern is with founders; out of the spotlight, first-time entrepreneurs might not be getting the resources they need.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are more and more resources available for founders in general – not just capital, but also helpful communities and content from trusted sources.</p>
<p>For instance, it is now possible to find online advice from leading venture funds on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/">how to raise your first dollars</a> or to get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/hear-from-these-amazing-investors-and-founders-on-techcrunch-live-this-february/">pitch feedback</a> from one of their partners, when a few years ago it would mostly happen behind closed doors within top accelerators.</p>
<p>Quality online resources are particularly valuable for first-time founders, not just for the knowledge, but also as a reminder not to underestimate themselves. Experimenting and bootstrapping are also great ways to learn, and VCs who overlook this type of profile may come to regret it.</p>
<p>My prediction, though, is that competition for hot deals will push VCs to look beyond their turf and pay more attention to first-time entrepreneurs. Let&#8217;s just hope it&#8217;s not only young ones or those who tick other boxes (top accelerators, top schools, etc.) – but simply those who are capable of delivering high returns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve met with Misty’s founders a number of times over the years, often in hotel suites at CES where the company was showing off their humanoid robot’s latest capability. The firm started life in mid-2017, as a spinoff of Sphero, which was dealing with its own growing pains at the time, moving from entertaining robots with help from Disney IP to a purely educationally-focused firm.</p>
<p>The company began life under the Sphero banner, led by co-founder Ian Bernstein, coming out of stealth with an $11.5 million Series A led by Venrock and Foundry Group. The company launched an adorable little wheeled robot, designed to be, in part, a development platform for things like hospitality.</p>
<p>Misty’s journey will continue, but things are about to look different from the startup, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/furhat-buys-misty/">recently acquired by Swedish firm Furhat Robotics</a>. The latter says it will be keeping a number of Misty senior staff on-board as it looks to incorporate the technology into its own products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For us, Misty is the piece that was missing. It helps us access a larger market focusing on education, for example,” co-founder and CEO Samer Al Moubayed tells TechCrunch. “The technologies are very similar, but Misty is great at the hardware front, and we are very strong on software. Instead of building a new robot for educational use, Furhat decided to start looking for another solution.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259792" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259792" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2259792" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/yt1s.com-Misty-Robotics-is-now-part-of-the-Furhat-family.2022-01-19-17_52_53.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259792" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Furhat</p></div></p>
<p>Misty is, at the very least, immediately less jarring than Furhat’s rear-projected face. The company notes on its About Page, “Animated projection allows for smoother facial movements as opposed to mechatronic designs, meaning Furhat falls short of the Uncanny Valley effect that most people feel when seeing a robot that appears almost lifelike, but fails to mimic a realistic human.” Uncanny? Maybe not. Unnerving? A bit, yeah.</p>
<p>Anyone in the industry can tell you the importance of creating a kind of emotional bond with a robot. I’ve heard stories about everyone from Roomba owners to manufacturing floor workers sticking googly eyes on their robots to humanize them. Or take all of those viral Boston Dynamics videos of robots dancing to Motown and Katy Perry. It takes the edge off when we see these machines are more human or animal-like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/could-humanlike-behavior-make-smart-devices-more-engaging-mit-researchers-think-so/">A recent MIT Media Lab paper</a> confirms what we sort of already knew on that front. People respond better to machines when they display some of these characteristics. This particular study focused on smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Nest. Pitted against bygone social robot Jibo, researchers reported greater interaction when the machine does something as simple as pointing its head toward the speaker in the way a person or animal would.</p>
<p>Says MIT, “[P]arcipants interacted with a Jibo robot, Amazon Echo, and Google Home, with no modifications. Most found the Jibo to be far more outgoing, dependable, and sympathetic. Because the users perceived that Jibo had a more humanlike personality, they were more likely to interact with it, [research assistant Anastasia] Ostrowski explains.”</p>
<p>Of course, Amazon has taken a step in that direction with its home robot Astro, but the device’s $1,500 price tag makes it quite cost prohibitive. And while the company insists it&#8217;s taking the category seriously, we still feel a long ways away from any sort of mainstream success for an Astro, Jibo or Misty. Crossing that threshold is going to require a dramatic reduction in cost and increase in functionality that can make it feel more accessible and like less of a toy. In the meantime, education is a fairly practical path for Furhat/Misty, going forward.</p>

<p>There was a pair of big rounds courtesy of French robotics startups this week. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec raised</a> a beefy $335 million Series D, which puts the firm’s valuation at $2 billion. The company deals in the familiar territory of warehouse automation, but takes a fairly novel approach to the category. That comes courtesy of its “Skypods,” which roll around autonomously and then climb up the side of a rack and pull down a bin. It’s an extremely clever solution, particularly in densely packed warehouses, as Romain notes in his piece.</p>
<p>“While the entire logistics sector is fraught with uncertainty, one of the most prevalent challenges is ongoing labor shortages,&#8221; CEO Romain Moulin said in a statement. &#8220;Exotec pioneers a new path: elegant collaboration between human and robot workers that delivers warehouse productivity in a lasting, far more sustainable way.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259116" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259116" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2259116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SFavUhmk.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wandercraft</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Parisian company Wandercraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/french-robotic-exoskeleton-maker-eyes-us-expansion-courtesy-of-a-45m-series-c/">has announced a $45 million Series C</a>. The round comes as the company is eyeing international expansion to the U.S. for its mobility-focused robotic exoskeleton, Atalante. The company is entering a crowded market here that includes the likes of ReWalk Robotics, Ekso, SuitX and Sarcos. Though Wandercraft distinguishes itself somewhat by exclusively focusing on healthcare.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are super excited to have attracted world-class investors from the USA and Europe to advance the development program of the company,&#8221; CEO Matthieu Masselin said in a release. &#8220;With the support of patients, medical professionals and the DeepTech community, Wandercraft’s team has created a unique technology that improves rehabilitation care and will soon enable people in wheelchairs to regain autonomy and improve their everyday health.&#8221;</p>

<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/aigen-fund-round/">Aigen announced</a> a more humble $4 million seed round, though that comes with the much grander ambition of “terraform[ing] the Earth” apparently. That starts with solar-powered weeding robots that use computer vision to distinguish crops.</p>
<p>“My relatives are farmers in Minnesota, and I’ve been talking with them for quite some time. They’re really experiencing some trouble with traditional agriculture approaches,” CEO Richard Wurden tells TechCrunch. “Even the diehard people that love chemicals, that love tilling the earth and other practices that have been releasing carbon in the atmosphere for thousands of years are starting to realize, hey, maybe we should be open to other ways to do this. Right now, agriculture is about 16% of carbon emissions. In the future, it has the potential to go negative, by reducing diesel emissions, soil compaction, chemical usage and reducing tilling.”</p>

		David Annis is the co-founder and COO of <a href="http://www.getparallax.com/">Parallax</a>, a provider of business insights that empower digital services companies to forecast with confidence.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has rapidly increased the pace at which companies must evolve to serve their customers, but as the world goes digital, it has also become harder to anticipate changing needs.</p>
<p>In order to design, build and maintain a product that meets changing customer demands, companies need a mechanism that provides unbiased insights from people that represent them.</p>
<p>By design, product advisory councils (PACs) are an invaluable tool that can provide direct access to the expectations of your customers. Once established, a good PAC will provide valuable perspectives on how to solve problems for a broader, evolving market while putting a real face and name to your customer personas, helping your teams feel more connected and motivated to provide tangible value.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways a PAC can influence your business decisions, but most importantly, they will help you prioritize features that have the most value to your customers and help position those features using the same language your customers use. And they can inform future content development by uncovering opportunities you might not have thought to explore.</p>
<p>Here are seven steps to help you set up a PAC and the steps for implementing them:</p>
<h2>Define the goals of your PAC</h2>
<p>First and foremost, define and align your goals for the PAC. These should be unique to your business, taking into account your industry, customers and goals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It’s important to think about what you can offer the PAC members to keep them engaged considering your budget, time constraints and your team&#8217;s bandwidth. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A good place to start is to ask yourself how you want to grow. For example, you might want to expand beyond your current target customer. To do that successfully, you’ll need to understand how your new customers think. What are their challenges? What are their motivations? What language do they use to describe their work? This will inform the features you want to have to meet the needs of your new customer, as well as how to position the product&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>In this case, one of the PAC&#8217;s goals should focus on defining and evolving your market opportunity. Clearly defined goals are crucial to helping you decide the kinds of people you want to be represented in the PAC. Consider demographics (age, gender, occupation, location, etc.) as well as psychographics (fears, motivations, influences, etc.).</p>
<p>We implemented a PAC with pretty straightforward goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remain close to our existing customer base to prioritize how our product and marketing should evolve.</li>
<li>Get better at overcoming barriers to purchase by increasing our understanding of buyers and how decisions are made.</li>
<li>Validate and broaden our understanding of our next growth market — the folks we plan on selling to in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>At a high level, these goals are valuable because they serve as the inputs needed to inform our product development strategy in both the near and long terms, as well as how we can best communicate the value we want to deliver.</p>
<h2>Ensure there is a clear, real value for PAC members who participate</h2>
<p>It’s important to think about what you can offer the PAC members to keep them engaged considering your budget, time constraints and your team&#8217;s bandwidth. The spectrum for this type of value is wide and can include anything from offering peer networking opportunities to providing exclusive content/training or negotiated discount rates for select member services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Not a single advanced driver assistance system offered in today&#8217;s new vehicles would meet pending safety criteria being developed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, according to the organization.</p>
<p>The nonprofit that is funded by auto insurance companies said Thursday that its new rating program will evaluate the safeguards that vehicles with &#8220;partial automation&#8221; use to help drivers stay focused on the road.</p>
<p>IIHS will give systems good, acceptable, marginal or poor ratings. The first set of ratings is expected to be issued in 2022, IIHS said, though it did not give a specific date because ongoing supply chain issues have made it more difficult to obtain vehicles for testing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260216" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Partial automation systems may make long drives seem like less of a burden, but there is no evidence that they make driving safer,&#8221; IIHS President David Harkey said in a statement. &#8220;In fact, the opposite may be the case if systems lack adequate safeguards.&#8221;</p>
<p>To earn a &#8220;good&#8221; rating, vehicles will have to have a driver monitoring system that ensures a driver&#8217;s eyes are directed at the road and that their hands are either on the wheel or ready to grab at all times, the organization said. These advanced driver assistance systems must also be equipped with alerts that escalate and emergency procedures if a driver continues to ignore them.</p>
<p>The new IIHS ratings will not address other functional aspects of the systems that could also potentially contribute to crashes, such as how well their cameras or radar sensors identify obstacles.</p>
<p>Automakers are offering increasingly advanced driver assistance systems with an array of &#8220;partial automation&#8221; features. The most common is a feature that combines adaptive cruise control, which maintains a driver-selected speed and automatically slows to maintain a selected following distance, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">with lane centering that </span>continuously adjusts the steering to help the driver keep the vehicle in the middle of the travel lane. Automated lane changing is also becoming more common, IIHS noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IIHS&#8217; move to rate automated driving systems follows a regulatory and consumer advocacy trend to keep automakers in check. Consumer Reports has said it will <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/driver-monitoring-systems-ford-gm-earn-points-in-cr-tests-a6530426322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin awarding points</a> for partially automated driving systems with adequate driver monitoring systems. CR will also factor in IIHS safeguard ratings once they are available.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports said that its 2022 autos Top Picks, which will be announced on February 17, will include evaluations of driver monitoring systems. CR will add two points to a vehicle&#8217;s overall score if it features a system that encourages safe driving as part of the model&#8217;s active driving assistance package.</p>
<p>CR said only Ford&#8217;s BlueCruise and GM&#8217;s Super Cruise systems will earn these additional points.</p>
<p>CR said in 2024 it will start docking two points from the overall score if the new vehicle lacks <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">adequate driver monitoring. That will increase to a loss of four points starting with 2026 models.</span></p>
<p>IIHS noted that while most partial automation systems have some safeguards in place, none of them meets all of the organization&#8217;s pending criteria. This can lead to drivers intentionally or unintentionally pushing the system well beyond its safe operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way many of these systems operate gives people the impression that they&#8217;re capable of doing more than they really are,&#8221; said IIHS research scientist Alexandra Mueller, who is spearheading the new ratings program. &#8220;But even when drivers understand the limitations of partial automation, their minds can still wander. As humans, it&#8217;s harder for us to remain vigilant when we&#8217;re watching and waiting for a problem to occur than it is when we&#8217;re doing all the driving ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no so-called self-driving cars available to consumers, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped automakers from branding their systems in a way that causes confusion or overstates the system&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Tesla has been widely criticized for the branding of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system that comes standard in its vehicles and the upgraded FSD (full self-driving) beta software package that costs $12,000. But other automakers have also oversold the capabilities of their systems in marketing campaigns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing support for paid subscriptions, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday. As first reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;utm_term=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>, the popular short-form video app is exploring the option for creators to charge subscriptions for their content. The feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not broadly available. TikTok declined to elaborate on the feature or share additional details.</p>
<p>“We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email, when reached for comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how the paid subscription model will be implemented in the app. For context, TikTok&#8217;s popular algorithmic &#8220;For You&#8221; page surfaces videos from creators that users don&#8217;t follow. If a creator chooses to charge a subscription for their content, it&#8217;s likely that their videos won&#8217;t appear on users&#8217; For You pages. However, it&#8217;s also possible that the subscription will apply to additional content that&#8217;s exclusive to paid users, as opposed to being applied to the entirety of a creator&#8217;s account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260193" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>News of the test comes a day after Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/instagram-launches-early-test-of-creator-subscriptions-in-the-u-s/">launched</a> subscriptions in the U.S. The feature is now in early testing with a small group of creators who are able to offer their followers paid access to exclusive Instagram Live videos and Stories. Creators can choose their own price point for access to their exclusive content. Paid subscribers will be marked with a special badge, differentiating them from unpaid users in the sea of comments.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s paid subscriptions test follows recent confirmation that it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">testing</a> an in-app tipping feature on its platform that allows creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. Creators who are part of the limited test can apply for the feature if they have at least 100,000 followers and are in good standing. Those who have been approved are given a Tips button on their profiles, which their followers are able to use to send them direct payments.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s newest test is its latest push toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its platform. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced</a> a $200 million fund aimed at helping creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings. TikTok also helps creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals and also provides monetization for livestreams. Considering TikTok’s focus on monetization efforts, it’s no surprise that the company is experimenting with a way for creators to offer paid subscriptions for their content.</p>
<p>TikTok and Instagram&#8217;s tests follow Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">launch</a> of &#8220;Super Follows,&#8221; a paid subscription offering that launched in September 2021. The feature allows users to subscribe to accounts they like for a monthly subscription fee in exchange for exclusive content. Eligible accounts can set the price for Super Follow subscriptions, with the option of charging $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 per month. Similar to Instagram&#8217;s model, subscribers are marked with a special Super Follower badge, differentiating them from unpaid followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok, Instagram and Twitter&#8217;s paid subscription offerings outline the companies&#8217; efforts to court creator communities. The offerings are also a way for the companies to compete with each other, along with other digital platforms such as YouTube, which offers lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is introducing a new feature that will allow users to show off their NFTs, or non-fungible tokens &#8212; a way to certify digital assets stored on the blockchain. The company is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out NFT Profile Pictures</a> to Twitter Blue subscribers on iOS by way of Twitter Blue&#8217;s early access Labs feature. Support for Android users and the web will follow. However, while only iOS users will have the ability to set their NFT as their profile picture, everyone on Twitter will be able to see the new hexa-shaped picture no matter what platform they&#8217;re currently using, Twiter says.</p>
<p>The Twitter Blue subscription service is not yet globally available, which will limit the adoption of NFT Profile Pictures to the early markets where the offering is now live &#8212; the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The company had earlier hinted toward its plans to more fully embrace NFTs, which has become a big topic of conversation on the platform. Many crypto-enthusiasts have also already set their profile picture to a photo of their NFT, as Twitter had not yet offered any official means of authenticating with a user&#8217;s crypto wallet and verifying ownership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In September, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">amid a sea of other updates</a>, Twitter had offered a first look at its plans for NFTs. At the time, Twitter touted how authentication would allow creators to <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmarmyBum/status/1443259893411049475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better showcase</a> their work on Twitter and said it was exploring ideas that would allow them to showcase their collections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter is where people go to talk about things they care about, and often where people have their first experience with crypto and NFTs,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, in an emailed announcement. &#8220;We’re now seeing people use NFTs as a form of identity and self-expression, and as a way to join the thriving community and increasingly active conversation on Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>To use the feature as a Twitter Blue subscriber, you&#8217;ll simply go to your profile to change your profile photo as you would normally. Here, you&#8217;ll be presented with the new option to choose an NFT instead. You then connect with your crypto wallet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, MetaMask, Ledger Live, Argent, and Trust Wallet are supported. After authenticating, you&#8217;ll select the NFT you want to showcase. Twitter says that, currently, JPEG and PNG NFTs minted on the Ethereum (ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens) can be used as NFT Profile Pictures.</p>
<p>Once live, Twitter users who come across the NFT will be able to tap on the profile picture to learn more about the art, its collection, provenance, and more. For instance, you’ll be able to see if a project or collection has been verified by OpenSea or another third-party marketplace.</p>

<p>You asked (a lot), so we made it. Now rolling out in Labs: NFT Profile Pictures on iOS <a href="https://t.co/HFyspS4cQW">pic.twitter.com/HFyspS4cQW</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The rollout follows Twitter&#8217;s growing interest in incorporating decentralized technologies into its platform, which has included things like support for tips in Bitcoin and the recent hire of <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1458467864545927168?t=FbKsw6GpZnhymP7jX1OawA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1458467864545927168?t%3DFbKsw6GpZnhymP7jX1OawA%26s%3D19&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642789350143000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2EvvUc5SHkQP1omjMFZPlD">Tess Rinearson</a> as its Crypto Engineering Lead. The company also last year experimented with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/twitter-is-making-nfts-now-apparently/">minting its own NFTs</a>, which it had offered for free.</p>
<p>The company hasn&#8217;t yet made a decision as to whether or not it will make the feature available at some later date to non-subscribers, but says it will monitor feedback from Twitter Blue users and make additional updates over time.</p>
<p><em>Note: A poorly timed <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5qjej/people-cant-see-some-nfts-in-crypto-wallets-after-opensea-goes-down" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSea outage</a> could be complicating the launch for Twitter.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.prophecy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prophecy</a>, a low-code platform for data engineering, today announced that it has raised a $25 million Series A round led by Insight Partners. Existing investors SignalFire and Berkeley Skydeck, as well as new investor Dig Ventures, also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $31 million.</p>
<p>At the core of the Prophecy user experience is its low-code environment, which allows data engineers and analysts to seamlessly switch between a visual interface and a code editor for building workflows. This interface makes it easy to quickly create Apache Spark code and then execute it through its <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airflow</a> service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this ability to switch back and forth between code and the visual interface, with changes on either side immediately reflected on the other &#8212; combined with the ability to extend the visual interface with custom elements as needed &#8212; that the team hopes will give it a leg up in the market. And since many enterprises are still using legacy tools, Prophecy also built a transpiler that allows businesses to modernize their existing ETL workflows.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_a7A_0TbbI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody keeps talking about how data is the new oil. They&#8217;ve been talking about it for a decade, but then you go into large enterprises and the data management is a mess. So I&#8217;m like: we can fix this,&#8221; Prophecy co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-bains-b837a46/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raj Bains</a> said. He argues that while Databricks, which has partnered with Prophecy, and Snowflake are building the processing engines to use the data, enterprises still need a lot of tools to do the heavy lifting, especially as they are making the move to the cloud at the same time.</p>
<p>These enterprises, Bains noted, often sit on tens of thousands of data pipelines that run on-premises. So it made sense for Prophecy to build the tooling to help them modernize these pipelines and move them to the cloud &#8212; and ideally its platform, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wrote this compiler, which is a very sophisticated tool,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It will read their old data pipelines and automatically write these new data pipelines for the cloud and cloud technologies. So we can just take a big company with a massive data engineering footprint [&#8230;] and we can just move the entire through the cloud. As large companies are looking to the cloud, they&#8217;re thinking about how to make the move and how to succeed &#8212; and we are working hand in hand with them to make this cloud migration and help them succeed in this new cloud world where it&#8217;s a completely different ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite its early stage, Prophecy&#8217;s customers already include a number of Fortune 500 and 50 companies that use it to build and manage their data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Insight Partner&#8217;s managing director George Mathew noted that there were a number of factors that got him interested in the firm, including Bains&#8217; background of previously working at Hortonworks, Nvidia and Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just very clear that Raj and the team at Prophecy really understood what this last generation of systems, particularly in the data world, were &#8212; and where they needed to go in a cloud-native world and how to make that massive transition happen, particularly with the use of a low-code/no-code environment,&#8221; Mathew said. He also noted that the timing was right, given how much data many enterprises now accumulate in their data warehouses and lakes &#8212; something that wasn&#8217;t necessarily the case only a few years ago.</p>
<p>As Bains noted, this next year will be about polishing the product and helping its customers succeed in production. Unsurprisingly, the company plans to use the new funding to do just that and invest in the go-to-market side of its business as it builds out its full-stack data engineering platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To say the last few years have been a roller coaster for Peloton barely scratches the surface. Once flying high on exploding pandemic demand, the company has been confronted with what it has deemed a “significant reduction” in its connected fitness products, including a series of treadmills and bikes.</p>
<p>Following a presentation, internal documents<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/peloton-to-pause-production-of-its-bikes-treadmills-as-demand-wanes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> noted by CNBC</a> point to a two-month halt in the production of its entry-level Bike between February and March. The premium Bike+ has already been halted, with production only starting back up again in June, per the documents. Tread production is set for a six-week pause in February, while the Tread+ won’t be produced at all during the 2022 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Peloton was initially one of the biggest tech winners as gyms across the globe closed down amid the pandemic. In fact, it was initially faced with the opposite problem: a delivery system that simply couldn&#8217;t meet the practically overnight spike in demand for its products. In May of last year, it announced that it was pumping $400 million into an Ohio factory to build its growing line of products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has long been a leader in connected home fitness, and by most accounts viewed COVID-19 as more of a paradigm shift than temporary shift in how people work out. And while the pandemic has continued to stretch on, it has seen flagging sales as gyms have reopened and competition has increased through startups and big names like Samsung and Apple. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/peloton-hires-mckinsey-to-review-cost-structure-as-equipment-sales-slow-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news broke</a> that the company had hired consulting firm McKinsey in a bid to stem some of the financial bleeding &#8212; a move expected to come with a restructuring and job loss. By the end of 2021, Peloton&#8217;s stock plummeted 76%, following an astronomical rise a year prior.</p>
<p>In spite of those early successes, the past few years have been dotted with controversy &#8212; most notably, a recall of its treadmill products over safety concerns. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">initially hesitant</a> to work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on a recall following 70 safety incidents, including the death of a young child.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, as one of the founders, the framing of the category wasn’t good enough. What the category thought of as safety wasn’t good enough,” CEO Foley told me at Disrupt late last year. “We thought, let’s bring treads to market, and from a hardware perspective, they’re the best designed treads. Looking at the safety that’s been in the category for decades, what we learned is, we need to be better. We’re better in almost everything, and now we need to be better in safety.”</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, the company was already well known for having attracted an almost cult-like following, thanks to its popular instructors and content plays. Though it&#8217;s safe to say it overestimated its continued growth and flew too close to the sun with its continued spending &#8212; at least for the short term. Late last year, it announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/the-500-peloton-guide-brings-connected-strength-training-to-the-wildly-popular-fitness-platform/">Peloton Guide</a>, a $495 connected strength system designed to lower the barrier of entry into its home fitness ecosystem. Additional products, including a rowing machine, were reportedly in the works as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No word on how today&#8217;s news would impact the arrival of either, though significant restructuring at the company would almost certainly find it doing everything within its power to curb spending. Some of the company&#8217;s chief competitors have been undergoing their own changes of late, as well. Earlier this month, Lululemon announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/lululemon-names-twitch-exec-mike-aragon-ceo-of-mirror/">appointed a new CEO for Mirror</a>, after the surprise departure of the company&#8217;s founder last September.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We’ve reached out to Peloton to confirm today’s reporting.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com shared new details about a recent hack on its platform last weekend </span><a href="https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a statement on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today, saying 483 of its users were affected and that unauthorized withdrawals of over $15 million worth of ETH, $19 million worth of BTC and $66,200 in “other currencies” occurred. The total losses, worth over $34 million at current cryptocurrency values, </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-breach-may-be-worth-up-to-33m-suggests-onchain-analyst" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are even higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than what analysts had predicted before Crypto.com released its statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s post-mortem comes just one day after CEO Kris Marszalek acknowledged the breach in an interview with Bloomberg TV. His confirmation of the breach came after multiple Crypto.com users alleged their funds had been stolen — complaints that had until then been met with vague responses from the company, referring only to </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb3zq/cryptocom-says-alleged-dollar15-million-hack-was-just-an-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an &#8220;incident.&#8221;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Marszalek did not share details on how the breach occurred during the interview, though he did confirm that Crypto.com had reimbursed all the impacted accounts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s statement said Crypto.com detected the suspicious activity on Monday where &#8220;transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.&#8221; The site suspended all withdrawals for 14 hours to investigate the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto.com did not say how the attacker was able to approve transactions without triggering 2FA, which is mandatory for all users. When TechCrunch reached out for more details, the company declined to comment on the breach outside of the statement issued today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company “revoked all customer 2FA tokens and added additional security hardening measures” before asking customers to log back into the platform and set up their 2FA tokens again, the company says. The additional measures include a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new withdrawal address and the first withdrawal, so users will be notified and have “adequate time to react and respond” by contacting the Crypto.com team if the withdrawal appears to be unauthorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company conducted an internal audit and engaged third-party security firms to check its platform after the breach, it says. It announced its plans to transition away from 2FA and to “true multi-factor authentication” to bolster security, though it did not provide an expected timeline for this change.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Crypto.com also announced in its statement today that it will be introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP) in select markets&#8221; starting on February 1, a program that will restore funds up to $250,000 for &#8220;qualified users&#8221; in cases where an unauthorized withdrawal occurs. To qualify for the program, users must enable multi-factor authentication on all transaction types where it is available, set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction, file a police report and provide it to Crypto.com, complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation, and not be using a jailbroken device, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Crypto.com is </span><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/crypto_com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world’s fourth-largest crypto exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has been pushing hard into U.S. markets in recent months, with stunts including viral advertisements featuring actor Matt Damon and a $700 million purchase of the naming rights to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers Arena. It calls itself the “fastest-growing” crypto exchange and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/crypto-com-500-million-fund-web3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded its venture capital arm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to $500 million to back early-stage startups in the space earlier this week. The fallout regarding this week&#8217;s breach and the company&#8217;s delayed response could threaten to stall some of its stateside growth.</span></p>

If and when SEE-1 is up and running, it plans to host TV and film productions, as well as music events and some kind of sports, which can be filmed or livestreamed, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/film-studio-space-1235157521/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Suleyman says the time has come for AI due to the ecosystem maturing and more people understand the strengths and limitations of AI and how to use it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mustafa Suleyman has been working in artificial intelligence for 12 years, trying to figure out how to use machine learning systems and AI to do important things in the work and have impact at scale.</p>
<p>“And over the years, I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to be at the forefront of a lot of cutting-edge applications of AI,” he told TechCrunch. “Over the years, that experience has given me a really good intuition, for when a piece of AI is ready for the real world, and when it&#8217;s not. The projects that I&#8217;ve seen fail are mostly because people overestimate how good AI is. People think that AI is this silver bullet and it can solve all your problems, but actually you have to craft the environment and the application problem correctly.”</p>
<p>Suleyman is now putting that intuition to good use on the venture capital side. After previously investing in companies alongside Greylock partner Reid Hoffman, Suleyman made the full leap to join Greylock as a venture partner.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259749" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He joins the firm from Google, where he was vice president of AI product management and AI policy. Prior to that, he co-founded and led DeepMind, an AI company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/why-google-bought-deepmind/">acquired by Google</a> in 2014.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;AI will no doubt touch every aspect of our lives in the coming years, and we at Greylock believe there&#8217;s an abundance of opportunity for entrepreneurs to continue building in this space.” Hoffman said via email. “Mustafa is visionary, knowledgeable and connected across the vast AI landscape, and we know he&#8217;ll be a valuable resource to our existing portfolio, and a board member of choice for new AI investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suleyman is eager to work with early-stage founders, who he said are “super fearless and really energetic people” who aren’t afraid to take a risk when they see opportunity.</p>
<p>He believes there is much opportunity in the AI companies that are out there. He says the time has come for AI due to the ecosystem maturing, and more people understand the strengths and limitations of AI and how to use it. AI is also becoming more accessible and usable by people who don’t necessarily have a technical background, but are creating new ways to use machine learning.</p>
<p>As such, he says that AI is at an inflection point: We now have AI systems that can generate new text, conversational sentences and whole paragraphs, which is approaching human-level performance.</p>

<p>“The range of things that entrepreneurs can do when you can basically have an API that can talk to your users in natural language is amazing and the imagination is the limit,” Suleyman added. “Combined with the explosion of the metaverse and all the excitement around that in the last couple years, I definitely think that AI has a central role to play in virtual reality, in gaming and the metaverse.”</p>
<p>While those are a few areas where he sees AI winning, there are some areas where he thinks AI is not quite there yet, including large-scale infrastructure, manufacturing and logistics distribution, and he is looking for those companies stepping up to build AI into scheduling and coordination of shipping, shipment tracking and route optimization.</p>
<p>When looking at what is down the pipeline for AI, he again sees the metaverse and gaming dominating the space as characters and avatars come to life &#8212; think “Ready Player One,” where there is an animated parallel world in tandem with ours.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;ll be able to do planning and prediction, so it won&#8217;t just be kind of generating scripted or written responses, it will actually be emergent and responsive to the environment,” Suleyman said. “On the enterprise side, the time for AI and medical imaging is definitely now that we&#8217;ve  proven it works in research, and now we&#8217;re ready for large-scale production that&#8217;s going to be very successful.”</p>
