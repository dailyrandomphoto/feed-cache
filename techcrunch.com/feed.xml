										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing I’m expecting to see a lot more of this week: good remote work gear. There’s plenty of room for improvement in the field, and as we stare down the beginning of year three of this global pandemic, you’ve got to assume most hardware companies have something up their sleeve, even if they missed out on the first round of remote work shopping sprees.</p>
<p>Webcams are probably more primed than any other single category in the space. Logitech has had a stranglehold over the space for a while now &#8212; due in no small part to the fact that, for most people, standalone devices have mostly been an afterthought. Now that we’re all living in a world of Zoom marathons, there’s great opportunity here.</p>
<p>I wrote about Opal’s potential <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/in-the-age-of-remote-work-opal-offers-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-webcams/">recently</a>, but there’s certainly room for more players to enter the field. One key thing that Anker can provide here is pricing. At $220, the Video Bar significantly undercuts premium webcams like Opal &#8212; though it notably maxes out at 2K/30 FPS. For your standard teleconferencing needs, however, that out to be plenty.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s got its own built-in adjustable lighting bar on top. That’s not going to replace a good ring light, but it should help poor lighting, which tends to be a constant on conference calls. A built-in MagicSight feature is designed to automatically adjust light, while the included app helps deal with things like white balance. The system also sports a built-in mic and speaker array, to complete the one-size-fits-all package.</p>
<p>The system arrives January 25.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253348" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253348" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253348" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/anker-nano.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253348" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Anker</p></div></p>
<p>Also new from Anker is yet another impossibly small GaN charger in a long line of impossibly small GaN chargers. This one packs 100W, which should be more than enough for a majority of laptops. The device sports dual USB-C and one USB-A port. And while you can charge multiple devices, it will split the charge when you have more than one product plugged in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The charger runs $79 and arrives at some point in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Panasonic battery cells made at the Gigafactory it operates with Tesla will use more recycled materials by the end of 2022 as part of an expanded partnership with startup Redwood Materials.</p>
<p>Panasonic said Tuesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show that Redwood Materials will start supplying it with copper foil produced from recycled materials, a critical component of the anode side of a battery cell. Redwood will begin producing the copper foil in the first half of the year; the copper foil will then head to Panasonic where it will be used in cell production by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The announcement marks Panasonic&#8217;s push to use more recycled materials, which in turn helps it reduce the amount of newly mined raw materials it must rely on; it also shows how Redwood continues to grow its business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253250" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Electric vehicles on the road today are equipped with lithium-ion batteries. A battery contains two electrodes. There&#8217;s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. An electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier that moves ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging. The anode is typically made of copper foil coated with graphite.</p>
<p>As automakers ramp up the production of electric vehicles — and eventually replace those with cars and trucks equipped with internal combustion engines — demand for batteries and the materials within them is expected to skyrocket. Nearly every major automaker that committed to electrifying their vehicle portfolio have also locked in partnerships with battery cell manufacturers and other suppliers in an effort to shore up its supply chain.</p>
<p>Redwood Materials, which was founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel in 2017, is aiming to create a circular supply chain. The company recycles scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries, laptop computers, power tools, power banks, scooters and electric bicycles. It then processes these discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and then supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers (It has also publicly disclosed that it is working with Amazon and AESC Envision in Tennessee).</p>
<p>The aim is to create a closed loop system that will ultimately help reduce the cost of batteries and offset the need for mining.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Redwood&#8217;s announcement earlier this year that it had purchased 100 acres of land near Gigafactory was a hint at this expanded partnership with Panasonic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our work together to establish a domestic circular supply chain for batteries is an important step in realizing the full opportunity that EVs have to shape a much more sustainable world,&#8221; Panasonic Energy of North America President Allan Swan said during the presentation.</p>
<p>Redwood announced in September plans to produce critical battery materials right in the United States. The company plans to build a $2 billion factory that will produce cathodes and anode foils up to a projected volume of 100 gigawatt-hour per year’s worth of materials; that&#8217;s enough for one million electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 8R tractor has been in select customers’ hands for “a few seasons” now, according to John Deere. After all, like any kind of autonomous machinery, a self-driving tractor isn’t the kind of thing you just unleash on the world without extensive testing. Prototypes have been piloted in fields since fall 2019. Come fall 2022, however, the company will finally be opening sales on the system.</p>
<p>In spite of the company’s recent acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/john-deere-buys-autonomous-tractor-startup-bear-flag-robotics/">Bear Flag Robotics</a>, it says that none of the startup’s autonomy technology went into this system, which has been in the works for several years. Future Bear Flag-driven offerings will provide farmers an opportunity to retrofit their existing tractors with self-driving tech, but for the time being, John Deere is focused on the self-contained solution that is the 8R.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251615" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251615" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251615" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/john-deere-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251615" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> John Deere</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The system sports six pairs of stereo cameras, powered by a pair of Nvidia Jetson modules, offering a full view of its surrounding. Its GPS guidance system, coupled with geofencing, keep the system on track for initial tasks, such as tilling. That’s controlled remotely by the John Deere Operations Center Mobile, which offers access to images, live video and data from the job.</p>
<p>The system will initially be offered selectively through dealers in the upper-Midwest of the U.S. John Deere will assist farmers in the implementation. The 8R is on display this week at CES in Las Vegas.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you add a sizzling hot take to Twitter beef, you might end up with some delicious news analysis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy new year!</p>
<p>As is our custom, you&#8217;ll see quite a few TechCrunch+ articles in the coming days that share predictions for 2022.</p>
<p>Upcoming topics include fintech, crypto/blockchain and growth marketing, but yesterday, TechCrunch reporter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/aws-will-buy-a-saas-company-and-other-2022-enterprise-predictions/">Ron Miller shared his predictions for enterprise companies this year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253143" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As he noted, making enterprise forecasts is tricky: In 2021, who expected Salesforce to snap up Slack for almost $28 billion, or that Jeff Bezos would hand over the reins of Amazon to Andy Jassy?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Full TechCrunch+ articles are only available to members.<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Use discount code <strong>TCPLUSROUNDUP</strong></a> to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>&#8220;I sure didn’t see that coming, and I’m betting most people didn’t,&#8221; wrote Ron. &#8220;The tech world moves so quickly, it’s often hard to keep up.&#8221;</p>
<p>With &#8220;the usual caveats,&#8221; his prognostications encompass ongoing supply chain issues, the impacts of increased regulatory oversight in Europe and the U.S., and his thoughts on a M&amp;A market where table stakes are measured in the tens of billions.</p>
<p>His boldest, spiciest take?</p>
<blockquote><p>Salesforce … was quiet in 2021, busy closing the Slack deal. It won’t be too unrealistic to expect something in 2022. Maybe something SaaS-y like Zoom, Box or Dropbox. Maybe Benioff finally gets Twitter, a company he desperately wanted in 2016, as Casey Newton suggested in The Platformer this week.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you add a sizzling hot take to Twitter beef, you might end up with some delicious news analysis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Block CEO and Bitcoin fan Jack Dorsey recently tweeted that despite steadfast claims from investors, &#8220;you don&#8217;t own &#8216;web3.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, &#8220;the VCs and their LPs do,&#8221; wrote Dorsey. &#8220;It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a subtweet, Chris Dixon, general partner at a16z, shared charts depicting how much financial holding companies own of Web 2.0 companies like Airbnb, Meta and Block.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Vanguard and Fidelity don’t really own that stock,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm. &#8220;I know that because I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, control of Web 2.0 is &#8220;pretty decentralized,&#8221; because shares are held widely by external investors like pension and index funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, your mom owns Web 2.0. At least part of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the final article in a series about New Zealand, Rebecca Bellan spoke to four stakeholders to learn more about how foreign investment and a fund of funds program are juicing up the nation’s burgeoning startup ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Beck, CEO/CTO Rocket Lab</li>
<li>Cecilia Robinson, founder and co-CEO, Tend Health</li>
<li>Phoebe Harrop, principal, Blackbird Ventures</li>
<li>Robbie Paul, CEO, Icehouse Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>“While starting on a rock at the bottom of the world comes with challenges, there are plenty of advantages, too,” said Paul, who advises native founders to “play the Kiwi card.”</p>
<p>Almost one of every five New Zealanders lives abroad, and that diaspora has helped the nation build a great deal of international goodwill.</p>
<p>“It’s an easy conversation starter and chances are most interesting people offshore have some sort of affinity or connection to New Zealand,” Paul said.</p>

<h2>The coming reckoning: Showing ROI from threat intelligence</h2>

<p>In the fast-evolving world of cybersecurity, being proactive can make or break companies and brands.</p>
<p>But threat intelligence teams are still siloed and focus mostly on funneling data to security operation centers instead of communicating important information to other parts of the business.</p>
<p>This tendency, writes Chris Jacob, global vice president of Threat Intelligence Engineers at ThreatQuotient, forces CISOs to justify the cost of threat intelligence teams, despite their importance to the modern security framework.</p>
<p>Jacob shares three key recommendations CISOs can implement to become more effective advocates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of threat intelligence as providers of a product.</li>
<li>Prioritize integration.</li>
<li>Formalize executive reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup theses are malleable and prone to evolution, and as the market matures and evolves, it&#8217;s going to be harder than ever to predict what will work in the coming years.</p>
<p>Natasha Mascarenhas, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim lay down their views on the major trends they expect to see in 2022 and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex: 2022 is when open source will become the de facto startup model.</li>
<li>Natasha: Hybridize. Everything.</li>
<li>Anna: A majority of SaaS companies will adopt usage-based pricing in 2022.</li>

<p>M&amp;A is arguably one of the best and most efficient ways to significantly scale a business, and Delivery Hero took that path last week with its deal to acquire Spanish delivery startup Glovo.</p>
<p>In an in-depth analysis of the deal, Alex Wilhelm explores how acquiring Glovo is more about growing its share of the food delivery market for Delivery Hero.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glovo&#8217;s focus beyond restaurants put it in line with a very hot trend: quick commerce, or q-commerce. Its rise is exemplified by companies such as Zapp and Gopuff, and Delivery Hero took notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That the last page was the two companies deciding to just team up is perhaps less of a twist ending than we thought at first blush.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If 2020 was the year of the e-commerce boom, 2021 was the year the industry hit major challenges: Data privacy changes deeply impacted merchants’ social media ads, and supply chain issues forced merchants to get creative with their inventory. Despite all that, though, shopping in the U.S. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/black-friday-2021-sales-stats-performance-online-in-store-2021-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained steady</a> and Shopify stores <a href="https://news.shopify.com/black-friday-but-make-it-epic-shopify-merchants-break-records-with-29-billion-in-sales-h8uopp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased</a> their 2021 Black Friday sales by 21%.</p>
<p>As we approach our third roller coaster year defined by the pandemic, what will happen to global commerce? What new trends will define e-commerce? And most importantly, how can entrepreneurs and merchants prepare for — and take advantage of — rapidly evolving e-commerce trends in 2022?</p>
<p>Here are a few educated guesses on what will be critical to e-commerce in 2022, along with some advice on how to prepare your brand or company.</p>
<h2>Personalization and zero-party data become critical</h2>
<p>One of the two key trends that defined e-commerce in 2021 was the dramatic change to data privacy initiated by Apple and how it tanked a key source of customers for e-commerce brands. When Apple allowed users to opt out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">data tracking on iOS 14.5</a>, Facebook lost access to valuable user behavior data, which is the backbone of Facebook’s ad targeting.</p>
<p>The result was that many commerce brands saw a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apples-ios-changes-hurt-facebooks-ad-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big decrease in the effectiveness of their ads</a>. Brands heavily reliant on Facebook ads saw a dip in revenue and greater costs.</p>
<p>This year will be when brands rapidly adapt to this change and future-proof themselves from an even bigger change, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">eventual end of third-party cookie support in Google Chrome</a>. The only way brands can adapt to these changes — specifically the loss of third-party data from Facebook and Apple — is to collect data directly from their customers (zero-party data) and leverage it for personalized marketing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Thanks to a combination of faster internet, the boom in live video and the rise of influencers, live shopping is becoming a major (if not a primary) channel for avid shoppers.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Doing this not only increases revenue dramatically, it also future-proofs your business from further data privacy changes.</p>
<p>How do you collect zero-party data from your customers? And how do you utilize it in your email and SMS marketing? I could write a whole post on this topic, and in fact, I did! I recently wrote a piece here on TechCrunch about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/collect-and-leverage-zero-party-data-to-personalize-marketing-and-drive-growth/">how to collect and leverage zero-party data</a> using key tools like surveys, quizzes and conversational pop-ups.</p>
<h2>E-commerce embraces web3 and NFTs, but what will that look like?</h2>
<p>2021 was the year of web3. Whether you think <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/7-investors-discuss-web3s-present-and-peer-into-its-future/">web3 is the future</a> or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/bitcoin-is-religion-web3-is-greed/">clever rebranding of crypto</a>, there is no doubt that web3 and NFTs aren’t going anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GE Lighting, a Savant company, today expands its smart home lineup with a smart thermostat, a temperature sensor, a suite of security cameras and a crate of new lighting products. The company also teases it&#8217;s got a lot more home-smartification gadgets in the pipeline, all tied together with the Cync app.</p>
<p>After the company&#8217;s lightbulb moment of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/smart-home-company-savant-set-to-acquire-ge-lighting/">selling off its GE Lighting division to Savant</a> back in 2020, the increasingly confusingly named <a href="https://www.gelighting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GE Lighting</a> (<a href="https://www.savant.com/lighting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Savant company</a>) is continuing its innovation spree at CES in Las Vegas, with a slew of new product announcements in the smart home space, under its brand <a href="https://www.gelighting.com/cync-smart-home-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cync</a>, which <a href="https://www.gelighting.com/c-by-ge-is-now-cync" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used to be called C by GE</a>. The naming alone is making me wonder how many names a product/company needs, and whether a &#8220;keep it simple&#8221; memo got lost somewhere in the steam pipes underneath the company&#8217;s headquarters. Luckily the product lineup is less confusing than its nomenclature, and the new set of products reinforces GE Lighting&#8217;s determination to take on the Philips Hue and Nest ecosystems of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ‘smartest’ smart home consists of a network of reliable products that work together seamlessly and are easy to install and use, for the ultimate in convenience, comfort and security,&#8221; said GE Lighting&#8217;s VP of Experiences, Paul Williams. &#8220;Our new products give consumers the ability to bolster their Cync smart home with new whole-home capabilities that are hubless and can all be controlled by a single app or voice.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251912" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2251928" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Thermostat-Entryway-e1640794834803.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251928" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251928" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Thermostat-Entryway-e1640794834803.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="598" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251928" class="wp-caption-text">Cync Smart Thermostat installed in a hallway. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GE Lighting</p></div></p>
<p>The new Cync smart thermostat comes with all the features you&#8217;d expect from a smart thermostat, but adds a few nice touches, too. Unlike certain other leading thermostats (I&#8217;m looking at you, Nest), it can be installed without a common wire, which means it can easily be used to make older apartments with pretty much any type of thermostat leverage the power of smart home tech. The thermostat product will start shipping now-ish, and will cost $120 or so.</p>
<p>The thermostat can be paired with the company&#8217;s $30 Room Temperature Sensor to keep an eye on individual rooms, too. For people with central air, that might be an opportunity to finally get the vents opened the right amount; for example, if your bedroom always runs 4 degrees warmer than every other room in the house, adjusting the forced-air vents accordingly might help resolve that problem. Whether you need an actual smart temperature sensor to figure that out is a question for another day, but at least now you have the option.</p>

<p>Cync launched an outdoor camera a little while back, and today announces a couple of additions to that lineup as well, with a wired or battery/solar-powered option for the Cync Outdoor Smart Camera. Packing 2K/1280P high-definition video feeds and night vision, and a &#8220;digital swivel head&#8221; (i.e. the option to change the crop of your video), at least on paper the cameras seem like a pretty solid choice. The cameras also have options for increased privacy and security, with cloud and local SD card storage options available. The wired version costs $100, the battery-powered version is $120, and for an additional $45 you can add on a solar panel to keep those eyes a-peepin.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251933" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Decorative-Bulbs-White-Exterior-e1640795642305.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251933" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251933" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Decorative-Bulbs-White-Exterior-e1640795642305.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251933" class="wp-caption-text">GE Lighting&#8217;s Decorative White Exterior Bulbs show that smart bulbs don&#8217;t have to look boring. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GE Lighting</p></div></p>
<p>The bright sparks in the GE lighting labs have been busy little bees, with a flurry of new products to spruce up the lighting design options for your pad. At CES, the company adds 11 new products, including smart decorative filament-style bulbs in various shapes and sizes, such as candelabra and globe, and an additional lineup of &#8220;general purpose bulbs&#8221; that took like, er, light bulbs. The new lineup of bright ideas is offered in both white and full-color options. The lights come equipped with Wi-Fi &#8212; of course, they wouldn&#8217;t be very smart otherwise &#8212; unlocking a range of features, including voice control, scheduling, scenes and more &#8212; all controlled from the Cync app.</p>
<p>Cync&#8217;s app is, of course, controllable by Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, Google Home and Apple&#8217;s Home Kit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiddo, formally known as GoodParents Inc., announced a $16 million Series A round on Tuesday. Through a combination of wearables, parental coaching, and telehealth, the company has its sights firmly set on managing care for kids with chronic health conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiddo has been working on developing a wearable and software combo for children’s health for several years. The company was founded in 2016 by Jaganath “CJ” Swamy, who was </span><a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/goodparents-raises-2m-childrens-health-wearable"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially interested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in developing a health and wellness device that would be fun for kids to use, and offer parents the ability to monitor health. However, the company has now revamped to focus fully on managing chronic health conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That focus, Swamy tells TechCrunch, is partially inspired by his own experience. He was in the midst of transitioning away from working as an early-stage investor when one of his sons began to have asthma-like breathing problems. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were struggling to manage and monitor what was happening with him on a daily basis, and with passing that information back to his physician, so that she could modify the treatment protocol appropriately,” Swamy tells TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we were kind of going through this struggle, it started making me think about how we could try and make this a better experience for parents, who essentially have to kind of manage kids with a chronic condition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was Kiddo, a care coordination platform aimed at kids aged two to 15. The child receives a proprietary wristband (it looks something like a FitBit), the parents download an app that collects data from that wearable, and relays that information to the child’s doctor. The platform is specifically designed to monitor children with asthma, heart disease, autism, and diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Clearlake-Capital backed Vive Collective and brings Kiddo’s total funding to $25 million. Other investors include Wavemaker 360, Wavemaker Asia Pacific, Mojo Partners, along with Techstars and affiliated funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly, Kiddo falls into the “Remote Patient Monitoring” category. It’s designed to help patients obtain the same basic care they might receive in a primary care office from home. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wearable transmits signals like heart rate, temperature, SpO2 (a blood oxygen measure), motion and perspiration. Meanwhile, the app integrates that data with local air quality conditions (a </span><a href="https://www.aafa.org/air-pollution-smog-asthma/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key metric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for asthma patients). Over time, Kiddo develops a profile for each child based on these characteristics. Should those metrics significantly deviate from the norm, a parent would receive a notification, as well as a list of tips that might help them control the situation at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a child was having an asthma attack, a parent might receive an alert suggesting that breathing rates and heart rates were out of regular ranges. Then, the app might give some general suggestions as to how to manage the situation. “We might say, ‘hey, let the child rest for an hour, give them a glass of cold water or put them in an air conditioned environment or, based on the advice of a physician take albuterol,” says Swamy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If symptoms persist, the app allows parents to schedule a doctor’s appointment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of remote patient monitoring itself isn’t new, but there have been more studies published on the idea in recent years. One 2020 </span><a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/tmj.2019.0066?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed"><span style="font-weight: 400;">systematic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telemedicine and e-Health</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, found that 43 percent of 272 reviewed articles were published between 2015 and 2018. In about 77 percent of those studies, remote patient monitoring had a positive impact on patient care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiddo is investing in clinical validation of its services, though Swamy notes that no data has yet been published publicly (“The data is confidential and only to be shared with customers,” he said via followup email).  But he did say that research from academic and partners and private parties has “validated many aspects of the Kiddo platform.&#8221; That process will include a new study under development at Thompson Autism Center at Children’s Hospital of Orange County, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s own data, says Swamy, suggests the platform improves treatment adherence more than 50 percent and led to a “2x reduction” in unnecessary ER visits. But again, this data is unpublished. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiddo currently hasn’t received FDA marketing clearance, but is aiming for Class I certification (this is a class reserved for low risk devices). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company also has partnered with seven health systems, benefits providers and foundations, including UHC Optum, PC Health, and “several children’s hospitals” per a press release (other partners were not disclosed). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critically, Swamy says the company sees itself solely as a B2B provider. It has no plans to go direct to consumer – but rather will focus on partnering with hospitals and health systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiddo’s most recent round of funding comes after a big year for the company when it comes to users. So far, the company is working with 70,000 children, with plans to expand to about 200,000 in the next few years. That traction, he notes, is one of the drivers of investor interest, but it’s not the only trend working in Kiddo’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also regulatory movement that could favor remote patient monitoring. Historically, there have been limited numbers of CPT codes (reimbursement codes) for remote monitoring technology. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7575829/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some codes have been repurposed and others added to make it easier for providers to charge for remote patient monitoring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That trend is continuing. In 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has </span><a href="https://mhealthintelligence.com/news/cms-expands-remote-patient-monitoring-coverage-in-proposed-2022-pfs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the amount of reimbursement codes that apply to remote patient monitoring – allowing payers to bill for even more types of remote patient monitoring these services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulatory landscape for remote patient monitoring is still very much in flux – though these regulations are moving in a direction that probably helps companies like Kiddo. According to Swamy, Kiddo’s technology is reimbursable thanks to these CPT codes. “So there&#8217;s a financial kind of outcome for the health systems that we work with,” he adds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this current round, Swamy hopes to increase the size of Kiddo’s sales and product development teams. He also has ambitions to expand the amount of chronic conditions Kiddo can treat. Right now, the company has an eye on pediatric oncology and orthopedics services, and hopes to move in that direction in the next 2 years. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing its own version of Twitter&#8217;s retweet with the addition of a new &#8220;Repost&#8221; button that allows users to amplify videos on the platform by sharing them with their own followers. The new Repost button is found in the &#8220;Share&#8221; menu where you could otherwise send the video to friends through messages, texts or social media posts elsewhere. Except, instead of sharing the video with friends directly, the Repost button promotes the video to your friends on TikTok.</p>
<p>But unlike a Twitter retweet, the reposted video will not show on your own TikTok profile &#8212; it only sends the video out to your friends&#8217; For You feeds.</p>
<p>The button is also not available across all of TikTok.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253022" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For example, if you find a video through the Discover page or in your TikTok inbox from a friend&#8217;s share, you won&#8217;t see the Repost button there. It only appears on videos you come across when you&#8217;re browsing your own For You feed on the app, we&#8217;ve confirmed. In other words, it&#8217;s a way to boost the visibility of video you&#8217;ve already been recommended algorithmically and now want more people to see. However, it stops short of requiring users to create their own video to make that happen &#8212; by either stitching or dueting with the original content, which is how users re-share others&#8217; videos today. This provides a low-friction way for users to engage with TikTok videos and re-share them and could encourage more passive users to participate on the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253051" style="width: 1368px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253051" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2253051 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg" alt="" width="1358" height="1361" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg 1358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=768,770 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3003.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1358px) 100vw, 1358px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253051" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>The feature is also one that hails back to a TikTok precursor: the short-form video platform known as Vine, which was acquired by Twitter and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine/">shut down years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Vine had also once offered a repost button (or in its case, a &#8220;revine&#8221; feature) that allowed users to repost a video for increased visibility. But Vine&#8217;s button had a mixed reception as some creators <a href="https://vineblogger.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/in-defense-of-the-revine-button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would abuse the feature</a> by offering &#8220;revine 4 revine&#8221; &#8212; that is, groups who would promote each others&#8217; content by agreeing to &#8220;revine&#8221; all the group members&#8217; videos. Instagram, too, faces a similar problem <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/instagram-pods-game-the-algorithm-by-coordinating-likes-and-comments-on-millions-of-posts/">where groups of Instagram users agreed</a> to systematically exchange likes and comments to game the service&#8217;s algorithms. TikTok, which is known for its eerily accurate, highly personalized For You feed, would seemingly run the risk of diluting its recommendations with &#8220;reposts&#8221; if creators also attempted to game the algorithm via the new Repost button.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But TikTok is attempting to address this problem by making its Repost button work differently than the &#8220;revine&#8221; &#8212; at least for the time being. Users will only see re-shared recommendations if they&#8217;re <em>mutual</em> <em>friends</em> with the person who reposted the video. That means you won&#8217;t necessarily see a larger creator&#8217;s recommendations unless that creator for some reason also follows you, too. By limiting recommendations to mutuals, TikTok combats the risk that would come from creators teaming up. But it also limits the potential for reposted content to gain a significant number of new views &#8212; like if it was re-shared by a popular creator, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253054" style="width: 1447px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253054" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2253054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg" alt="" width="1437" height="928" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg 1437w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg?resize=768,496 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg?resize=680,439 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_3002.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1437px) 100vw, 1437px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253054" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok confirms the button is being tested on the publicly available version of its app with a small number of users for the time being. However, it&#8217;s already attracted a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=tiktok%20repost%20button&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention on Twitter</a> as users have been posting screenshots of the new feature. Some people seem to believe it&#8217;s a new feature everyone has access to, but that&#8217;s not yet the case, we understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience. Currently, we&#8217;re experimenting with a new way for people to share TikTok videos they enjoy,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch, after clarifying the feature&#8217;s functionality.</p>
<p>If you happen to have access to the Repost button, you&#8217;ll be able to use it when browsing your For You feed. When you tap the button on a video you want to promote, TikTok informs you the video will be visible to your friends. The app also prompts you to share a few words about why you reposted the video. These don&#8217;t appear as comments on the video, but are flagged directly on the video itself above the creators&#8217; name and video description. Here, you&#8217;ll see which friends have reposted the content and can tap the &#8220;reposted&#8221; label to read their comments in a small, pop-up window.</p>
<p>And if you change your mind about your Repost, you can tap into the Share menu and then on &#8220;Remove Repost&#8221; to undo your re-sharing. This will delete the message you&#8217;ve added, as well, TikTok notes.</p>
<p>In some cases, TikTok users are seeing the Repost button labeled as &#8220;Recommend&#8221; because TikTok is still playing around with the language it wants to use here. But like the Repost, the Recommend button also prompts users to share why they&#8217;re re-sharing the video with others.</p>
<p>If TikTok chooses to roll out the Repost button more broadly, it could prove to be a new way creators get their content discovered on a platform that is today more about algorithmic recommendations than it is about personal suggestions. But TikTok has likely observed how many of its users already leverage its in-app messaging system just to send videos to friends and is now trying to find a way to better incorporate that signal into the For You feed itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech giant Qualcomm signaled a strong commitment to furthering its technologies in the automotive sector at CES this year, announcing new OEM clients and the opening of an engineering software office in Berlin to support the company&#8217;s European auto customers with the latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/qualcomms-new-mobile-flagship-snapdragon-8-gen-1-arriving-on-devices-this-year/">Snapdragon</a> Digital Chassis.</p>
<p>“The office opening is further evidence of the company’s commitment to bring new and exciting technologies to the Automotive sector,” said Enrico Salvatori, senior vice president and president of Europe/MEA and Qualcomm Europe, in a statement.</p>
<p>The digital chassis is a suite of cloud-connected &#8220;platforms&#8221; which automakers can adopt in full or à la carte, and it includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252780" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Qualcomm&#8217;s integrated automotive platforms, including the digital chassis, have an order pipeline of more than $13 billion, according to the company. Snapdragon as it stands today is built off the back of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/qualcomm-launches-a-car-to-cloud-service-for-over-the-air-updates-and-telemetrics/">Qualcomm&#8217;s car-to-cloud service</a>, announced at CES in 2020, which was the company&#8217;s first product that aimed to keep cars connected to the cloud. This would allow for faster over-the-air updates and the ability to gather vehicle and usage analytics to create new revenue streams both for the company and for automaker partners.</p>
<p>“Qualcomm Technologies understands automakers’ needs for uniqueness and differentiation as well as the tremendous opportunity to redefine the automotive and transportation business model,&#8221; said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of automotive at Qualcomm, in a statement. “The Snapdragon Digital Chassis allows platforms to stay continually up-to-date with new capabilities after vehicle purchase, while allowing the automaker to create new features and services for enhanced customer engagement and services-based business models.”</p>
<p>Volvo became one of the many automakers to integrate Snapdragon into their vehicles, the companies announced on Tuesday. Volvo&#8217;s upcoming fully electric SUV and Volvo EV brand Polestar&#8217;s Polestar 3 SUV will both be powered by Qualcomm&#8217;s digital cockpit, powered by Google&#8217;s Android OS, and a suite of wireless technologies to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and the automaker expects to launch vehicles with these features later this year.</p>
<p>Honda also shared plans to bring Qualcomm&#8217;s digital cockpit to its upcoming models for the first time, which it expects to be commercially available in the U.S. in the second half of 2022 and across the globe in 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Renault Group announced in September its plans to integrate the digital cockpit into its Mégane E-Tech electric vehicle, but on Tuesday, the company shared plans to expand that collaboration to the entire suite of digital chassis platforms, including the connectivity platform and the Snapdragon Ride platform.</p>
<p>Volvo, Honda and Renault join the increasingly long list of Qualcomm Snapdragon customers, which seemed to have picked up in earnest around the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/qualcomm-acquires-veoneer-for-4-5-billion-canceling-its-agreement-with-magna/">Qualcomm acquired automotive tech company Veoneer</a> in October. Since then, Qualcomm has signed on around 40 OEMs, including BMW, GM, Hyundai, JiDu, Xpeng, NIO and WM, to integrate different Snapdragon platforms into their vehicles.</p>
<p>Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon is also enabling other companies building automotive infotainment centers to innovate. At CES, the company announced a partnership with Alps Alpine to develop a &#8220;Digital Cabin,&#8221; which is powered by the Snapdragon cockpit. The cabin includes technologies such as an e-mirror that helps ameliorate blind spots by providing a peripheral view, a large ceiling display and sound zones that project noise individually to each passenger.</p>
<p>While most of Qualcomm&#8217;s clients are opting to enhance their cockpits and infotainment systems, the company might be most bullish on its Ride platform, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that should provide a powerful enough processor to allow for many ADAS and automated driving functions. Veoneer&#8217;s Arriver self-driving software unit has only enhanced Ride, which has allowed it to compete directly with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/nvidias-next-generation-self-driving-toolkit-is-available-for-2024-vehicle-models/">Nvidia&#8217;s Drive Orin SoC</a>, which is already being used to develop similar functionalities with customers like Cruise, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Zoox and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tusimple-integrates-nvidias-newest-auto-grade-chip-to-scale-autonomous-trucking/">most recently, TuSimple</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If we do see public software valuations keep dipping while private-market software valuations stay extreme, someone is going to be very wrong. We just won't know for a little while who it was.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kicking off 2022 may feel like we&#8217;re stuck the third round of 2020, but things have actually changed quite a lot in Technology Land, even if the pandemic is still with us.</p>
<p>Crypto has become far more established in the intervening period, for example, with more investors, startups and fundraising to be found in the space. Another change from the pre-pandemic days is the value of software revenues.</p>
<p>That may sound a little esoteric, but given that much of the startup world builds and sells software, the value of those incomes is incredibly important. If the value of software revenue rises, the value of software startups rises as well. That lowers investing risk. In turn, the climate for investing in software startups &#8212; which is <em>most</em> of them, mind &#8212; warms as risk decreases.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t bore you with the mechanics of changing startup risk in a market rife with rising revenue multiples. What matters for our purposes today is to note that software became more valuable since the onset of the pandemic, inducing investors to fight over startup deals and preempt private rounds more often than was previously the norm.</p>
<p>The result? Rising startup prices.</p>
<p>The fact that startups have become more expensive, measured by comparing their valuations to their revenues, is reasonable. However, the H2 2020 software valuation boom tapered last year as SaaS and cloud stocks closed 2021 down a fraction from where they started the year.</p>
<p>Even more, 2022 is starting off downright nasty for software stocks. The <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bessemer Cloud Index</a> (trackable <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WCLD?p=WCLD&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the $WCLD ETF</a>), a basket of public software stocks, has lost ample ground thus far in 2022 (the following chart has a five-day range, so mind the dates):</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253176" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253176" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253176 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1253" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253176" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YCharts</p></div></p>
<p>The index is off around 5.8% <em>today</em> as I write to you.</p>
<p>Zooming out, observe how the same basket of software and cloud stocks has lost ground since the start of 2021:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253178" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253178" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253178 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png" alt="" width="2000" height="1253" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=768,481 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=1536,962 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/WCLD_^MSWNTR_chart-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253178" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YCharts</p></div></p>
<p>Now normally this would not be an issue. Stocks go up and stocks go down. It&#8217;s what they are best at.</p>
<p>But there are second-order effects to consider. If the value of software stocks is on the ascent, startups benchmarking their present and future worth have rich comps to leverage. If those same software stocks lose ground, the startup comps start to make less sense. Thus the connection between public company prices and the value of startups.</p>
<p>As software stocks went up in 2020, tech investor willingness to pay more for less startup revenue rose. And it appeared to keep rising last year, even as software stocks struggled to hold onto their 2020 gains. But from a late 2021 peak, those same stocks have given back all their recent gains, and more.</p>
<p>Notably, this pretty sharp decline in value doesn&#8217;t appear to be hitting the private markets in the same way:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous shuttle company EasyMile and sidewalk robot delivery startup Coco are integrating DriveU.auto&#8217;s teleoperation and connectivity platform into their operations, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/driveu-auto-a-liveu-spinout-comes-out-of-stealth-with-4m/">DriveU.auto, an Israeli startup that came out of stealth last year</a>, they announced at CES.</p>
<p>The autonomous vehicle industry is still a ways off from being able to commercialize full self-driving technology, despite the promises certain companies have made or the way they choose to name their advanced driver assistance systems. Indeed most countries still require a human to be in the loop during autonomous operations for safety purposes. To get to market faster and increase public acceptance of driverless vehicles, AV companies are turning to teleoperations, where a remote driver can swoop in to pilot the vehicles in the event of an emergency, anomaly or safety incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Think of the site of an accident where there are multiple police officers gesturing at traffic to drive around,&#8221; Alon Podhurst, CEO at DriveU.auto, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The AI of the vehicle will in all likelihood ask for assistance to interpret these gestures and vocal commands. The remote operator needs to see a real-time view of the world around the vehicle she is assisting &#8212; a robot or an autonomous vehicle&#8230;We want to stream the feed from the vehicle sensors to the remote operator’s location. This must be done in a manner ensuring reliable, high-quality and low-latency connectivity so that the decisions being made by the remote operator are based on the actual real-world situation around the vehicle. This is done over cellular networks.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252266" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Much of the success of teleoperations relies on high-performance connectivity in order to transfer video, audio and other sensor data. DriveU.auto&#8217;s connectivity platform aims to ensure stable network connections and avoid any latency, &#8220;dark spots&#8221; or drops in connection that could prevent a teleoperator intervening to help an autonomous vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;No single cellular network &#8212; not even 5G &#8212; can guarantee the performance levels needed for reliable remote operation,&#8221; said Podhurst. &#8220;Remember, the task is to transmit multiple feeds, as there are multiple cameras on the vehicle, of high-definition video over a constrained cellular network, from a moving vehicle. Bottom line &#8212; one network is not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>DriveU.auto&#8217;s tech is already live on a fleet of EasyMile&#8217;s EZ10 autonomous shuttles that are serving a medical complex in France, and the company is in the process of integrating into the entire EasyMile fleet, according to Podhurst.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to deploy more and more use cases for autonomous vehicles, we expect remote supervision to be a key component of our solution,&#8221; said Benoit Perrin, managing director of EasyMile, in a statement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s connectivity solution is also already in Coco&#8217;s fleet of about 100 Coco 0 units, its proof-of-concept pilot vehicle. The plan is to integrate the platform into the new shipment of 1,000 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">Coco 1 robots, the hardware base of which is being built by Segway</a> and will be deployed in Los Angeles and two other U.S. cities during Q1 2022, according to Coco.</p>
<p>Aside from EasyMile and Coco, the startup says it is already operational on robotaxis, autonomous trucks, other delivery robots and special use case AVs, all partnerships that are still under non-disclosure agreements, but Podhurst says he hopes to go public in the coming weeks. The company recently announced an <a href="https://driveu.auto/blog/denso-validates-driveu-auto-connectivity-platform-for-autonomous-vehicle-teleoperation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18-month partnership with Denso</a>, a Japanese auto parts manufacturer.</p>
<p>DriveU.auto typically provides customers with a software development kit that is integrated into the vehicles&#8217; computers. Customers operate their own vehicles, including the teleoperation, relying on the vehicle&#8217;s existing sensor suite and other hardware components. Podhurst says this software-only approach is a key component in the company&#8217;s market traction because it makes for faster integrations.</p>
<div>The software-based connectivity platform works by fusing three technologies: dynamic video encoding, low-latency algorithms and cellular bonding. The fused data package is then sent over multiple cellular networks based on the performance of the networks at the time of the transmission. The data is then reconstructed as video frames once it reaches the remote operator side. To break it down further, the platform is essentially made up of software modules that are integrated into the vehicle&#8217;s system and that interoperate with both a cloud-based software component and a module that&#8217;s been integrated into the remote operator&#8217;s computer.</div>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Integrating a superior connectivity solution on delivery robots dictates extremely demanding power and compute parameters,” said Sahil Sharma, COO of Coco, in a statement. “Having evaluated the industry leaders in this space, we found DriveU’s solution to be the strongest match for our growth plans and aggressive delivery schedules.”  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An AirTag and Tile competitor called <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipolo</a> has today launched a new product that allows consumers to locate their missing wallet through Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find My app</a> or be notified if they&#8217;ve accidentally left it behind. The <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-card-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipolo CARD Spot</a> is an updated version of the company&#8217;s existing <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card-2-pack?cl=header" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smart card,</a> which now works with Apple&#8217;s Find My network similar to its other lost-item tracker, the Chipolo ONE Spot &#8212; a smaller, rounded device that competes more directly with AirTag.</p>
<p>The new slim smart card is nearly as thin as a bank card at 3.35 inches x 2.11 inches in size, allowing it to be slid into a wallet&#8217;s credit card pockets.</p>
<p>To track the device, customers pair the Chipolo CARD Spot with their iPhone or iPad using the Find My app&#8217;s support for tracking hardware accessories manufactured by third parties. This system, backed by <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple&#8217;s MFi Program</a>, provides device makers with the technical specifications and resources needed to create accessories that can communicate with Apple devices, like the iPhone. It was also a point of contention for Tile, which had previously led the lost item tracker market before Apple&#8217;s entry with AirTag.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Tile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">argued Apple abused its power</a> to take over that market, saying Apple now wanted device makers like itself to give up direct access to their customers through their own mobile apps by integrating with Apple technology instead. And Apple delayed access to its technology until AirTag had launched and established its own customer base. (Tile recently exited to Life360 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/family-locator-service-life360-to-acquire-tile-for-205-million/">for $205 million</a>, apparently seeing the writing on the wall in terms of its potential as a standalone company going forward given the increased competition.)</p>
<p>Chipolo, however, had taken a different stance. Instead of fighting Apple, the company embraced Apple&#8217;s network, rolling out Find My support for its <a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-one-spot?cl=header" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original tracker</a> which resembles the AirTag. This may have helped Chipolo raise its profile and reach new customers who were just learning about lost item trackers and their capabilities, thanks to Apple&#8217;s promotion of the new devices.</p>
<p>With its Chipolo CARD Spot, the company is now further capitalizing on its potential by offering a Find My-connected product that Apple doesn&#8217;t have: a smart card for tracking your wallet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, this new accessory largely competes with <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/store/tiles/slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tile&#8217;s thin wallet  tracker, the Tile Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Like Tile&#8217;s smart card, the Chipolo card can be rung or placed into a Lost Mode when the wallet goes missing. The ring is loud (105 dB) and the card can be located within Find My&#8217;s 200 ft. range.</p>
<p>Chipolo&#8217;s new device is water-resistant to splashes (IPX5), but Tile Slim is somewhat better on this front at IP67. The Chipolo card&#8217;s battery life will last up to two years. At that point, customers will receive an email offering a 50% discount on a new product and can ship back their old one for recycling. Tile Slim promises up to 3 years, however.</p>
<p>The Chipolo device is $35 for one or $60 for two, while Tile has discounted its Slim down to $29.99 for one or $59.99 for two.</p>
<p>But Chipolo&#8217;s advantage is that its customers are likely opting for a device that works with the Find My app, specifically &#8212; and Tile&#8217;s does not.</p>
<p>Plus, as consumers are becoming aware of the safety issues with AirTag &#8212; the devices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/technology/apple-airtags-tracking-stalking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are being used for stalking and carjacking,</a> reports have noted &#8212; they may opt to use a Find My-connected product, as Apple&#8217;s app can proactively alert them to unknown devices following them around. Tile is only now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/tile-unveils-its-new-product-lineup-including-its-upcoming-apple-airtag-rival-tile-ultra/">working</a> on anti-stalking features.</p>
<p>Chipolo&#8217;s new device is available for pre-order via its website and on <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/chipolo-card-spot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad</a>, and ships in February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Threat intelligence giant Recorded Future announced Tuesday that it has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-acquires-securitytrails-301453543.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> SecurityTrails, an internet inventory startup that collects and banks current and historical domain and IP address data, for $65 million.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not immediately disclosed. A spokesperson for Recorded Future confirmed the acquisition price.</p>
<p>SecurityTrails collects and maintains vast amounts of current and historical internet records, such as domain name records, registration data and DNS information, giving organizations visibility into what their threat attack surface is — that is, the networks and servers that are accessible from the wider internet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253137" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two companies have a long-standing relationship already. SecurityTrails became a technology partner in 2018 — a year after it was founded — providing Recorded Future with data for its intelligence platform, which customers use to improve their security standing and fend off adversaries.</p>
<p>The deal will deepen technological ties between the two companies. In remarks, Recorded Future&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Dr. Christopher Ahlberg said that the combined technology from the two companies makes life &#8220;miserable for the adversary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition comes less than a year after Recorded Future invested in SecurityTrails from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/recorded-future-has-a-new-20m-fund-for-early-stage-startups/">its newly established Intelligence Fund</a> for early-stage startups. Recorded Future was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought by Insight Partners</a> in April 2019 for $780 million.</p>
<p>Chris Ueland, SecurityTrails&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive, said the two companies &#8220;naturally complement each other in terms of providing risk landscape visibility.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Skydio&#8217;s self-flying drone is getting a host of new software, hardware and services updates to ring in the new year.</p>
<p>The Bay Area-based drone company is revamping their flagship drone with a number of features designed around usability, along with a major software update focused on bringing more control to users without forcing them to take manual control of the drone. The team is also delivering a new service plan called Skydio Care designed to give drone owners a protection plan that supplements their existing warranty but allows for rapid replacement of accidentally damaged devices.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Skydio has been in an interesting position as a young American drone company with both consumer and enterprise clients. The startups has raised more than $340 million from top venture capitalists on the promise it can take drones mainstream with AI-aided controls that simplify user onboarding.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Its latest device &#8212;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an updated version of its Skydio 2 drone called the Skydio 2+ &#8212; aims to serve both customers. The big update here increased flight range thanks to 5 GHz Wi-Fi radio and two pop-up antennas that extend maximum range from 3.5 km to 6 km. The 2+ also sports a higher-density battery pack that adds a few minutes to its maximum flight time, now 27 minutes.</span></p>

<p>The AI-powered feature allows for more cinematic capture by giving the user the power to define the individual shots they want to capture with the device&#8217;s app but then allowing the Skydio drone to handle the trouble of moving between those shots while creating a sweeping video that nails all of the key points of interest.</p>
<p>The software feature is one of the most powerful yet to come to the device and may help onboard enterprise clients who are still skittish to play around with self-flying drone software. Skydio has another effort to entice the nervous: a new service plan called Skydio Plus that brings flat rate accidental damage repair to the device. Users will be able to choose 1-year or 2-year support plans for $149 and $249 respectively, which allow users to replace broken or lost drones for flat rates. The first replacement of a damaged drone will cost just $150 for subscribers while a lost drone will require users to pay up $550 to replace it under the extended warranty plan.</p>
<p>The Skydio 2+, which starts at $1,099 for a basic package and taps out at $2,169 for a Pro Kit is available for order now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye is partnering with Chinese automaker Zeekr to develop an all-electric autonomous vehicle for consumers. The vehicle will be sold in China starting in 2024 and eventually roll out to other markets, the companies said Tuesday without naming specific countries or a timeline.</p>
<p>The companies made the announcement Tuesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. Mobileye also announced separate deals with Ford and Volkswagen Group to use its mapping technology to support their respective advanced driving assistance systems.</p>
<p>The planned Zeekr autonomous vehicle will combine Mobileye&#8217;s chips with Zeekr parent company Geely Holdings&#8217; electric vehicle architecture, which includes redundant braking, steering and power. The company didn&#8217;t show what that vehicle might look like (the main photo shown in this article is of the Zeekr 001 EV, which includes Mobileye tech).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The upcoming vehicle will have so-called Level 4, or L4, capabilities, a term that means it will be able to handle all aspects of driving for the human in certain conditions. This might mean the technology will only work on certain roadways or urban centers or when weather conditions are ideal.</p>
<p>The Mobileye tech will include six of its EyeQ5, or fifth generation, system on chips, which will be used to process incoming data from sensors as well as incorporate the company&#8217;s branded &#8220;Road Experience Map&#8221; mapping technology and Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)-based driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye also announced that it is scaling up research and development efforts in China with plans to open a local data center and boost with workforce there.</p>
<p>The Mobileye-Zeekr news comes less than a month since Waymo, Alphabet&#8217;s autonomous driving technology arm, announced it was partnering with Chinese automaker Geely to build an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/">all-electric, self-driving ride-hailing vehicle</a>. The companies said they would integrate Waymo&#8217;s AV system into Geely&#8217;s Zeekr vehicles for use in U.S. markets &#8220;in the years to come.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mobileye, best known for its chips that support advanced driver assistance systems, has also been developing automated vehicle technology for several years. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology &#8212; is combined with its REM mapping system and RSS driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its system on chip to build high-definition maps that can be used to support ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. The mapping technology is accessed via the cloud to provide, in real time, up-to-date information on the drivable paths ahead.</p>
<p>Mobileye already has agreements with BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip — the most recent chip equipped in vehicles — which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an aftermarket product it sells to commercial operators. Today, it has over 1 million vehicles harvesting REM data — now up to over 25 million kilometers per day. Mobileye has used all of this crowdsourced, anonymized information to create a database of precise, high-definition maps that it has branded Mobileye Roadbook.</p>
<p>Mobileye is now expanding its relationship with Volkswagen Group to take the map data that is being collected and apply it to the automaker&#8217;s Travel Assist 2.5 driver assistance system. The expanded partnership was also announced at CES.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Mobileye&#8217;s Roadbook will be used to increase the functionality of VW&#8217;s ADAS. For instance, where available, lane-keeping assistance will be provided in many areas without visible lane markings, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>The companies said Tuesday that Roadbook-enhanced Travel Assist features will be available soon in Volkswagen, Škoda and Seat electric vehicle models based on Volkswagen&#8217;s MEB platform.</p>
<p>Mobileye also announced Tuesday that Ford will begin using Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping technology in future versions of Ford&#8217;s hands-free advanced driver assistance system called BlueCruise. The companies did not share a timeline for when the mapping tech would be integrated into Ford&#8217;s ADAS system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CES may be going ahead as a shortened, pared-down operation this year, but we’re still seeing a decent swathe of announcements prepared for the event still coming out into the wild, in particular among chipmakers who power the world&#8217;s computers. Intel has been a regular presence at the show and is continuing that with its run of news today, focusing on the newest, 12th generation of its mobile chip with versions aimed both at enterprises and consumers, alongside updates to its Evo computing platform concept, new 35- and 65-watt processors for desktop and vPro platform launches.</p>
<p>With some of the lineup announced back in October (it has now dropped the Alder Lake naming that appeared still to be in use then) today&#8217;s news is arguably the biggest push that Intel has made in years to promote its processors built for a range of use cases, from consumers through to more intense gaming, through to enterprise applications and IoT deployments. After what some described as a lacklustre 11th-generation launch, here Intel is unveiling no less than 28 new 12th-generation Intel Core mobile processors, and an additional 22 desktop processors.</p>
<p>Intel claims that the mobile processors are clocking in speeds of up to 40% faster than previous generations</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253010" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Intel&#8217;s new performance hybrid architecture is helping to accelerate the pace of innovation and the future of compute,” said Gregory Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, in a statement. &#8220;We want to bring that idea of ubiquitous computing to life,&#8221; he added in a presentation today at CES.</p>
<p>The H-series of the 12th Gen Intel core mobile processors come in four main categories: i3, i5, i7 and i9. The i9-12900HK is the fastest of the range of eight and are one of the first from Intel to build performance and efficient cores together on the same chip to better handle heavy workloads. They come with frequencies of up to 5GHz, 14 cores (six for performance, eight for efficiency) and 20 threads for applications that are multi-threaded, and they also offer<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> memory support for DDR5/LPDDR5 and DDR4/LPDDR4 modules up to 4800 MT/s. Intel says this is a first in the industry for H-series mobile processors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They offer support for Deeplink for optimized power usage; Thunderbolt 4 for faster data transfers (up to 40 Gbps) and connectivity; and Intel&#8217;s new integrated Wi-Fi 6E, which Intel dubs its &#8220;Killer&#8221; Wi-Fi and will be available in nearly all</span> laptops running Intel’s 12th generation chips. The interesting thing about this latest WiFi version is that it essentially optimizes for gameplay and other bandwidth-intensive activities: latency is created by putting the most powerful applications on channels separate from the rest of the applications on a device that might also be using bandwidth (these are relegated to lower bandwidth channels) that now essentially run in the background. Bands can also be merged intelligently by the system when more power for a specific application is needed. All this will be available from February 2022, Intel said.</p>
<p class="p1">H-series, it added, is now in full production, with Acer, Dell, Gigabyte, HP, Lenovo, MSi and Razer among those building machines using it, some 100 designs in all covering both Windows and Chrome operating systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">In terms of applications that Intel is highlighting for its chip use, in addition to enterprises and more casual consumers, it continues to focus on gaming. No surprise there, given the demands of the most advanced games and gamers today, which have become major drivers for improving compute power. To that end, Intel is making sure its chips are in that mix with the 12th-generation chip.</p>
<p class="p1">That has included both investing in gaming companies (such as Razer), as well as working closely with developers to optimize speeds on its processors. Intel said that it worked with Hitman 3, for example, so that its chips could support the audio and graphics processing in the game, and increased frame rates by up to 8%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tuning games to achieve maximum performance can be daunting,” says Maurizio de Pascale, chief technology officer at IO Interactive, in a statement. &#8220;But partnering with Intel and leveraging their decades of expertise has yielded fantastic results – especially optimizing for the powerful 12th Gen Intel Core processors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">Content application remains another major part of the market for Intel, with customers building software and hardware optimized for its chips, including Adobe, Autodesk, Foundry Blender, Dolby, Dassault, Magix and more. Indeed, the processor now sits at the centre of all of these as they live as digital activities. They also represent a large number of verticals that Intel can target, including product designers, engineers, broadcasting and streaming, architects, creators and scientific visualization.</p>
<p>The 22 new processors getting unveiled are coming in both 65-watt and 35-watt varieties. Alongside the higher wattage (and thus higher energy consuming) chip, Intel also launched a new Laminar cooler.</p>
<p>Another strand of Intel&#8217;s work over the last several years has been to approach the specifications of computers running its chips in a more holistic way to integrate what it is building with where it can be put to use, by way of its Evo platform and Project Athena. Intel said that there are not more than 100 co-engineered designs using the 12th-generation chips based on these, ranging from foldable displays to more standard laptops, with many of them launching during the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Evo specifications already cover responsiveness, battery life, instant wake and fast charge, and Intel said that a new addition to that range will be a new parameter, &#8220;intelligent collaboration&#8221;, which will be focused on how many of us are using computers today, for remote collaboration, videoconferencing and the features that make it better such as AI-based noise cancellation, better Wi-Fi usage, and enhanced camera and other imaging effects. This will be likely where its $100-$150 million acquisition of screen mirroring tech provider Screenovate, which it <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-intel-acquires-israeli-co-screenovate-1001393421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in December, will fit.</p>
<p>At a time when Intel continues to face a lot of competition from the likes of AMD and Nvidia, and Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-02/what-s-apple-aapl-releasing-in-2022-iphone-14-airpods-pro-2-imac-pro-ipads-kxxmcej5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes yet more moves</a> to distance itself from the company, continuing to move ahead and reinforce the partners that it does have, and build an ecosystem around that, is the strategy that the company will continue to pursue, as long as it keeps up its end of the innovation bargain.</p>
<p>“Microsoft and Intel have a long history of partnering together to deliver incredible performance and seamless experiences to people all over the world,” said Panos Panay, chief product officer at Microsoft, in a statement. &#8220;Whether playing the latest AAA title, encoding 8K video or developing complex geological models, the combination of Windows 11 and the new 12th-gen Intel Core mobile processors means you’re getting a powerhouse experience.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">What do deep neural networks and cancer immunotherapy have in common?</p>
<p>While both are among the most transformational areas of modern science, 30 years ago, these fields were all but ridiculed by the scientific community. As a result, progress in each happened at the sidelines of academia for decades.</p>
<p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, some of the most prominent computer scientists, including Marvin Minsky, in his book &#8220;Perceptrons,&#8221; argued that neural networks (the backbone of most modern AI) would never work for most applications. He exposed flaws in the early conceptions of neural networks and argued that the whole approach was ineffective.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, during the 1980s through the 2000s, neural network pioneers and believers — Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun — continued their efforts and pursued their intuition that neural networks would succeed. These researchers found that most of the original ideas were correct but simply needed more data (think of ImageNET), computational power and further modeling tweaks to be effective.</p>
<p><a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2018-turing">Hinton, Bengio and LeCun were awarded the Turing Award</a> in 2018 (the computer science equivalent of a Nobel prize) for their work. Today, their revelations have made neural networks the most vibrant area of computer science and have revolutionized fields such as computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
<p>Cancer immunology faced similar obstacles. Treatment with IL-2 cytokine, one of the first immunomodulatory drugs, failed to meet expectations. These outcomes slowed further research, and for decades, cancer immunology wasn&#8217;t taken seriously by many cancer biologists. With the effort and intuition of some, however, it was discovered decades later that the concept of boosting the immune system to fight cancer had objective validity. It turned out that we just needed better drug targets and combinations, and eventually, researchers demonstrated that the immune system is the best tool in our fight against cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/conquest/immunotherapy-innovator-jim-allisons-nobel-purpose.h36-1592202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo</a>, who pioneered the class of cancer immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though widely accepted now, it took decades for the scientific establishment to accept these novel approaches as valid.</p>
<p>Machine learning and immunotherapy have more in common than historical similarities. The beauty of immunotherapy is that it leverages the versatility and flexibility of the immune system to fight different types of cancers. While the first immunotherapies showed results in a few cancers, they were later shown to work in many other cancer types. AI, similarly, utilizes flexible tools to solve a wide range of problems across applications via transfer and multitask learning. These processes are made possible through access to large-scale data.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something to remember: The resurgence of neural networks started in 2012 after <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920309756/pdf?md5=8c3d8439f8f7c362aef0d755bc86d40f&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S2351978920309756-main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the AlexNet architecture demonstrated 84.7% accuracy</a> in the ImageNET competition. This level of performance was revolutionary at the time, with the second-best model achieving 73.8% accuracy. The ImageNET dataset, started by Fei-Fei Li, is robust, well labeled and high quality. As a result, it has been integral to how far neural networks have brought computer vision today.</p>
<p>Interestingly, similar developments are happening now in biology. Life sciences companies and labs are building <a href="https://www.life-sciences-usa.com/product/amica-database-annotated-multi-immunai-group-biological-chemical-2001-32935.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale datasets with tens of millions of immune cells labeled consistently</a> to ensure the validity of the underlying data. These datasets are the analogs of ImageNET in biology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already seeing these large, high-quality datasets giving rise to experimentation at a rate and scale that was impossible before. For example, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine learning is being used to identify</a> immune cell types in different parts of the body and their involvement in various diseases. After identifying patterns, algorithms can &#8220;map&#8221; or predict different immune trajectories, which can then be used to interpret, for example, why some cancer immunotherapies work on particular cancer types and some don&#8217;t. The datasets act as the Google Maps of the immune system.</p>
<p>Mapping patterns of genes, proteins and cell interactions across diseases allows researchers to understand molecular pathways as the building blocks of disease. The presence or absence of a functional block helps interpret why some cancer immunotherapies work on particular cancer types but not others.</p>
<p>Mapping pathways of genes and proteins across diseases and phenotypes allows researchers to learn how they work together to activate specific pathways and fight multiple diseases. Genes can be part of numerous pathways, and they can cause distinct types of cells to behave differently.</p>
<p>Moreover, different cell types can share similar gene activities, and the same functional pathways can be found in various immune-related disorders. This makes a case for building machine learning models that perform effectively on specific tasks and transfer to other tasks.</p>
<p>Transfer learning works in deep learning models, for example, by taking simple patterns (in images, think of simple lines and curves) learned by early layers of a neural network and leveraging those layers for different problems. In biology, this allows us to transfer knowledge on how specific genes and pathways in one disease or cell type play a role in other contexts.</p>
<p>AI research that addresses the effects of genetic changes (perturbations) on immune cells and their impact on the cells and possible treatments is increasingly common in cancer immunology. This kind of research will enable us to understand these cells more quickly and lead to better drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>With large-scale data fueling further research in immunotherapy and AI, we are confident that more effective drugs to fight cancer will appear soon, thus giving hope to the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics#:~:text=Statistics%20at%20a%20Glance%3A%20The%20Burden%20of%20Cancer%20Worldwide,million%20cancer%2Drelated%20deaths%20worldwide." target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 18 million people who are diagnosed with cancer</a> every year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past decade, the Israeli cybersecurity industry has secured its place as a formidable wellspring of technological innovation. No longer famous only for its high level of human technological capital born and bred in elite army intelligence units, the Israeli industry has matured into a veritable ecosystem of its own. With enough capital in this booming ecosystem to grow massive category leaders and cultivate internal M&amp;A, Israeli startups are now major players in the global cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">last year’s recap</a> of the Israeli cybersecurity ecosystem, we anticipated that the record-breaking rounds of 2020 and marked-up valuations would continue in 2021, but upon collecting and assessing this past year’s data, we were taken aback by the magnitude. Israeli cybersecurity startups in 2021 raised a stunning $8.84 billion, more than triple the amount in 2020 ($2.75 billion). Investments last year were distributed across 135 rounds, up from 109 in 2020, with 15 startups raising more than one funding round last year.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity market today has limited patience, and a &#8220;go big or go home&#8221; mindset has permeated as founders focus on laying the groundwork for reaching unicorn status, building multibillion-dollar companies, going public and more. Cybersecurity in Israel has become a polarized market that accepts only two types of startups: potential unicorns and actual unicorns.</p>

<p>With such early and constantly growing investments, the industry has taken on a new approach that favors the survival of the fittest. It quickly becomes clear who will stay the course and catapult to growth and success, and who will look for the nearest exit with no time to linger in limbo.</p>
<h2>Off to a running start</h2>
<p>In order to achieve this growth, founders are making their goals distinctly clear in investment board rooms. They require more funding for a strong head start and later on for entering the unicorn club at record speed. Fortunately, such sizable amounts of capital are readily available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg" alt="Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed towards the later stages" width="1024" height="645" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg 1310w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=768,484 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/YLV_SOTCN2021_A-Polarized-Industry.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252465" class="wp-caption-text">Capital allocation for growth rounds in 2021 skewed toward the later stages. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> YL Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>The total amount raised in seed rounds last year increased slightly to $233 million from $203 million in 2020, but Series A rounds surged 140% to a whopping $693 million from $288 million a year earlier. At the other end of the spectrum, growth rounds (Series C and above) rose 300% to an astounding $6.46 billion in 2021 from $1.63 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;As entrepreneurs, [2021] has drastically changed the industry’s rules,&#8221; says Assaf Hefetz, co-founder of Snyk, an Israeli cloud-native application security unicorn. &#8220;As threats abound and with skyrocketing demand for innovative solutions, Israeli cybersecurity startups now have an invaluable opportunity to grow big and grow fast. The table stakes are higher [ … ] and in such a competitive arena you have to stand out, or fold.”</p>

<p>The average seed round increased by 35% to $7 million from $5.2 million. As investments rise, so does the bar for entry into the market. Only 58 new startups were founded in 2021 compared with 2020’s 64, a testament to the competitive and highly ambitious landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Formlabs launched on Kickstarter nearly a decade ago, it stood out from the (then) crowded field of 3D printing startups by offering an accessible approach to high-res stereolithography.</p>
<p>It was a big deal, introducing a technology that had thus far been relegated to far more expensive industrial machines. It’s paid off for the company, which achieved double unicorn status earlier this year, even as much of the competition has fallen away. The company says it has sold more than 90,000 printers to date.</p>
<p>Today at CES, the MIT spinout announced a pair of new printers &#8212; the Form 3+ and Form 3B+. As the names imply, the new printers are updates to the Form 3 and 3B, announced back in 2019. The main update here is speed &#8212; promising exposure and printing that’s up to 40% faster than earlier models. That comes courtesy of more powerful, higher intensity lasers for the resin curing process. The new Build Platform 2, meanwhile, promises faster and easier removal of prints.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Formlabs created the professional desktop printer market, and our Form 3 has become a best-seller,” CEO Max Lobovsky said in a release tied to the CES news. “The Form 3+ is the next iteration designed to help users go from idea to part in hand as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<p>Also new for the show is a new ESD (electrostatic discharge) resin for printing, designed specifically for electronics manufacturing, automotive and aerospace applications.</p>

<p>At the core of Omniverse is the Universal Scene Description format, which makes it easy to import assets from a wide variety of existing tools. But sometimes, you just want a basic 3D asset and are willing to pay for it, so Nvidia also now added support for 3D marketplaces and libraries from the likes of TurboSquid by Shutterstock, CGTrader, Sketchfab and Twinbru in the Omniverse Launcher. Reallusion’s ActorCore, Daz3D and e-on software’s PlantCatalog will soon launch their own Omniverse-ready assets, too.</p>

<p>For free assets, Omniverse is expanding its set of Omniverse Machinima assets with new characters and objects from games like Shadow Warrior 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And when you need your character to speak, Omniverse Audio2Face, an existing AI-enabled app that animates 3D faces with the help of an audiotrack, now features <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-blendshapes-in-unity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blendshape</a> support and the ability to export directly to Epic&#8217;s <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaHuman Creator app</a>.</p>
