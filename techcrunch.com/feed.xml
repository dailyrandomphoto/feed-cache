										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis financing company Bespoke Financial today announced it raised $8 million in a Series A financing round. Through this round, the company brought new, key investors into its corner as it fights to bring financing solutions to companies in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Bespoke is a direct lender and provides several financing solutions to companies operating in cannabis. These short-term loans allow the companies to build credit with Bespoke, which then offers better terms on subsequent loans and products. The company says its loan origination volume has grown exponentially, outgrowing forecasts by 25% over the proceeding year. The company has deployed $120 million in gross merchandise volume over 2,000 cannabis license holders with zero defaults to date.</p>
<p>With this new round of capital, Bespoke intends to launch new financing structures and expand its financing options across various distribution channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and Co-founder George Mancheil calls this round a pivotal moment for his company and stamp of validation on the direction and products offered by Bespoke Financial. As he tells TechCrunch, this round provides several key partners to the growing startup.</p>
<p>The financing round was co-led by Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde Capital and Sweat Equity Ventures, along with Ceres Group Holdings, Greenhouse Capital Partners, DoubleLine Capital&#8217;s co-founder and former president Philip Barach, and Robery Stavis, a VC based in New York.</p>
<p>This is Sweat Equity Ventures&#8217; (SEV) first investment into a cannabis company. SEV, backed and in part funded by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, is led by Dan Portillo and works differently from traditional venture funds. SEV works with founders to provide top engineering and business talent to its portfolio companies. In exchange for these services, SEV takes equity from the companies instead of just writing checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our firm&#8217;s first investment in the cannabis industry, and we are excited to partner with Bespoke as more and more states legalize cannabis use, and the Federal government contemplates nationwide legalization. This partnership combines Bespoke&#8217;s finance and cannabis acumen with our team&#8217;s expertise scaling innovative tech companies, and will provide cannabis companies greater access to streamlined financing while benefiting investors with increased transparency and enhanced risk surveillance,&#8221; says Dan Portillo, Managing Partner of Sweat Equity Ventures, in a released statement.</p>
<p>Karan Wadhera, managing partner at Casa Verde Capital, says Bespoke Financial addresses real needs in a growing industry. Casa Verde Capital previously invested in Bespoke Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/meet-bespoke-financial-a-lender-for-cannabis-companies-backed-by-snoop-doggs-casa-verde-capital/">including in a $7 million round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Bespoke CEO Mancheil tells TechCrunch his company is focused on being more than just a lender; it wants to be a modern financing company that allows it to act as a true partner with the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>With this $8 million in financing, Bespoke Financial has raised $28 million to date. The company was founded in 2019 and, as of this announcement, has 12 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re spent any time on TikTok lately, then you&#8217;ve probably seen a number of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Popl&#8217;s ads</a>. The <a href="https://popl.co/">startup</a> has been successfully leveraging social media to get its modern-day business card alternative in front a wider audience. Packaged as either a phone sticker, keychain or wristband, Popl uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> technology to make sharing contact information as easy as using Apple Pay. To date, Popl has sold somewhere over 700,000 units and has generated $2.7 million in sales for its digital business card technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://popl.co/">Popl</a> co-founder and CEO Jason Alvarez-Cohen, a UCLA grad with a background in computer science, first realized the potential for NFC business cards through a different use case &#8212; a device he encountered in someone&#8217;s home while attending a party. But it sparked the idea to use NFC technology for sharing information person-to-person, which would be faster than alternatives, like AirDrop or manual entry. And so, Popl was born.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139487" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139487" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though startup history is littered with would-be &#8220;business card killers&#8221; that eventually died, what makes Popl different from early contenders is that it combines both an app with a physical product &#8212; the Popl accessory. This accessory can be purchased in a variety of form factors, including the popular Popl phone sticker that you can apply right to the back of your phone case (or even the top of your Popsocket), and customized with a photo of your choosing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, in the past, people would tap phones and share information like that. But I learned quickly that you can&#8217;t do this just phone-to-phone with pure software,&#8221; says Alvarez-Cohen. &#8220;So I was like, what&#8217;s the closest way we can get the phone tapping? And that&#8217;s how I came up with this back-of-the-phone product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each Popl accessory is actually an NFC tag which enables the handoff of the user&#8217;s contact information. When the phones are close, the recipient will get a notification that alerts them to your shared Popl data.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to quickly exchange contact information. You can easily enter in someone&#8217;s digits into your phone&#8217;s contacts app directly, for example, which may work better for more casual encounters &#8212; like meeting someone at a bar. But Popl lets you share a full business cards&#8217; worth of contact data with just a tap, which makes it better for professional encounters, or any other time you want to share more than just your phone number.</p>
<p>While the Popl tags make for a nice gimmick, the Popl mobile app is what makes the overall service useful. And to be clear, the app is <em>only</em> necessary for the Popl&#8217;s owner &#8212; the recipient doesn&#8217;t need the app installed for Popl to work. They will, however, need to have a phone that <a href="https://www.bluebite.com/nfc/iphone-nfc-compatibility">can read NFC tags</a>, which can leave out some older devices. Or, as a backup, they&#8217;ll need ability to scan the QR code the app provides as a workaround.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png 3375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=2048,1646 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AddYourLinks.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p>
<p>In the Popl app, you can customize which data you want to share with others &#8212; including your contact info, social profiles, website links, etc. &#8212; all via an easy-to-use interface. Like some business card apps in the past, you can flip in between a personal profile and a business profile in Popl in order to share the appropriate information when out networking. To actually make the exchange of contact information with another person, you simply hold up your phone to theirs and they&#8217;ll get a notification directing them to your Popl profile webpage. (The phones don&#8217;t have to physically touch or bump together, however. It&#8217;s more like Apple Pay, where they have to be near each other.)</p>
<p>From the Popl website that&#8217;s shared via the notification that pops up, the recipient can tap on the various options to connect with the sender &#8212; for example, adding them on a social network like LinkedIn or Instagram, grabbing their phone number to send a quick text, or even downloading a full contact card to their phone&#8217;s address book, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139500" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139500" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png 3375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=680,547 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=1536,1235 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=2048,1646 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CreateYourProfile.png?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p>
<p>The app&#8217;s more clever feature, however, is something Popl calls &#8220;Direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>This patented feature won&#8217;t send over the Popl website where the recipient then has to choose how they want to connect. Instead, it opens up the destination app directly. For example, if you have LinkedIn Direct on, the recipient will be taken directly to your profile on LinkedIn when they tap the notification. Or if you put your Contact Card on Direct, it will just pop your address book entry onto the screen so the user can choose to save it to their phone.</p>
<p>For paid users, the app also lets you track your history of Popl connections on a map, so you can recall who you met, where and when, along with other analytics.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139504" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139504" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139504" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POP-BLK_flag.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139504" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p>
<p>Work on Popl, which is co-founded by Alvarez-Cohen&#8217;s UCLA roommate, Nick Eischens, now Popl COO, began in late 2019. The startup then launched in February 2020 &#8212; just before the coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S. That could have been a disastrous time for a business designed to help people exchange information during in-person meetings when the world was now shifting to Zoom and remote work. But Alvarez-Cohen says they marketed Popl as a &#8220;contactless solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have this, and I have to meet someone for my business, I don&#8217;t even have to tap it &#8212;  you can just hover, and it will still send that information,&#8221; Alvarez-Cohen says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m able to share my business card with you without handing you a business card, which is kind of safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what really helped to sell Popl were its video demos. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">One TikTok ad</a>, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen if you use TikTok at all, features the co-founders&#8217; friend <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@endicci">Arev</a> sharing her TikTok profile with a new friend just as she&#8217;s leaving the gym.</p>
<p>In the video, the recipient &#8212; clearly dumbfounded by the technology after she taps his phone &#8212; responds <em>&#8220;what? what? Whoa! What? How&#8217;d you do that?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now been viewed over 80 million times.</p>

</blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl">Popl&#8217;s TikTok videos</a> get high tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and sometimes still millions of views per video. The company also has an active presence on other social media. For instance, Popl posts regularly to Instagram where it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/popl/">over 100K followers</a>. Today, the startup&#8217;s growth now is about 60% driven by Facebook and Instagram marketing and 40% organic, Alvarez-Cohen says.</p>
<p>Now, the company is preparing new products for the post-pandemic era when in-person events return. Though it had before sold <a href="https://popl.co/pages/enterprise">Popl&#8217;s in bulk</a> for this purpose, it&#8217;s now readying an &#8220;event bracelet&#8221; that just slips on your wrist (and is reusable). The bracelet could be used at any big event &#8212; like music festivals or business conferences, where you&#8217;re meeting a lot of new people. And because Popl uses NFC, phones have to be close to make the contact info exchange &#8212; it won&#8217;t just randomly share your info with everyone you pass by them.</p>
<p>Popl is also fleshing out the business networking side of its app with integrations for Salesforce, Oracle and Hubspot, and CSV export, that come with its <a href="https://popl.co/pages/pro">Popl Pro subscription</a> ($4.99 per month). The in-app subscription is already at $320,000 in annual recurring revenue and growing 10% every week, as of early April.</p>
<p>A Y Combinator Winter 2021 participant, Popl is backed by Twitch co-founder Justin Kan (via Goat Capital), YC, Urban Innovation Fund, Cathexis Ventures, and others angels including Wish.com CEO Peter Szulczewski and Plangrid co-founder Ralph Gootee.</p>
<p>The app is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/popl/id1503939262">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfc.popl">Android</a>, and the Popl accessories are sold on its <a href="https://popl.co/">website</a> and on <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=popl">Target.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has intervened to trigger public interest scrutiny of chipmaker&#8217;s Nvidia&#8217;s planned to buy Arm Holdings.</p>
<p>The secretary of state for digital issues, Oliver Dowden, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-secretary-instructs-cma-to-look-into-nvidias-takeover-of-arm">said today</a> that the government wants to ensure that any national security implications of the semiconductor deal are explored.</p>
<p>Nvidia&#8217;s $40BN acquisition of UK-based Arm was announced last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">September</a> but remains to be cleared by regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began to solicit views on the proposed deal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/uks-markets-regulator-asks-for-views-on-nvidia-arm/">January</a>.</p>
<p>Domestic opposition to Nvidia&#8217;s plan has been swift, with one of the original Arm co-founders kicking off a campaign to &#8216;save Arm&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-starts-save-arm-campaign-to-keep-independence-amid-40b-nvidia-deal/">last year</a>. Hermann Hauser warned that Arm&#8217;s acquisition by a U.S. entity would end its position as a company independent of U.S. interests &#8212; risking the U.K.&#8217;s economic sovereignty by surrendering its most powerful trade weapon.</p>
<p>The intervention by Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; using statutory powers set out in the Enterprise Act 2002 &#8212; means the competition regulator has been instructed to begin a phase 1 investigation.</p>
<p>The CMA has a deadline of July 30 to submit its report to the secretary of state.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Dowden said: “Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of ARM, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds. As a next step and to help me gather the relevant information, the UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>At the completion of the CMA&#8217;s phase 1 investigation Dowden will have an option to clear the deal, i.e. if no national security or competition concerns have been identified; or to clear it with remedies to address any identified concerns.</p>
<p>He could also refer the transaction for further scrutiny by instructing the CMA to carry out an in-depth phase 2 investigation.</p>
<p>After the phase 1 report has been submitted there is no set period when the secretary of state must make a decision on next steps &#8212; but DCMS notes that a decision should be made as soon as &#8220;reasonably practicable&#8221; to reduce uncertainty.</p>
<p>While Dowden&#8217;s intervention has been made on national security grounds, additional concerns have been raised about impact of an Nvidia take-over of Arm &#8212; specifically on U.K. jobs and on Arm&#8217;s open licensing model.</p>
<p>Nvidia sought to address those concerns last year, claiming it&#8217;s committed to Arm&#8217;s licensing model and pledging to expand the Cambridge, UK offices of Arm &#8212; saying it would create &#8220;a new global center of excellence in AI research&#8221; at the UK campus.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s hard to see what commercial concessions could be offered to assuage concern over the ramifications of an Nvidia-owed Arm on the UK&#8217;s economic sovereignty. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a political risk, which would require a political solution to allay, such as at a treaty level &#8212; something which isn&#8217;t in Nvidia&#8217;s gift (alone) to give.</p>
<p>National security concerns are a rising operational risk for tech companies involved in the supply of cutting edge infrastructure, such as semiconductor design and next-gen networks &#8212; where a relative paucity of competitors not only limits market choice but amps up the political calculations.</p>
<p>Proposed mergers are one key flash point as market consolidation takes on an acute politico-economic dimension.</p>
<p>However tech companies&#8217; operations are being more widely squeezed in the name of national security &#8212; such as, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/trump-huawei-zte-ban-tech/">in recent years</a>, the U.S. government&#8217;s attacks on China-based 5G infrastructure suppliers like Huawei, with former president Trump seeking to have the company barred from supplying next-gen networks not only within the U.S. but to national networks of Western allies.</p>
<p>Nor has (geo)political pressure been applied purely over key infrastructure companies in recent years; with Trump claiming a national security justification to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/trump-says-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-wont-be-extended/">try and shake down the Chinese-owned social networking company, TikTok</a> &#8212; in another example that speaks to how tech tools are being coopted into wider geopolitical power-plays, fuelled by countries&#8217; economic and political self-interest.</p>

<p>Hi there, new and returning readers. This is The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting ready to ship this newsletter, I spotted that there was a fatal crash involving a Tesla, in which no one was in the driver&#8217;s seat. There was an individual in the passenger seat and one in the rear. Both men died. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Follow </span><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1n1174f r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2Deven">@KPRC2Deven</a>, the Houston reporter who <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">broke this story over the weekend, to keep up with the latest. Once again, Tesla vehicles are not self driving. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Welp. I was only partially right about the e-scooter pilot in New York City. On Wednesday, <strong>Lime</strong> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">as I predicted</a>), <strong>Bird</strong> and <strong>Veo</strong> were officially chosen to kick off the city&#8217;s first foray into the world of shared electric scooters. Equity, accessibility and proven capabilities of keeping those pesky vehicles off of sidewalks were top priorities for the NYC Department of Transportation. Each company will be releasing 1,000 e-scooters into parts of the east Bronx, with more to come in the second phase expanding further into the borough.</p>
<p>The process of gaining this small sliver of the Big Apple has been very competitive. City concessions are a hot commodity, and winning New York is perceived to be, in technical terms, a big deal. The operators that hit the mean streets of New York have the potential to survive as the rideshare industry continues to consolidate under two-wheeled micromobility giants. But there is something a little bit anticlimactic about the news. Not to knock the Bronx, but dockless e-scooters are needed and could be of use citywide. One has to wonder how much influence Lyft-owned Citi Bike has over where e-scooter companies get to operate.</p>
<p>The 2018 legislation that allowed for the e-scooter pilot in the first place very clearly stipulates that pilot zones would be prioritized based, in large part, on areas of the city that don&#8217;t have access to docked bike shares, which basically means areas that don&#8217;t have access to Citi Bike. And the pilot zone in the Bronx doesn&#8217;t extend into areas in the South Bronx where Citi Bike plans to expand. I guess we&#8217;ll see how it goes after the first year.</p>
<h2>Let&#8217;s talk about Europe</h2>
<p>Electric bikes and scooters are barely legal in Ireland, but <strong>Tier</strong> is already <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/dcu-rolls-out-e-scooter-scheme-on-its-campuses-1.4537439">preparing for more regulation</a>. The Berlin-based e-scooter company has partnered with the Irish micromobility tech platform Luna, the Insight SFO Centre for Data Analytics, and Smart DCU to create a new AI-powered e-scooter trial that&#8217;ll launch on Dublin City University campuses as soon as the ink on the bill legalizing e-scooters dries.</p>
<p>The fleet of 30 computer vision-enabled scooters will allow Insight researchers to analyze a new, ever-growing dataset. Luna&#8217;s tech will allow the scooters to roll out with pedestrian and lane identification, making them as safe as the Irish government could possibly hope for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in France, the government is moving closer to being the first country in the world to offer people the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trading-clunkers-electric-bikes-france-moves-offer-financial-incentive-2021-04-11/">chance to trade in clunkers</a> for an electric or folding bicycle. Owners that scrap their yucky old ICE cars can get a €2,500 rebate to buy a bike with the money. The National Assembly just approved the measure in a preliminary vote.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Ok, I know we had Grab as deal of the week in the last edition of The Station, but now we have a finalized deal and it&#8217;s a lot bigger than expected.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing, delivery and super app&#8221; company Grab finally and officially <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/press/others/grab-go-public-in-partnership-with-altimeter/">announced</a> plans to go public. Grab, which operates in Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, merged with special purpose acquisition company Altimeter Growth Corp. The merger would value Grab at $39.6 billion and the company would keep $4.5 billion in cash. Importantly, Altimeter agreed to a three-year lockup period for its sponsor shares.</p>
<p>Grab has aspirations for the capital that the public markets provide. The company thinks there’s still a lot of room to grow when it comes to food delivery and on-demand mobility in Southeast Asia. It expects to see the total addressable market jump from $52 billion to $180 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>As part of the announcement, Grab shared some metrics and some big numbers. In 2020, the company managed to generate around $12.5 billion in gross merchandise value, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Romain Dillet reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230; </strong></p>
<p><strong>Battery Resourcers</strong>, a startup that has a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; process to turn recycled battery material into nickel-manganese-cobalt cathodes to sell back to battery manufacturers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/battery-resourcers-raises-20m-to-commercialize-its-recycling-plus-manufacturing-operations/">raised</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in a $20 million Series B equity round led by Orbia Ventures, with injections from At One Ventures, TDK Ventures, TRUMPF Venture, Doral Energy-Tech Ventures and InMotion Ventures. Battery Resourcers CEO Mike O&#8217;Kronley declined to disclose the company&#8217;s new valuation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong>, the autonomous vehicle company aiming to deploy robotaxis in San Francisco and Dubai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/walmart-helps-push-cruises-latest-investment-round-to-2-75b/">added Walmart as an investor</a> in an extended fundraising round that has grown to $2.75 billion. The company said it has a post-money valuation of more than $30 billion. Walmart and several unnamed institutional investors added capital to a $2 billion equity round announced back in January that was led by Microsoft.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-0"><strong>Clearcover</strong>, the digital car insurance startup, raised $200 million as part of a late-stage financing round led by Eldridge, the investment firm helmed by Los Angeles Dodgers owner Todd Boehly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-insurance-startup-clearcover-raises-200-mln-eldridge-others-1-bln-2021-04-13/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dat Bike</strong>, a Vietnamese startup with ambitions to become the top electric motorbike company in Southeast Asia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/vietnamese-electric-motorbike-startup-dat-bike-raises-2-6m-led-by-jungle-ventures/">raised $2.6 million in pre-Series A funding</a> led by Jungle Ventures. Dat Bike&#8217;s selling point is its ability to compete with gas motorbikes in terms of pricing and performance. Its new funding is the first time Jungle Ventures has invested in the mobility sector, and included participation from Wavemaker Partners, Hustle Fund and iSeed Ventures.</p>
<p><strong>Oxbotica</strong>, a U.K. startup that develops autonomous driving systems took on online grocer Ocado as a new investor. Ocado, which took a $13.8 million stake in the AV startup, is treating this as a strategic investment to develop AI-powered, self-driving systems that will work across its operations, from vehicles within and around its packing warehouses through to the last-mile vehicles that deliver grocery orders to people&#8217;s homes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/oxbotica-raises-13-8m-from-ocado-to-build-autonomous-vehicle-tech-for-the-online-grocers-logistics-network/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong>, Volvo Car Group&#8217;s standalone electric performance brand, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/polestar-raises-500m-from-outside-investors-as-ev-market-grows/">raised $550 million</a> in its first external round led by Chongqing Chengxing Equity Investment Fund Partnership, Zibo Financial Holding and Zibo Hightech Industrial Investment. SK Inc., the South Korean global conglomerate, and a range of other investors also participated.</p>
<p><strong>TuSimple</strong> debuted on the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001823593/000119312521108212/d909743ds1a.htm">public market this week</a>. The company raised a bit more than $1 billion in its IPO, selling shares at $40. I interviewed the CEO Cheng Lu, so keep an eye out for that article in the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>Xwing</strong> scored another win two months after it completed its first gate-to-gate autonomous demonstration flight of a commercial cargo aircraft. The company announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/autonomous-aviation-startup-xwing-hits-400m-valuation-after-latest-funding-round/">raised $40 million</a> at a post-money valuation of $400 million.</p>

<p><strong>Scale AI</strong>, the data labeling startup that essentially<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> sells the picks and shovels needed to develop and apply artificial intelligence, closed a $155 million round  back in December. Just after that round closed, more investors came calling co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang told me in a recent interview. </span></p>
<p>The upshot? A $325 million Series E funding round co-led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global at a valuation of more than $7 billion — double what it was four months ago. Additional new investors Wellington Management and Durable Capital joined existing investors Coatue, Index, Founders Fund and YC. Jeff Wilke, former CEO of Amazon&#8217;s Worldwide Consumer business, will be joining as advisor to Wang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors, I think are really ready to go all in on AI and you&#8217;re seeing that just across the board in terms of investments,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;A lot of that is because, I think AI as an industry is really going from something that&#8217;s been more research based and theoretical to one that&#8217;s really rooted in impact and real business results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wang said the company, which got its start serving the autonomous vehicle industry, is seeing an increase in demand for its product from a broad swath of industries, including the government. Its customers now include fintech companies like Brex, PayPal and Square, e-commerce businesses Etsy, Instacart and Pinterest, transportation and logistics companies Flexport, GM, Luminar, Oshkosh as well government agencies such as the Department of Defense and U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>Wang said they&#8217;ve also noticed this &#8220;incredible pickup&#8221; from its customers to view Scale AI as a full stack infrastructure provider and a full stack AI partner, rather than just a data lake provider. &#8220;That&#8217;s been another big evolution that is that a lot of our investors are really excited about.</p>
<p>And finally, I asked Wang if we should expect an IPO or another fundraising round soon. He didn&#8217;t quite answer my question. But here&#8217;s what he did say:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our goal is to build a super sustainable business where we don&#8217;t need to keep raising outside capital and so our intent is certainly not to not to have to keep raising money to operate the business, and in fact I think historically we&#8217;ve always operated really efficiently,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;I think the idea is that we as a business, we don&#8217;t really need to keep raising outside capital, beyond this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hey there! TechCrunch reporter <strong>Aria Alamalhodaei</strong> loves some good wonky policy. And so periodically — like today! — she will bring us transportation-related policy updates.</p>
<p>EV manufacturers have been waging legislative battles in multiple states over the ability to sell directly to customers, rather than at established franchise dealerships. It&#8217;s a privilege that&#8217;s been held to this point only by Tesla, and even then only in select states. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/ev-rivals-tesla-rivian-unite-to-target-direct-sales-legislation/">TechCrunch covered the issue a few weeks ago</a>.) But there are signs that the fight may be turning into something larger.</p>
<p>A senior representative from one of the country&#8217;s largest automaker lobbying groups, Alliance for Automaker Innovation &#8212; which has until this point been fighting EV makers&#8217; push to direct sell, in step with dealership groups &#8212; made a major pivot from this stance. Alliance&#8217;s Wayne Weikel told Vermont lawmakers during a hearing of one of the state&#8217;s legislative committees that it is Alliance&#8217;s position in Vermont that the state should consider allowing automakers to sell directly to customers &#8212; all automakers.</p>
<p>This is a major break from the group&#8217;s established position, which is defending dealers&#8217; monopoly on selling cars in every other state where direct sales legislation is being considered. It&#8217;s unclear why the group has broken ranks in Vermont only, or if they&#8217;ll be doing so in any other state.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that things will be changing anytime soon, and certainly not in all fifty states. The direct sales bills in Washington and Georgia were both killed this legislative session, for example. A source close to the issue noted to TechCrunch that Washington&#8217;s Rep. Amy Walen (D), the Vice Chair of the House Consumer Protection and Business Committee (which heard the bill), is herself an auto dealer &#8212; the owner of Hyundai of Kirkland. The same is true of a legislator in Idaho, Rep. Jim Addis, who is part of a committee hearing the direct sales bill in that state.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>— Aria Alamalhodaei</em></p>
<p><strong>Oh and one more thing, from TechCrunch&#8217;s Rebecca Bellan &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Remember the bill that California state Senator Dave Min introduced<span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/california-bill-would-require-all-self-driving-vehicles-to-be-zero-emission-by-2025/">require all AVs in the state</a> to be zero-emission by 2025? Well, the bill has cleared the California Senate Transportation Committee. The language has been reworked a bit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the bill would require all light-duty autonomous vehicles to be zero emission by 2027. The previous language hadn’t stipulated a type of self-driving vehicle, which could have had massive consequences on industries planning on heavy-duty AVs like autonomous trucking. While the bill still has a ways to go before it’s on Governor Newsom’s desk, it’s in line with the state’s goals to reduce emissions.</span></p>
<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Argo AI</strong> will be releasing its Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment — the official jargon in government speak for what can be described as its safety report — on Monday. But here at The Station, you <a href="https://www.argo.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ArgoSafetyReport.pdf">can see it first</a>. I haven&#8217;t done a super close read yet, but check out page 30 for the description on perception and a few pages later, how their self-driving system handles ambiguous situations.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Cruise</strong> announced it struck a deal to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/cruise-strikes-deal-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-dubai/">launch a robotaxi service in Dubai</a> in 2023. This announcement felt like a distraction and has me wondering when Cruise is going to make — and show — technical progress with its autonomous vehicle deployment efforts in San Francisco, the market it has been aiming for all these years. Cruise said the robotaxi service in Dubai will use the Cruise Origin, the all-electric shuttle-like vehicle that has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> subsidiary <strong>Mobileye</strong> struck a deal with Udelv to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ntels-mobileye-teams-with-udelv-to-launch-35000-driverless-delivery-vehicles-by-2028/">supply its self-driving system</a> to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles, dubbed Transporters, on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023. It&#8217;s worth noting that Udelv was once developing its own self-driving system, but has now ditched that in favor of Mobileye&#8217;s SDS.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Nuro</strong>, the autonomous delivery vehicle company, will soon be delivering Domino’s pizza in parts of Houston. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/dominos-nuro-to-begin-autonomous-pizza-deliveries-in-houston/">Please welcome your new pizza overlords</a>.) On certain days and times, customers who prepay online can choose to have the bot R2 drop their pizzas off. They’ll receive a text when the robot is outside and will be given an access code to open the bot’s chamber and release hot cheesy goodness into their hands.</span></p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous vehicle startup that recently raised $310 million, received a permit to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/chinese-autonomous-vehicle-startup-weride-scores-permit-to-test-driverless-cars-in-san-jose/">test driverless vehicles</a> (meaning without a human safety driver behind the wheel) on public roads in San Jose, California. WeRide is the seventh company, following AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro Waymo and Zoox, to receive a driverless testing permit. The permit only allows for two driverless vehicles.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>GM</strong> and LG Chem announced plans to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/gms-second-2-3b-battery-plant-with-lg-chem-to-open-in-late-2023/">second U.S. battery cell factory</a> &#8212; a $2.3 billion facility in Spring Hill, Tennessee that will supply the automaker with the cells needed for the 30 electric vehicle models it plans to launch by mid decade.</p>
<p><strong>QuantumScape</strong>, the solid state battery company, filed a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-119470/">document with the SEC</a> that caught my attention. Celina Mikolajczak has joined its board. Why does that matter? Mikolajczak is the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Vice President of Engineering and Battery Technology at Panasonic Energy of North America and prior to that was senior manager, cell quality and materials engineering at Tesla.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rivian</strong>, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to bring an electric pickup to market later this year, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/ev-automaker-rivian-partners-with-samsung-sdi-in-battery-cell-supply-deal/">partnered with Samsung SDI</a> as its battery cell supplier. The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI &#8220;throughout the vehicle development process.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tesla&#8217;s</strong> lawsuit against Dr. Guangzhi Cao is over. For the unfamiliar, Tesla had accused Cao, a former employee, of stealing source code from its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system and sharing it with XMotors, the U.S. unit of Chinese EV maker Xpeng, where he had taken a new job. A U.S. district court filing dated April 15 said the matter had been settled. Cao no longer works at XMotors.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement from XMotors, which was never made a party to the lawsuit.</p>
<blockquote><p>After over two years of extensive discovery, including against XMotors, Tesla has failed to find any substantive evidence that supports its allegations and innuendos against XMotors. Tesla has failed to show any credible evidence that XMotors ever possessed, let alone used, any Tesla information from Dr. Cao.</p>
<p>Tesla has finally dismissed its claims and stopped its search for evidence that does not exist.</p>
<p>Technology innovation is at core of our foundation and strategy. In our pursuit of popularizing smart EVs, we respect any competition; however, we will not tolerate any bullying behavior or attempt to disrupt competitors. XMotors fully respects intellectual property rights, and bases its own competitive edge on its in-house-developed proprietary R&amp;D and intellectual property.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>TezLab</strong>, a free app that’s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/tesla-owners-can-now-see-how-much-solar-or-coal-is-powering-their-evs/">pushed out a new feature</a> this week that shows the energy mix — breaking down the exact types and percentages of fossil fuels and renewable energy — coming from charging locations, including Superchargers and third-party networks throughout the United States.</p>
<h3>Evtols</h3>
<p><strong>NFT Inc.</strong>, a relatively unknown drive-and-fly vehicle startup, is betting it will succeed where its rivals have failed, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/nft-inc-reimagines-urban-and-rural-living-with-flying-car-aska/">preorders opening for ASKA</a>, its first electric flying car. The SUV-sized ASKA ( which means &#8220;flying bird&#8221; in Japanese) may be better described as a plane that drives, rather than a car that flies. Even when its six rotors are folded closed, the vehicle has the unmistakable look of a flying craft, with a helicopter-esque bubble front window and a distinct tail that would be familiar to anyone who has flown on an airplane. Important note: ASKA isn&#8217;t anticipated to be delivered until 2026.</p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Apex.AI</strong>, a startup founded by Bosch veterans and automated systems engineers Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic, has spent four years rewriting the robot operating system that will give automakers the tools to integrate software within the vehicle and make sure all the applications run reliably. Now, freshly armed with a safety certification that validates its software development kit (SDK) is sophisticated enough to be used in production vehicles, Apex.AI has landed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/toyota-taps-apex-ai-for-its-autonomous-vehicle-operating-system/">Toyota and Japanese tech startup Tier IV as partners</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</strong> executives warned that the global semiconductor shortage, which has produced production slowdowns at Ford and General Motors, may drag on into 2022. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei pointed to the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as &#8220;geopolitical tensions&#8221; as reasons for the prolonged shortage in an investor call. TSMC, one of the world&#8217;s largest chip manufacturers, supplies chips for a wide range of products including smartphones, high-performing computers, and Internet of Things. Automotive sales accounted for 4% of their first-quarter revenue, which may not seem like much &#8212; but that&#8217;s a 31% increase quarter-over-quarter. (Aria Alamaldohaei)</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> will debut its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">new hands-free driving feature</a> (nope this doesn&#8217;t belong in the AV section) on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year. The automaker is aiming to compete with similar systems from Tesla and GM.</p>
<p>That hands-free capability uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver&#8217;s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> lifted the final veil on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">flagship EQS sedan</a> after weeks of teasers, announcements and even a pre-production drive in which TechCrunch participated. (The company also released a 62-page press release alongside the reveal). There is a ton of the tech crammed into this vehicle from the microsleep warning system and 56-inch hyperscreen to the monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. Oh, and 350 sensors used to record distances, speeds and accelerations, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver&#8217;s blink of an eye or the passengers&#8217; speech.</p>
<h3>Ride-hailing</h3>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> appears to have lost another legal battle in Europe. Labor activists challenging Uber over what they allege are &#8216;robo-firings&#8217; of drivers in Europe have trumpeted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/uber-hit-with-default-robo-firing-ruling-after-another-eu-labor-rights-gdpr-challenge/">winning a default judgement</a> in the Netherlands &#8212; where the Court of Amsterdam ordered the ride-hailing giant to reinstate six drivers who the litigants claim were unfairly terminated &#8220;by algorithmic means.&#8221; The court also ordered Uber to pay the fired drivers compensation.</p>
<p>In other Uber-related news &#8230; Uber&#8217;s transit SaaS program is expanding in partnership with three new agencies in Denver, Cecil County, Maryland and Porterville, California. Uber Transit already has deals with Marin Transit in California and Cape May County in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</h2>
<p>The TC Sessions: Mobility 2021 event, which is scheduled for June 9,  will be virtual again — as I mentioned last week. I&#8217;ll provide updates each week as we announce speakers.</p>
<p>This week, I want to point your attention to a panel I put together that will focus on mobility, profitability and equity. Here are the questions we hope to address: can mobility be accessible, equitable and profitable? And how?</p>
<p>We are bringing together three guests who are at the center of cities, equity and shared mobility to help us answer those questions — community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true">Early Bird tickets</a> to the show are now available — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=hoffman&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=hoffman&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book today</a> and save $100 before prices go up.</em></strong></p>
<p>Other guests to TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, includes <strong>Joby Aviation</strong> founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose SPAC merged with Joby, investors <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital</strong>, as well as <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO/CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/do-you-need-a-spac-therapist/">news roundup from last week</a> was probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a few months, so make sure to catch up on that if you haven&#8217;t. That said, here&#8217;s a rundown of what we got into on the show this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">new Clubhouse round</a> has us thinking about what is a good venture-style bet, and what isn&#8217;t. At least you can&#8217;t fault the Clubhouse crew for not having conviction.</li>
<li>UiPath <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521120347/d98556ds1a.htm">raised its IPO range</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/what-we-all-missed-in-uipaths-latest-ipo-filing/">as expected</a>.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s an Apple event this week, which caused us to wonder why more startups aren&#8217;t competing with the giant.</li>
<li>Cryptos have recovered from the flash crash, which had us thinking.</li>
<li>Druva raised $147 million as TechCrunch will report later today, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/18/razorpay-160-million-raise-valuation-hits-3-billion/">Razorpay raised even more capital</a> at a newly refreshed valuation.</li>
<li>Finally, DoNotPay had some news, but it&#8217;s corporate ethos proved even more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The week is here, everyone! It&#8217;s Monday! We can do this!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/transfer-your-facebook-posts-and-notes-with-our-expanded-data-portability-tool/">announced</a> a new feature that will allow users to export their Facebook posts and notes to a number of third-party services. Although the company has long since offered tools that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/facebook-now-allows-you-to-download-your-information/">let you download the information</a> you&#8217;ve posted to Facebook, the tool launching today offers a more practical way of saving that data &#8212; by allowing you to export your notes and posts to popular services like Google Docs, Blogger, or WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Facebook users will find this latest feature under the &#8220;Your Facebook Information&#8221; menu in Settings, where you&#8217;ll then click &#8220;Transfer Your Information.&#8221; A series of prompts will walk you through the process to transfer you data to the one of the available destinations.</p>
<p>To protect the data, Facebook says it will ask users to re-enter their password before the transfer begins, which it also does with other exports. The process will encrypt the data as it moves between Facebook and the other service, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The move to support the export of text-based content is interesting, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-paying-writers-journalists-pages-0b96d3cd-e61b-4435-9f54-99aed136f932.html">it&#8217;s been reported</a> Facebook is developing a competitor to newsletter platform Substack. The social network aims to capitalize on the growing momentum in the newsletter industry, which has recently seen a number of top writers leave larger publications in order to connect with their audience directly, via paid newsletters. Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">also acquired a newsletter business, Revue</a>, to pursue the same goals. While Facebook didn&#8217;t say if it&#8217;s upcoming product would be included in the export procedure announced today, it makes for a good hedge against any sort of anti-competitive claims if and when Facebook rolls out the new service.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s addition is part of Facebook&#8217;s larger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/20/data-transfer-project/">Data Transfer Project</a>, a collaboration between tech giants designed to give users more ways to move their content between services. Last year, for example, Facebook added a feature that gave users a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/facebook-now-allows-users-in-the-u-s-canada-to-export-photos-and-videos-to-google-photos/">export their Facebook photos and videos to Google Photos</a>, as a result of the team-up. Users can now also export photos and videos to Backblaze, Dropbox, and Koofr, as well.</p>
<p>Alongside news of its announcement, Facebook argued for regulation in the area of data portability. It said there should be laws that determine which data should be made portable, and who is responsible for protecting the data once it has been transferred. The company also pointed to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/comments-on-data-portability/">comments it filed with the FTC</a> last year as well as <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/privacy-and-data-portability/">a white paper</a> that explored the privacy questions that surround the development of data portability tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlassian today announced that it has acquired Brisbane, Australia-based <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/">ThinkTilt</a>, the company behind the popular Jira-centric no-code/low-code form builder <a href="https://www.thinktilt.com/proforma/forms-for-jira-service-management">ProForma</a>. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The acquisition is meant to help strengthen <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-management">Jira Service Management</a>, Atlassian&#8217;s version of Jira that focuses on IT service management (ITSM). Launched in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/introducing-jira-service-management">November 2020</a>, Jira Service Management is meant to remove the barriers between development and IT operations and provide them with a unified platform, but it also enables other teams (think HR, legal or finance) to set up their own service operations.</p>
<p>Edwin Wong, Atlassian&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">head of product, IT, tells me that the company already has over 30,000 customers who use Jira Service Management (though to be fair, Jira Service Management is in part a rebrand of Jira Service Desk with additional ITSM functionality, so a lot of these users were previous Jira Service Desk customers).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One thing that I keep hearing from our customers when we speak to them, is that what makes us different is that Jira Service Management really helps them deliver value quickly, without the cost and complexity of some of the other ITSM solutions that they&#8217;ve used in the past. It&#8217;s just easier to set up, get going and maintain,&#8221; Wong said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140145" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140145" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140145" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/atlassian_thinktilt.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while at launch, the company&#8217;s focus was very much on bringing developers and IT together, Wong stressed that today&#8217;s announcement is very much about how IT can help other business teams develop services as well &#8212; and cope with the reality of remote and hybrid work</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Employees now expect digital experiences from the employers and their colleagues as much as they expect them in every aspect of their consumer lives, as these two things blend together,&#8221; Wong noted. &#8220;Fact is, you can&#8217;t really walk up to the HR team anymore when you&#8217;re working remote and say, &#8216;hey, I&#8217;ve got someone coming in.&#8217; You can&#8217;t go tap on their shoulder and say, &#8216;hey, upgrade that campaign for me.&#8217; That&#8217;s not really going to work anymore.&#8221; </span>But ThinkTilt, Wong argues, helps businesses &#8220;create amazing customer and employee experiences, and allows anyone to do that really quickly and easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, ProForma comes with all the tools you would need to create forms (and there are <a href="https://docs.thinktilt.com/proforma/proforma-features.1646821396.html#">a lot of them</a>) and it is already deeply integrated with Jira and Jira Service Management. It also features over 300 templates for often used business flows like candidate approval tracking in an HR system, for example. &#8220;What we&#8217;re really providing for our customers is not just the features and saying, &#8216;hey, figure it out yourselves,&#8217; but really that practice and the [ThinkTilt] team really brings with them an amazing amount of knowledge with that,&#8221; Wong said about ProForma&#8217;s set of templates.</p>
<p>One neat tool more companies should offer: ProForma features a fully functional <a href="https://proformademo.thinktilt.net/">demo mode</a> that lets you try out the product before even signing up for its free trial.</p>
<p>Jira Service Management, of course, can already build all these workflows, too. That is, after all, what the product is all about. But with ProForma, an HR team could capture all the information they need to capture for a given workflow, with Jira Service Management becoming the backend for those operations. Or they can easily create forms based on existing workflows, too, and enhance the user experience that way.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last five years, Atlassian regularly acquired a company or two per year. Currently, though, it feels like this pace is picking up a bit. Indeed, the acquisition of ThinkTilt marks the company&#8217;s fourth acquisition in the last twelve months. In February, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/atlassian-is-acquiring-chartio-to-bring-data-visualization-to-the-platform/">visualization and analytics company Chartio</a>, while in 2020, it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/atlassian-acquires-halp-to-bring-slack-integration-to-the-forefront/">helpdesk tool Halp</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/atlassian-acquires-asset-management-company-mindville/">asset management company Mindville</a>. If anything, I would expect this pace to increase in the next year as Atlassian aims to capitalize on current trends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://zoom.com">Zoom</a> launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/">Zoom Apps and the Marketplace</a> as a place to sell them last year, it was a big signal that the company wanted to be more than just a popular video conferencing application. It wanted to be a platform, which developers could use to build applications on top of Zoom.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $100 million investment fund to encourage the most promising startups using the Zoom toolset to launch a business by giving them funding, while using that as a springboard to encourage other developers to take advantage of the tooling on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re looking for companies with a viable product and early market traction, and a commitment to developing on and investing in the Zoom ecosystem,&#8221; Zoom&#8217;s Colin Born wrote <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-apps-fund/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s corporate development team with heavy involvement from the Zoom executive team will be in charge of selecting and managing the portfolio companies. The company plans to invest between $250,000 and $2.5 million in each startup in the portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big part of this is helping facilitate those early companies and giving them the access to resources and connections within Zoom, so that they can grow and succeed,&#8221; Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WiRZl5OW1y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">Zoom introduces new SDK to help developers tap into video services</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom introduces new SDK to help developers tap into video services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/embed/#?secret=WiRZl5OW1y" data-secret="WiRZl5OW1y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the company wants to invest successfully, a big part of this is using the fund to encourage developers to take advantage of the platform offerings from Zoom. &#8220;We feel we&#8217;ll help [these startups] build these valuable and engaging experiences and by having that and by investing, we&#8217;re helping bring solutions and further expand the ecosystem and our customers should benefit from that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Zoom has a number of developer tools that budding entrepreneurs can use to build applications that take advantage of Zoom functionality. In March <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/">the company introduced an SDK</a> (software development kit) designed to help programmers embed Zoom functionality inside other applications.</p>
<p>The company also provides tools for embedding an application inside of Zoom, such as one designed for a specific purpose like education or healthcare, and it has created a centralized place to learn about all of them at <a href="http://developer.zoom.us">developer.zoom.us</a>.</p>
<p>Zoom is not alone in investing in companies building applications on its platform. Firms like Sequoia, Maven Ventures and Emergence Capital have already started investing in startups building companies on top of Zoom including <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/">Mmhmm</a>, <a href="https://www.dockethq.com/calendar-app/">Docket</a> and <a href="https://www.classedu.com/">ClassEdu</a>.</p>
<p>The fund gives startup founders one more option to get some funding to get their idea off the ground. Ittelson says all of the investments will be seed level investments for starters and they will be providing developer and business resources to help the young startups build and distribute their products.</p>
<p>While he says that the company will be on the lookout for promising startups to bring into the portfolio, interested entrepreneurs can apply directly at <a href="https://zoom.us/fund">zoom.com/fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lawyer and veteran of the startup world (but <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1105859481219616770?lang=en">don&#8217;t call him a VC</a>), Andrew Yang rose to national prominence during his 2020 campaign for president. A hard-fought battle in a crowded field, Yang made a name for himself as an outsider candidate, heavily favoring a technocratic approach to policy that reflected his entrepreneurial background.</p>
<p>His approach earned a sizable following through a self-stylized Yang Gang of supporters. In particular, his “Freedom Dividend” proposal helped reintroduce concepts of universal basic income (UBI) back into mainstream American discourse.</p>
<p>Yang dropped out of the race in February 2020, after failing to crack 3% in the New Hampshire primary. At the time, he told supporters, “we&#8217;re just getting started.” In January of this year, he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York in a bid to succeed fellow 2020 presidential candidate Bill de Blasio. Once again, Yang has entered a crowded field. This time, however, he does so with national name recognition that has helped propel him to the top of polls.</p>
<p>Like the presidential election before it, the New York City mayoral race comes at an unprecedented time. More than a year after becoming the epicenter of the pandemic, the city is still reeling from the impact of COVID-19. It has made for a unique campaign, with candidates relying on social media more than ever &#8212; to sometimes mixed results.</p>
<p>As the United States’ largest city looks to reopen, the next mayor will face unique challenges &#8212; and, perhaps, opportunities. We spoke with Yang over Zoom to discuss his hopes for the city and the role technology might play in getting there.</p>

<p><strong>You are <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewyang/status/1374689935547101186?lang=en">on record</a> as being supportive of the Amazon Union. They were dealt a big blow recently with the vote. In 2021, what do you think is the best course of action for blue-collar and gig workers going forward?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s been keeping up with me knows I am deeply concerned about the impact of technology on blue-collar workers, in particular. If you look at anything from trucking to retail, to even things like butchering and meatpacking, we&#8217;re automating them away, much more quickly.</p>
<p>There are some instances where unions can help, but if you look at the macro-environment, the proportion of American workers who are unionized has gone down by about half. And so, we should do much more for workers who right now don&#8217;t have benefits in terms of portable benefits programs.</p>
<p>I think versions of freelancing and the gig economy are here to stay. And a lot of those workers don&#8217;t have meaningful benefits in terms of healthcare or retirement or other provisions. We essentially are running an industrial-era economy that has transformed, but our institutions haven&#8217;t caught up, and we need to try and get them to catch up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><strong>We&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of union movement in tech. Kickstarter is a good example. Do you think unions should play a role in both blue and white-collar tech jobs?</strong></p>
<p>I was for the union drive in the Amazon warehouse, because I think it would have created really positive pressure on Amazon to treat workers better in many different environments. I&#8217;m for really rethinking a lot of the things we&#8217;re doing right now, where if you look at top-line, Keynes predicted that by now we&#8217;d be so wealthy that we&#8217;d be working only 15 hours a week. And he was right about the top-line growth. We are as wealthy as he predicted, but our work weeks are getting longer, not shorter. And that&#8217;s having adverse consequences for people of every background, white collar, blue collar.</p>
<p>I think we should be exploring bigger modifications, like a four-day work week, which studies have shown that we can get the same amount done in four days in many, many environments. And then our mental health would improve. Our outlooks would improve. So I think we should be thinking bigger. And right now unions have been a path of the middle class for many, many Americans, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be unions alone that can solve some of these problems, particularly in many environments where unions aren&#8217;t terribly prevalent.</p>

<p><strong>You <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/03/29/andrew-yang-new-york-city-mayoral-race/">recently said</a> that letting Amazon and its 26,000 jobs walk away from New York City was not a good thing in reference to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/amazon-drops-plans-for-new-york-hq2/">HQ2</a>. But you, along with other Democratic politicians, have criticized the fact that they don&#8217;t pay federal taxes. If a company like Amazon were to relocate or bring a substantial number of jobs in New York City, how would you hold them accountable?</strong></p>
<p>I guess there&#8217;s a difference between the local impact and the federal impact. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good thing that a trillion-dollar company doesn&#8217;t pay any federal taxes, but if you are a locality and someone comes along and it&#8217;s going to be good for your community, then you say, &#8220;yes.&#8221; I want to make the case that New York City loves business. It loves businesses big and small that are based here. And it wants more companies to know that New York City is the best place to build a world-class company and culture. So, that would be my stance as mayor, if a large tech company wanted to come to New York, and if there&#8217;s a large tech company that&#8217;s reading this right now or a small one or an entrepreneur, come to New York! Early next year, if I&#8217;m mayor, I&#8217;m going to be doing everything I can to help you.</p>

<p><strong>A lot of the pushback that they were getting were around incentives. Is there a way to bring a company like Amazon into New York without offering that?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good when localities end up bidding against each other to try and bring in various companies. One of my proposals when I was running for national office was that we should actually make it impossible to do so by making any benefits that are provided to a company in that manner themselves taxable, at a rate of a 100%.</p>
<p>So, the entire thing becomes a non-starter and companies then would be based where they think it&#8217;s most advantageous to their organization to be based, not by pitting cities against each other as to who&#8217;s going to bend over backwards the most. I think that would be a better system and people were upset about the level of subsidies that were supposed to be directed to Amazon with HQ2, and that was legitimate concern.</p>
<p>And some of the local impacts were also of legitimate concern. But again, big picture, you cannot let an employer that&#8217;s going to create 26,000 high-paying jobs and probably an additional 100,000 or so service jobs walk away. You have to say New York City is the place for you.</p>
<p><strong>Among U.S. politicians, you’re probably the most closely associated with the concept of UBI. Is that something you see being implemented on a city level?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;ve been dozens of cities at this point that have either already rolled out some kind of basic income trial or are exploring doing so. And I&#8217;ve committed to making New York City the home for perhaps the biggest basic income trial outside of our federal government, sending everyone stimulus checks (which by the way I loved). And I think that cash relief and other measures are the future. So of course, I&#8217;m going to make New York City the site for one of the biggest basic income programs and in the country. And I think people are increasingly recognizing that it&#8217;s the best way to give many people a chance to be healthier, mentally healthier, more stable, more enterprising, more creative, more nurturing.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pushback against UBI is around the loss of a social safety net. Do you think that there&#8217;s a way to implement it in New York City without getting rid of some of these existing benefits?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The program we&#8217;re looking to roll out in New York targets the extreme poor, and would have no interaction with existing social safety nets. And I think that, again, cities around the country have made this work. And in no case that I&#8217;m aware of, has it actually interfered with someone&#8217;s ability to aid get from an existing program.</p>
<p><strong>Can and should government effectively regulate against the implementation of robotics and automation when it comes to job loss?</strong></p>
<p>I think economy-wide, that would be a completely ineffective strategy. It&#8217;d be almost impossible to implement. There might be an isolated case where you could do something that would make sense, but even then, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the best way to go. I think the better approach is to try and speed up the evolution of our economy so that it works for more and more people, even as technology is advancing. And I do believe cash relief and universal basic income are the first big step. And we all know the pandemic has accelerated many of these trends. Anyone that reads TechCrunch knows that automation technologies have been elevated in terms of corporate priorities.</p>
<p><strong>You tweeted that you <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1359992211186843649">would invest in making the city a hub for BTC</a> and other cryptocurrencies. You&#8217;ve also been pretty vocal about climate change. Is that a hard square to circle?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the cryptocurrencies that are out there, frankly, have already been mined. And so it&#8217;s not like you necessarily are looking at consuming tons of energy, if you say that the world&#8217;s financial capital in New York City is going to be very friendly to cryptocurrencies. And we&#8217;re talking about a trillion-dollar asset class at this point. If you are the financial capital, you have to make sure that your city is among the leaders in developing applications. I&#8217;ve been in touch with various people from the cryptocurrency community about ways that we can make New York City a proving ground for some of the applications that people have been working on.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond cryptocurrency, what role do you see technology playing in bringing people and businesses back to the city, following the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>I was talking to my friend, Eliot Horowitz, who is one of the co-founders of MongoDB, and he&#8217;s starting a new company around robotics. He says that when he&#8217;s trying to recruit people for his new company and says, &#8220;we&#8217;re headquartered in New York City and you would be based here&#8221; they are excited about it. A lot of people want to live in New York City.</p>
<p>New York City has the potential to be number one in technology, in part because I think the next generation of technologies will very much interact hand in hand with other industries, like the way that Peloton is a tech company, but it&#8217;s also a fitness and a exercise equipment company. You can see that New York City remains the hub for finance, but also for culture and branding and tourism and fashion and art and other industries.</p>
<p>This is going to be an incredible time for New York City to take advantage of its stature and the breadth of diversity of our economy to be competitive for any tech company.</p>
<p><strong>For a lot of companies working from home is becoming the standard. When so many tech companies in particular are opening up to remote work, how do you keep people excited about coming to a place like New York when they could potentially work from anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>I think right now a lot of people are still adapting. If, let&#8217;s say, you&#8217;ve worked remotely for a year (and that can mean a lot of different things), but a lot of people want to be able to go outside and experience the food, the culture, the nightlife, the companionship of a place like New York. And one thing that I know that tech companies prize is the ability to innovate and create. And studies have shown very consistently that workers are more creative and innovative when they&#8217;re together in the same office. That&#8217;s even true for academics producing research, that academics in the same physical proximity produce higher-level research.</p>
<p>And technology is the kind of industry where if you have even a tiny, competitive edge, it can be worth an incredible amount. And so if you imagine that Zoom is essentially like an equalizer, like a place like New York City will be a competitive edge and Eliot Horowitz is already experiencing that. I think that there are a lot of other companies that already know that. I talk to CEOs who are champing at the bit to get people back into the office for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean some form of incentivizing businesses to bring people physically together into offices?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t rule anything out where New York City is concerned, because that is going to be central to our case. New York City is a premium environment, and there are ways that we can help establish that premium by helping people understand just what we can do for companies that are trying to grow and compete.</p>
<p><strong>What are your top cybersecurity priorities for New York?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough because, the fact is a lot of these systems are vulnerable right now. A lot of public agencies haven&#8217;t really properly invested in cybersecurity. So my priority would be to identify, frankly, the elements of New York&#8217;s infrastructure, that if they were hacked, it would be especially crippling and devastating, and invest in countermeasures trying to protect those assets as quickly as possible. Frankly, recognizing that it&#8217;s impossible to be a hundred percent secure in a lot of these arenas, but we can control our risks better than what we&#8217;re doing right now, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>You got <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2021/04/12/yang-tweets-about-street-vendors-and-ignites-fury-on-the-left-1373504">pushback</a> against the food cart comments on Twitter earlier this week. Do you have any regrets about the ways in which you&#8217;ve used social media during the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at my social media, the vast, vast majority of it is promoting being out and about New York City, whether it&#8217;s a restaurant that my wife and I are having dinner at, or attending a Yankee&#8217;s game at Yankee Stadium (though I am a Mets fan). when I walked the streets of New York City, people are really excited to see me most all the time. And then I&#8217;ll often take a picture with them, and I posted one today that I think made that person very happy.</p>
<p>So I think that my use of social media is hopefully giving people a glimpse into where New York is heading, and the fact that frankly, we can activate a news cycle based upon social media is something that I think is very positive, generally. And it&#8217;s something that I hope to use to benefit New York when I&#8217;m mayor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gm.com/">General Motors</a> is joining the list of big automakers picking their horses in the race to develop better batteries for electric vehicles with its lead of a $139 million investment into the lithium-metal battery developer, <a href="https://www.ses.ai/">SES</a>.</p>
<p>Volkswagen <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210331005943/en/%C2%A0QuantumScape-Meets-Volkswagen-Technical-Milestone-Clearing-Way-for-100M-Investment#:~:text=QuantumScape%20Meets%20Volkswagen%20Technical%20Milestone%2C%20Clearing%20Way%20for%20%24100M%20Investment,-March%2031%2C%202021&amp;text=SAN%20JOSE%2C%20Calif.&amp;text=This%20will%20be%20the%20second,a%20total%20%24200%20million%20investment.">has QuantumScape</a>; Ford <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-10/ford-s-battery-bet-says-automotive-testing-will-start-in-2022#:~:text=Ford%20is%20weighing%20whether%20to,Jim%20Farley%20said%20last%20month.&amp;text=The%20company%20estimates%20its%20first,start%20producing%20cells%20in%202024.">has invested in SolidPower</a> (along with Hyundai and BMW); and now with SES&#8217; big backing from General Motors most of the big American and European automakers have placed their bets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beyond R&amp;D development,&#8221; said SES chief executive Hu Qichao in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;The main purposes of this funding is to, one, mprove the key material, this lithium metal electrolyte on the anode side and the cathode side, and, two, to improve the scale of the current cell from the iPhone battery size to the size that can be used in cars.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s a third component to the financing as well, Hu said, which is to increase the company&#8217;s algorithmic capabilities to monitor and manage cell performance. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that we and our OEM partners care about,&#8221; said Hu.</p>
<p>The investment from GM s the culmination of nearly six years of work with the big automaker, said Hu. &#8220;We started working with them in 2015. For the next three years we will go through the standard automation approval processes. Going from &#8216;A&#8217; sample to &#8216;B&#8217; sample all the way through &#8216;D&#8217; sample,&#8221; which is the final testing phase before commercial availability of SES&#8217; batteries in cars.</p>
<p>While Tesla, the current leader in electric vehicle sales in America, is looking to improve the form factors of its batteries to make them more powerful and more efficient, Hu said that the chemistry isn&#8217;t that different. Solid state batteries represent a step change in battery technology that makes batteries more powerful, easier to recycle, and potentially more stable.</p>
<p>As Mark Harris <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">wrote in TechCrunch</a> earlier earlier this year:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are many different kinds of SSB but they all lack a liquid electrolyte for moving electrons (electricity) between the battery’s positive (cathode) and negative (anode) electrodes. The liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries limit the materials the electrodes can be made from, and the shape and size of the battery. Because liquid electrolytes are usually flammable, lithium-ion batteries are also prone to runaway heating and even explosion. SSBs are much less flammable and can use metal electrodes or complex internal designs to store more energy and move it faster — giving higher power and faster charging.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic-induced lockdowns halted many a home decoration project, but the irony was that our homes became even more important. But where to get ideas to decorate? Home decor experts could no longer visit. Now an LA-based startup is addressing this digitization of the interior design market, but kicking off with a typically LA-oriented, high-end clientele.</p>
<p>The LA-based <a href="http://Theexpert.com">The Expert</a> &#8211; a platform for video consultations with interior designers &#8211; has raised a $3 million seed funding round led by Forerunner Ventures, with participation from Sweet Capital, Promus Ventures, Golden Ventures, Jeffrey Katzenberg’s WndrCo, AD 100 designer Brigette Romanek, and movie star Gwyneth Paltrow.</p>
<p>The Expert offers 1:1 video consultations with leading interior designers, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders consist of Jake Arnold, a celebrity interior designer (who has worked with John Legend, Rashida Jones, and Cameron Diaz among, others) and YC-alumni, Leo Seigal, who previously founded and sold Represent.com to CustomInk for $100m in 2015.</p>
<p>After being “inundated” with DMs during lockdown asking for his advice, Arnold says he realized he didn’t have the business model to help non-retainer clients. So he joined Seigal to create The Expert.</p>
<p>The Expert features 85 designers, so far. CLients click on their profiles to see rates and availability and then click to book. Clients can upload any relevant floor plans, images of the home, inspiration ideas etc for the designer to review ahead of time. They then join a zoom link (the platform uses the Zoom API) to meet with an interior designer and can leave a review afterward.</p>
<p>The company claims it has 700 designers on its waitlist and will hit $1m of bookings after its first quarter, after launching in early February this year.</p>
<p>The startup has some competition in the form of Modsy and Havenly, but The Expert says it is going for a more high-end experience, where clients are willing to pay $300-$2,500 for an hour of a designers’ time. The startup takes a 20% cut of the transaction.</p>
<p>Co-founder Leo Seigal said: “We were able to attract a crazy roster of designers partly thanks to co-founder Jake who is so highly regarded in the industry, and partly due to a timeliness of offering which is far above anything that has been tried in the home space.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Gwyneth Paltrow said: “I’ve always felt that access to great design – and those who create it – is too rare of a commodity. It’s a game-changer for someone without the budget for a full-time designer to have this roster of talent on speed dial.”</p>
<p>Nicole Johnson, Partner at Forerunner said: “We’ve been thinking through new models for the interior design sector for years at Forerunner, observing room for improvement for the trade and consumers alike. Interior design is arguably the ultimate, best-suited source of home inspiration and commerce enablement for consumers, but the trade is a famously walled garden. The Expert solves for this, connecting anyone, anywhere with the world’s leading interior designers via video consultation—allowing Experts to broaden their reach and monetization in a predictable, rewarding, and low-friction way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pippa Lamb, Partner at Sweet Capital who led their pre-seed investment round last summer said: “The Expert is democratizing access to top creators in the $150B global interior design industry. By partnering with leading talents like Amber Lewis and Leanne Ford, it&#8217;s solving both upstream discovery and downstream services: bringing Instagram feeds to life. Leo and his team are visionaries and Sweet Capital has been proud to back them since Day 1.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The online grocery market is poised to get a little more crowded in the next several months, with the launch of a startup led by a veteran founder who has taken big hits from Amazon in the past, but now hopes to come back swinging with the help of an army of robots.</p>
<p>Home Delivery Services, a delivery startup founded by Louis Borders that plans to sell groceries and general merchandise online using a massive, automated system to power the fulfillment and logistics, is today announcing funding of $3 million to finalize the finishing touches on an AI-based robotic demonstration center outside of Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The plan is for the center to showcase the technology that HDS Global has been building over the last several years (plans first emerged <a href="http://recode.net/2014/04/18/webvans-founder-is-back-and-hes-building-another-grocery-delivery-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as long ago as 2014</a>), robots and other automation under the name RoboFS, that will power a wide fulfillment system extending from stocking, sorting and picking items that will then be delivered, mostly by humans, to consumers, to take on what Borders describes as a $1 trillion grocery market in the US.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The $1 trillion grocery in the US is not well penetrated,&#8221; he said, comparing the opportunity to the one that Walmart seized 20 years ago in physical stores. &#8220;We want to offer a complete selection of groceries and general merchandise in one order.&#8221; The idea is to build warehouses that cover some 150,000 square feet to do $200 million in revenue over millions of SKUs for one-hour deliveries.</p>
<p>A funding round of $3 million &#8212; which is coming from Bob DiRumauldo, the chairman of Ulta and CEO of Naples Ventures &#8212; might sound a little modest, especially considering the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been collectively raised by online grocery players in the last several months &#8212; all of them racing to scale up their businesses in the wake of huge consumer demand for online shopping alternatives to visiting stores in person in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Borders said in an interview that this small round is primarily to kick off the demo center to show off RoboFS to help bring on new investors and new partners with the proof of concept. It already has a few investor partners, Ingram Micro and Toyota, and the idea will be to add more.</p>
<p>And he confirmed that HDS &#8212; which will unveil a different name when it launches commercially, he added &#8212; is also working on a much bigger round of funding, likely to close in the next 15 months, to fuel that wider commercial launch. It has raised $38 million to date, he said.</p>
<p>Borders&#8217; name will ring a bell to many in the worlds of retail and technology: he was the founder and head of the Borders book superstores and later started Webvan, a very early mover in the world of online grocery ordering and delivery. Both companies crashed hard in their times and became case studies, and more specifically cautionary tales, around how to build businesses in the digital era: beware the specter of Amazon, of innovating too early or too late, of being less agile, too inefficient, and of not correctly identifying where the puck was going and skating to it.</p>
<p>This time around, the idea is that he&#8217;s focusing first and foremost on technology to try to head those problems off in ways that his previous ventures did not. This is one reason why HDS has spent so many years on building the technology: automation, specifically in areas like picking groceries, is one area that has foxed a lot of companies to date &#8212; Amazon continues to work on this, and Ocado, a leader in the space, has yet to launch robotic picking although it says this is coming soon. Borders estimates that bringing in automation can bring down the cost of labor by two-thirds, with people instead focused on delivering and selling at people&#8217;s doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we went out to buy the tech we didn’t see what we wanted,&#8221; Borders said. &#8220;We&#8217;re tryin to be smart about technology but the tech was just not there when we decided to build this 5 years ago. So we started with building that system. This became our opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interesting opportunity is not just to build services that don&#8217;t quite exist yet, but to provide a set of infrastructure that can be a viable alternative and supply chain to Amazon &#8212; a common goal that brings together players from a lot of disparate yet interconnected areas in the grocery value chain. This is one reason why companies like Toyota and Ingram have come on board to work with the startup.</p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s been so many years in the making and has yet to see the proof of concept, there will continue to be a lot of factors that could not come together, but it&#8217;s a play that HDS, Borders and their partners are willing to make.</p>
<p>“Ecommerce has become an essential component in people’s daily lives but what many don’t realize is that it can be exponentially better than what is offered today,” said DiRumauldo in a statement. “I was attracted to working with Louis again and to the company’s big idea approach – an all-new robotic fulfillment system purpose-built for ecommerce – which can deliver a vastly improved experience at lower cost. I am excited to be a part of bringing this vision to life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA has marked a major milestone in its extraterrestrial exploration program, with the first powered flight of an aircraft on Mars. The flight occurred very early this morning, and NASA received telemetry confirming that the &#8216;Ingenuity&#8217; helicopter it sent to Mars with its Perseverance rover. This is a major achievement, in no small part because the atmosphere is so thin on Mars that creating a rotor-powered craft like Ingenuity that can actually use it to produce lift is a huge challenge.</p>
<p>This first flight of Ingenuity was an autonomous remote flight, with crews on Earth controlling it just by sending commands through at the appropriate times to signal when it should begin and end its 40-second trip through the Martian &#8216;air.&#8217; While that might seem like a really short trip, it provides immense value in terms of the data collected by the helicopter during the flight. Ingenuity actually has a much more powerful processor on board than even the Perseverance rover itself, and that&#8217;s because it intends to gather massive amounts of data about what happens during its flight test so that it can transmit that to the rover, which then leapfrogs the information back to Earth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140219" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ingenuity-flight.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140219" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140219" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ingenuity-flight.gif" alt="NASA's Ingenuity helicopter in flight on Mars." width="1000" height="557" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140219" class="wp-caption-text">NASA&#8217;s Ingenuity helicopter in flight on Mars.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As mentioned, this is the first ever flight of a powered vehicle on Mars, so while there&#8217;s been lots of modelling and simulation work predicting how it would go, no one knew for sure what would happen before this live test. Ingenuity has to rotate its rotor at a super-fast 2,500 RPM, for instance, compared to around 400 to 500 RPM for a helicopter on Earth, because of how thin the atmosphere is on Mars, which produced significant technical challenges.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of even flying a helicopter on Mars? There are a few important potential applications, but the first is that it sets up future exploration missions, making it possible for NASA to use aerial vehicles for future science on the red planet. It can explore things like caves and peaks that rovers can&#8217;t reach, for instance. Eventually, NASA is also hoping to see if there&#8217;s potential for use of aerial vehicles in future human exploration of Mars, too — martian explorers would benefit significantly from being able to use aircraft as well as ground vehicles when we eventually get there.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kcYW03dAe5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/nasa-plans-first-flight-of-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-on-april-8/">NASA plans first flight of Mars helicopter Ingenuity on April 8</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NASA plans first flight of Mars helicopter Ingenuity on April 8&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/nasa-plans-first-flight-of-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-on-april-8/embed/#?secret=kcYW03dAe5" data-secret="kcYW03dAe5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, NASA will work on unpacking the data to glean more insights from the flight, and get back more photos and video of the helicopter during its ascent, hover and landing. Following this flight, it&#8217;ll plan additional flight testing attempts based on remaining power and other parameters now that it knows Ingenuity can fly and did as intended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy ‘social audio’ app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> has raised a Series C funding round, reportedly valuing the company at $4 billion. Clubhouse said the new round of financing was led by Andrew Chen of Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from DST Global, Tiger Global and Elad Gil. This round means Clubhouse has tripled the valuation it attained in January when Andreessen Horowitz led its Series B funding round.</p>
<p>The funding comes as Twitter, Spotify, Facebook, Telegram, Discord <em>and</em> LinkedIn are all prepping similar features to Clubhouse’s live audio streaming rooms, which has attracted attention for hosting live chats with the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. Indeed, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/4/18/22390742/facebook-podcasts-clubhouse-audio-launch-spotify-zuckerberg-apple">reported</a> that Facebook will announce a series of &#8216;social audio&#8217; products only today.</p>
<p>But, unusually for such a late stage of funding, the company has not revealed the amount raised. Industry sources say that this is probably because the Series C funding round is ‘multi-stage’ and therefore not officially closed. Alternatively, the company is &#8216;hyping&#8217; itself ahead of a sale, as is often the case with &#8216;hot&#8217; startups. Twitter reportedly broke off talks to acquire the startup at a $4 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And despite appearances that this funding round has been timed to coincide with the launch this week of Facebook’s Clubhouse clone, one well-placed source told me “this funding round has been in the works for the last 1.5 months&#8221; and that some offers have been &#8220;above 2x&#8221; the $4bn valuation. On other words, there are some investors out there who think Clubhouse is worth <em>more</em> than $8bn.</p>
<p>So far Clubhouse is demurring on all this, and declining to comment more directly to the media. The company disclosed the news about the funding during its weekly &#8216;town hall&#8217; chat last Sunday night and in a <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/growing-a-global-community">blog post</a>, the company said the fundraising will support a fresh burst of growth for the app.</p>
<p>“While we’ve quadrupled the size of our team this year, stabilized our infrastructure, launched Payments in beta to help creators monetize, and readied Android for launch, there is so much more to do as we work to bring Clubhouse to more people around the world. It’s no secret that our servers have struggled a bit these past few months, and that our growth has outpaced the early discovery algorithms our small team originally built,” said the post.</p>
<p>Noting that “it’s important to us to be building all of this with people who are invested in the community and who represent a diverse set of backgrounds and voices,” Clubhouse has, however, been struck by a wave of problems in the last few days, when Anti-Semitic audio rooms <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=clubhouse%20antisemitism&#038;src=typeahead_click">seemed to proliferate on the platform</a>. Clubhouse has previously been criticized for its seeming inability to moderate extremism on the app.</p>
<p>The year-old platform, which has reported 10 million weekly active users, has thrived during the pandemic while people were locked down and therefore unable to chat easily in person.</p>
<p>Tech news site The Information <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/clubhouse-closes-new-round-funding-that-would-value-app-4-billion-source-2021-04-18/">first reported</a> details on the Clubhouse funding on Friday.</p>

<p>Didi said on Monday it will be using the XC90 SUVs of Volvo, which has been owned by Chinese auto company Geely since 2010, for its global network of robotaxis in the long term. Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/softbank-pours-500m-into-didi-in-chinas-biggest-autonomous-driving-round/">created a subsidiary</a> dedicated to autonomous driving last year and the unit has since <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-autonomous-driving/company_financials">raised about $800 million</a> from investors including SoftBank Vision Fund and IDG Capital. The subsidiary now has over 500 employees.</p>
<p>Didi started out as a ride-share app in 2012 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">gobbled up Uber China in 2016</a>. It now offers a range of mobility services including taxi hailing, ride-hailing, carpooling, shared bikes and scooters, as well as financial services for drivers. The company is seeking a valuation north of $100 billion in an initial public offering, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-didi-ipo-banks-exclusive-idUSKBN2BW0TG">Reuters reported last month</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Didi&#8217;s autonomous driving arm has been testing robotaxis for the past two years in China and the United States, but Volvo&#8217;s XC90 model will be the first to adopt Didi&#8217;s freshly minted self-driving hardware system called Gemini, which contains sensors like short, mid and long-range lidars, radars, cameras, a thermal imager; a fallback system; and remote assistance through 5G networks.</p>
<p>Didi said that its Gemini platform, coupled with Volvo&#8217;s backup functions including steering, braking and electric power, will eventually allow its robotaxis to remove safety drivers. If any of the primary systems fail during a ride, Volvo&#8217;s backup systems can act to bring the vehicle to a safe stop.</p>
<p>Didi is competing against a clutch of well-funded robotaxi startups in China, such as Pony.ai and WeRide, which are busy testing in major Chinese cities and California while splurging on R&amp;D expenses to reach Level 4 driving. AutoX, another Chinese robotaxi company, announced last week that it will be using Honda&#8217;s Accord and Inspire sedans for its test drives in China. The edge of Didi, some suggest, is the mountains of driving data accumulated from its ride-hailing business spanning Asia, Latin America, Africa and Russia.</p>
<p>Rising electric automakers like Nio and Xpeng have also joined in the race to automate vehicles, making bold claims that they, too, will be able to remove safety drivers soon. Meanwhile, traditional car manufacturers don&#8217;t want to fall behind. BAIC, a state-owned enterprise, for instance, is adding Huawei&#8217;s advanced automation system and smart cockpit to its new electric passenger cars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a year after the pandemic began, remote work shows no signs of going away. While it has its cons, it remains </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">top of mind for potential employees around the world before joining a new company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while most people in Africa still go to physical offices despite the pandemic, a few companies have nevertheless embraced this concept</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a New York-based startup that helps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/andela-a-tech-training-and-development-outsourcer-for-african-coders-raises-40m/">tech companies build remote engineering teams from Africa</a>, was one of the first to publicly announce it was going remote on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is doubling down on this effort by announcing the global expansion of its engineering talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over the past six months, the company has seen a 750% increase in applicants outside Africa. More than 30% of Andela&#8217;s inbound engineer applications also came from outside the continent in March alone. Half this number came from Latin America while Africa saw a 500% increase in applications as well.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Andela, which builds engineering teams tapping African talent, goes fully remote and opens to the wider continent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/embed/#?secret=xWWMJQ9rcy" data-secret="xWWMJQ9rcy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Andela launched in 2014, it built hubs in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to source, vet and train engineers to be part of remote teams for international companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also tested satellite models in Egypt and Ghana as substitutes to physical hubs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company would issue a call </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for applications, select a few (less than 1%), pay them a salary for the first six months and provide them with housing and food</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also helped developers improve their skills via training and mentorship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100,000 engineers have taken part in the company&#8217;s learning network and community, and,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of 2019, Andela had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/what-is-andela-the-africa-tech-talent-accelerator/">more than 1,500 engineers</a> on its payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after noticing that this model wasn&#8217;t sustainable, it began to make changes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it let go of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 420 junior engineers across Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine months later, citing the pandemic, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/">laid off 135 employees</a> while introducing salary cuts for senior staff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite the layoffs, the pandemic provided some form of clarity to how Andela wanted to operate &#8212; which was remote, judging by the success of the satellite models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the very beginning, a developer had to be in Lagos to work with Andela. Then it became living in Nigeria. Then Kenya. Then Uganda, Rwanda,&#8221; CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Before the pandemic, Andela was opening applications in country after country. The pandemic came and changed that as we opened up to the entire continent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shutting down its existing physical campuses and going remote also helped the company focus on getting engineers with more experience to meet its clients&#8217; requirements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experiment, which the company conducted in less than a year, is also part of its mission to be a global company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That went so well and we thought &#8216;what if we accelerated it now that we&#8217;re remote and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable applicants from anywhere</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8217; because it was always the plan to become a global company. That was clear, but the timing was the question. We did that and it&#8217;s been an amazing experiment,&#8221; Johnson added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now with its global expansion, its clients can tap into regional expertise to support international growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a statement released by the firm, it currently has engineers from 37 countries across Africa, Asia, Latin America, North America and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson didn&#8217;t go into details about how many of these engineers are getting jobs from Andela or even its total developer count</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s more interested in helping its clients solve the diversity issues that have plagued many Western corporations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela is currently working with eight companies that have hired its engineers in Latin America and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the diversity play, the CEO says that means Andela engineers get to prove themselves on a global playing field in a way the company has &#8220;always wanted to see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela serves more than 200 customers, including GitHub, ViacomCBS, Pluralsight, Seismic, Cloudflare, Coursera and InVision</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. GitHub is one company that seems to be benefitting from Andela&#8217;s new offerings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s VP of Engineering, Dana Lawson, in a statement said, “As a business in the developer tool space, a lot of us are trying to enter those areas of the world (Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa) where the emergent developers are coming so we can better understand their needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a local presence there with amazing talent is super valuable to building a global product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its quest to become a global company, going up against competition is unavoidable for the seven-year-old company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since most of these companies are horizontal marketplaces (providing a wide range of expertise), whereas Andela is vertical, Johson believes there&#8217;s enough market share to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be acquired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are focused on building digital products, and because of that, we&#8217;re able to do more, essentially, for our customers&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s where our focus is &#8212; [building long-term relationships] and around building great digital products,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was founded by Jeremy Johnson, Christina Sass, Nadayar Enegesi, Ian Carnevale, Brice Nkengsa and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji. It has raised more than $180 million (up to Series D) from firms like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Generation Investment Management, Google Ventures and Spark Capital, at a valuation of about $700 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While announcing the layoffs last year, Andela said it was on an annual revenue run rate of $50 million. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen asked how this number has changed over the past year, Johnson said the company is &#8220;growing at a healthier pace as we&#8217;ve ever had</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The future of remote work is global and Johnson believes Andela provides the vital link to talent wherever it is found. The company&#8217;s head of talent operations, Martin Chikilian, echoed similar sentiments regarding the expansion.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen exponential growth and interest from engineers from across Africa who want to work with some of the world&#8217;s most exciting technology-focused companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Growing our network of talent from Africa to include more markets is a unique proposition and we continue to match talent with opportunity beyond geographical boundaries.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The buy now, pay later model, popularized by companies like Klarn and Affirm has been one of the big e-commerce winners in the last year, giving consumers who might be stretched financially another option to pay for things when they buy them online. While that has prompted the UK financial authority to <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-woolard-review-unsecured-credit-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-examine how it regulates the space</a>, an enterprise taking a slightly different approach is announcing some funding as it prepares to expand to the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.payzilch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zilch</a>, a London startup that has built an &#8220;over the top&#8221; buy now, pay later (BNPL) business out of cutting deals directly with consumers &#8212; bypassing the need for integrating anything new into an e-commerce site&#8217;s check-out process, as many of the leading providers have done &#8212; has raised $80 million, an all-equity Series B that values the company at over $500 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Gauss Ventures and M&amp;F Fund, among other unnamed investors. The startup has up to now opted to raise from individuals and smaller firms, CEO and founder Philip Belamant said in an interview, although that may change in future rounds as it looks both to bring in a tier-one debt line, not just to fuel growth in its current market of the UK but to expand to more countries, including the United States.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For now, Zilch has financed usage of its service off its own balance sheet: it has more than 500,000 users, Belamant said, and is seeing sign-ups of around 4,000 a day on its app.</p>
<p>BNPL is a payment scheme that has been around as long as stores themselves, but its emergence online has been more a later arrival. It&#8217;s proven to be a very popular one. A recent report from <a href="https://worldpay.globalpaymentsreport.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldpay</a> estimated that in the UK, which is the world&#8217;s third-biggest e-commerce market in its estimation (£192 billion, or $266 billion, transacted in 2020), BNPL will account for 10% of all sales by 2024, when the overall e-commerce market will be worth £264 billion ($366 billion).</p>
<p>Most schemes today are run by third parties &#8212; Klarna and Affirm being two of the biggest &#8212; who ink deals with e-commerce companies and integrate in the check-out alongside other options for payment. Zilch&#8217;s key differentiation has been that it&#8217;s cut a deal with only one other company &#8212; Mastercard &#8212; and created a payment card with it so that when a person wants to pay using Zilch, they use the Mastercard number in the checkout, which then triggers the option to them to either pay in installments or pay as you would with a normal credit card.</p>
<p>As with other BNPL schemes, Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge fees on its service, and instead makes a cut in the transaction from the retailer (part of the fee retailers pay to card companies in card transactions: the deals are all predicated on the idea that these alternatives to paying everything up front increases conversions, and that &#8216;convenience&#8217; is what retailers are paying to have as an option). Its approach is pretty straightforward: it offers installments for paying back that start with 25% up front (so not exactly &#8220;zilch&#8221;) and paying for the item in full in 25% installments over 6 weeks. For those who miss a payment, they are stopped from using the service again until this gets cleared but Zilch doesn&#8217;t charge late fees.</p>
<p>The prospect of bypassing the retailer means that Zilch has been able to scale by making its service more applicable to more payment scenarios, a model that Belamant said was inspired by another killer disaggregator.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;If you look at when Amazon started, many commented on it being a phenomenal bookstore, but they built an infrastructure to sell everything. They could have built that covering different booksellers one by one but Amazon went direct to the consumer and said it would ship any book in a day. How profitable is not your problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We didn’t want to be beholden to the retailer and wanted the relationship with consumer. We go to them and say, pay over time, and use us anywhere you like. We built this technology plugging them in on one side and plugging retailers on the other. We can now build up any way to play and can use it anywhere they like without being restricted by retailers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p5">Conversely, this has also helped Zilch fend off competition from bigger BNPL players, at least up to now: &#8220;Their main customers are retailers, and they have pre-existing arrangements with those retailers,&#8221; Belamant said of the Affirms and Klarnas of the world. Offering a model similar to Zilch&#8217;s, he said, &#8220;would have to circumvent those services, and that’s a massive cannibalization. Can they do that? Well, it&#8217;s naive to say they can’t. But will they? I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zilch&#8217;s approach of riding the rails of Mastercard &#8212; which may well soon to be augmented by other providers like Visa &#8212; means that it can quickly distribute a recognized payment method, but as Belamant describes it, it&#8217;s Zilch that is still building the algorithms to make the credit evaluations for individual consumers.</p>
<p>Using what Belamant described to me as &#8220;soft credit checks&#8221; alongside <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/customers/what-is-open-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking</a> data &#8212; a system used in the UK and Europe that taps into using APIs to share and integrate data from one financial service with another (in this case a way to easily check a person&#8217;s credit and financial history by way of their bank details as they are applying for a new financial service) &#8212; people sign up and automatically get assessed for their suitability for a BNPL scheme.</p>
<p>This has helped the company, as it says, become the first BNPL provider to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the financial services regulator in the UK that has run an investigation of BNPL companies and appears to be preparing tighter regulation around how they can work, to stave off people inadvertently walking into spending money that they don&#8217;t have and may never be able to repay. Zilch was officially authorized as a consumer credit provider in 2020.</p>
<p>This is not to say that others in the space will not be able to also get the same certification for their models, incidentally, but it might mean more regulatory hoops, possibly slower growth, and perhaps also more consumer wariness as the situation continues to get more publicity. (The UK in particular has a pretty sordid history with other schemes to provide people with financing, specifically around the murky practices associated with payday loan schemes, and that has left a bad taste in many consumers&#8217; mouths.)</p>
<p>One specific advantage also of linking up with a card company is that, in this world of &#8220;everything will soon be virtual&#8221;, it gives Zilch users access to a card, which they can in turn use to also shop using BNPL in brick-and-mortar stores. Tap and Pay-over-time, as it&#8217;s called, means users can integrate the card number into a digital wallet to and use it as they would their handsets to pay with Apple or Android-based payment schemes. Zilch said it&#8217;s the first BNPL do make this leap. (To be clear, for now there is no physical &#8216;card&#8217; although it seems they are considering how and if to offer it.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gett.com/intl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gett</a>, the ride-hailing startup that has been carving out a niche for itself in a crowded and competitive market for on-demand transportation by focusing on enterprise accounts and connecting people with rides in some 1,500 cities leveraging a number of third-party fleets, is adding another partner today as it continues to double down on its business model in the wake of corporate travel slowly coming back online.</p>
<p>Gett has inked a deal to integrate <a href="https://gocurb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curb Mobility</a> to integrate yellow taxis into Gett&#8217;s app, which will now cover some 65 cities across the US. The news is coming at a time when Gett is looking to expand its service to meet more demand: it notes that rides currently at around 80% of the levels they were in Q1 2020, just ahead of Covid-19 really descending on the western world.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the deal does not involve any investment between Gett &#8212; which has raised around $865 million to date (including most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gett-raises-115m-more-for-its-on-demand-ride-hailing-platform-for-business-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing a $115 million round</a>) and was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2019 &#8212; and Curb &#8212; which is a part of Verifone, after the payments hardware company <a href="https://paymentweek.com/2015-10-13-verifone-acquires-curb-expands-e-hail-payments-and-media-business-8545/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired it in 2015</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(If you think it sounds odd for a payments hardware company to own a taxi fleet app, this is only part of Curb&#8217;s business and is in fact also a hardware player: in addition to Curb providing a way to hail yellow taxis &#8212; it app covers some 50,000 cabs and 100,000 drivers &#8212; the company also builds hardware for cabs and fleet operations, including metering apps, payment terminals, and those interactive screens for passengers that let them pay for rides, watch news and advertisements and more.)</p>
<p>To differentiate its service from the very highly capitalized Ubers and Lyfts of the world, Gett has been building out a two-pronged strategy that covers both how it scales, and the services that it provides to its users.</p>
<p>On the scaling front, Gett has been moving away from managing fleets of contractor drivers in the US for some years now: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/juno-shuts-down-its-operations-in-nyc-as-owner-gett-signs-strategic-partnership-with-lyft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>, after slogging it out for years against Lyft and Uber in its primary New York metro market, Gett effectively shut down its main fleet operation in the region and instead inked a deal with Lyft. That has become a template of sorts that the company has been repeating in other cities outside of the U.S. where it doesn&#8217;t have substantial market share. (For example, Ola is another Gett partner.) In some cities where it has a larger footprint, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">like London and Tel Aviv, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gett works with drivers directly.</span></p>
<p>Partner fleets made up one-third of Gett&#8217;s business in the first quarter of this year, but as Gett brings on more to its network, it expects partner fleets to cover the majority of its rides by the end of this year, the company said.</p>
<p>On the service front, Gett has made a big bet on building a platform that integrates with businesses at the back end to make it easier to order rides and for them to reconcile more easily with a businesses expense management and accounting software. Gett&#8217;s big pitch to would-be customers is that this software makes it less expensive and significantly more efficient to hail a cab using Gett compared to the alternatives &#8212; for starters users can compare different prices from different providers &#8212; and it gives users significantly more choice.</p>
<p>“Today’s partnership cements Gett’s position as a technology platform focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM), where spend is worth $79.6 billion globally,&#8221; said Dave Waiser, CEO and co-founder of Gett, in a statement. &#8220;In recent years, we have become the GTM category leader, serving over a quarter of Fortune 500 companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the part of Curb, it gives drivers using its software another link through to an app that might bring in more business at a time when riders have more choice than ever before, covering not just other on-demand car apps, but eco-friendly, exercise-ready, and traffic-busting options like e-bikes, scooters and shared rides. As the profile of the average corporate user changes and gets younger, that too will change the expectations many of them will have for what constitutes a preferred set of ground transportation options, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>“As cities across the U.S. prepare for the return of international travel, our partnership with Gett will create new income opportunities for local drivers and ensure Gett&#8217;s business users have access to the same safe, reliable transportation options trusted by locals,&#8221; said Amos Tamam, CEO at Curb. &#8220;By integrating with platforms like Gett, we&#8217;re aiming to make taxis more ubiquitous online by opening up new digital avenues for today’s consumers and businesses to find and book taxis.”</p>
<p><em>Updated to correct that Gett has shifted Moscow out of direct fleet management and currently operates this model in London and Tel Aviv.</em></p>
