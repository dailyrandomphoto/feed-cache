										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As containers proliferate, developers are using them to deliver software, and depending on the environment, on prem or in the cloud, that can present a set of challenges for your users when it comes to installing the container. To help solve that issue, <a href="http://aws.com">AWS</a> announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a> for Containers Anywhere today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The name of the product may not be the most creative, but it does describe precisely what it does. You can offer your container in the marketplace and your users can deploy it anywhere. The idea is to use the AWS Marketplace to provide a way to discover containerized applications, then subscribe to them and deploy them in an easy way to a Kubernetes cluster in any environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this launch, you can deploy third party Kubernetes applications to on-premises environments using Amazon EKS Anywhere or any customer self-managed Kubernetes cluster in on-premises environments or in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), enabling you to use a single catalog to find container images regardless of where they eventually plan to deploy,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Channy Yun wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-marketplace-for-containers-anywhere-to-deploy-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-any-environment/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Yun points out, this gives users all of the advantages of using the marketplace including flexible billing options, the knowledge that your application has been run through a security scan and simplified administration. One of the big advantages is the flexible licensing, which lets you deploy across different environments with changing the license.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you have subscribed to an application using this feature, you can migrate your Kubernetes applications to AWS by deploying the independent software vendor (ISV) provided Helm charts onto their Kubernetes clusters on AWS without changing their licenses,&#8221; Yun wrote.</p>
<p>AWS reports that AWS Marketplace for Containers Anywhere is available now across all regions, so long as it supports the AWS Marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fundbox, a company that offers loans and financial products to small businesses, announced today it has raised $100 million in a Series D round at a valuation of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Or more simply, the company aims to solve SMBs’ working capital needs through its credit and payments offerings. It is particularly focused on B2B-focused small businesses.</p>
<p>“We use artificial intelligence to deliver financial products that small business owners use to better run and grow their businesses,” CEO Prashant Fuloria told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240512" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) led Fundbox’s Series D financing, which brings the company’s total equity raised to $410 million since its 2013 inception. Existing backers Allianz X, Khosla Ventures and The Private Shares Fund joined new investors including Arbor Waypoint Select Fund and a suite of BNY Mellon funds managed by Newton Investment Management North America.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="https://fundbox.com/">Fundbox</a> last raised in 2019 &#8212; a $175 million Series C that valued the company at $700 million post-money. That same year, the company also opened its Dallas office, now its largest in the U.S., “to capitalize on the talent pool there,” according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Fundbox is refreshingly transparent about its financials, at least when it comes to revenue. The startup, which saw a pandemic-related boost in business, crossed $100 million in annual revenue run rate earlier this year. Today, it is “well and truly beyond” that, Fuloria said, although it is not yet profitable as it is focused on growth, he said.</p>
<p>Since the company launched its first product in 2013, it has “connected with” over 325,000 small businesses and transacted over $2.5 billion in working capital, the executive added. In 2021, Fundbox tripled its new customer acquisition rate. But the majority of its revenue comes from existing customers, who Fuloria describes as “incredibly loyal.” He believes one of the company’s biggest differentiators &#8212; besides its use of AI and data &#8212; is that it is focused on SMBs whose customers are other businesses, rather than consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Fundbox works with SMBs that serve consumers like restaurants, such as businesses supplying food or companies supplying cleaning and staffing services to these restaurants.</p>
<p>“These B2B SMBs have the same challenges as everybody else except that they invoice their clients and then they wait to get paid,” Fuloria told TechCrunch. “All of this capital tied up in unpaid receivables is a huge drag on those SMBs. So one of the things that Fundbox does is provide tools to unlock that working capital that&#8217;s tied up in unpaid invoices, which actually adds up to over a trillion dollars in the U.S. alone.” Customers, he added, can receive approval in minutes, with access to capital as soon as the next business day.</p>
<p>Khosla led Fundbox’s Series A in 2014 and founding partner and managing director David Weiden said his firm was initially &#8212; and remains &#8212; impressed with Fundbox’s founders’ ability to recognize there were “dramatic increases in the availability of relevant data in the small business market.”</p>
<p>“Many companies talk about data and using AI; ironically, only a few have any data that demonstrates the actual effectiveness of their approach,” he wrote via email. “Fundbox, including over the exceptional pandemic period, delivered strong results and are on a path to continued growth and scale.”</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s customers range from sole proprietors with a few dozen employees and as little as a few hundred thousand dollars a year or businesses with as much as a few million dollars a year in annual revenue. Fundbox asks its customers to connect with it via some aspect of their transactional system, such as their invoicing app or even their bank account.</p>
<p>“We look at these business transactions sitting in their systems and put together what we call a business graph where you can imagine the nodes of the graph being all these small businesses that are trading with each other, with the customers being their vendors and the connections being their transactions,” Fuloria explained. “And that graph becomes our picture of the small business economy to derive signals or features that can be used to assess the risk of a B2B transaction or a B2B small business.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240520" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240520" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2240520 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?w=158" alt="" width="234" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg 788w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?resize=79,150 79w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?resize=158,300 158w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?resize=768,1456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?resize=359,680 359w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-6.36.06-PM.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240520" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fundbox</p></div></p>
<p>The company then uses those risk assessments to provide tools, such as working capital on tap or the ability to get instant funding against an invoice. It also integrates with other companies&#8217; technology. For example, it&#8217;s partnered with Intuit and is natively integrated inside of QuickBooks. It also shows up in places like FreshBooks&#8217; accounting software or in Synchrony&#8217;s merchant center (Synchrony is an investor in Fundbox).</p>
<p>The small end of the small businesses are often ignored by large banks, Fuloria contends, because the average bank spends over $3,500 (largely in human capital) in assessing a small business’s risk. For loans that aren’t much more than that, it’s not exactly worth it. However, to be clear, Fundbox says it offers up to $150,000 in lines of credit.</p>
<p>“Our focus on using AI to make these decisions really helps us shine because more than 99% of all our decisions are completely automated without any human involvement whatsoever,” Fuloria said. “And that lets us really scale and serve customers very, very efficiently.”</p>
<p>While primarily having served as a lender, Fundbox is now expanding into payments and membership-based offerings (with the intent to generate a subscription revenue stream). The company recently launched Flex Pay, which is designed to provide small business owners with additional payment options and greater flexibility for business expenses.</p>
<p>For example, Fundbox Line of Credit customers now get three extra days to pay those expenses. Repayment options include a bank account, credit card or Line of Credit draw, essentially providing small business owners with another tool to buy now, pay later, according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, next year Fundbox plans to develop a product aimed specifically at entrepreneurs with multiple small businesses as well as new businesses that lack the financial history to access capital through traditional means.<br />
Shrirang Apte, VP of HOOPP, believes Fundbox’s performance this year speaks to the market opportunity “in disrupting the highly underserved world of small business financing, which has traditionally lagged behind consumer financing innovations.”</p>
<p>Fundbox plans to use its new capital to expand its 300-person team, customer acquisition and expanding its product offerings. It recently hired a handful of new execs, including two former Capital One veterans — Khary Scott and Shawn Haigh to serve as VP and head of partnerships and VP of growth marketing, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/introducing-the-aws-energy-competency-partners/">announced</a> a new program that will formally identify AWS Partners who develop specialized solutions aimed at the energy industry. The new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/partners/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-type-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-usecase-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-location-storage=*all">AWS Energy Competency Program</a>, as it&#8217;s called, will identify these specialized partners who have already demonstrated the technical expertise and customer success that can help energy producers around the world build and implement AWS-powered solutions using the latest technology, while also navigating the transition to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
<p>Today, many AWS Partners work with the energy industry to help them take advantage of AWS technology, including for managing the operation of oil and gas assets from the exploration phases, to the gathering, processing, transportation, management, and maintenance of those operations, as well as those in the renewable and sustainable space. These industries are now accelerating the adoption of solutions like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), says Amazon.</p>
<p>The new AWS Energy Competency Program will help the industry better identify the AWS Partners who have the specific expertise when it comes to working with the world&#8217;s energy producers, including those that can help them develop a portfolio that includes sustainable and renewable energy assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At launch, the program includes 32 global partners who also worked with AWS to help develop the new program for energy producers. This group includes those who can help with specialized solution areas, industry verticals, or workloads. This is now one of the toughest designations an AWS Partner can achieve, notes Amazon, as partners have to undergo a rigorous technical validation related to energy industry-specific best practices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240722" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240722" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AWS-Energy-Competency-reInvent-Launch-2.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240722" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>One partner, Slalom, has been helping North American energy company TC Energy manage 44,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines. TC Energy worked with the partner to develop a business intelligence application that uses machine learning to help customers optimize gas scheduling and throughput. Another partner, Unleash Live, an AI video analytics provider, helped industrial engineering solutions provider Worley, which operates wind farms, solar parks, hydropower, natural gas projects, and more. Worsley is using Unleash Live to leverage drones and computer vision for its inspections.</p>
<p>Other partners can help provide solutions that include upstream, midstream, downstream, new energies, core business applications, health, safety, and environmental, and data and analytics, says Amazon. AWS Partners now interested in joining the program can view the Validation Checklists for both <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/consulting/CTpftZxbZ.html">AWS Services Partners</a> and <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html">AWS Software</a><a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html"> Partners</a> to get started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter updated its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">private information safety policy</a> this morning to ban sharing images or videos of private individuals without their consent. The platform already banned users from sharing others&#8217; personal information without permission, like their address or location, identity documents, non-public contact information, financial information or medical data. But this update makes these anti-harassment and anti-doxxing policies more robust.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning today, we will not allow the sharing of private media, such as images or videos of private individuals without their consent.

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that Twitter will require consent from all individuals in a photo or video before its posted. But if a person depicted wants the media taken down, Twitter will take it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it,&#8221; Twitter wrote in its <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">update</a>. &#8220;This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in the case of public figures, Twitter clarified that it may remove content intended for harassment in line with its existing policies against <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/abusive-behavior">abusive behavior</a>, which also ban sharing non-consensual nude images. The company also says that when deciding whether to remove content about public figures, it will assess whether this information is already available in other public media, like TV and newspapers.</p>
<p>And also, in case you didn&#8217;t use the internet yesterday, Jack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">stepped down</a> as CEO of Twitter.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent</a>, the company&#8217;s customer conference taking place in Las Vegas this week, AWS announced a new open source autoscaling tool for Kubernetes clusters called <a href="https://karpenter.sh/">Karpenter</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of cloud computing is the ability to scale automatically to meet your required resource needs &#8212;  or at least that&#8217;s theory. In reality, admins managing Kubernetes clusters have had to monitor them carefully to make sure that they had the right amount of resources or avoid service breakdowns.</p>
<p>Karpenter is designed to bring that cloud computing ideal into reality. AWS&#8217;s Channy Yun <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-karpenter-an-open-source-high-performance-kubernetes-cluster-autoscaler/">writing in a blog post</a> announcing the new tool, described its advantages.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240692" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Karpenter] helps improve your application availability and cluster efficiency by rapidly launching right-sized compute resources in response to changing application load. Karpenter also provides just-in-time compute resources to meet your application’s needs and will soon automatically optimize a cluster’s compute resource footprint to reduce costs and improve performance,&#8221; Yun wrote.</p>
<p>It works by analyzing your Kubernetes workloads to determine what resources you will require by looking at the pods that cannot launch due to a resource limitation. It then sends information to your cloud provider to add or remove compute based on this information.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note here that as an open source tool, this is not specifically designed for AWS cloud resources and can be used to send information to any cloud provider about the underlying Kubernetes cluster. Karpenter takes advantage of <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a>, the Kubernetes package manager to determine your Kubernetes workloads. It also requires permission to provision compute resources in an automated way.</p>
<p>Karpenter is an open source tool being offered under an Apache 2.0 license and is available today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CloudTrucks wants to use technology to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their business: The California-based startup sells business management software that helps owner-operators manage cash flow and costs, generate revenue, handle insurance, and more, and it just raised a $115 million Series B.</p>
<p>The company will use the funds to increase headcount as it expands its business, which operates in the United States. CloudTrucks is hiring in almost all areas, with a focus on engineers and data scientists to help double down on product, as well as customer service professionals to support truckers on the road. The company also wants to broaden its digital integration with brokers and shippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cater to owner-operators and truck drivers who have one or more trucks and are managing their business while also doing the job of moving goods from point A to point B,&#8221; Tobenna Arodiogbu, co-founder and CEO of CloudTrucks, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The job of being a trucking entrepreneur is getting harder and harder. Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who&#8217;s actually doing the really hard work.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239908" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Freight movement is expected to rise from 17.4 billion tons in 2015 to 25.5 billion tons by 2045, an increase that coincides with a decrease in truck drivers. Since the 1980s, the industry has experienced high turnover rates, in large part due to low wages and the poor health effects associated with the job. Without significant changes to the business model and talent pool, the truck driver shortage is estimated to hit 160,000 drivers by 2028, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/future-of-mobility/autonomous-trucks-lead-the-way.html">Deloitte</a>.</p>
<p>The autonomous trucking space promises to one day alleviate these labor issues, but that shift will take place over decades and likely include integration between humans handling first- and last-mile deliveries and self-driving systems managing highway transport, according to Deloitte. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo Via&#8217;s transfer hub model is a perfect example of this</a>.</p>
<p>Despite future projections of a driverless world, Arodiogbu sees a market need now. There are around 350,000 owner-operator truckers in the United States, according to the nonprofit <a href="https://www.ooida.com/foundation/research/owner-operator-and-professional-employee-driver-facts/">Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association</a>, but Arodiogbu reckons the target market is actually as large as a million truck drivers. Owner-operators usually own one truck and either lease onto a carrier or operate under their own authority, but CloudTrucks also targets entrepreneurs who have up to five trucks, as well as truckers who are contractors.</p>
<p>Before founding CloudTrucks, Arodiogbu started Scotty Labs, a startup focused on building remote operations and autonomous driving solutions for the trucking industry, which was later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/doordash-acquires-autonomous-driving-startup-scotty-labs/">acquired by DoorDash</a>. While running the company, Arodiogbu gained insights into the problems truck drivers had with managing their businesses and why the industry has been attracting fewer drivers, resulting in today&#8217;s truck driver shortage. These issues include things like trouble making revenue-generating decisions, the rising costs of insurance and compliance, and how long it takes to get paid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a job of driving, but it&#8217;s everything else that people have to manage,&#8221; said Arodiogbu. &#8220;An increasing number of truck drivers just don&#8217;t want to be company employees anymore, right? They want to take control of their time. They want to determine when they&#8217;re home and when they&#8217;re on the road. They want to determine when they get to spend time with their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>CloudTrucks launched three products over the past year to help solve trucking business challenges. CT Cash helps drivers get paid faster and alleviate cash flow constraints with instant pay and cash card options, as well as cash advances, so drivers don&#8217;t have to worry about not having enough funds for fuel or maintenance.</p>
<p>Flex, which is designed for small trucking businesses that are already managing their own insurance and compliance, helps with back office support. This product came from an existing product line called Virtual Carrier, which essentially puts drivers under CloudTrucks&#8217; authority. Included in this is a package deal where CloudTrucks manages everything for the driver, including compliance and insurance.</p>
<p>Included in both Flex and the Virtual Carrier is a &#8220;schedule optimizer&#8221; feature, which Arodiogbu described as a dispatcher in your pocket. CloudTrucks has the schedule and preferences for every driver in its system, so it&#8217;s able to send suggestions for available loads that can help maximize revenue given preferences and the states they&#8217;re willing to drive to. Drivers can book those loads within the platform, which helps simplify the whole process.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Business Intelligence, a dashboard that gives drivers a breakdown of their performance, personal expenses and revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really improve something that you don&#8217;t track, so with that in mind, we wanted to have a product that was very simple for a trucking entrepreneur to just look at the CloudTrucks app and, at a glance, see exactly how their business is performing,&#8221; said Arodiogbu.</p>
<p>As far as how CloudTrucks&#8217; business is performing, the company said its revenue has increased 9.5x since it raised its $20.5 million Series A in December 2020. The startup also said it&#8217;s seen the number of loads completed on its platform grow 8x since last year, but declined to provide a base for either of those increases. Arodiogbu did say that the company completes thousands of loads around the country per month.</p>
<p>CloudTrucks&#8217; Series B was led by Tiger Global with participation from Menlo Ventures, as well as investment from Flexport and angel investors Michael Ovitz and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, and brought the startup&#8217;s total funding amount to $141.6 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Holoride, the Audi-backed startup that&#8217;s creating an in-vehicle virtual reality entertainment system designed for passengers, has begun publicly selling its <a href="https://www.holoride.com/newsroom/holoride-releases-cryptocurrency">Ride cryptocurrency token</a>.</p>
<p>The launch of the crypto is the latest move by Holoride to build up its extended reality (XR) ecosystem of games and experiences created by a community of developers. Vehicle passengers keen to experience virtual worlds or play games — all of which are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/holorides-in-car-vr-solution-is-the-best-thing-at-ces-2019/">in tune with the movement the car</a> they&#8217;re riding in — will have to use the Ride utility token to make purchases.</p>
<p>Holoride is aiming to offer its XR system in private vehicles next year, although details of which brands and when it might launch are scant. The company had previously said it would launch in summer 2022, but has since pulled back on specific timing for next year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239598" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In the last few years, we have created a proprietary tech stack that connects car manufactures and content creators with passengers,&#8221; Nils Wollny, CEO and co-founder of Holoride, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Enhancing our platform with blockchain technology and launching our own Ride token is the logical next step in order to supercharge our ecosystem and allow for a fair and transparent participation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/holoride-deploys-elrond-blockchain-and-nfts-in-prep-for-2022-market-launch/">Holoride announced it would be integrating Elrond&#8217;s blockchain</a> into its tech stack and using NFTs to incentivize developers to create more content on the platform while also attracting passengers who want to personalize their in-car experience. Both the NFTs and Ride are built on Elrond, and both can be used for transactions in Holoride&#8217;s ecosystem. The NFT is unique and cannot be replicated, whereas the Ride cyrptocurrency is interchangeable, as with any type of currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will enable users and content creators to mint unique NFTs based on their experiences in exchange for RIDE tokens,&#8221; said Wollny. &#8220;The resulting NFTs can then be bought and sold using Ride.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Incorporating blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrency into the Holoride platform isn&#8217;t just a way to get attention with nebulous buzz words. Holoride is taking a bet on its ability to extend reality from the car seat to the metaverse, where the digital and virtual worlds intertwine with physical and augmented reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That bet could pay off. However, Ride can only be used to buy games and entertainment within Holoride and cannot be traded with other currency, which could limit its reach or stunt growth.</p>
<p>A slew of big names have begun announcing metaverse projects, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">Facebook which went so far as to rename its parent company Meta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/niantic-raises-300m-at-a-9b-valuation-to-build-the-real-world-metaverse/">Niantic (the makers of Pokémon Go)</a>, Amazon, Roblox, Unity Software and Microsoft. Meanwhile, as the building blocks of the metaverse begin to reach some semblance of maturity, so does the self-driving ride-hailing industry, with companies like Waymo, Cruise, Motional/Lyft and WeRide on the path to commercialization.</p>
<p>Wollny has told TechCrunch that he wants Holoride to be the &#8220;transportation company for the metaverse.&#8221; Even though Holoride will initially target private vehicles, the end game is to integrate into self-driving vehicles, giving passengers with plenty of down time a way to stay entertained.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.holoride.com/newsroom/terranet-and-holoride-announcement">Holoride announced a partnership with NEVS</a>, a Swedish electric car manufacturer, to integrate its tech into the automaker&#8217;s PONS mobility system, a self-driving shared mobility concept featuring Sango, a purpose-built AV. Holoride&#8217;s tech would continue to be bolstered by software development company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/"> Terranet&#8217;s VoxelFlow technology</a>, which relies on a combination of vehicle sensors to calculate the distance, direction and speed of an object. This informs Holoride&#8217;s platform in real time so that the user experience within the game is matched by the actual movements of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Ride is being sold on <a href="https://maiarlaunchpad.com/">Elrond&#8217;s Maiar Launchpad</a> (Crypto launchpads provide a way to raise capital for new projects, give investors time to get early and discounted access to token sales and help build a community around a project). Holoride will initially circulate 130 million tokens at $0.04 each, and there is a max supply of 1 billion tokens. 200 million tokens have already been sold at $0.02 via a private sale, which has since concluded, and another 50 million had been sold publicly before the launch of the crypto. In total, this would have brought the company $5 million.</p>
<p>The Holoride team mainly plans to use the proceeds of the Ride tokens for content creation, but will also allocate funds towards development, marketing and legal and security audits. As far as Ride token allocation goes, 25% will be filtered throughout the XR ecosystem Holoride is creating, which includes ecosystem supporters, key partnerships and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, developers, content <span style="font-weight: 400;">creators, automotive manufacturers, mobility providers, operational supporters or advisors and ambassadors,&#8221; said Wollny. </span></p>
<p>Another 20% of the total tokens will be allocated to the &#8220;community,&#8221; which Wollny says is reserved for early contributors from the crypto community, including beta users, technical audits and code reviews. Only 5% goes towards &#8220;public sale,&#8221; which means Holoride fans, supporters and believers, and the rest goes to selected financial and strategic investors, equity investors, Holoride&#8217;s treasury and the Holoride team.</p>
<p>Aside from purchasing experiences and other virtual items associated with them, Wollny said token holders will initially be able to use them towards ecosystem governance, as well as community benefits like subscriptions, upgrades and special events. The tokens will also be used to incentivize users into a &#8220;ride to play to earn&#8221; cycle where they can earn extra benefits for taking a sustainable ride in an electric car or sharing specific data, for example. In addition, content creators and car manufacturers may receive Ride as partner royalties, says Wollny.</p>
<p>Holoride is only a year or so away from launch, but it&#8217;ll need some serious scale to get to the point where such an involved ecosystem makes sense. At the very least, it might serve as a microcosm for how the metaverse will rely on the underlying principles of blockchain technology, like transparency, security, interoperability and participation. Wollny is optimistic that Holoride has the potential to be at the heart of the movement for how the metaverse will be built and how its users will manage their identity or create and capture value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that everyone is all over the metaverse, cryptocurrencies and NFTs, the puzzle pieces might fit a little better,&#8221; said Wollny. &#8220;However, many things are still unsolved and the best it yet to come.&#8221;<b><i></i></b><b><i><br />

					<description><![CDATA[In all, Sapphire has brought in $3.7 billion in capital in the last 12 months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sapphireventures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sapphire Ventures</a> will inject $2 billion of newly raised capital into growth-stage enterprise companies from two new funds, Sapphire Ventures Fund VI and Sapphire Ventures Opportunity Fund III.</p>
<p>The new funding represents the venture capital firm’s largest raise to date, Nino Marakovic, CEO of Sapphire, told TechCrunch, giving it more than $8.8 billion in assets under management with team members across Austin, London, New York, Palo Alto and San Francisco.</p>
<p>In all, Sapphire has brought in $3.7 billion in capital in the last 12 months, which includes a separate <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sapphire-ventures-closes-1-7b-across-multiple-funds-and-begins-to-deploy-new-capital-301221841.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.7 billion</a> announced in February that will go into enterprise technology companies, Marakovic said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240424" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“Companies are raising larger rounds and that requires us to write larger checks to lead and be an active participant,” he added. “We pride ourselves on being an active adviser, and that  is our differentiator.”</p>
<p>Marakovic expects both funds to last through the end of 2022. Fund VI will invest in 20 to 30 companies, while the Opportunity Fund targets a smaller number of investments but larger check sizes.</p>
<p>Recently, Sapphire invested in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/verbit-lands-250m-series-e-at-a-2b-valuation-to-double-down-on-its-acquisition-strategy/">Verbit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/pubnub-raises-65m-to-build-and-run-data-streams-for-messaging-presence-and-other-real-time-aspects-of-virtual-spaces/">PubNub</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/yugabyte-stores-up-188m-more-for-its-open-source-distributed-sql-database-model-now-valued-at-1-3b/">Yugabyte</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/medable-2-1b-valuation-tiger-blackstone-gsr-clinical-trials/">Medable</a>.</p>
<p>Sapphire was founded in 1996 and invests at the Series B stage to IPO in the U.S., Europe and Israel. The firm is investing in value-added resources and is expanding in Europe and Israel with plans to open an office in Berlin and Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>It has 40 investment professionals investing in areas including enterprise SaaS, infrastructure software, fintech, healthcare IT and crypto-infrastructure. Notable investments by the firm include DocuSign, LinkedIn, Fitbit, Box, Sumo Logic and 23andMe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far in 2021, Sapphire invested $990 billion in capital, up from $970 million in 2020, and added 26 new companies into its portfolio. Among the firm’s 165 portfolio companies, there were over 70 exits, including 30 IPOs and 45 acquisitions.</p>
<p>With the new funds, the firm also announced it rounded out its leadership team, including Cristina Hohlman as CFO, Ellie Javadi as CMO and Kevin Burke as vice president of strategy;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marakovic called today’s investment environment one where VC firms have to “adapt and do diligence ahead of the fundraise.”</p>
<p>“It used to be that you met with the company first,” he added. “If you are already domain experts, it is easier because you meet with the founders early on, before they raise, and build a relationship with them so you are ready for when they do raise.”</p>
<p>He expects more investments to go into software and business applications, with fintech and health IT also being “great opportunities,” and blockchain across all of those. Marakovic referred to blockchain as “the fundamental new building block we have high hopes for as we invest against web3.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cycode.com/">Cycode</a>, a startup that helps businesses secure their DevOps pipelines and software supply chains, today announced that it has raised a $56 million Series B funding round led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>. <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, which led the company&#8217;s seed round, also participated in this round, which brings the total investment into the company to $81 million, including the $20 million Series A round it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cycode-raises-20m-to-secure-devops-pipelines/">announced</a> about half a year ago.</p>
<p>The company argues that this is one of the largest funding rounds in the application security space. In part, that&#8217;s surely driven by the fact that the company was also able to show its investors some impressive growth numbers, with its ARR increasing 7x in the first three quarters of this year.</p>
<p>Cycode co-founder and CEO Lior Levy noted that the company&#8217;s growth is driven by an increased awareness of supply chain attacks and incidents, including the SolarWinds breach, as well as President Biden&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> on improving the U.S.&#8217;s cybersecurity stance, which specifically calls out supply chain attacks. And while Cycode <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">launched</a> with a focus on securing the source code of a business&#8217; applications, today&#8217;s trend toward &#8220;infrastructure as code&#8221; has allowed it to significantly widen its scope.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Code has become the engine of the organization,&#8221; Levy said. &#8220;As it automates the entire software development lifecycle, it really created a need to look at everything from a holistic perspective, which we do.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240343" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240343" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240343" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png 7064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=2048,1188 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/integrations-screenshot.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240343" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cycode</p></div></p>
<p>Levy noted that Cycode&#8217;s userbase includes Fortune 100 companies and small startups with fewer than 100 employees. &#8220;All of them have one thing in common: they all develop software and they all have software as part of their core, whether it&#8217;s being a software-enabled business or as a vendor. But given that everyone does software today, everyone is a potential customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent months, Cycode launched its Knowledge Graph, which helps it connect all of a company&#8217;s DevOps tools and infrastructure services to build a map of a customer&#8217;s potential attack surfaces. Levy noted that this now allows the company to think like an attacker by being able to identify issues across a company&#8217;s software pipeline instead of only focusing on individual services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2240342" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240342" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2240342" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="594" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png 7064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=1536,891 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=2048,1188 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Graph-screenshot.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2240342" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cycode</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put, software supply chains are highly vulnerable absent thoughtful security measures,&#8221; said Jon Rosenbaum, principal at Insight Partners. &#8220;Cycode’s leadership in securing DevOps pipelines meets developers where they are while giving CISO’s peace of mind. There has been a continually increasing demand for Cycode’s solutions, and we’re excited to continue to support the business as it doubles down on R&amp;D and go-to-market efforts into the ScaleUp phase of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cycode currently has just under 60 employees, with plans for doubling that by the middle of next year, including an expanded sales and marketing team in the U.S.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The ordering system is specifically designed so food distributors can launch mobile apps and websites to accept orders and payments online.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A majority of restaurants and grocery stores still order food from distributors via voicemail and pay with paper checks, without paper trails or the ability to access order history. <a href="https://www.usepepper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pepper</a> wants to change that.</p>
<p>The New York-based company developed an ordering system specifically for food distributors that supports catalogues of over 100,000 items and enables these companies to launch mobile apps and websites so that they can accept orders and payments online. This method, on average, increased revenue for customers by 15%, company CEO Bowie Cheung told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Cheung co-founded Pepper with Chetan Narain and Ivana Tesanovic in 2019. Cheung and Narain met at UberEats, where they saw technology infiltrate restaurants, yet not so much into the day-to-day workflows of the food distributors that worked with them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“People care about food waste and sustainability, but it is difficult to envision any operational change when the industry is so fragmented,” Cheung said. “We watched how rapidly technology went from non-existent to prolific in restaurants. There are 25,000 food distributors in the U.S. and almost no technology built for them. That is a hole we can fill.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pepper, a platform for restaurants and suppliers, pivots to deliver food to consumers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/pepper-a-platform-for-restaurants-and-suppliers-pivots-to-deliver-food-to-consumers/embed/#?secret=Fy5aE8YZhR" data-secret="Fy5aE8YZhR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2020 to address needs during the global pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/pepper-a-platform-for-restaurants-and-suppliers-pivots-to-deliver-food-to-consumers/">the company started Pepper Pantry</a>, a consumer-facing portal for customers to place orders directly with food distributors and have them delivered to their homes.</p>
<p>Now today, Pepper announced $16 million in Series A funding to expand what it started two years ago as it aims to work with over 25,000 restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Index Ventures led the round and was joined by Greylock Partners, Imaginary Ventures, BoxGroup, Moving Capital and Brett Schulman. The latest round brings the total capital raised to date to $20 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pepper is pursuing what we think is the next big opportunity in the restaurant industry: enabling restaurants to purchase $200 billion of annual food inventory digitally instead of via phone and email,” said Damir Becirovic, principal at Index Ventures, and Pepper investor, in a written statement. “Pepper has built a great platform that they provide to food distributors, essentially enabling a Shopify-like e-commerce storefront for them.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.firstresearch.com/industry-research/Food-Wholesalers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. wholesale food distribution industry</a> has a combined annual revenue of about $991 billion. To meet that demand, Cheung plans to inject the new funding into three areas: onboarding more food distributors in the U.S. and Canada, product development and sales and marketing. He also plans to double the size of Pepper’s 24 employees in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Pepper prides itself on being low friction for customers to get up and running, in some cases without upfront costs, something Cheung said was not possible with some of Pepper’s competitors.</p>
<p>The company charges on a monthly basis based on the number of active users and can get customers going in about two months compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars in upfront costs and a six- to 12-month timeline from other companies, he added.</p>
<p>He believes that is why Pepper was able to recruit a network, in one year, that represents 20,000 unique buyers that bring in over $1 billion in sales altogether.</p>
<p>“For some supplies, that is enough friction, which is why they haven’t launched digital operations to date,” he added. “We can get our technology up quickly, so we don’t have to charge those fees. We also don’t charge ongoing consulting fees and are building out a library of features so customers can pick and choose what they need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Developers often build machine learning models with the help of a third-party data set, which they add to their model, and they&#8217;re done. But data isn&#8217;t always static. That means building some sort of pipeline to collect the data at regular intervals, creating extra work.</p>
<p>Today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas</a>, the company announced the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/">AWS Data Exchange for APIs</a>, a new tool that updates changing third-party APIs automatically, removing the need for building the updating mechanism.</p>
<p>AWS&#8217;s Alex Casalboni writing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/data-exchange-for-apis-find-subscribe-use-third-party-apis-consistent-authentication/">in a company blog</a> post pointed out that by using an API, data scientists can get an answer to a specific question with changing information like a stock price quickly, eliminating the need for the pipeline. That&#8217;s great for a single API, but if you&#8217;re using multiple APIs, that creates a new set of problems around communication, authentication and governance related to the APIs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240670" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where AWS Data Exchange for APIs comes in to help solve those issues. &#8220;Today, I’m happy to announce the general availability of AWS Data Exchange for APIs, a new capability that lets you find, subscribe to, and use third-party APIs with a consistent access using AWS SDKs, as well as consistent AWS-native authentication and governance,&#8221; Casalboni wrote in the blog post.</p>
<p>The key part here is that this is AWS-specific like many tools announced this week. If you are building your application or data model on top of AWS, this tool lets you access AWS software development kits (SDKs) and use AWS authentication and governance tooling to access and update third party APIs in this automated way.</p>
<p>Those third-party data providers get something here too. By listing their APIs in the Data Exchange catalog, more developers can see and use their data sources. &#8220;As a data provider, you make your API discoverable by millions of AWS customers by listing it in the AWS Data Exchange catalog using an OpenAPI specification and fronting it with an Amazon API Gateway endpoint,&#8221; Casalboni explained.</p>
<p>Third party providers offering data through the data exchange include Variety Business Intelligence, IMDb and Foursquare, among many others. The tool is available for both developers and API providers starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.threeflow.com/">ThreeFlow</a>, which provides software for insurance brokers selling employee benefits, announced today that it raised $45 million in Series B funding. New investor <a href="https://www.accel.com/">Accel</a> led the round alongside existing investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.emcap.com/">Emergence Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.equal.vc/">Equal Ventures</a>, and <a href="https://ftcapitalpartners.com/">First Trust Capital Partners</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chicago-based company, formerly known as WatchTower, </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-watchtower-becomes-threeflow-raises-8m-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its Series A round in January 2021. The latest round brings its total venture funding to $53 million since its founding in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Series A, the company has grown from roughly 20 to 84 employees and hired four new executives to oversee engineering, sales, marketing, and product, CEO Ryan Sachtjen told TechCrunch in an interview. Sachtjen said the company will use the proceeds from its latest round to double its employee base in 2022 across these functions.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240462" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A big part of our plan progression here for next year is making investments on the engineering side so that carrier integrations are more widely adopted,” Sachtjen said. The company will also announce a broader API strategy to strengthen connectivity with insurance carriers next year, which Sachtjen expects to be a major growth driver.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240481" style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240481" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240481" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="476" height="339" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg 3300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=1536,1097 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=2048,1463 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ThreeFlow-Co-founders-.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240481" class="wp-caption-text"><em>ThreeFlow co-founders Ryan Sachtjen, Richard Perrott, and Shaheeb Roshan. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> ThreeFlow</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s product falls within a new category of software that it calls a “benefits placement solution” for insurance brokerages. Brokerages aggregate plans from insurance carriers and sell them to companies. In the past year, ThreeFlow facilitated over $600 million in transactions &#8212; double that of the year prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brokers using ThreeFlow represent 7,600 employers and 40 insurance carriers across 34 US states today, and the company plans to continue its geographic expansion. The company now has over 100 enterprise contracts, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-watchtower-becomes-threeflow-raises-8m-series-a/">up from 28 in January</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the medical, dental, and vision insurance markets are “very mature,” Sachtjen said, companies are now looking to grow their offerings by adding new plans for employees including fertility, mental health, and financial wellness benefits, presenting new opportunities for ThreeFlow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brokers require a high degree of customization in their sales process because of the complexities of designing plans suitable for a variety of clients, a need that Sachtjen said has historically been filled by outdated, highly-manual systems like Microsoft Office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s solution hinges on three key tenets, per Sachtjen &#8212; it is purpose-built for brokers’ specific needs, supports the entire placement process end-to-end, and serves as a true shared system of record between insurance carriers and brokers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThreeFlow’s deep relationships with brokers and carriers provide it with a trove of data it plans to leverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help pull that information together and provide it back to leadership on both the broker and carrier side, to help them make better decisions fundamentally at a leadership level, and to actually help them engage together more effectively between carriers and brokers, because there is a very dependent relationship structure between the two,” Sachtjen said.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding will support hiring staff and enable new data-as-a-service markets powered by quantum sensing, founder and CEO of Q-CTRL Michael Biercuk said. It also will continue to invest in developing its quantum control for quantum computing and quantum sensing for acceleration, gravity and magnetic fields, Biercuk added. To date, the company has raised more than $43 million (60 million AUD) in total capital. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Q-CTRL’s vision has always been to enable all applications of quantum technology. This new fundraising is critical in realizing our mission to deliver real value to the space, defense, and commercial sectors,” said Biercuk. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240590" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Q-CTRL provides infrastructure software that improves quantum computing performance by addressing the most pressing challenge in the field – hardware error and instability, Biercuk told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p>The Series B financing event comes on the heels of major technical and product development recently announced by Q-CTRL. It includes technical demonstrations using core Q-CTRL technology, known as quantum logic gates, to improve the performance of quantum algorithms executed on real quantum computers by 2680%.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is also developing space-qualified quantum sensors and exploration technologies for Earth, the Moon and Mars with a consortium of Australian firms led by <a href="https://fleetspace.com/">Fleet Space Technologies</a>. Its quantum sensing clients include <a href="https://www.advancednavigation.com/">Advanced Navigation</a>, <a href="https://www.defence.gov.au/">the Australian Department of Defense</a>, Air Force Research Lab, and <a href="https://www.industry.gov.au/policies-and-initiatives/australian-space-agency">the Australian Space Agency</a>. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The team’s impressive quantum control software suite enables speed and agility at a moment of rapid acceleration for the entire quantum industry,” said Lewis Pinault, Partner of Airbus Ventures based in Tokyo. “We’re particularly excited about Q-CTRL’s widening span of advanced applications and solutions, including lunar development, geospatial intelligence and Earth observation, all increasingly critical in the global effort to address the accelerating planetary system crises we now face.”</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its revenue in FY2020/2021 was up 3X year on year, and the company generated over $9 million in sales and booking for its new quantum sensor business, which only commenced in late 2020, Biercuk said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Like most companies, the pandemic caused a substantial pause in growth, which resulted in significant losses in its planned international sales and marketing engagement, Biercuk said. Despite this, the company has grown from about 20 to 60 on its team since January 2020, Biercuk continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He added that the company operates a large team of quantum control specialists with over 30 PhD-level researchers driving its research and product development in quantum computing and quantum sensing.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company recently launched <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/products/black-opal/">Black Opal</a>, an interactive and accessible online learning platform that enables anyone to learn quantum computing. Biercuk said that it surpassed its ten days sales target in 2.5 days. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In 2017, Q-CTRL was spun off from the University of Sydney, where Biercuk works as a Quantum Physics and Quantum Technology professor. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Q-CTRL currently operates offices in Sydney and Los Angeles. It will open an office in Berlin with the first employees starting next month, Biercuk noted. </span></p>
<p>The quantum computing industry is estimated to be worth more than $850 billion in annual value by 2040, according to a report by <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/21july2021-quantum-computing-transform-multiple-industries-create-850-billion-annual-value">Boston Consulting Group</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.abacum.io/">Abacum</a>, a SaaS maker geared toward upgrading mid-sized companies&#8217; financial planning and analysis tools, has fast-followed the $7 million seed it raised earlier this year (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/yc-backed-abacum-nets-7m-to-empower-finance-teams-with-real-time-data-and-collaboration-tools/">April</a>) with a $25M Series A round. The latest funding brings its total raised to date to $32M.</p>
<p>The Series A is led by European VC Atomico, with participation from Creandum, FJ Labs, S16VC, and other existing investors.</p>
<p>It added that a number of &#8220;notable&#8221; unicorn founders and executives are also joining this round as angels &#8212; including Adyen CFO Ingo Uytdehaage; Infarm CFO Carmine Visconti; JobandTalent co-founders Felipe Navío and Juan Urdiales; and Blockfi founder Zac Prince.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240131" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As part of the investment, Atomico principal Terese Hougaard will join its board.</p>
<p>As we reported when we covered Abacum&#8217;s seed raise, a core focus for the software is on bringing a collaborative layer to financial planning and analysis &#8212; making it easier for financial teams to share data internally with the wider business by automating fiddly, repetitive manual tasks (such as copypasting data between spreadsheets or other manual data transformations that can be prone to human error).</p>
<p>Abacum co-founder and CEO Julio Martínez told TechCrunch the 2019-founded startup now has over 50 customers, spread across five continents.</p>
<p>These include a number of familiar scaleups given the mid-tier focus. (It slates the likes of Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/typeform-a-platform-for-conversational-data-collection-raises-35m/">Typeform</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/uber-rival-cabify-has-raised-another-160m-at-a-1-4b-valuation/">Cabify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/ebury-santander/">Ebury</a> among its sign-ups, for example, and while Abacum&#8217;s business is based in New York its co-founders are Spanish, and it has an office in Barcelona, so has evidently been leveraging links to the local ecosystem to drive uptake).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked about its growth rate this year, Martínez said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve multiplied 15x our ARR in the last year, and our ARR per client continues to expand as the value they find in the Abacum platform continues to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, the majority of our customer base is split between North America and Europe. Regarding industries, we&#8217;re focused on fast-scaling tech companies. Fintech and SaaS are the most prominent sub-industries we deal with but there is no shortage of Mobility and Martech companies either,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Per Martínez, Abacum will use the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Series A funding &#8212; primarily &#8212; for product development and growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Our goal in the next months is to continue building more value for our customers in the Abacum platform with more functionality. On the commercial side, we are also growing our offices in the US and LatAm to serve our customers better in those markets,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>Commenting in a supporting statement, Atomico principal Terese Hougaard added: “Modern finance teams are increasingly called upon as the central source of truth in a company, providing all other teams with the input they need to make key strategic decisions. The uncertainties presented by the pandemic have exacerbated this, with finance teams needing to accurately forecast and scenario plan faster than ever before. Abacum provides the platform strategic finance teams need to do exactly this: Aggregate and combine existing sources of business data, forecast, plan and &#8212; crucially &#8212; collaborate with all other teams in a company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fantasy sports exchange founded by Irish betting veteran Paddy Power is bringing NFT-enabled live trading to rugby fans in a bid to expand globally. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://asx.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Sports Exchange</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ASX Sports), just signed a deal with New Zealand digital media company <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/">RugbyPass</a> to use its data to allow fans to participate in ASX&#8217;s virtual stock market for rugby games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX Sports launched in May 2021 and took its exchange live on the Apple and Android app stores earlier this month. The exchange lets users buy and sell virtual shares in esports and fantasy players, reflecting their prices in real time based on player performance and fan demand. The virtual rugby games are set to begin on ASX’s exchange in early 2022 ahead of the </span><a href="https://www.sixnationsrugby.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Nations Rugby Championship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Power told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240138" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RugbyPass reaches an audience of over 10 million viewers, the company says. For ASX Sports, which is explicitly targeting expansion in the United States market, rugby seems like an unexpected pick given </span><a href="https://lastwordonsports.com/rugby/2020/07/14/top-20-rugby-union-countries-registered-players/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its popularity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Europe, Australia, and Asia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the company, which just moved its headquarters to Miami from Dublin, is betting on rugby’s growing traction in the U.S, which has 8.8 million active rugby fans, per sports analytics firm Gemba.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NFTs are such an exciting buzzword, and the U.S. is kind of where it&#8217;s at. It’s the home of next-generation fantasy, which is effectively what we are. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re Miami-based now, and that&#8217;s kind of opening plenty of opportunities for us,” Power said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While users of the ASX exchange will be able to buy and hold shares in specific players, the sports teams themselves and their sponsors will be the owners of the NFTs. The intricacies of partnership deals for virtual team ownership on ASX will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by the teams, Power said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power previously worked in marketing for his father David Power’s company, </span><a href="https://www.paddypower.com/bet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddy Power Betfair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which rebranded as Flutter Entertainment in 2019 and bought a majority stake in FanDuel, </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/flutter-considers-fanduel-spinout-investors-want-draftkings-multiple.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the largest player in US sports betting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ASX wants to position itself to partner with leagues like the NFL and NBA, as more U.S. states, particularly large markets like New York, look to legalize sports betting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX is raising capital rapidly so it can compete for coveted partnerships against incumbents like Disney, Caesars and Fox Sports, as the regulatory landscape opens up. It crowdfunded 2.5 million euros</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ahead of its May launch, using the proceeds to hire a team of about 30 developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to raise a Series A round early next year and is currently in talks with tier one sports franchises and leagues in the U.S., according to Power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASX hosted its first public game last week, a virtual version of the English Premier League’s Liverpool vs. Arsenal match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got thousands of players &#8212; we were delighted with that &#8212; and we had really good engagement as well as people trading during play,” Power said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a significant push against big tech&#8217;s ability to maintain market dominance through sheer buying power, the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">ordered Facebook</a> (now Meta) to reverse its acquisition of animated GIF platform, Giphy &#8212; confirming the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/662c8e3f-4909-4bec-9131-c0237bb4897d">Financial Times</a>&#8216; earlier reporting.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its phase 2 investigation cemented its earlier competition concerns about the impact of Meta owning and operating Giphy &#8212; and it&#8217;s now ordering Meta to sell Giphy.</p>
<p>In a statement, Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group heading the CMA probe, said: &#8220;The tie-up between Facebook and Giphy has already removed a potential challenger in the display advertising market. Without action, it will also allow Facebook to increase its significant market power in social media even further, through controlling competitors’ access to Giphy GIFs.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239998" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;By requiring Facebook to sell Giphy, we are protecting millions of social media users and promoting competition and innovation in digital advertising,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The watchdog&#8217;s intervention follows an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">extended investigation</a> of the acquisition that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Facebook announced (and completed) in May 2020</a>, with the CMA taking an initial look in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/"> summer 2020</a> &#8212; and dialling up its scrutiny over the following months.</p>
<p>It also, in June 2020, ordered a halt to further integration of Giphy by Facebook while the oversight continued.</p>
<p>In another first last month, the regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/facebook-fined-70m-for-flouting-giphy-order-made-by-uk-watchdog/">fined Facebook almost $70 million</a> for deliberately withholding information related to ongoing oversight of the acquisition &#8212; billing the infringement a &#8220;major&#8221; breach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s preliminary report on the Facebook-Giphy acquisition, this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns">August</a>, concluded that Facebook&#8217;s takeover of Giphy raised a number of competition concerns &#8212; including that it would harm competition between social media platforms, given the lack of choice in the supply of animated GIFs.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s concern was not only that Facebook might simply deny rivals access to Giphy content for their users to reshare but that the data-mining giant might change the terms of access &#8212; and could, for example, require rivals like TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat to provide it with more user data in order to access Giphy GIFs.</p>
<p>The CMA appears to have held to its concern on the risk of competitive harm through data extraction from other services, as well as from other more obvious risks &#8212; such as Facebook shutting off rivals&#8217; access to the platform &#8212; hence rejecting all the tech giant&#8217;s proposed alternative &#8216;remedies&#8217; to selling Giphy as insufficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;After consulting with interested businesses and organisations &#8212; and assessing alternative solutions (known as ‘remedies’) put forward by Facebook &#8212; the CMA has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer,&#8221; the CMA writes in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">press release</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the summer the watchdog had also said it was concerned about the impact on digital &#8216;display&#8217; advertising &#8212; as Giphy had, pre-merger, been offering paid advertising services in the US (and considering expanding to other countries including the UK) which it said had the potential to compete with Facebook&#8217;s ad services. However this competition was terminated by Facebook&#8217;s takeover.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CMA found that Giphy’s advertising services had the potential to compete with Facebook’s own display advertising services,&#8221; the regulator writes now. &#8220;They would have also encouraged greater innovation from others in the market, including social media sites and advertisers. Facebook terminated Giphy’s advertising services at the time of the merger, removing an important source of potential competition. The CMA considers this particularly concerning given that Facebook controls nearly half of the £7 billion display advertising market in the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>A summary of the CMA&#8217;s final report can be <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61a4bfa2e90e07044a559d57/Facebook_GIPHY_-_Summary_of_Final_Report.pdf">found here</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s merger assessment hinges on whether &#8212; on a &#8220;balance of probabilities&#8221; standard &#8212; there will be a &#8220;substantial lessening of competition&#8221; (SLC) should the takeover go ahead. And in the case of Facebook-Giphy that is what it has concluded &#8212; finding<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> very limited choice of alternatives to Giphy for (other) social media platforms; and that Facebook </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">has significant market power in display advertising in the UK, among other contributing concerns.  </span></p>
<p>The CMA was particularly interested in Giphy&#8217;s potential to develop its paid advertising model, including a potential UK launch, noting feedback from advertisers had been positive about the GIF-based ad format and also that &#8220;due to its GIF format, the Paid Alignment model of advertising is subtle and intrinsic to the message, rather than interrupting it&#8221; &#8212; something its report notes was &#8220;reflected in Giphy&#8217;s internal documents&#8221; and &#8220;Facebook’s internal documents also discuss the importance of monetising messaging&#8221;.</p>
<p>It also concluded that Facebook would have an incentive to foreclose rivals&#8217; access to Giphy &#8212; which led to another conclusion that the merger &#8220;will result in an SLC in social media as a result of vertical effects, in the form of input foreclosure&#8221;.</p>
<p>The CMA assessed a number of other potential &#8216;remedies&#8217; to addressing the competition concerns vs requiring Giphy to be sold &#8212; considering and rejecting three options suggested by Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s suggestions were: a) open access &#8212; to maintain access to Giphy of existing and new API partners; b) a ‘commingling’ remedy, to remove a restriction contained in Giphy&#8217;s ToS against commingling its search results with results of another GIF provider &#8212; which Facebook suggested would &#8220;enable a potential Paid Alignment provider to increase the attractiveness of its product by allowing it to intersperse Giphy&#8217;s GIFs with its own ads&#8221;; and c) a white label licensing remedy, that would involve the creation and sale of a white label copy of Giphy&#8217;s content library and a licence to use its search algorithm for five years.</p>
<p>The CMA describes Facebook&#8217;s &#8216;remedies&#8217; as &#8220;behavioral&#8221; rather than &#8220;structural&#8221; &#8212; and in rejecting them as unsuitable it&#8217;s notable that it highlights the challenge of ongoing compliance monitoring, as well as the proposals themselves not being sufficient to address all its concerns, writing: &#8220;Structural remedies are normally preferable to behavioural remedies, as they address the adverse effects of the Merger at source. Although behavioural remedies may be suitable in certain cases, this Merger does not have such characteristics.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Notable because the CMA has, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">separate oversight procedure</a> &#8212; related to Google&#8217;s proposal to deprecate support for tracking cookies &#8212; said it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">minded to accept a number of behavioral commitments made by Google</a>, such as limits on the data it can use for ads, around the level of transparency it provides to rivals, and the appointment of a monitoring trustee to audit compliance. But of course that&#8217;s not a merger review; it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">a competition complaint</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, the SLCs that we have found are dynamic in nature and are not time-limited, reducing the likelihood that a behavioural remedy would provide an effective and comprehensive solution,&#8221; the CMA goes on in the summary of its final report on Facebook-Giphy. &#8220;We also found a number of specific risks with Facebook’s proposed remedy options, including their inability to comprehensively address the SLCs, the challenges in specifying Facebook’s obligations, the risks of Facebook being able to circumvent these obligations, and the difficulties in monitoring and enforcing Facebook’s compliance with these obligations. We therefore found that Facebook’s remedy proposals would not be effective in addressing the SLCs we have found.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the CMA has concluded that only a full divesture of Giphy will be effective, there is some complication here &#8212; in that the merger was already completed and Facebook had taken steps to integrate Giphy, including terminating its revenue function and team; the transfer of back office functions to Facebook; and Giphy staff being moved onto Facebook employment contracts.</p>
<p>In order to address these &#8220;particular challenges&#8221;, the CMA says Facebook must reinstate some of the dissolved business functions and assets &#8212; &#8220;to ensure that Giphy has the necessary management, technical and creative personnel to enable it to compete effectively throughout and following the divestiture&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We anticipate that Facebook will need to provide appropriate financial and other incentives to encourage former Giphy employees to transfer back to Giphy, and to recruit appropriate replacements for any key Giphy staff who choose not to do so. We also anticipate that Giphy will need to be divested with sufficient financial resources to allow it to operate and compete as it would have done had it not been acquired by Facebook,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Meta/Facebook was contacted for its response to the CMA&#8217;s order to undo the Giphy acquisition.</p>
<p>The company responded aggressively to the CMA&#8217;s provisional findings this summer &#8212; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">denouncing</a> the analysis and questioning the UK regulator&#8217;s jurisdiction over its business.</p>
<p>In a brief statement now, in response to the CMA&#8217;s final word, a Meta spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. Both consumers and <span class="il">Giphy</span> are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resources. Together, Meta and <span class="il">Giphy</span> would enhance <span class="il">Giphy</span>’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use <span class="il">Giphy</span> every day, providing more choices for everyone.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Killing killer acquisitions?</h2>
<p>Concern over so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; &#8212; aka the ability of tech giants&#8217; to flex their financial muscle to protect market power by buying budding competition to defuse the risk posed by startups and new services (sometimes literally by closing them down post-purchase) &#8212; has been a major topic of concern among industry watchers for years.</p>
<p>The critique centers on how competition regulators have failed to evolve theories of harm to keep pace with digital market dynamics. Failing, for example, to consider how data itself can be used as a tool against competition. Dominant platforms can also easily leverage their market power in one channel to rapidly scale into a new segment, via tactics like self-preferencing. While &#8216;free&#8217; at the point of use services may still entail significant harms for consumers &#8212; such as abuse of their privacy.</p>
<p>In recent years, legislators and regulators have started to respond to such concerns &#8212; including by updating rules, such as in Germany which passed an update to its regime to cover digital platforms at the start of this year. (The country now has a number of open procedures against tech giants (<a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2021/28_01_2021_Facebook_Oculus.html">including Facebook</a>) to confirm its ability to impose preemptive measures.)</p>
<p>In the US, the Biden administration&#8217;s elevation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Lina Khan to chair the FTC, earlier this year, </a>marks key moment of change on US soil &#8212; signalling lawmakers&#8217; support for a reformist approach toward regulating tech.</p>
<p>It follows Khan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">landmark paper</a> (on Amazon) which examined how the government’s outdated ways of identifying monopolies have failed to keep up with modern business realities. What was initially dismissed by some &#8212; as &#8216;hipster antitrust&#8217; &#8212; is now setting the establishment regulatory agenda. Although Khan still faces huge opposition on home soil from the tech lobby working through channels like the US Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Over in the EU, the Europe Commission has also been working to address the lag between tech and antitrust.</p>
<p>Since December it&#8217;s had a draft proposal on the table for a set of ex ante rules to apply to intermediating platform giants (aka, those classified as &#8216;gatekeepers&#8217; under the Digital Markets Act). And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">earlier this month</a> MEPs backed an intervention on killer acquisitions by voting for the Commission to have powers to impose structural or behavioural remedies where gatekeepers have engaged in systematic non-compliance.</p>
<p>Although whether the DMA will go far enough to actually help reboot competition remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The UK, now outside the bloc, has its own update to domestic competition law incoming, also aimed at tackling platform power &#8212; with a new regime of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">&#8220;pro-competition&#8221; bespoke rules for platforms</a> deemed to have &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;.</p>
<p>All this comes too late to undo plenty of baked in tech consolidation, however. But not too late to undo Facebook-Giphy &#8212; as regulators have clearly been sharpening their understanding of digital markets (and harms) for some years now.</p>
<p>Outdated approaches to regulation of digital markets have, nonetheless, allowed thousands of tech acquisitions to be waived through over the past decades &#8212; including Facebook&#8217;s purchase of photo-sharing site Instagram, messaging platform WhatsApp and VR headset maker Oculus, to name three strategic takeovers which span the core social networking arena that Facebook/Meta owns and wants to keep owning for decades to come (in an even more immersive/invasive form; aka &#8220;the metaverse&#8221;).</p>
<p>And only at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/">end of last year</a> the Commission failed to block Google&#8217;s acquisition of health wearable Fitbit &#8212; despite a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-human-rights-remedies-says-amnesty-to-eu/">huge outcry</a> from civil society warning over the rights risks of letting the adtech giant further entrench its dominance by gobbling up such sensitive data. Instead of blocking the acquisition, the EU&#8217;s competition commission accepted a number of behavioral &#8216;remedies&#8217; proposed by Google &#8212; which included a promise not to shut out third party developers from Fitbit&#8217;s API; and a pledge not to use Fitbit health data for ad targeting for a full ten years.</p>
<p>More recently the CMA also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/uk-clears-facebooks-purchase-of-crm-maker-kustomer/">cleared Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of CRM maker Kustomer</a> &#8212; again using a fairly narrow assessment of potential competition risks &#8212; and entirely ignoring privacy advocates who were raising concerns over what the adtech giant would do with Kustomer users&#8217; data.</p>
<p>The CMA&#8217;s decision now to order Facebook to reverse its acquisition of Giphy is a significant development &#8212; albeit, it&#8217;s still just one decision that hasn&#8217;t gone big tech&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Discussing the move in response to questions from TechCrunch, professor <a href="https://twitter.com/TomValletti">Tommaso Valletti</a>, a former chief competition economist within the Commission &#8212; who worked under current EVP Margrethe Vestage &#8212; described the CMA&#8217;s move as a &#8220;highly symbolic decision&#8221;. But he cautioned against reading too much into one &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been repeating the figures “1000 and 0”: mergers done by GAFAM and mergers blocked in past 20 years. So having finally a 1 does not change the overall picture but it’s a signal,&#8221; he told us.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1384">Earlier this year</a> the Commission made it possible for Member States to refer cases for merger review when they may fall between the cracks of national antitrust policy, with the risk of an innovative tech or business being acquired (on the cheap) by a more established rival in order to kill budding competition.</p>
<p>Valletti also pointed out that Vestager has finally signalled an intention to discuss big tech acquisitions with US lawmakers &#8212; which he dubbed &#8220;another good sign&#8221;, saying the EU &#8220;was (and still is) lagging on this&#8221;.</p>
<p>Major reworking of how antitrust gets applied in the US will clearly be essential to rein in what remain (mostly) US tech giants &#8212; however innovative the actions of individual (or even pan-EU) regulators elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for &#8216;new&#8217; theories of harm, I think it’s just that the CMA has good economists that are aware of what economics has being saying and finding in the past 10 years: Data are part of the business model, so they must be part of the competitive assessment too,&#8221; Valletti added in further remarks on the CMA&#8217;s decision to undo Facebook-Giphy. &#8220;It’s not &#8216;just&#8217; a privacy issues dealt by someone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good economics, openness of mind, and a higher risk appetite by their leadership, means the CMA is trying to move the bar in a typically <em>extremely</em> conservative field with shy regulators. Let’s be hopeful!&#8221;</p>
<p>As noted above, the UK is working on a reform of competition law that&#8217;s specifically targeted at platform giants &#8212; with so called &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; &#8212; who will be regulated under an ex ante require of bespoke rules in the future. Although the necessarily legislation to empower the dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a> that&#8217;s been set up to focus on this area is still pending.</p>
<p>Still, the CMA hasn&#8217;t been sitting on its hands in the meanwhile, with a number of open investigations into various aspects of big tech&#8217;s business and ongoing scrutiny of acquisitions.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s regulatory regime has a free hand to go its own way on tech policy &#8212; and big tech M&amp;As &#8212; given the country is not longer a member of the EU. Although UK regulators have said they continue to consult with international counterparts on issues of common concern.</p>
<p>While the bloc is seeking to harmonize digital regulations under incoming legislative updates and extensions such as the DMA and the Digital Services Act, there has been some concern that EU lawmakers&#8217; push to reduce &#8216;fragmentation&#8217; may end up benefiting tech giants &#8212; i.e. if it removes the ability of individual Member States to pass more ambitious legislation.</p>
<p>UK regulators could thus end up addressing shortfalls in the bloc&#8217;s one-size-fits-all plan &#8212; for a list of behavioral &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for platform giants &#8212; by applying a more tightly tailored regime that&#8217;s designed to address specific problematic practices of each tech giant. Having creative thinkers at the CMA therefore looks vital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soveren, a London-based startup that automates the detection of privacy risks to help organizations comply with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/gdpr/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ccpa/">CCPA</a>, has launched out of stealth with $6.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The company analyzes real-time data flows inside an organizations’ infrastructure to discover personal data and detect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a> risks to make it easier for CTOs and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/bridging-the-gap-what-cisos-must-do-to-get-the-c-suite-on-their-side/">CISOs</a> to recognize and address privacy gaps. Soveren says some 10 million companies globally are at risk of violating GDPR and other regulatory obligations because of their failure to detect and resolve privacy incident.</p>
<p>“Security software successfully addresses security threats, but has a limited impact on addressing privacy challenges,” Peter Fedchenkov, founder and co-CEO of <a href="https://soveren.io/">Soveren</a>, tells TechCrunch. “This is because, unlike other confidential data that can be easily isolated, personal data is actually meant to be accessed, used, and shared in day-to-day business operations. We believe that privacy is the new security because it demands the same automated, continuous protection measures.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fedchenkov says the idea for Soveren came from his personal experience in the e-commerce sector. “We saw first hand how manual and complex data protection and privacy compliance is today. It takes more time, more money, and more effort than it really should.”</p>
<p>Sovern has so far secured 10 lighthouse customers across software, e-commerce, travel, fintech, and healthcare in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>The firm is now planning to expand globally after securing a $6.5 million seed investment, which was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/firstminute-capital-launches-second-111-fund-featuring-a-whos-who-of-founders-as-lps/">Firstminute Capital</a> with participation from Northzone, 11 unicorn founders including Airbnb and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mulesoft/">Mulesoft</a>, Sir Richard Branson’s family, and a handful of global CEOs including Nikesh Arora, the chairman CEO of Palo Alto Networks.</p>
<p>Fedchenkov says, to begin with, Soveren will use the funds to expand its product team and to invest in sales and marketing. “We haven’t actually done anything on the marketing side yet, so we definitely want to double-down on that,” he tells TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based VC firm <a href="https://partechpartners.com">Partech</a> has announced the closing of the fundraising of its new growth fund. Partech Growth II is the firm’s second growth fund. And the team managed to raise $750 million.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Partech Growth I was a smaller fund with €400 million under management, which represents $460 million at today’s exchange rate. Partech closed Partech Growth I back in 2015.</p>
<p>When it comes to today’s fund, backing comes from 45 institutional investors, such as endowments, foundations, pension funds, life insurers, asset managers and fund-of-funds. Around 40 family offices, entrepreneurs and business angels also participated directly in the new fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239388" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Partech has already started deploying some of the fund in tech companies. Portfolio companies include <a href="https://www.rohlik.group">Rohlik</a>, a grocery delivery company from Czech Republic (more details in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/rohlik-raises-119m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-to-grow-its-2-hour-grocery-delivery-service-in-europe/">Ingrid Lunden’s article</a>), <a href="https://en.skello.io">Skello</a>, a work scheduling software-as-a-service tool (more details in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/skello-raises-47-3-million-for-its-employee-scheduling-tool/">my separate article</a>), <a href="https://www.studocu.com">Studocu</a>, a note sharing platform for college students (Ingrid also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">covered it here</a>) and recurring payment platform <a href="https://billogram.com">Billogram</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/billogram-provider-of-a-payments-platform-specifically-for-recurring-billing-raises-45m/">more from Ingrid</a>).</p>
<p>“We’re humbled and grateful for the support of, and commitment from, our global investors. It allows us to continue to deliver meaningful and strategic assistance to the outstanding community of European tech entrepreneurs who decide to welcome us on their journey,” Partech Growth General Partner Omri Benayoun said in a statement.</p>
<p>Partech plans to invest across many different verticals, both enterprise and consumer companies, across multiple industries. The firm plans to invest in 12 to 15 companies with an average check ranging from $22.4 million to $78.4 million (€20 million to €70 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.join-jump.com">Jump</a> wants to disrupt the industry of umbrella companies. Those companies provide an alternative to traditional freelancing jobs. They can hire workers on permanent contracts so that they get the stability and the benefits that come with a full-time contract. But workers remain independent — they can work with multiple clients and they negotiate their contracts directly.</p>
<p>What makes Jump different from legacy companies operating in the space is that it’s much cheaper and much more automated than what’s already available. Jump lets you create an account and send your first invoice automatically — you don’t have to talk to anyone at Jump to get started.</p>
<p>Once you sign up, you can start asking your clients to pay Jump instead of paying you directly. At any time, you can see your outstanding invoices and how much money you have on your Jump account.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240151" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Jump customers can then create payslips and receive a salary. And because it’s a regular French permanent contract, you are registered with the national healthcare system and you start saving for your retirement. If things are not going well with your client, you can request a <em>rupture conventionnelle</em> and become eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The company raised a $4.5 million (€4 million) seed round led by Index Ventures. Kima Ventures and 16 angel investors also participated in the round, such has Nicolas Brusson, Hanno Renner, Laurent Ritter and Thibaud Elziere.</p>
<p>Traditional umbrella companies take a cut of your annual turnover. Pricing varies but it can be 5%, 7% or even sometimes 10%. For instance, Jump’s co-founder and CEO Nicolas Fayon used to work for <a href="https://www.itg.fr">ITG</a>, which charges 6% to 8% on your revenue. You can also pay ITG an additional 2% to manage expenses and therefore optimize your pay.</p>
<p>Jump currently charges a flat subscription fee of €79 per month (that’s $89). Customers can then access third-party services, such as professional and personal life insurance with Axa, health insurance with Alan, several freelance marketplaces (Malt, Talent.io and LeGratin) and other miscellaneous services (Simbel, Secret or HelloPrêt).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, Jump has been working with hundreds of freelancers. They have invoiced €3 million to date. Many freelancers could benefit from such a product, such as developers, real estate agents or drivers. And I believe there’s a big market opportunity for umbrella companies as they could be particularly useful for people working remotely for foreign companies that don’t want to open a subsidiary in France.</p>
