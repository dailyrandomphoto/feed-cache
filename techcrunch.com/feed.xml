										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The backbone of Indonesia’s economy are small- to medium-sized businesses, which <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">account for 60% of its gross domestic product</a>. Many still rely on manual bookkeeping, but the impact of COVID-19 has driven small businesses to digitize more of their operations. <a href="https://www.bukukas.co.id/">BukuKas</a>, one of several startups helping SMEs go online, announced today it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bukukas" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bukukas">BukuKas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launched in December 2019 as a digital bookkeeping app, but is growing its range of services with the goal of creating an &#8220;end-to-end software stack&#8221; for small businesses. Eventually, it wants to launch a SME-focused digital bank.</p>
<p>The funding, which brings BukuKas’ total raised so far to $22 million, included participation from returning investors Saison Capital, January Capital, Founderbank Capital, Cambium Grove, Endeavor Catalyst and Amrish Rau.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As of November 2020, BukuKas had a registered user base of 3.5 million small merchants and retailers, and had crossed 1.8 million monthly active users. During that month, the platform also recorded $17.4 billion worth of transactions on an annualized basis, a figure corresponding to more than 1.5% of Indonesia’s $1.04 trillion GDP.</p>
<p>BukuKas was founded by chief executive officer Krishnan Menon and chief operating officer Lorenzo Peracchione, who met eight years ago while working at Lazada Indonesia.</p>
<p>Menon’s previous startup was Fabelio, an Indonesian online home furnishings store. Every two months, he would visit smaller small cities in Indonesia, like Jepara and Cirebon, to source furniture.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that stood out was how different the Jakarta bubble is from the rest of Indonesia, all the way from the penetration of software to financial services,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. While talking to merchants and suppliers, Menon realized that &#8220;no one is building products with them as the center of the universe,&#8221; despite the fact that there are 56 million small businesses.</p>
<p>Peracchione said he and Mebon had been brainstorming startup ideas for a while. &#8220;When he told me about the idea of solving cash flow visibility to SMEs, it immediately struck me,&#8221; Peracchione said. &#8220;My dad used to be a SME owner himself and during my childhood I experience first hand the struggles and ups and downs connected to running a small business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two decided to start with digital bookkeeping after speaking to 1,052 merchants because helping them keep track of their business performance would generate data that would in turn enable access to more financial services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision expanded into providing an end-to-end software stack to digitize SMEs and help them across a wide range of activities as a prequel to building an SME-focused digital bank down the line,&#8221; Menon said.</p>
<p>In addition to digital ledger features, BukuKas also sends payment reminders to buyers through WhatsApp and automatically generates invoices, includes an an inventory management module and analyzes expenses to help businesses understand what is impacting their profit. The company plans to add digital payments this month. During the rest of 2021, it will also introduce more features to help businesses sell online, including tools for online store fronts, a promotions engine and social sharing.</p>
<p>&#8220;With COVID-19, SMEs are rushing to get digitized, but they lack the right mobile-first tools to sell online as well as to manage their business,&#8221; said Menon.</p>
<p>The app focuses on smaller Indonesian cities and towns, since about 73% of the merchants who use BukuKas are located outside of tier 1 cities like Jakarta. Its users represent wide range of sectors, including retailers, food vendors, grocery markets, mobile and phone credit providers, social commerce sellers, wholesalers and service providers. BukuKas acquired digital ledger app Catatan Keuangan Harian, which has 300,000 monthly active users, in September 2020 to expand its market share in Indonesia.</p>
<p>With its large number of SMEs, Indonesia is seen as a desirable market for companies helping the drive toward digitization. For example, India’s Khatabook, which was valued between $275 million to $300 million after its last round of funding in May 2020, recently launched BukuUang in Indonesia. Other startups in the same space include Y Combinator-backed BukuWarung, Moka and Jurnal, all of which offer tools to help SMEs bring more of their operations online.</p>

<p>Menon said BukuKas’ advantage is its team’s experience building businesses in Indonesia over the past seven years. For example, it launched a &#8220;Know Your Profits&#8221; module based on user feedback. It also offers a self-guided onboarding process, a simple user interface and an offline mode for users in areas with poor network connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general, individual features can be copied but we believe our &#8216;integrated end-to-end software stack approach,&#8217; coupled with our obsessive focus on simplicity, deep understanding of our users and a superior level of service will be key in differentiating BukuKas from competing offerings,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>BukuKas’ Series A will be used on user acquisition, its engineering and product teams in Jakarta and Bangalore and to introduce new services for merchants. The company may eventually expand into other Southeast Asia markets, but &#8220;in the short term consolidating and further expanding our leadership in the SME space in Indonesia is our top priority,&#8221; said Menon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In October, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/popsockets-is-working-on-magsafe-compatible-iphone-accessories/">broke the news</a> that PopSockets was developing its own line of MagSafe-compatible products that will support the new wireless charging capabilities of the iPhone 12 devices. Today, at the (virtual) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2021/">2021 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, the company formally introduced its upcoming products for the first time. The new line will include three MagSafe-compatible PopGrips, a wallet with an integrated grip and two mounts.</p>
<p>The first of these is the new PopGrip for MagSafe, which will magnetically attach to MagSafe-compatible cases for iPhone 12 devices.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2094941" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The design of this PopGrip clears up some confusion over how a PopGrip (the round, poppable dongle that people normally think of when they think of &#8220;PopPockets&#8221;) will work with a MagSafe device. Instead of attaching just at the base of the grip itself, the grip is integrated into a larger base that attaches to the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094933" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094933" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094933 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-for-MagSafe2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094933" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>PopSockets</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the grip has a swappable top so you can change the style of your PopGrip whenever you want without having to buy a whole new accessory.</p>
<p>This grip will also be compatible with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/popsockets" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="popsockets">PopSockets <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> PopMount 2 phone mounts, including the new PopMount 2 for MagSafe, introduced today.</p>
<p>The PopMount 2 for MagSafe will launch as two solutions: PopMount for MagSafe Multi-Surface and PopMount for MagSafe Car Vent. As described by their name, both products will magnetically attach to iPhone 12 devices either at home or while on-the-go.</p>
<p>For those who use the new PopGrip for MagSafe grip, they&#8217;ll be able to leave the grip on, then let the mount&#8217;s magnets attach to the base.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094935" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094935" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094935" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopMount-Multi-Surface-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094935" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PopMount Multi Surface for MagSafe</p></div></p>
<p>Also new is an updated PopWallet+ for MagSafe, which is a combination wallet and grip that lets users carry up to three cards and now attaches magnetically to MagSafe-compatible phone cases for iPhone 12 devices. The wallet has an elastic sock so you can extract your cards without having to remove the wallet from the back of the device, and it now includes a shield to protect credit cards from magnetic damage. The grip here is swappable, too.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2094939" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094939" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094939" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopWallet-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094939" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PopWallet+ for MagSafe</p></div></p>
<p>There are also two versions of the PopGrip Slide becoming available. One, the PopGrip Slide Stretch will have expanding arms that attach mechanically to the sides of most phone cases, including iPhone 12 cases. You can slide this grip to the bottom of the phone to serve as a portrait stand or to attach MagSafe accessories, without having to remove the grip.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094942" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094942" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2094942" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?w=512" alt="" width="512" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PopGrip-Slide-Stretch-for-MagSafe.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094942" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PopGrip Slide Stretch for MagSafe</p></div></p>
<p>The PopGrip Slide for iPhone 12 is basically the same thing, but designed to fit the Apple Silicone cases for iPhone 12 devices, more specifically.</p>
<p>Among the first of the new accessories to hit the market will be the PopGrip for MagSafe and PopWallet+ for MagSafe in spring 2021.</p>
<p>The PopGrip Slide Stretch will launch March 21 on PopSockets.com and in select Target locations ahead of a broader rollout. The PopGrip Slide will launch May 1 on PopSockets.com and in Apple Stores. And the PopMount for MagSafe line will launch in summer 2021.</p>
<p>The company also announced a few other non-MagSafe products, including the PopGrip Pocketable, which streamlines the grip when collapsed so the surface is flat; the PopGrip Antimicrobial, which has an embedded silver-based treatment for protection; and the PopSockets x SOG PopGrip Multi-Tool, made in collaboration with SOG Speciality Knives, which includes a PopGrip with a detachable multi-tool.</p>
<p>The company didn&#8217;t share an exact time frame for these products besides &#8220;early 2021.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At CES this week, the company’s finally prepared to show off a bit more. “Today, we’re going to introduce a product that integrates AI and robotics,” CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said in an announcement video, “designed for adventurous creators.”</p>
<p>The drone is designed to carry Sony’s own imaging technology &#8212; specifically the Alpha series of mirrorless. And while it’s large compared to what we’re used to seeing on the consumer side from companies like DJI, Sony say it’s going to be the smallest drone on the market that can be equipped with its cameras.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_XWbHuwsfw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the announcement, the company’s also debuting footage of the drone in action, along with video captured with its on-board camera. The drone was flown through snow and managed to capture some lovely, stable footage, all things considered. Also of note: The car in the video is the Vision-S concept the company unveiled this time last year.</p>
<p>The system looks to compete with some of the more pro-focused models. DJI has that market under lock &#8212; along with practically all drone categories. Though while DJI owns a majority stake in Hasselblad, Sony’s system looks like a proprietary, purpose-built design. That could certainly be a bonus from the standpoint of compatibility, though it doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to swap the Alpha out for different cameras.</p>
<p>The company is targeting a spring release for the system. No word yet on pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week and throughout the weekend, technology companies took the historic step of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">deplatforming the president of the United States</a> in the wake of a riot in which the US Capitol was stormed by a collection of white nationalists, QAnon supporters, and right wing activists.</p>
<p>The decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">remove Donald Trump</a>, his<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/stripe-reportedly-joins-the-tech-platforms-booting-president-trump-from-their-services/"> fundraising</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">moneymaking</a> apparatus, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/"> a large portion of his supporters</a> from their digital homes because of their incitements to violence in the nation&#8217;s Capitol on January 6th and beyond, has led a chorus of voices to call for the regulation of the giant tech platforms.</p>
<p>They argue that private companies shouldn&#8217;t have the sole power to erase the digital footprint of a sitting president.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there&#8217;s a reason why the legislative hearings in Congress, and the pressure from the president, have not created any new regulations. And there&#8217;s also a reason why &#8212; despite all of the protestations from the president and his supporters &#8212; no lawsuits have effectively been brought against the platforms for their decisions.</p>
<p>The law, for now, is on their side.</p>
<p><strong>The First Amendment and freedom of speech (for platforms)</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the First Amendment. The protections of speech afforded to American citizens under the First Amendment only apply to <em>government</em> efforts to limit speech. While the protection of all speech is assumed as something enshrined in the foundations of American democracy, the founders appear to have only wanted to shield speech from government intrusions.</p>
<p>That position makes sense if you&#8217;re a band of patriots trying to ensure that a monarch or dictator can&#8217;t abuse government power to silence its citizens or put its thumb on the lever in the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p>The thing is, that marketplace of ideas is always open, but publishers and platforms have the freedom to decide what they want to sell into it. Ben Franklin would never have published pro-monarchist sentiments on his printing presses, but he would probably have let Thomas Paine have free rein.</p>
<p>So, the First Amendment doesn&#8217;t protect an individuals&#8217; rights to access any platform and say whatever the hell they want. In fact, it <em>protects</em> businesses in many cases from having their freedom of speech violated by having the government force them to publish something they don&#8217;t want to on their platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Section 230 and platform liability </strong></p>
<p>BuT WhAt AbOUt SeCTiOn 230, one might ask (and if you do, <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1348334863385063424?s=20">you&#8217;re not alone</a>)?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Canceling conservative speech is hostile to the free speech foundation America was built on.</p>
<p>There is no reason why social media organizations that pick &amp; choose which speech they allow to be protected by the liability protections in 47 US Code Section 230.</p>
<p>230 must be repealed</p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1348334863385063424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Unfortunately, for Abbott and <a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1347713461246169089?s=20">others who believe that repealing Section 230</a> would open the door for less suppression of speech by online platforms, they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>First, the cancellation of speech by businesses isn&#8217;t actually hostile to the foundation America was built on. If a group doesn&#8217;t like the way it&#8217;s being treated in one outlet, it can try and find another. Essentially, no one can force a newspaper to print their letter to the editor.</p>
<p>Second, users&#8217; speech isn&#8217;t what is protected under Section 230; it protects <em>platforms</em> from liability for that speech, which indirectly makes it safe for users to speak freely.</p>
<p>Where things get complicated is in the difference between the letter to an editor in a newspaper and a tweet on Twitter, post on Facebook, or blog on Medium (or WordPress). And this is where U.S. Code Section 230 comes into play.</p>
<p>Right now, Section 230 protects all of these social media companies from legal liability for the stuff that people publish on their platforms (unlike publishers). The gist of the law is that since these companies don&#8217;t actively edit what people post on the platforms, but merely provide a distribution channel for that content, then they can&#8217;t be held accountable for what&#8217;s in the posts.</p>
<p>The companies argue that they&#8217;re exercising their own rights to freedom of speech through the algorithms they&#8217;ve developed to highlight certain pieces of information or entertainment, or in removing certain pieces of content. And their broad terms of service agreements also provide legal shields that allow them to act with a large degree of impunity.</p>
<p>Repealing Section 230 would make platforms more restrictive rather than less restrictive about who gets to sell their ideas in the marketplace, because it would open up the tech companies to lawsuits over what they distribute across their platforms.</p>
<p>One of the authors of the legislation, Senator Ron Wyden, thinks repeal is an existential threat to social media companies. &#8220;Were Twitter to lose the protections I wrote into law, within 24 hours its potential liabilities would be many multiples of its assets and its stock would be worthless,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">Senator Wyden wrote back in 2018</a>. &#8220;The same for Facebook and any other social media site. Boards of directors should have taken action long before now against CEOs who refuse to recognize this threat to their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others believe that increased liability for content would actually be a powerful weapon to bring decorum to online discussions. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-10/revoke-shield-for-twitter-and-facebook-but-for-the-right-reason?cmpid=BBD011121_OUS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=210111&amp;utm_campaign=openamericas&amp;sref=AwwRcx4b">As Joe Nocera argues in Bloomberg BusinessWeek today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230; I have come around to an idea that the right has been clamoring for — and which Trump tried unsuccessfully to get Congress to approve just weeks ago. Eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That is the provision that shields social media companies from legal liability for the content they publish — or, for that matter, block.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The right seems to believe that repealing Section 230 is some kind of deserved punishment for Twitter and Facebook for censoring conservative views. (This accusation doesn’t hold up upon scrutiny, but let’s leave that aside.) In fact, once the social media companies have to assume legal liability — not just for libel, but for inciting violence and so on — they will quickly change their algorithms to block anything remotely problematic. People would still be able to discuss politics, but they wouldn’t be able to hurl anti-Semitic slurs. Presidents and other officials could announce policies, but they wouldn’t be able to spin wild conspiracies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservatives and liberals crowing for the removal of Section 230 protections may find that it would reinstitute a level of comity online, but the fringes will be even further marginalized. If you&#8217;re a free speech absolutist, that may or may not be the best course of action.</p>
<p><strong>What mechanisms can legislators use beyond repealing Section 230? </strong></p>
<p>Beyond the blunt instrument that is repealing Section 230, legislators could take other steps to mandate that platforms carry speech and continue to do business with certain kinds of people and platforms, however odious their views or users might be.</p>
<p>Many of these steps are outlined<a href="https://www.hoover.org/research/who-do-you-sue"> in this piece from Daphne Keller on &#8220;Who do you sue?&#8221; from the Hoover Institution</a>.</p>
<p>Most of them hinge on some reinterpretation of older laws relating to commerce and the provision of services by utilities, or on the &#8220;must-carry&#8221; requirements put in place in the early days of 20th century broadcasting when radio and television were distributed over airways provided by the federal government.</p>
<p>These older laws involve either designating internet platforms as &#8220;essential, unavoidable, and monopolistic services to which customers should be guaranteed access&#8221;; or treating the companies like the railroad industry and mandating compulsory access, requiring tech companies to accept all users and not modify any of their online speech.</p>
<p>Other avenues could see lawmakers use variations on the laws designed to limit the power of channel owners to edit the content they carried &#8212; including things like the fairness doctrine from the broadcast days or net neutrality laws that are already set to be revisited under the Biden Administration.</p>
<p>Keller notes that the existing body of laws &#8220;does not currently support must-carry claims against user-facing platforms like Facebook or YouTube, because Congress emphatically declined to extend it to them in the 1996 Telecommunications Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>These protections are distinct from Section 230, but their removal would have similar, dramatic consequences on how social media companies, and tech platforms more broadly, operate.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The] massive body of past and current federal communications law would be highly relevant,&#8221; Keller wrote. &#8220;For one thing, these laws provide the dominant and familiar model for US regulation of speech and communication intermediaries. Any serious proposal to legislate must-carry obligations would draw on this history. For another, and importantly for plaintiffs in today’s cases, these laws have been heavily litigated and are still being litigated today. They provide important precedent for weighing the speech rights of individual users against those of platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The establishment of some of these &#8220;must-carry&#8221; mandates for platforms would go a long way toward circumventing or refuting platforms&#8217; First Amendment claims, because some cases have already been decided against cable carriers in cases that could correspond to claims against platforms.</p>
<p><strong>This is really happening already so what could legislation look like</strong></p>
<p>At this point the hypothetical scenario that Keller sketched out in her essay, where private actors throughout the technical stack have excluded speech (although the legality of the speech is contested), has, in fact, happened.</p>
<p>The question is whether the deplatforming of the president and services that were spreading potential calls to violence and sedition, is a one-off; or a new normal where tech companies will act increasingly to silence voices that they &#8212; or a significant portion of their user base &#8212; disagree with.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Europe, seeing the actions from U.S. companies over the last week, aren&#8217;t wasting any time in drafting their own responses and increasing their calls for more regulation.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe seizes on social media&#8217;s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation/embed/#?secret=5Fx1LHlyR0" data-secret="5Fx1LHlyR0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In Europe, that regulation is coming in the form of the Digital Services Act, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">which we wrote about at the end of last year</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the content side, the Commission has chosen to limit the DSA’s regulation to speech that’s illegal (e.g., hate speech, terrorism propaganda, child sexual exploitation, etc.) — rather than trying to directly tackle fuzzier “legal but harmful” content (e.g., disinformation), as it seeks to avoid inflaming concerns about impacts on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Although a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">beefed up self-regulatory code on disinformation</a> is coming next year, as part of a wider European Democracy Action Plan. And that (voluntary) code sounds like it will be heavily pushed by the Commission as a mitigation measure platforms can put toward fulfilling the DSA’s risk-related compliance requirements.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers do also plan on regulating online political ads in time for the next pan-EU elections, under a separate instrument (to be proposed next year) and are continuing to push the Council and European parliament to adopt a 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/12/europe-to-push-for-one-hour-takedown-law-for-terrorist-content/">terrorism content takedown proposal</a> (which will bring specific requirements in that specific area).</p></blockquote>
<p>Europe has also put in place rules for very large online platforms that have more stringent requirements around how they approach and disseminate content, but regulators on the continent are having a hard time enforcing htem.</p>
<p>Keller believes that some of those European regulations could align with thinking about competition and First Amendment rights in the context of access to the &#8220;scarce&#8221; communication channels &#8212; those platforms whose size and scope mean that there are few competitive alternatives.</p>
<p>Two approaches that Keller thinks would perhaps require the least regulatory lift and are perhaps the most tenable for platforms to pursue involve solutions that either push platforms to make room for &#8220;disfavored&#8221; speech, but tell them that they don&#8217;t have to promote it or give it any ranking.</p>
<p>Under this solution, the platforms would be forced to carry the content, but could limit it. For instance, Facebook would be required to host any posts that don&#8217;t break the law, but it doesn&#8217;t have to promote them in any way — letting them sink below the stream of constantly updating content that moves across the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;On this model, a platform could maintain editorial control and enforce its Community Guidelines in its curated version, which most users would presumably prefer. But disfavored speakers would not be banished enitrely and could be found by other users who prefer an uncurated experience,&#8221; Keller writes. &#8220;Platforms could rank legal content but not remove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the regulation that Keller is most bullish on is one that she calls the &#8220;magic APIs&#8221; scenario. Similar to the &#8220;unbundling&#8221; requirements from telecommunications companies, this regulation would force big tech companies to license their hard-to-duplicate resources to new market entrants. In the Facebook or Google context, this would mean requiring the companies open up access to their user generated content, and other companies could launch competing services with new user interfaces and content ranking and removal policies, Keller wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letting users choose among competing &#8216;flavors&#8217; of today&#8217;s mega-platforms would solve some First Amendment problems by leaving platforms own editorial decisions undisturbed,&#8221; Keller writes.</p>
<p><strong>Imperfect solutions are better than none </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear to speech advocates on both the left and the right that having technology companies control what is and is not permissible on the world&#8217;s largest communications platforms is untenable and that better regulation is needed.</p>
<p>When the venture capitalists who have funded these services &#8212; and whose politics lean toward the mercenarily libertarian &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1348664592541634562?s=20">are calling for some sort of regulatory constraints</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1348703472988745730?s=20">the power of the technology platforms they&#8217;ve created</a>, it&#8217;s clear things have gone too far. Even if the actions of the platforms<a href="https://twitter.com/sacca/status/1348704862863716353?s=20"> are entirely justified</a>.</p>
<p>However, in these instances, much of the speech that&#8217;s been taken down is clearly illegal. To the point that even free speech services like Parler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">have deleted posts from their service for inciting violence</a>.</p>
<p>The deplatforming of the president brings up the same points that were raised back in 2017 when Cloudflare, the service that stands out for being more tolerant of despicable speech than nearly any other platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/cloudflare-ceo-calls-for-a-system-to-regulate-hateful-internet-content/">basically erased the Daily Stormer</a>.</p>
<p>“I know that Nazis are bad, the content [on The Daily Stormer] was so incredibly repulsive, it’s stomach turning how bad it is,” Prince said at the time. “But I do believe that the best way to battle bad speech is with good speech, I’m skeptical that censorship is the right scheme.</p>
<p>“I’m worried the decision we made with respect to this one particular site is not particularly principled but neither was the decision that most tech companies made with respect to this site or other sites. It’s important that we know there is convention about how we create principles and how contraptions are regulated in the internet tech stack,” Prince continued.</p>
<p>“We didn’t just wake up and make some capricious decision, but we could have and that’s terrifying. The internet is a really important resource for everyone, but there’s a very limited set of companies that control it and there’s such little accountability to us that it really is quite a dangerous thing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building on a policy that the company said has been in place since the Charlottesville protests back in 2017, <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-capitol-safety-plan-for-the-inauguration/">Airbnb said it will take additional steps to beef up community protections for the DC metro area</a> ahead of the presidential inauguration.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already removes people from the platform who are associated with violent hate groups <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/01/07/airbnb-says-it-canceled-some-hate-group-members-dc-reservations-and-plans-to-do-more/">ahead of specific events</a>, the company said.</p>
<p>And ahead of the inauguration, the company said it would use a seven-step plan to ensure that the DC metro-area isn&#8217;t overwhelmed with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or &#8220;western chauvinists.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airbnb said it would ban individuals identified as involved in criminal activity around the Capitol at last week&#8217;s riot. &#8220;When we learn through media or law enforcement sources the names of individuals confirmed to have been responsible for the violent criminal activity at the United States Capitol on January 6, we investigate whether the named individuals have an account on Airbnb,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;This includes cross-referencing the January 6 arrest logs of D.C. Metro Police. If the individuals have an Airbnb account, we take action, which includes banning them from using Airbnb.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s in addition to another sweep of existing reservations at locations around the Capitol in the days leading up to the inauguration to ensure that no one associated with hate groups slips through its dragnet.</p>
<p>The company will also tighten up booking requirements, with additional identity verification measures and other security checks to ensure that background checks are up-to-date.</p>
<p>As final steps, the company said that it is communicating with booking guests to inform them that if they&#8217;re bringing people who are associated with hate groups then they could face legal action from Airbnb. Hosts are also being told by the company that if they suspect anything about individuals staying on their properties that they should contact the company&#8217;s Urgent Safety Line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in South Korea five years ago, content discovery platform <a href="http://dable.io/en/">Dable</a> now serves a total of six markets in Asia. Now it plans to speed up the pace of its expansion, with six new markets in the region planned for this year, before entering European countries and the United States. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dable" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dable">Dable <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today that it has raised a $12 million Series C at a valuation of $90 million, led by South Korean venture capital firm SV Investment. Other participants included KB Investment and K2 Investment, as well as returning investor Kakao Ventures, a subsidiary of Kakao Corporation, one of South Korea’s largest internet firms.</p>
<p>Dable (the name is a combination of “data” and “able”) currently serves more than 2,500 media outlets in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. It has subsidiaries in Taiwan, which accounts for 70% of its overseas sales, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Series C brings Dable’s total funding so far to $20.5 million. So far, the company has taken a gradual approach to international expansion, co-founder and chief executive officer Chaehyun Lee told TechCrunch, first entering one or two markets and then waiting for business there to stabilize. In 2021, however, it plans to use its Series C to speed up the pace of its expansion, launching in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, mainland China, Australia and Turkey before entering markets in Europe and the United States, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s goal is to become the &#8220;most utilized personalized recommendation platform in at last 30 countries by 2024.&#8221; Lee said it also has plans to transform into a media tech company by launching a content management system (CMS) next year.</p>
<p>Dable currently claims an average annual sales growth rate since founding of more than 50%, and says it reached $27.5 million in sales in 2020, up from 63% the previous year. Each month, it has a total of 540 million unique users and recommends five billion pieces of content, resulting in more than 100 million clicks. Dable also says its average annual sales growth rate since founding is more than 50%, and in that 2020, it reached $27.5 million in sales, up 63% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Before launching Dable, Lee and three other members of its founding team worked at RecoPick, a recommendation engine developer operated by SK Telecom subsidiary SK Planet. For media outlets, Dable offers two big data and machine learning-based products: Dable News to make personalized recommendations of content, including articles, to visitors, and Dable Native Ad, which draws on ad networks including Google, MSN and Kakao.</p>
<p>A third product, called karamel.ai, is an ad-targeting solution for e-commerce platforms that also makes personalized product recommendations.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taboola and Outbrain call off their $850M merger&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/embed/#?secret=G51p3JutDw" data-secret="G51p3JutDw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dable’s main rivals include Taboola and Outbrain, both of which are headquartered in New York (and recently called off a merger), but also do business in Asian markets, and Tokyo-based Popin, which also serves clients in Japan and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Lee said Dable proves the competitiveness of its products by running A/B tests to compare the performance of competitors against Dable’s recommendations and see which one results in the most clickthroughs. It also does A/B testing to compare the performance of articles picked by editors against ones that were recommended by Dable’s algorithms.</p>
<p>Dable also provides algorithms that allow clients more flexibility in what kind of personalized content they display, which is a selling point as media companies try to recover from the massive drop in ad spending precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Dable’s Related Articles algorithm is based on content that visitors have already viewed, while its Perused Article algorithm gauges how interested visitors are in certain articles based on metrics like how much time they spent reading them. It also has another algorithm that displays the most viewed articles based on gender and age groups.</p>

<p>The little accessory sports a Lightning plug (it&#8217;s currently iOS only), which connects to the bottom of an iPhone. The little dongle features a trio of microphones, coupled with an audio signal processor designed to reduce background noise.</p>

<p>The Noopl app launches when the device is plugged in, setting up a connection with a pair of AirPods Pro. It’s designed to utilize head tracking to determine the direction the wearer is facing, in order to offer clearer sound in that direction. The app can then be used to broaden the direction beam and adjust volume.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Steven Verdooner and Kevin Snow, building on technology from Sydney’s National Acoustic Laboratories (NAL).</p>
<p>“The genesis for the idea occurred when Verdooner was at a noisy restaurant with his father and both of them experienced challenges hearing each other, even with the father’s state-of-the-art hearing aids in ‘restaurant mode,’ ” it writes in a press release. “Realizing an immense opportunity to potentially help millions of people, Verdooner partnered with NAL and a small team of seasoned scientists and engineers to create Noopl. Hearing industry veteran, Tim Trine, was brought on in 2020 as President and CEO to create a scalable technology platform, commercialize products, and grow the company.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has enjoyed unrivaled reach in India for years. By mid-2019, the Facebook-owned app had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">amassed over 400 million users in the country</a>. Its closest app rival at the time was YouTube, which, according to the company’s own statement and data from mobile insight firm App Annie, had about 260 million users in India then.</p>
<p>Things have changed dramatically since.</p>
<p>In the month of December, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/youtube" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="youtube">YouTube <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had 425 million monthly active users on Android phones and tablets in India, according to App Annie, the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. In comparison, WhatsApp had 422 million monthly active users on Android in India last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Factoring in the traction both these apps have garnered on iOS devices, WhatsApp still assumes a lead in India with 459 million active users<sup>1</sup>, but YouTube is not too far behind with 452 million users.</p>
<p>With China keeping its doors closed to U.S. tech giants, India emerged as the top market for Silicon Valley and Chinese companies looking to continue their growth in the last decade. India had about 50 million internet users in 2010, but it ended the decade with more than 600 million. Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> played their part to make this happen.</p>
<p>In the last four years, both Google and Facebook have invested in ways to bring the internet to people who are offline in India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. Google kickstarted a project to bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/google-says-over-8-million-people-use-its-free-wifi-service-at-railway-stations-in-india/">Wi-Fi to 400 railway stations</a> in the country and planned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/google-station-indonesia/">extend this program to other public places</a>. Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/17/save-free-basics/?_ga=2.76173149.954111183.1610362407-37075995.1609086401">launched Free Basics in India</a>, and then &#8212; after the program was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/india-blocks-facebook-freebasics-net-neutrality/">banned in the country</a> &#8212; it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/04/facebooks-express-wi-fi-launches-commercially-in-india/">launched Express Wi-Fi</a>.</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook, which identify India as their biggest market by users, have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">scaled down on their connectivity efforts</a> in recent years after India&#8217;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, took it upon himself to bring the country online. After he succeeded, both the companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">bought multibillion-dollar</a> stakes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">in his firm</a>, Jio Platforms, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Jio Platforms&#8217; cut-rate mobile data tariff has allowed hundreds of millions of people in India, where much of the online user base was previously too conscious about how much data they spent on the internet, to consume, worry-free, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/09/netflixs-biggest-competition-isnt-sleep-its-youtube/">hours of content on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/tiktok-education-edutok-india/">other video platforms</a> in recent years. This growth might explain why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">Google is doubling down</a> on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">short-video apps</a>.</p>
<p>The new figures shared with TechCrunch illustrate a number of other findings about the Indian market. Even as WhatsApp’s growth has slowed<sup>2</sup> in India, it continues to enjoy an unprecedented loyalty among its users.</p>
<p>More than 95% of WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India use the app each day, and nearly its entire user base checks the app at least once a week. In comparison, three-fourths of YouTube’s monthly active users in India are also its daily active users.</p>
<p>The data also showed that Google’s eponymous app as well as Chrome &#8212; both of which, like YouTube, ship pre-installed<sup>3</sup> on most Android smartphones &#8212; has also surpassed over 400 million monthly active users in India in recent months. Facebook&#8217;s app, in comparison, had about 325 million monthly active users in India last month.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to <a href="https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/digital/youtube-reaches-over-325-million-18-viewers-in-india/78906708">a report from Comscore last year</a>, which estimated that YouTube had about 325 million monthly unique users in India in May 2020.</p>
<p>A separate report by research firm Media Partners Asia on Monday estimated that YouTube commanded 43% of the revenue generated in the online video market in India last year (about $1.4 billion). Disney+ Hotstar assumed 16% of the market, while Netflix had 14%.</p>

<hr />
<h5><em><sup>1 For simplicity, I have not factored in the traction WhatsApp Business and YouTube Kids apps have received in India. WhatsApp and YouTube also maintain apps on KaiOS, which powers JioPhone feature handsets in India. At last count &#8212; which was a long time ago &#8212; more than 40 million JioPhone handsets had shipped in India. TechCrunch could not determine the inroads any app has made on this platform. Additionally, the figures of YouTube on Android (phones and tablets) and iOS (iPhone and iPad) will likely have an overlap. The same is not true of WhatsApp, which restricts one phone number to one account. So if I have WhatsApp installed on an iPhone with my primary phone number, I can&#8217;t use WhatsApp with the same number on an Android phone &#8212; at least not concurrently.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>2 WhatsApp Business appears to be growing fine, having amassed over 50 million users in India. And some caveats from No. 1 also apply here.</sup></em></h5>
<h5><em><sup>3 Users still have to engage with the app for App Annie and other mobile insight firms to count them as active. So while pre-installing the app provides Google an unprecedented distribution, their apps still have to win over users.</sup></em></h5>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of last week&#8217;s violence at the U.S. Capitol, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today announced it will be taking additional steps to remove content referencing the phrase &#8220;stop the steal&#8221; on its platform. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election#:~:text=Stop%20the%20Steal%20is%20a,former%20vice%20president%20Joe%20Biden.">phrase</a> is associated with the right-wing campaign that falsely alleges the democratic U.S. elections have been rigged and aims to keep Trump in power by any means necessary, including, now, violent insurrection. Facebook had previously removed some of the original Stop the Steal groups in November, and says it has continued to remove Pages, groups and events that violate its policies, including calls for violence.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">previously reported,</a> Facebook had also begun to block election conspiracy hashtags back in November 2020, including #sharpiegate and #stopthesteal. Searches for those would not return groups or posts, as a result.</p>
<p>However, the cleanup effort was not as widespread or as ongoing as Facebook would have you believe. As of the time of writing, we&#8217;re aware of several active Facebook Groups that are still literally called &#8220;stop the steal,&#8221; for example.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Nyz0QTOG7O"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">Facebook blocks hashtags for #sharpiegate, #stopthesteal election conspiracies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook blocks hashtags for #sharpiegate, #stopthesteal election conspiracies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/embed/#?secret=Nyz0QTOG7O" data-secret="Nyz0QTOG7O" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Facebook says its decision to take this further action has to do with the increased calls for violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been allowing robust conversations related to the election outcome and that will continue,&#8221; explained Facebook in an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/">announcement</a> co-authored by Facebook VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen, and Monika Bickert, VP Global Policy Management. &#8220;But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in D.C., we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,&#8221; the blog post read.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts,&#8221; the authors noted.</p>
<p>The company clearly wants to distance itself from being thought of as one of the platforms used by the organizers of the U.S. Capitol riot. In fact, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4kbd5KqbIM&amp;amp;ab_channel=Reuters">interview</a> with Reuters on Monday that the riot <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html">was &#8220;largely organized&#8221; on other internet services</a>, not Facebook. She said that Facebook had taken down content from fringe groups, like QAnon, as well as Proud Boys and Stop the Steal groups, and anything that was talking about violence.</p>
<p>Facebook is not the only mainstream social platform actively removing content that violates its terms as the ramifications of social media&#8217;s more permissive policies have now resulted in violent protests and an attempted coup, as well as people&#8217;s deaths.</p>
<p>Several social media companies have also now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">removed</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">Trump</a> from their platforms, as Congress weighs impeachment for his incitement of violence. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">app</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">stores</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">web services provider</a> for the alternative social network Parler have also now given it the boot for the hate speech and calls for violence it hosted, as well.</p>
<p>Facebook says it will continue to staff its Integrity Operations Center on a 24/7 basis at least through January 22 in order to monitor and respond to threats in real time. This time frame is likely because the FBI now is warning of plans for armed protests in all 50 state capitals and Washington in the days leading up to President-Elect Joe Biden&#8217;s inauguration on January 20, according to <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-01-11/fbi-warns-of-plans-for-nationwide-armed-protests-next-week">a report this morning from the AP.</a> This is why Facebook&#8217;s Integrity Operations Center will need to be highly available during these days.</p>
<p>The Center had already been active ahead of Georgia&#8217;s runoff elections and Congress&#8217;s counting of the Electoral College votes. Its operations were extended due the Capitol protests, Facebook says.</p>
<p>The company notes, too, it will continue to work with law enforcement to remove content, disable accounts and respond to legal requests for user data.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Of the Inc. 5000 companies, <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/currents/three-facts-you-probably-didnt-know-about-and-venture-capital-and-entrepreneurship/">only</a> 6.5% raised money from VCs and 7.7% raised from angels. Where else can fast-growing companies get funding?</p>
<p>More and more startups are pursuing <a href="http://teten.com/rbi">revenue-based VCs</a>, but it&#8217;s not a good fit for everyone. A new category of investors has emerged offering a hybrid between VC and revenue-based investment (RBI), which we call “flexible VC.&#8221;</p>
<p>From RBI, flexible VCs borrow the ability to reap meaningful returns without demanding founders build for an exit. From traditional equity VC, flexible VC borrows the option to pursue and reap the rewards of an outsized exit. Every flexible VC structure allows founders to access immediate risk capital while preserving exit, growth trajectory and ownership optionality.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Before raising capital, we encourage founders to dig into the nuances between different flexible VC structures.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our categorization is not a technical one. Rather, we want to accommodate the wide variety of instruments currently offered by flexible VC investors, detailed below. As two fund managers employing flexible VC, we think it is a healthy addition to the ecosystem and will yield more predictable and stable healthy returns for investors.</p>
<h2>Flexible VC 101: Equity meets revenue share</h2>
<p>This is currently the most common investment structure: The flexible VC investor purchases either equity ownership, or a convertible right to equity, and a right to regularly scheduled payments based on a percentage of revenues.</p>
<p>By tying payments to actual revenues, founders and investors remain aligned around the company’s real-time performance, good or bad.</p>
<p>“Too often, investment structures force the management team to make decisions between misaligned growth and investment (return) objectives. This structure allows for alignment on the front end, and real-time flexibility for performance metrics,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirasalman/">Samira Salman</a>, a family office investor and advisor.</p>
<p>Payments are commonly delayed for a grace period of 12-36 months. John Berger, director of Operations and Impact Solutions at <a href="https://toniic.com/">Toniic</a>, observed that this has clear investor benefits: “The grace period became a feature because it benefits investors in regions like the U.S. where there can be tax differences between short- and long-term gains. It has moved from its origins as a tax benefit and can be viewed as a feature that benefits founders.” After the grace period, the return payments begin, often lasting until a return cap is hit, such as 2-5 times the original investment.</p>
<p>To account for these revenue share payments, the investor’s ownership (or convertible right to ownership) is simultaneously reduced. Once the return cap is reached, the investor is typically left with a residual stake — a fraction of the pre-revenue share ownership. At any point, should the founder wish to pursue a traditional equity VC round, or get bought, the revenue share is paused, and the investor’s then-current ownership converts to equate to a traditional equity VC investor.</p>
<h2>Flexible VC 102: Variations</h2>
<p>Flexible VCs have created structures based on other company performance metrics than revenues, such as profits or founder salaries. These different company performance metrics provide a slight variation in how the investor and founder relationship is defined. For example, profit-sharing structures ensure payments do not begin until the company is profitable, though likely delaying returns to the investor and complicating payment calculations.</p>
<p>Similarly, when flexible VC structures are based off of the founder’s own compensation (often via salary or dividends), investors are specifically tying their returns to the financial success of the founder. This translates less directly to company performance compared to a revenue or profit share, but offers uniquely personal alignment. These variations in founder alignment allow flexible VCs to specialize in the types of companies they work with.</p>
<h2>The state of flexible VC</h2>
<p>In all these cases, capital is provided to fuel forecasted growth without creating a commitment to a particular vision for future funding rounds, exit goals and associated blitzscaling. The founder retains full control over whether they want to optimize for hypergrowth (usually at the expense of profitability) or for organic, profitable growth. Flexible VC opens up a new risk capital option for bootstrappers, minorities, family-owned and countless other founder segments left out by the traditional funding landscape.</p>
<p>A range of small VCs are deploying with flexible VC structures, but we believe the total amount of AUM deployed with this strategy is well under $50 million. Similar to the explosion of seed funds in the past decade, we (and some <a href="https://medium.com/blue-future-partners/the-rise-of-challenger-vcs-what-lps-need-to-know-about-this-new-bet-in-early-stage-venture-109348d33a9e">limited partners too</a>) believe these Flexible VCs are on the forefront of what will become a major segment of the venture ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Flexible VC versus other venture capital models</h2>
<p>Flexible VC investors offer founders some of the same advantages as equity VCs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aligned incentives.</strong> Whether it is a breakout success or complete failure and loss of capital, investors are along for the ride. When the company hits potholes, flexible VC investors usually don’t have the nuclear options of firing management and/or doing a recapitalization. Their only option is to work with management to try to fix the problems.</li>
<li><strong>Few strings attached.</strong> Founders have autonomy to spend the funds in whatever way they like.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term alignment.</strong> Many flexible VCs retain a small residual stake in the company after the return cap is reached, driving alignment well beyond the horizon of the revenue share, similar to the long-term orientation of equity VC.</li>
<li><strong>Seed-stage compatible. </strong>Like traditional equity VC investors, flexible VCs accommodate early-stage investment risk within their portfolios better than a traditional RBI funder.</li>
<li><strong>Eligible for favorable treatment under qualified small business stock exemption, if structured as equity. </strong>This applies if the investment converts into common stock; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/how-to-build-or-invest-in-a-startup-without-paying-capital-gains-tax/">details</a> are beyond this essay’s scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flexible VCs also offer investors some of the same advantages as RBI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear return expectations.</strong> The return cap is a stated multiple of the investment, typically 2x-5x.</li>
<li><strong>Early liquidity. </strong>Equity VC is a “get rich slow” business. Flexible VC creates early liquidity that can be either reinvested or distributed to LPs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved financial management.</strong> All parties want the company to be able to afford the payment obligations and, ideally, deliver a quick return. As a result, unfounded hockey-stick graphs and unicorn promises give way to financial fluency, realistic expectations, frank conversations about what a business can credibly achieve and transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability is prioritized.</strong> The revenue that is going to grow the company immediately is the same revenue that is going to get investors to their return cap. If the company is profitable, the revenue share becomes increasingly affordable. This drives an earlier focus on profitability than is typical for a company backed by traditional equity VC.</li>
<li><strong>Founder retains control.</strong> Flexible VCs typically purchase nonvoting common stock, if they purchase stock (one even <a href="https://www.indie.vc/notes/2021">assigns their voting rights to the founders</a>). This keeps the founder in the driver’s seat of the company.</li>
<li><strong>Attractive to women and underrepresented founders.</strong> See <a href="https://teten.com/blog/2019/08/20/why-are-revenue-based-vcs-investing-in-so-many-women-underrepresented-founders/">Why Are Revenue-Based Investors Investing in Women &amp; Diverse Entrepreneurs?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Flexible VC also offers some unique advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Straightforward equity interface.</strong> If an equity round is needed to fund breakout growth beyond what the flexible VC funds, the mechanics of including a flexible VC in an equity VC round are predetermined and simple.</li>
<li><strong>Prepared for blitzscaling, but neither required nor expected.</strong> <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling">Blitzscaling</a> typically means prioritizing user growth over revenue growth and revenue growth over profitability. Tim O’Reilly, CEO, O’Reilly Media, <a href="https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/">argues</a>, “Blitzscaling isn’t really a recipe for success but rather survivorship bias masquerading as a strategy.” With flexible VC, not every company is expected to achieve breakout growth, but that possibility is accounted for up front.</li>
<li><strong>Particular application in impact capital.</strong> Our research has found that impact investors appear to be particularly interested in flexible VC. An impact investor typically needs some economic return to function, but doesn’t necessarily want the company as a whole to exit, given exits often have a negative impact on the company’s founding mission. Flexible VC allows impact VCs to thread this needle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, nothing is cost-free. The unique disadvantages of flexible VC include:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy, a community built around buying hot sneakers and related items that are increasingly hard to acquire at retail, raised $2 million in a round that closed late last year. SoleSavy is a group of communities that is currently mostly hosted on Slack. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://solesavy.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/dp16?lang=en">Dejan Pralica</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/justdoit604">Justin Dusanj</a> founded the company in 2018 as a paid community for collectors and enthusiasts seeking pairs that were getting snapped up by bots or resellers. Pralica previously co-founded Kicks Deals, a sneaker shipping site focused on less than retail pricing and Dusanj is the former director of Operations at New Age Sports, a Nike retailer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s $2 million party raise includes investment from <a href="https://www.panache.vc/">Panache Ventures,</a> Jason Calacanis’ <a href="https://launch.co/">LAUNCH</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak">Turner Novak</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bnarasin?lang=en">Ben Narasin</a>, Morning Brew&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/businessbarista">Alex Lieberman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/austin_rief">Austin Rief</a>, <a href="http://tinycapital.com/">Tiny Capital</a>, Wesley Pentz (yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/diplo">Diplo</a>), Matthew Hauri aka <a href="https://twitter.com/yunggravy">Yung Gravy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/invoker">Ryan Holmes</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rohamg">Roham Gharegozlou</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/bedrock-capital/">Bedrock Capital</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy has built an engaged community (several communities, really) around the ebb and flow of the sneakerhead consumer universe (SCU). I just coined that, by the way, please make it a thing. The SCU is an interesting place filled with fascinating characters and behaviors. Every once in a while it pokes its head into the mainstream, whether via a </span><a href="https://shiftermagazine.com/film/sneakerheadz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">documentary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hot shoe release or a </span><a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/south-florida-social-media-personality-benjamin-kickz-arrested-on-robbery-charges/#:~:text=(WSVN)%20%2D%20A%20young%20man,been%20arrested%20on%20robbery%20charges.&amp;text=Kapelushnik%20has%20been%20arrested%20and,Miami%2DDade%20after%20posting%20bond."><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong-arm robbery attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2021, I believe that we will see more of this world breaking out of its box into the larger consumer consciousness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trends that are leading us to this place are varied, but some of them have been front and center during the pandemic, as a decade’s worth of consumer behavioral change has occurred in the space of a few months. You only have to look at how hard it was to get a PS5 or Xbox One X or a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1306595714097491974?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the holiday season, and how many services, Twitter accounts and monitor groups rose up to try to help people do that to see what the future of shopping looks like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I joked about not being able to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1326291738772738048?s=20"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy butter without a bot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s not far from the truth &#8212; nearly every category of goods has had its own shortages over the last year. But the mother of all limited goods category for decades now has been sneakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every release is hotly anticipated and eagerly purchased by people looking for the latest shoe. The massive increase in interest in the sneaker as the marquee desirable item and the unwillingness of the biggest manufacturers to lose the hype halo has led to each drop being harder to get than the last. Second-market startups like StockX and GOAT have sprung up to facilitate those who don’t mind paying 30%-200% premiums on each release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution for many lies in the countless &#8220;cook groups&#8221; that help buyers anticipate demand and stock for each drop and plan to purchase them on release date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy’s function is ostensibly to do just that: help regular enthusiasts to strategize and execute the release-day cop. But beyond that, Pralica says that the group has come to be about the community of people around those shoes more than the purchase itself. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094799" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094799" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094799 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png" alt="" width="1024" height="655" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png 3358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=680,435 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=1536,983 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=2048,1310 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Slack.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094799" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: SoleSavy</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy is at its heart a Slack group (a series of groups actually that act as cohorts, leading people through the tiers of community that the team has built) with rooms that help people to understand what’s happening in sneakers, get the releases and commiserate around the culture. Pralica says that they’ve built that community out slowly (the waitlist for the group grows by 400 people per day) in order to maintain a positive atmosphere and to properly onboard new people to the group. They also have an app that drives push notifications and a podcast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy’s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to re-sell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That’s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though cook groups have been the &#8220;core&#8221; of the Discord and Slack-based communities in the sneaker world, other iterations have been booming too. Entrepreneurial communities based in the same hustle principles like Tyler Blake’s </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/only-resolution-45651741"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In This Economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fanbase-focused groups around popular streamers </span><a href="https://disboard.org/servers/tag/streamers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top the Disboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And bets on social token </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/crypto-driven-marketplace-zora-raises-2m-to-build-a-sustainable-creator-economy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outfits like Zora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also focused on community as the glue that holds together a user base. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community is the future of all commerce, whether you’re looking for a specific product (see the huge </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheSiteSupply"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PS5 monitors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or want to steep yourself in a particular universe of product interest (the SCU). The trends that I’ve been seeing all point to 2021 being the year that community-driven purchasing breaks out of the underbelly of fandom and becomes officially “a thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoleSavy has been experimenting with a variety of ways to keep the community knit going, including live chats, get-togethers and even a handsome custom community-designed Jordan 1. These efforts have driven the previously bootstrapped company to some impressive early numbers. Pralica says that SoleSavy is currently profitable, with $1.5 million ARR on $33 monthly subscriptions plus affiliate revenue and that their DAUs are at 90% &#8212; an engagement number that would make any retailer salivate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the funding closed (very) late last year I thought that this would be a great kick-off story for the year ahead. Though SoleSavy seems to have a really compelling story and a great growth curve, I think they’re at the tip of a very large trend, one that we will see continue to build throughout the year. </span></p>

<p>In <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification?ubiquiti-20201101">a short email to customers</a> on Monday, the tech company said it became aware of unauthorized access to its systems hosted by a third-party cloud provider. Ubiquiti didn&#8217;t name the cloud company, when the breach happened or what caused the security incident. A company spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>But the company confirmed that it &#8220;cannot be certain&#8221; that customer data had not been exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This data may include your name, email address, and the one-way encrypted password to your account,&#8221; said the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ubnt/account-notification?ubiquiti-20201101">email to customers</a>. &#8220;The data may also include your address and phone number if you have provided that to us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than a full day into <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 2021, and it seems that smart glasses are very much shaping up as a trend. I wrote about a pair of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/lenovo-launches-ar-glasses-for-enterprise/">AR glasses from Lenovo</a> aimed at business applications yesterday, and a few other companies have popped up in the meantime, with various levels of “smartness” included.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vuzix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vuzix">Vuzix’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest models are still several months away, but they seem to be one of the more promising we’ve seen at the show thus far. The company is best known for its business-focused solutions &#8212; that, after all, is where all the money is &#8212; at least until someone offers a really profound breakthrough in the consumer category.</p>
<p>These probably aren’t that (if I had to guess, I’d look more closely at offerings from bigger consumer electronics companies), but they do seem like a step in the right direction, in terms of an offering that bakes augmented reality into a presentable form factor. It seems like AR glasses that look like regular eyeglasses is the right hook here. There are clearly differentiating factors here, but the next-gen glasses look a lot closer to standard eyewear than what we’ve seen in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XabpNlxq0oQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>That’s due in no small part to a partnership with Jade Bird Display, which will help commercialize the Chinese company’s microLED tech. Jade Bird describes it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>JBD offers active matrix inorganic microLED display chips and panels with wavelength ranging from UV to visible to IR. The pixel pitch ranges from 400 dpi to 10,000 dpi with a varity of resolutions. With high brightness, high EQE, high reliability, these panels are ideal for AR, VR, HUD, projector, weapon sights, 3D printing, microscope, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>The module, which projects a monochrome stereoscopic image, is roughly the size of a pencil eraser, according to Vuzix’s description. The company says the glasses will be available in a number of configurations, including Wi-Fi and optional LTE. All will feature stereo speakers and noise-canceling mics.</p>
<p>No word on price, but Vuzix says they should hit the market this summer.</p>

<p>Snap confirmed the news to TechCrunch and said the acquisition will result in four <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/streetcred" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="streetcred">StreetCred <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> team members — including co-founders Randy Meech and Diana Shkolnikov — joining the company, where they&#8217;ll be working on map and location-related products.</p>
<p>A big component of that strategy is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/">the Snap Map</a>, which allows users to view public snaps from a given area and to share their location with friends. Last summer, the Snap Map was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/snapchat-redesigns-its-app-with-new-action-bar/">added to Snapchat&#8217;s main navigation bar</a>, and the company <a href="https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2020/q2/Q2’20-Earnings-Release_Final_7.21.20-(2).pdf">announced</a> that the product was reaching 200 million users every month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, Snapchat has been adding other products that tie into a user&#8217;s locations, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/snapchat-boosts-its-ar-platform-with-voice-search-local-lenses-and-snapml/">Local Lenses</a>, which allow developers to create geography-specific augmented reality lenses that interact with physical locations.</p>

<p>Meech and Shkolnikov should be bringing plenty of mapping experience to Snap — Meech was formerly CEO at Samsung&#8217;s open mapping subsidiary Mapzen, and before that the senior vice president of local and mapping products at TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company AOL (subsequently rebranded as Verizon Media). Shkolnikov, meanwhile, is the former engineering director at Mapzen.</p>
<p>StreetCred had raised $1 million in seed funding from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bowery-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bowery-capital">Bowery Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Notation Capital. When I spoke to Meech in 2018, he said his goal was to &#8220;open up and decentralize&#8221; location data by building a blockchain-based marketplace where users are rewarded for helping to collect that data.</p>
<p>While the financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the existing StreetCred platform will be shut down as part of the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mapping the ocean&#8217;s floor is a surprisingly vital enterprise, which helps with a range of activities including shipping, coastal protection, and deep-sea resource gathering. It&#8217;s also a very costly and time-consuming activity, which can be demanding and dangerous for those involved. <a href="https://www.saildrone.com">Saildrone</a> is a startup focused on building out autonomous exploratory vessels that can do lots of mapping, while making very little impact on the environment in which they operate, and without requiring any crew on board at all.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/saildrone" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="saildrone">Saildrone&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> newest robotic ocean explorer is the Surveyor, its largest vessel at 72-feet long. The Surveyor can spend up to 12 months at a stretch out at sea, and draws its power from wind (hence the large sail-like structure, which is not actually used like the sail on a sailboat) and the sun (via the solar panels dotting its above-water surfaces). Its sensor instrumentation includes sonar that can map down to 7,000 meters (around 22,000 feet). That&#8217;s not quite as deep as some of the deepest parts of the world&#8217;s oceans, but it&#8217;s plenty deep enough to cover the average depth of around 12,100 feet.</p>
<p>As Saildrone notes, we&#8217;ve only actually mapped around 20% of the Earth&#8217;s oceans to date – meaning we know less about it than we do the surface of Mars or the Moon. Saildrone has already been contributing to better understanding this last great frontier with its 23-foot Explorer model, which has already accumulated 500,000 nautical miles of travel on its autonomous sea voyages. The larger vessel will help not only with seafloor mapping, but also with a new DNA sample collection effort using sensors developed the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/university-of-new-hampshire" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="university-of-new-hampshire">University of New Hampshire <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, to better understand the genetic makeup of various lifeforms that occupy the water column in more parts of the sea.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, is scaling up its autonomous vehicle program and plans to launch test fleets in at least four more cities over the next several months, including Detroit, Paris Shanghai and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua said Monday during the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show that if the company can receive regulatory approval it will also begin testing on public roads in New York City.</p>
<p>The expansion announcement, along with details about a new lidar System on Chip product that is under development and will come to market in 2025, illustrates Mobileye&#8217;s ambitions to commercialize automated vehicle technology and bring it to the masses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The selection of the cities and countries is based on two factors: customers and the regulatory environment, according to Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we put our cars in the U.S. in Detroit, rather than Silicon Valley because all major OEMs are in Detroit,&#8221; Weast said in an interview Monday, adding that Peugeot Renault are in Paris and Toyota and Nissan are in Japan. &#8220;The selection of the cities had a lot to do with putting the vehicles near our customers so that they would all have the opportunity to experience the technology firsthand because we expect our OEM customers to continue to be an important part of our business going forward even, even as we supply a complete self driving system.&#8221;</p>
<p>A test fleet is already on the road in Detroit, according to the company. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p>Mobileye is taking a three-pronged strategy to developing and deploying automated vehicle technology that combines a full self-driving stack — that includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology— with its REM mapping system and a <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into nearly 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. Shashua said Mobileye&#8217;s technology can now map the world automatically with nearly 8 million kilometers tracked daily and nearly 1 billion kilometers completed to date. </span></p>
<p>This strategy will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025, Shashua said Monday.</p>
<p>Mobileye has long dominated a specific niche in the automotive world as a developer of computer vision sensor systems that help prevent collisions. In 2018, the company expanded its focus beyond being a mere supplier to becoming a robotaxi operator; now it&#8217;s aiming to bring autonomous vehicle technology to passenger cars by augmenting its computer vision technology with the new lidar SoC it is developing with Intel.</p>
<p>Mobileye has already partnered with Luminar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">supply lidar for its robotaxis</a>. However, Mobileye revealed more about the lidar SoC that it says will be ready for passenger vehicles by 2025. Shashua nor Weast would say if it planned to end its partnership with Luminar once its own lidar SoC is ready for the market.</p>
<p>The lidar, which will use Intel’s specialized silicon photonics fab, is notable because Mobileye is known for its camera-based technology. And yet it&#8217;s not backing away from that camera-first approach. Shashua explained Mobileye believes the best technological and business approach is to develop a camera-first system and use the lidar and radar as add-ons for redundancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that you have this camera subsystem,&#8221; Shashua said. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s camera based, it&#8217;s at a consumer price level. So now you have scalable thinking. And this scalable thinking is really the cure for sustaining for a long time until level four becomes ubiquitous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shashua pointed to its long-term high-volume agreement for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/mobileye-signs-driver-assistance-deal-with-geely-one-of-chinas-largest-privately-held-auto-makers/">advanced driver-assistance systems</a> with Geely Auto as an example of how a camera-first approach could later be adapted. The lidar and radar can be added on to support greater automation capabilities once the market is ready.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the vaccination campaign to counter COVID-19 gets underway (albeit with a rocky start), a number of companies are attempting to support its rollout in a variety of ways.<a href="https://healthvana.com"> Healthvana</a>, a health tech startup that began with a specific focus on providing patient information digitally for individuals living with HIV, is helping Los Angeles County roll out mobile vaccination records for COVID-19 using Apple&#8217;s Wallet technology. A cursory appraisal of the implementation of this tech might lead one to believe it&#8217;s about providing individuals with easy proof of vaccination &#8212; but the tech, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/healthvana" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="healthvana">Healthvana, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are focused on informing individuals to ensure they participate in their own healthcare programs, not providing an immunity pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally consider most of healthcare to look and feel like Windows 95,&#8221; Healthvana CEO and founder Ramin Bastani said. &#8220;We look and feel like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Why is that important? Because patients can engage in things they understand, it&#8217;s easier for them to communicate in the way they&#8217;re used to communicating, and that ends up leading them to better health outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bastani points out that they began the company by focusing this approach to patient education and communication on HIV, and demonstrated that using their software led to patients being 7.4 times more likely to show up for their next follow-up appointment versus patients who received follow-up information and appointment notices via traditional methods. The company has built their tooling and their approach around not only producing better health for individuals, but also on reducing costs for healthcare providers by eliminating the need for a lot of the work that goes into clearing up misunderstandings, and essentially hounding patients to follow-up, which can significantly dig into clinician and care staff hours.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Carbon Health raises $100 million with plans to expand pop-up clinics ahead of COVID-19 vaccination programs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/carbon-health-raises-100-million-with-plans-to-expand-pop-up-clinics-ahead-of-covid-19-vaccination-programs/embed/#?secret=AF84ElmkMQ" data-secret="AF84ElmkMQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re actually also reducing the cost to healthcare providers, because you don&#8217;t have 1,000 people calling you asking what are their results, and saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand, I can&#8217;t log in, I don&#8217;t know what it means to be SARS nonreactive,&#8217; or all those things we address through simplicity,&#8221; Bastani said. &#8220;That&#8217;s made a huge difference. Overall, I think the key to all healthcare is going to be to be able to get patients to pay attention, and take action to things around their health.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the goal of Healthvana&#8217;s partnership with LA County on COVID-19 immunization records, too &#8212; taking vitally important action to ensure the successful rollout of its vaccination program. All approved COVID-19 vaccines to date require a two-course treatment, including one initial inoculation followed by a booster to be administered sometime later. Keeping LA county residents informed about their COVID-19 inoculation, and when they&#8217;re due for a second dose, is the primary purpose of the partnership, and benefits from Healthvana&#8217;s experience in improving patient follow-up activities. But the app is also providing users with information about COVID-19 care, and, most usefully, prevention and ways to slow the spread.</p>
<p>While Bastani stresses that Healthvana is, in the end, just &#8220;the last mile&#8221; for message delivery, and that there are many other layers involved in determining the right steps for proper care and prevention, the way in which they provide actionable info has already proven a big boon to one key measure: contact tracing. In select municipalities, Healthvana will also prompt users who&#8217;ve tested positive to anonymously notify close contacts directly from their device, which will provide those individuals with both free testing options and information resources.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple and Google release sample code, UI and detailed policies for COVID-19 exposure-notification apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/apple-and-google-release-sample-code-and-detailed-policies-for-covid-19-exposure-notification-apps/embed/#?secret=F19rh3oxoM" data-secret="F19rh3oxoM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Just us doing this in the greater Los Angeles area for less than two months, 12,000+ people have been notified that they&#8217;ve been exposed,&#8221; Bastani said. &#8220;Each of them likely lives with other people and families &#8212; this is how you can help slow the spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrast that with the relatively slow uptake of the exposure notification tools built into iOS and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> devices via recent software updates provided by Google and Apple working in a rare collaboration. While the technology that underlies it is sound, and focused on user privacy, its usage numbers thus far are far from earthshaking; only 388 people have sent alerts through Virginia&#8217;s app-based on the exposure notification framework in three months since its launch, for instance.</p>
<p>Healthvana&#8217;s focus on timely and relevant delivery of information, offered to users in ways they&#8217;re mostly likely to understand and engage with, is already showing its ability to have an impact on COVID-19 and its community transmission. The startup is already in talks to launch similar programs elsewhere in the country, and that could help improve national vaccination outcomes, and how people handle COVID-19 once they have it, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alternative social media apps, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sgrouples" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sgrouples">MeWe, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech, are topping the app stores following Trump&#8217;s ban from mainstream social platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">Twitter</a> and the more recent removal of conservative social app Parler from both the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google Play</a>. In the days since the Parler ban, &#8220;free speech&#8221;-favoring social networks are seeing notable numbers of new downloads at a quick pace, data shows.</p>
<p>Next-generation social network MeWe, founded in May 2012, is one of those that&#8217;s seeing the largest bump in new installs.</p>
<p>The app has been steadily growing in the days since the U.S. presidential election and the related increases in moderation of misinformation by larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Mainstream social networks enforced their policies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">even created new ones</a> to moderate content shared by Trump and his allies &#8212; including their baseless claims of election fraud that have not be substantiated by U.S. courts, despite dozens of lawsuits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To date, MeWe has seen over 16 million global lifetime installs, according to data from app intelligence firm <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a>. However, since Wednesday of last week, the app has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times worldwide. A majority of those new downloads are coming from U.S. users, who accounted for nearly 143,000 installs.</p>
<p>Largely, those users came to MeWe following <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ban from app stores. Apple gave Parler the boot late on Saturday, and MeWe popped in the charts as a result. Saturday through Sunday alone, MeWe gained 110,200+ new installs in the U.S.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ixoz1K4KLY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/embed/#?secret=ixoz1K4KLY" data-secret="ixoz1K4KLY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company told us it has seen 1 million new members sign up in the last 72 hours and now adds over 20,000 new members per hour.</p>
<p>Because app stores&#8217; Top Charts reflect not just total downloads but also the velocity of those new installs, MeWe has gained a position in the top 10 very quickly due to recent trends.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, MeWe ranked No. 7 in the U.S. App Store&#8217;s Top Overall free charts. It&#8217;s already moving up today.</p>
<p>This is remarkable growth for the alternative social app, given that as recently as October the app was not ranked on the App Store&#8217;s Top Charts at all. (Being unranked means that the app is so far down on the charts, it&#8217;s lower than rank No. 1,500 &#8212; so its rank is basically untrackable.) MeWe did, however, chart in the Social Networking category at some points during this time.</p>

<p>Another app benefitting from recent events, including the Parler ban, is the relative newcomer <a href="https://www.clouthub.com/home">CloutHub</a>.</p>
<p>The app was launched in January 2019 and claims to be a social network for &#8220;social, civic, and political networking&#8221; with a free speech angle. Its website says it wants to give &#8220;everyone a platform to have their voice heard.&#8221;</p>

(CloutHub may be struggling with the surge of new users, as we found sign-ups and logins are often timing out.) The app as of now ranks No. 11 on the U.S. App Store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094685" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094685" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2094685 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094685" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Store screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Two other apps that have moved into the top charts are cases of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://mashable.com/article/confused-and-looking-for-parler-parlor-app-wins/">Mashable recently reported</a>, an app called &#8220;Parlor&#8221; is being mistaken for the now-banned &#8220;Parler&#8221; app. Its report cited Sensor Tower data that said &#8220;Parlor&#8221; has seen as many as 40,000 downloads in December alone.</p>
<p>Apptopia says the social chat app, founded in May 2011, has seen 8.6 million lifetime global installs. But from Wednesday through Sunday, it gained 115,846 new users &#8212; many who were likely looking for &#8220;Parler.&#8221; Of those, 99,220+ arrived on either Saturday or Sunday, just as the Parler ban was beginning to roll out. Even though Apple didn&#8217;t take action on Parler until later on Saturday, users may have come across &#8220;Parlor&#8221; by searching for it by this alternative spelling.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, &#8220;Parlor&#8221; became the No. 4 Top App Overall on iOS in the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an app called &#8220;Gab News&#8221; &#8212; which is actually just a local news app for the Georgetown area &#8212; is also gaining ground. This is because it&#8217;s mistaken for the long since banned app &#8220;Gab,&#8221; which ex-Parler users are suggesting as an alternative. Apple had declined to host Gab back in 2016, citing its pornographic content and <a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html">later, due to its policies against hosting apps that include hate speech</a>. Though Gab was able to launch on Google Play in 2017, the app was quickly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-app-store-gab-ban-hate-speech-2017-8">removed</a> from there as well, also for hate speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gab News,&#8221; however, is currently ranking No. 44 on the App Store&#8217;s Top Free Apps Chart in the U.S., as of the time of writing. (Download data was not immediately available.)</p>
<p>Then there is Rumble, a <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90574842/what-is-rumble-meet-the-video-platform-trumps-supporters-are-flocking-to">conservative alternative</a> to YouTube. The app has gained 2.4 million total global installs since its January 2020 launch, per Apptopia&#8217;s estimates. Since Wednesday, that included 91,916 new downloads, 73,700+ of which were in the U.S. It has also climbed to No. 78 on the U.S. App Store, up from No. 1,484 on December 19, 2020.</p>
<p>The Parler ban is not the only thing triggering these shifts, to be clear.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094695" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094695" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094695 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg 2758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1187 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-1.44.42-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094695" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Google Play screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a general backlash underway against big tech, which many on both sides feel has become too powerful.</p>
<p>Governments have been examining the business models and practices of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook over the past year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">in markets around the world</a> with an eye on antitrust action. Facebook and Google are also being scrutinized by users for their privacy practices &#8212; especially as Apple is now forcing companies to add privacy labels to all apps that disclose what they do with user data.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="S2FrBFAIQJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/">From the US to China, Korea, India and Europe, antitrust action against tech is gaining serious momentum</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From the US to China, Korea, India and Europe, antitrust action against tech is gaining serious momentum&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/global-antitrust-gaining-serious-momentum/embed/#?secret=S2FrBFAIQJ" data-secret="S2FrBFAIQJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As a result, some people were turning to alternative networking apps not just because they&#8217;re conservative, but because they value privacy. As a result, encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram are booming in recent days, as is the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, a Google.com alternative.</p>
<p>These apps have also picked up steam over the past week. Signal is now No. 1 on the U.S. App Store, Telegram is No. 2 and DuckDuckGo is No. 8. This is rapid growth. Around mid-October 2020, these apps were ranked No. 618, 79, and 715, respectively, Apptopia says. DuckDuckGo also told us it&#8217;s seen 62% year-over-year growth between 2019 and 2020 and has become the No. 2 search engine in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s also worth noting that some users may be seeking private messaging platforms in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riots, now that the FBI has begun to arrest insurgents. Signal has gained nearly 325,000 new installs since Thursday and Telegram gained 330,600+, for example.</p>
<p>This rapid shift to alternative social and messaging networks is an indication of how difficult it may be in the weeks ahead for app stores to enforce their policies. Though the platforms typically crack down on apps hosting hate speech and those allowing incitement of violence, they tend to move more slowly than the crowd downloading the next alternative app.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the apps that become popular may struggle with moderation. We&#8217;ve already come across examples of both extreme hate speech and calls for assassination on MeWe, for instance, even though the company&#8217;s public statements say it investigates and removes this sort of content. (MeWe has been asked to comment.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the future for these free speech, alternative apps may hold, as platform providers such as Amazon (AWS) are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">now also declining to host them</a>, and payment providers, like Stripe, which just <a href="https://apptopia.com/">cut ties with the Trump campaign</a>, may decline to process future online payments. That could leave the networks to ultimately scramble for private funding to build their own infrastructure and stay afloat, as well as to seek out alternative distribution systems, like the web or even sideloading, to reach their users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has sued <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> after the beleaguered conservative social media site was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">expelled from AWS</a>, filing a fanciful complaint alleging the internet giant took it out for political reasons — and in an antitrust conspiracy to benefit Twitter. But its own allegations, including breach of contract, are belied by evidence they supply alongside the suit.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed today in the U.S. Western District Court, Parler complains that &#8220;AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus. It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon Web Services gives Parler 24-hour notice that it will suspend services to the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/embed/#?secret=DY5bmd3x6n" data-secret="DY5bmd3x6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Regarding the &#8220;political animus,&#8221; it is difficult to speak to Parler&#8217;s reasoning, since that argument is supported nowhere in the suit — it simply is never referred to again.</p>
<p>There is the suggestion that Amazon has shown more tolerance for offending content on Twitter than on Parler, but this isn&#8217;t well substantiated. For instance, the suit notes that &#8220;Hang Mike Pence&#8221; trended on Friday the 8th, without noting that much of this volume was, as any user of Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=hang%20mike%20pence">can see by searching</a>, people decrying this phrase as having been chanted by the rioters in the Capitol two days prior.</p>
<p>By way of contrast, one Parler post cited by Amazon says that &#8220;we need to start systematicly [sic] assasinating [sic] #liberal leaders, liberal activists, #blm leaders and supporters,&#8221; and so on. As TechCrunch has been monitoring Parler conversations, we can say that this is far from an isolated example of this rhetoric.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike Pence&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/embed/#?secret=wmYhvLWwM9" data-secret="wmYhvLWwM9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The antitrust argument suggests a conspiracy by Amazon to protect and advance the interests of Twitter. Specifically, the argument is that because Twitter is a major customer of AWS, and Parler is a threat to Twitter, Amazon wanted to take Parler out of the picture.</p>
<blockquote><p>Given the context of Parler’s looming threat to Twitter and the fact that the Twitter ban might not long muzzle the President if he switched to Parler, potentially bringing tens of millions of followers with him, AWS moved to shut down Parler.</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is not convincing for several reasons, but the most obvious one is that Parler was at the time also an AWS customer. If people are going from one customer to another, why would Amazon care at all, let alone enough to interfere to the point of legal and ethical dubiety?</p>
<p>The lawsuit also accuses Amazon of leaking the email communicating Parler&#8217;s imminent suspension to reporters before it was sent to administrators at the site. (It also says that Amazon &#8220;sought to defame&#8221; Parler, though defamation is not part of the legal complaint. Parler seems to be using this term rather loosely.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J0I0JnUFUx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">The deplatforming of President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The deplatforming of President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/embed/#?secret=J0I0JnUFUx" data-secret="J0I0JnUFUx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lastly Parler says Amazon is in breach of contract, having not given the 30 days warning stipulated in the terms of service. The exception is if a &#8220;material breach remains uncured for a period of 30 days&#8221; after notice. As Parler explains it:</p>
<blockquote><p>On January 8, 2021, AWS brought concerns to Parler about user content that encouraged violence. Parler addressed them, and then AWS said it was “okay” with Parler.</p>
<p>The next day, January 9, 2021, AWS brought more “bad” content to Parler and Parler took down all of that content by the evening.</p>
<p>Thus, there was no uncured material breach of the Agreement for 30 days, as required for termination.</p></blockquote>
<p>But in the email attached as evidence to the lawsuit — literally exhibit A — Amazon makes it clear the issues have been ongoing for longer than that (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Over the past several weeks</strong>, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence&#8230; You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency&#8230; It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">the rest of the letter here</a>, but it&#8217;s obvious that Amazon is not simply saying that a few days of violations are the cause of Parler&#8217;s being kicked off the service.</p>
<p>Parler asks a judge for a Temporary Restraining Order that would restore its access to AWS while the rest of the case is argued, and for damages to be specified at trial.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Amazon has provided the following statement regarding the lawsuit:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no merit to these claims. AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.</p></blockquote>
