We&#8217;re officially nearing the end of the year, and what a year it&#8217;s been. Despite the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think it&#8217;s pretty safe to say that this has been a watershed 365 days for the space industry.

<h2>Astra is heading to Cape Canaveral</h2>
<p>Fresh on the heels of its first successful launch to orbit, space startup Astra is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/astra-will-launch-a-rocket-from-cape-canaveral-in-florida-for-the-first-time-in-january/">heading to the Space Coast</a>. The company said it would carry CubeSats for NASA for its first mission to take place outside of Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska on Kodiak Island. The launch, which is scheduled for January, will fly as part of a Venture Class Launch Services program contract Astra won last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244782" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a big win for the company. Multiple launch locations means Astra can finally demonstrate one of its key value propositions: that its on-site launch operations are agile, lightweight and can be effectively deployed from a number of sites. The Florida location will also give the company access to more orbits &#8212; which means being able to serve even more customers.</p>

<h2>Ursa Major wants to disrupt the vertically integrated rocket launch sector</h2>
<p>Ursa Major is scaling up its ambitions to disrupt the vertically integrated launch sector with a fresh round of funding. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/ursa-major-raises-85m-to-disrupt-the-vertically-integrated-launch-sector/">an $85 million Series C</a> led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, as well as participation from XN, Alsop Louie, Alpha Edison, Dolby Family Ventures, KCK, Space Capital, Explorer 1, Harpoon Ventures and others.</p>
<p>The startup has already put its first product into production, a 5,000-pound thrust liquid oxygen and kerosene engine called Hadley, and it&#8217;s at work on the Ripley, the next-gen engine that’s 10 times more powerful than Hadley, with a 50,000-pound thrust.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Joe Laurienti likened Ursa Major to a company like Intel, which is constantly innovating more powerful processors and outsourcing that expertise to brands like Dell and Lenovo. “We really like the notion that we are a technology development company, and the companies that are flying rockets today should not be flying the same engine that they architected for their rocket 10 years ago. That’s the paradigm we see in vertical integration.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, enterprise software companies have grown faster, and more valuable, than ever. Still, most startups never reach that kind of escape velocity, with many of plodding along while their venture backers &#8212; who are returning to market more quickly and raising bigger funds &#8212; move on to newer, shinier objects.</p>
<p>The end result is many thousands of stranded companies with a limited number of options. One of these is to simply shut down. Another option for some companies is buy back their shares. A third option for some is sell to a private equity firm that is interested in potentially rolling up sub-scale properties or bolting a startup onto another asset. There is so much opportunity for PE firms, in fact, that according to the Financial Times, the software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo plans to raise up to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/456f2fd7-f868-4ea6-abd7-fce34e783333">$35 billion </a>for its next fund.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, newer players are also getting in on the action. Among them is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.camber.io/">Camber Partners</a>, a San Francisco-based growth equity firm founded last year by investor Scott Irwin, long of the venture firm Rembrandt Venture Partners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246838" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Camber is today taking the wraps off a $100 million debut fund that promises to either buy &#8212; or buy a majority stake in &#8212; stranded SaaS companies, reinvigorate them with its own in-house data science technology, then sell them within what would ideally be around five years or less.</p>
<p>Irwin says he founded Camber Partners largely out of aggravation with the current venture environment, which requires that startups scale up unnaturally fast in order for VCs to return the massive amounts of capital they&#8217;ve been raising in recent years.</p>
<p>He says he grew tired of &#8220;some of those adverse incentives&#8221; involved. As he puts it, &#8220;100% growth isn&#8217;t interesting; it&#8217;s gotta be 200%. Earning $100,000 a month isn&#8217;t interesting; it has to be a million. A good solid management team that&#8217;s going to learn over time and grow the business isn&#8217;t interesting. It&#8217;s instead, &#8216;How do we jump ahead faster and hire more experienced people?'&#8221;</p>
<p>VCs have seen some &#8220;awesome successes because of the model but &#8220;the failure rate also way higher.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for Irwin&#8217;s alternative, he says that helped by cofounder and serial operator Jason Hable, along with Scott Ernst, Camber&#8217;s VP of data and engineer, the young outfit is positioned with a data platformcalled Gemini to isolate companies across the globe with a specific profile, then help fuel their growth. Its targets should make a &#8220;well-loved product&#8221; that enjoys &#8220;strong, organic inbound&#8221; interest from potential customers; they should be generating between $3 million and $10 million in annual recurring revenue; and they be looking to overcome an &#8220;under-optimized go-to-market&#8221; strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel like you haven&#8217;t fully realized the growth potential of the business, that&#8217;s a really good fit,&#8221; says Irwin.</p>
<p>Already Camber has backed two companies: Scout APM and SE Ranking. It spent $8 million to pick up a majority interest in Scout, which makes application performance software, along with a related business called ExceptionTrap.</p>
<p>It has not disclosed terms of its deal with SE Ranking, which makes SEO software, but Irwin says a typical investment will be &#8220;$10 million to $25 million checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altogether, Camber Partners expects to invest this first fund in six to seven companies.</p>
<p>As for exits, Irwin says he expects that they will look like typical SaaS exits, including sales (&#8220;full or partial&#8221;) to financial sponsors like Thoma Bravo or another active software investor, Vista Equity Partners. In some cases, if the stars align, he hopes initial public offerings will be in the cards.</p>
<p>Either way, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need 50 times our return,&#8221; says Irwin. &#8220;We try to get very aligned with a team that a $200 million exit can be life changing and a strong return for everyone involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always an easy number to sell in today&#8217;s go-go market.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good thing about private equity interest in the space is that if investors want to accept it [a buyout proposal] and the management team wants to keep going, you can work that out,&#8221; says Irwin. &#8220;The challenge is when the investors are like, &#8216;Oh, yeah, $200 million just doesn&#8217;t move the needle for us. We&#8217;re not willing to accept that. You need to turn that down and go for a billion-dollar exit,&#8217; and then it turns out it&#8217;s a wipeout.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, December 13! The theme of today is crypto, or web3 if you prefer that rebranding. Why? Because it turns out that an NFT project is making a game, a new startup wants to bring crypto and no-code together and there are several other bits of web3 startup news on our pages today.</p>
<p>Yes, we also have our normal run of funding rounds, unicorn exits and the like. But, strap in for some token talk! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246819" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">Chinese AI IPO on hold:</a> </strong>The SenseTime IPO was set to raise around $767 million in a Hong Kong listing. However, after finding itself on an American technology blacklist as of Friday, the IPO is on hold. As Didi looks to delist from the American markets, seeing such a high-profile Hong Kong debut on hold is not a great look for Chinese tech liquidity.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/bored-apes-shoots-for-the-moon/"><strong>Bored Ape Yacht Club game?</strong></a> If you aren’t a fan of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series — I am not, for what it’s worth — you may not be hype to hear it, but there’s a game coming from the image collection. If this is a hit, expect many games to be built atop other NFT IP. Quickly, I wonder what the market size is for this game, given that there are only 10,000 images in the series.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">UK taking look at Microsoft-Nuance deal:</a></strong> A $19.7 billion deal between Microsoft and “speech-to-text specialist Nuance,” as TechCrunch put it, has picked up regulatory scrutiny by a U.K. watchdog. This is the prelude to an investigation, it appears, but the fact that Microsoft is even getting a second look could chill other large buys by the megacorps of the technology world.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>A few themes are obvious today, including the startup exit market and crypto. We’ll take those on first, and then close with the rest of the startup news of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Exits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/what-2021s-ipo-pops-tell-us-about-future-flotations-and-spacs/">So much for that IPO pop:</a> </strong>A number of 2020 and 2021 IPOs had super strong first-day performances and early trading gains. This led to much complaining that tech offerings were being mispriced on purpose, to the benefit of banking customers. Well, we took a look back, and the numbers with a little time are far less clear than they once seemed.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/walmart-supported-symbotic-set-to-go-public-via-softbank-spac/"><strong>Robot company Symbotics to go public via SPAC:</strong></a> After securing greater commitment from huge American retailer Walmart, Symbotics has decided to pursue a public listing via a SPAC, or blank-check company. Notably the deal will see the robot firm link with Softbank Investment Advisers’ SVF Investment Corp. 3.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/harley-davidsons-ev-motorcycle-unit-livewire-to-go-public-via-spac/"><strong>E-motorcycle company LiveWire to go public via a SPAC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Have you ever heard the pneumonia-rattle of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle? Well, it turns out that the company <em>also</em> makes electric bikes. Who knew! The deal, per TechCrunch, will allow Harley to hold onto a good stake in the company while also injecting capital into the business. We’re just glad that the company is making bikes that don’t sound like their engines are filled with used dentures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And then, crypto: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/gary-vaynerchuk-mark-cuban-web3-thirdweb/"><strong>Thirdweb raises $5M for the union of crypto and no-code:</strong></a><strong> </strong>What Thirdweb is doing sounds cool. TechCrunch reports that the company’s software helps “developers build, launch and manage their web3 projects without writing any lines of code.” Anything that makes tech more generally accessible is fine by us, including, yes, crypto.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/justin-kan-debuts-fractal-a-solana-based-marketplace-for-gaming-nfts/"><strong>Fractal is an gaming NFT marketplace built on Sol</strong><strong>ana:</strong></a> Did that make sense to you? If not, let me help. Fractal is a company that is building a market to sell gaming-related non-fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain, which rivals Ethereum and Bitcoin. How does gaming come into the speculative world of NFTs? Well, there are now play-to-earn games out there, where players are rewarded with NFTs instead of, say, internet points. So you can trade those on Fractal, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/crypto-giant-dapper-labs-takes-its-next-shot-with-genies-nft-platform-the-warehouse/"><strong>NBA Top Shot takes another shot:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Dapper Labs became known as the team behind the NBA Top Shot NFT series that was hot a while back. Now the company — worth some $7.6 billion — is back with its next product called The Warehouse. I can’t really improve on what our own Lucas Matney wrote, so here it is: The Warehouse is “an ambitious NFT storefront that the startups hope will serve as a hub for web3 digital identity, allowing users to create animated avatars and outfit them with crypto accessories.” As with all crypto projects, I have no idea if this is going to be a hit or a flop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The rest of it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/former-twitter-india-head-leaving-firm-to-start-an-edtech/"><strong>Prior head of Twitter India is starting an edtech startup:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Twitter and India get along about as well as any authoritarian government does with the social network. But now the company’s former head in the country, Manish Maheshwari, is “leaving the firm to launch an edtech startup, according to nine people familiar with the matter.” Something to keep an eye on.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/snaplogic-raises-165m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-help-enterprises-integrate-and-automate-their-disparate-apps-and-data/"><strong>SnapLogic now worth $1B:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The NFT world may get more headlines than enterprise software lately, but that hasn’t stopped the more staid parts of startupland from still doing business. SnapLogic is indicative of that fact, raising $165 million at a new, higher valuation. The new unicorn helps companies bringing their work into the digital realm connect their various data sources and workflows.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/ex-snap-employees-raise-4m-for-conversational-commerce-startup-whym/"><strong>Weird startup names are still here:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Say hello to Whym, founded by ex-Snap employees. The startup is working on mobile e-commerce, a part of the larger digital purchasing world that could still use some work. I say that as someone who, at times, buys things on his phone and has dealt with all the fun that it entails. Whym just raised $4.3 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/notus-wants-to-suggest-the-best-ways-to-have-influence-and-then-scale-it/"><strong>Notus wants to help you find the right influencer for your brand:</strong></a> The world of influencer marketing has become mature enough that finding one’s next in-market avatar is now a business. Notus has raised $1.25 million to build a software service to help brands of all sorts find whom they should hire to rep their stuff. Neat!</li>

<p>It&#8217;s notoriously difficult for software to mimic human conversation. Many chatbots are so inept, it makes one long for the days of <em>press 0 for an operator</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though chatbots are largely meant to handle simple customer service tasks, there is an opportunity to scale both customer service and sales messaging,&#8221; writes Raghu Ravinutala, CEO and co-founder of Yellow.ai, a conversational CX platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nike is taking a plunge deeper into the world of crypto collectibles, announcing that they&#8217;re acquiring the NFT studio RTFKT (pronounced &#8220;artifact&#8221;).</p>
<p>The acquisition announcement comes at an opportune time for the studio; RTFKT is currently behind one of the most talked-about NFT project drops of the month &#8212; a sweeping avatar partnership with artist Takashi Murakami called CloneX. Since its initial drop less than three weeks ago, the project has already seen nearly $65 million in transaction volume according to crypto tracker <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/rtfkt-clonex-mintvial/sales/summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoSlam</a>.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The startup raised an $8 million seed round back in May led by Andreessen Horowitz that valued the company at $33.3 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“This is a unique opportunity to build the RTFKT brand and we are excited to benefit from Nike’s foundational strength and expertise to build the communities we love,” RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Adidas announced a partnership with NFT project Bored Apes Yacht Club.</p>
<p>In addition to building out its own NFT drops, RTFKT had collaborated with other crypto creators to design items like physical shoes that utilized imagery in other NFT projects, including CryptoPunks and Bored Apes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A women-led startup called <a href="https://joinhoneycomb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honeycomb</a> is launching its private social app for families, backed by $4 million in seed funding led by Peter Boyce at Stellation Capital. Now out of private beta, the app offers families a way to curate and share their favorite moments and memories via their smartphone as an alternative to using a more public social media platform, like Facebook, or group texting, where photos and videos can be easily lost.</p>
<p>Of note, Honeycomb is the first startup Boyce is backing with his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/peter-boyce-stellation-capital/">new firm, Stellation Capital,</a> founded this year after he left General Catalyst. Other participants in the round include <a href="https://www.dcm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DCM</a> (Kyle Lui), <a href="https://www.blingcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bling Capital</a> (Ben Ling) and <a href="https://precursorvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Precursor Ventures</a> (Charles Hudson), as well as angels including Ancestry CEO Deborah Liu, Giphy founder Alex Chung and Twitter VP of Engineering Nick Caldwell, formerly of Reddit.</p>
<p>Honeycomb itself was co-founded by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelialin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amelia Lin</a>, previously of Udacity and Optimizely, and former Instagram product manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolewee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicole Wee</a>. The co-founders had been inspired to create an app that would connect families through private social networking, but had originally approached this with a different product, called Saga. Their first app was a social audio experience that let families <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/turn-grandmas-memories-into-a-podcast-with-the-saga-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capture and record their life stories</a> &#8212; like tales about how the grandparents first met, for example, or even just birthday wishes for a child that can be listened to later, as a sort of audio diary.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But while that app received <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnscottlewinski/2020/05/17/new-saga-app-lets-users-record-their-covid-18-tales-for-future-use/?sh=60a2b2d968ae">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/california-live/new-holiday-tech-toys-for-all-ages/2482335/">of</a> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/turn-grandmas-memories-into-a-podcast-with-the-saga-app/">early</a> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/11/24/11-tech-tools-to-bring-joy-2020-holidays/6386052002/">press</a>, it wasn&#8217;t necessarily what families wanted. Instead, the team kept hearing from early adopters how they wanted to store their photos and videos, too, not just audio recordings. So the team pivoted and <a href="https://medium.com/joinhoneycomb/introducing-honeycomb-94395b5950f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded their app as Honeycomb</a> this past fall.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246837" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246837" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-7.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p>
<p>The new experience launched into private beta testing in September, offering a way for families to save their favorite photos and videos, which are combined with text and turned into a digital story of sorts. The experience as it stands today isn&#8217;t necessarily that much more robust compared with a group chat over iMessage, for instance, but it does offer an easy way to go back to revisit older shares which can be difficult to do when using text messaging. It also lets users set a reminder so they&#8217;ll remember to curate their favorite memories from the day &#8212; a feature that&#8217;s probably best for new parents who rapidly fill their phones with dozens of new photos daily as their baby hits new milestones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246835" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246835" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246835" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-5.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246835" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We help it become a really easy daily ritual of sorting through the best memories of the day,&#8221; explains Lin. &#8220;You pick your favorites and they automatically get compiled into this story that&#8217;s not only shared with your family, but also saved in this collection forever,&#8221; she says. However, she notes, the experience is not meant to replace users&#8217; existing photo services, like Google Photos, Apple&#8217;s Photos app or Dropbox, where people back up and save all their content &#8212; including duplicate photos and those that didn&#8217;t quite turn out well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think of that as being the curated, beautiful place that I interact with my family,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;And then [users may have] Facebook and Instagram, but that feels really public to put my baby photos out on.&#8221; Honeycomb, by comparison, is private by default.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only your family gets to choose who is in here, and I do think that is a pretty different philosophical approach,&#8221; says Lin. Plus, she notes, &#8220;we don&#8217;t sell your photos or your data to third parties.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honeycomb is also different from mainstream social apps because it will be a subscription-based service, not one that&#8217;s monetized through advertising. For now, however, the app is free as the startup gets the new app off the ground.</p>
<p>The company is working to address how to include the family&#8217;s elder users into the platform, which may include adding support for exporting its content to be shared elsewhere. But the team thinks that the draw of new baby and kid photos may be the push grandma or grandpa needs to figure out how to put the app on their phone &#8212; even if they&#8217;re not technically savvy.</p>
<p>After users download Honeycomb they&#8217;ll first gain access to a basic set of features. But soon, they&#8217;ll be opted into the new beta, which includes a more engaging story format for sharing memories with family and friends. (This opt-in won&#8217;t happen immediately, but is now rolling out, the company clarifies.)</p>
<p>The idea to return to human curation, not AI, to help users find their best photos and videos is certainly a different idea these days. But whether or not people want to sort through their daily snaps &#8212; especially after that &#8220;new baby&#8221; buzz wears off &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246832" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246832" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2246832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-5-inch-Display-2.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Honeycomb</p></div></p>
<p>Besides, AI can be useful. (Presumably, a smart AI would have known to feature a photo of a person, not a toy, as the cover photo after I made a birthday photo album in the app). AI can also help users automatically sort through photos by discarding those with poor lighting or bad exposure.</p>
<p>What users don&#8217;t want, generally, is having an AI have the final say on their &#8220;best&#8221; photos or putting together albums without any context about their lives and what they think is important. And they don&#8217;t want AI reminding them through automated &#8220;memories&#8221; of times they&#8217;d rather forget.</p>
<p>The best solution, however, may be a balance between AI and manual curation, but done in a private, social environment.</p>
<p>Because Honeycomb is effectively a new app, the startup isn&#8217;t sharing user figures. But Lin notes that engagement tripled since pivoting from Saga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honeycomb is a truly mission-driven company, using technology to advance one of our most basic and long-standing human desires: to archive and share our family’s memories,&#8221; said Stellation&#8217;s Peter Boyce about his investment in the startup. &#8220;Honeycomb has the potential to bring the family album into the 21st century. It’s rare to find such a large problem space that is ripe for a step-function change in innovation. Families are ready for the next evolution of social apps, one that is meant to be personal and intimate, and this team is building it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Honeycomb, now a team of seven, is planning to use the new funds for hiring, including engineers, who will work in-person from its San Mateo office space. It expects to add around 10 people.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Climate change is the issue of our time. From policymakers to the individual, every one of us has a responsibility to do our part to ensure that sustainability and green practices are implemented throughout society.</p>
<p>Indeed, governments across the world, from the U.S. to China, are increasingly taking a proactive stance on climate change, with<a href="https://ukcop26.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> COP26</a>, the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, serving as a driving impetus toward the goals of the<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement#:~:text=The%20Paris%20Agreement%20is%20a,compared%20to%20pre%2Dindustrial%20levels." target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Paris Agreement</a> in inspiring climate action.</p>
<p>Corporations are also stepping forward to take greater responsibility, with many investors no longer considering financial performance alone a sufficient measure of success — ESG measures, i.e., negative externalities, are increasingly taken into account to determine the true value of business activity for society.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246517" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In this context, the process of revitalizing our financial infrastructure is increasingly under the spotlight. How well do Bitcoin and other digital assets meet ESG criteria? This question has become ever more important as crypto adoption reaches wider audiences. Multiple<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/22/valkyrie-bitcoin-futures-etf-starts-trading-joining-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Bitcoin futures ETFs have now been approved</a> and are trading in the U.S., while institutional adoption is also reaching new highs, with many of the world’s largest financial institutions, including<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/stanchart-unit-to-launch-cryptocurrency-trading-platform.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Standard Chartered</a>,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/state-street-is-creating-a-dedicated-cryptocurrency-division.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> State Street</a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d90ed3bf-2c8d-46c9-98b7-67859f6598e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citibank</a> quietly building capabilities in the space.</p>
<p>Growing regulatory clarity is also enabling a broader range of participants globally to accelerate their strategies for digital assets. The EU’s comprehensive <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-crypto-assets-1">Market in Crypto-assets (MiCA) framework</a> continues to move through the legislative process in the European Parliament. While in the U.S., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3HRyPxXtoo&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission</a> has also signaled its intent to clarify a framework for stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<p>For digital assets to truly cement their place in the mainstream and the portfolios of investors across the globe, they must be subject to the same rigorous ESG standards that every government and corporation should now address. Significantly, the industry has gradually come to terms with this need and has ramped up a process of environmental self-regulation in response to rising adoption.</p>
<p>Organizations such as the <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Mining Council</a> are working to increase transparency in the industry through higher reporting standards. Many crypto-native organizations are also joining the <a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Crypto Climate Accord</a>, committing to achieve net-zero emissions from electricity consumption associated with crypto-related operations by 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, for all this activity, perhaps the single greatest contribution to the energy efficiency of digital assets has been a decision entirely out of the control of the industry. In May, China’s State Council banned cryptocurrency mining and trading. Previously the global stronghold for crypto mining activity, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/50acdea5-cad1-4f39-8e6a-9be7ab78485d">with 44% of the global share of Bitcoin mining hashrate</a>, the decision prompted an exodus of miners to other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The move has been a significant one for the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin mining industry, moving away from the coal-heavy energy production of the Chinese economy to more renewable forms of energy in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>North America has been the big beneficiary of this move, with the U.S. share of mining hashrate increasing from <a href="https://cbeci.org/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17% in April to 35% in August</a>. With the addition of a 9.5% mining hashrate in Canada, North America now dominates the global mining hashrate with close to 50% of the global supply.</p>
<p>While energy production in the U.S. is diverse across states, the shift has been a significant boon to the sustainability of Bitcoin mining. The U.S. is replete with renewable energy sources; add to the mix the fact that large mining companies are essentially competing in a low-margin industry, where the primary variable cost is energy, and the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/us-beats-china-as-the-number-one-destination-for-bitcoin-miners.html">incentive is to migrate to the cheapest sources of power &#8212; which are largely renewable</a>.</p>
<p>For example, New York &#8212; one of the states with the largest share of Bitcoin hashrate, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/09/war-to-attract-bitcoin-miners-pits-texas-against-new-york-kentucky.html">according to data from Foundry USA</a> &#8212; draws a third of its in-state energy generation from renewable sources. Texas, another significant state for Bitcoin mining hashrate, is rapidly growing its share of renewable energy production, with <a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2020/august/ercot.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20% of its power</a> coming from wind in 2019.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bitcoin mining industry has a unique feature set that actually incentivizes the use of trapped sources of renewable energy that are not yet connected to the national grid. By acting as a means of monetizing the production of renewable energy, mining can thus further accelerate the building out of renewable energy capabilities.</p>
<p>This shift toward renewable energy sources has already begun to demonstrate to critics that Bitcoin and the wider digital asset industry can succeed with an ethos of sustainability. Such a transition will not be an instantaneous one, and it will take time for large mining operations to reestablish themselves in new jurisdictions. However, this transition is firmly underway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to digital asset service providers to demonstrate the value that crypto provides is worth its consumption of energy. Significant progress has been made this year alone in reducing the carbon footprint of digital assets, and as crypto continues its sustainability journey, corporate and institutional adoption will follow suit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whymwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whym</a>, a conversational commerce startup founded by former Snap employees, wants to make it easier for consumers to shop online via their mobile devices. Instead of filling out long checkout forms and entering in payment card details by hand, Whym&#8217;s solution offers a single-tap checkout experience where customers can pay via Apple Pay or Google Pay or even over a text message. The startup is now announcing $4.3 million in new seed funding, following its early traction with CPG, wellness and beauty brands.</p>
<p>The round was led by Deciens Capital and included participation from DNX Ventures, Reciprocal Ventures, Unusual Ventures, Chaos Ventures and Magic Fund, as well as small investments from Sequoia, Lightspeed and Canaan Partners. Whym also has angel investments from founders and other executives from Stripe, PayPal, Venmo, Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat, Uber, Airbnb, Red Bull and Spotify.</p>
<p>The startup itself was founded in 2017 by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellynyland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kelly Nyland</a> and COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rheneebartlett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhenee Bartlett</a>, both previously of Snap. Nyland had headed up the consumer products and marketing division of the company, where she created the go-to-market strategy for Snap&#8217;s Spectacles. Bartlett had served as the head of event marketing and partnerships for Spectacles. In addition, founding team member and Whym&#8217;s VP of Engineering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhornberger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Hornberger</a>, had worked at Snap after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/16/snapchat-emails-not-so-ephemeral/">acquired</a> his startup Scan, Inc., which formed the basis for Snapchat&#8217;s Snapcode.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246600" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2246753" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246753" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2246753" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/WHYM-Secure-Text-Checkout.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246753" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whym</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While at Snap, Nyland saw how the DM (direct messaging) screen drove Snapchat&#8217;s daily usage. She proposed that the company allow brands and consumers to communicate with each other directly through that part of the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized through that journey that messaging was going to become a really important part of social shopping in the future,&#8221; Nyland explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whym&#8217;s team realized that combining messaging and commerce into a new experience where transactions could take place over a text or even a DM thread could enable a new form of social shopping. Its first product, launched into beta in June 2018, offered brands a way to let their customers &#8220;reply to buy&#8221; over a text message.</p>
<p>In the years since, Whym has expanded to offer brands a micro-storefront solution that can be paired with their current texting campaigns, allowing customers to shop a product or small set of products and their variations &#8212; like colors or sizes, for example &#8212; then immediately check out. Brands can also promote their links in other places across social media and messaging apps, like &#8220;link in bio&#8221; solutions, swipe-ups (now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/instagram-rolls-out-the-ability-for-all-users-to-share-links-in-stories-via-link-stickers/">link stickers on Instagram</a>), messaging apps and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246746" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246746" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2246746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=768,640 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=680,567 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Customer-Setup.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whym</p></div></p>
<p>As a consumer, the solution is designed to be quicker and easier than clicking through to a traditional mobile website to check out. Instead, they&#8217;re sent to the micro-storefront to customize their cart, then can tap on Apple Pay or Google Pay to complete the sale. The company also still offers its original experience that lets customers check out over text, but will soon use consumers&#8217; mobile phone numbers in a new way, too. Starting next year, consumers will be able to enter their phone number to signal their interest in a product they may want to buy in the future, as an alternative to sending themselves a website link or taking a screenshot as many do today.</p>
<p>Over time, Whym will be able to offer consumers a universal cart where they can purchase items across brands. It will also enable brands to reach out to their customers again when it&#8217;s time to repurchase.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up and coming direct-to-consumer brands, beauty, wellness, and CPG are our main focus,&#8221; notes Nyland. &#8220;We focus on businesses that have a high repurchase cadence. What Whym can do is actually rebuild each of those customers&#8217; carts one-to-one and do a reply-to-buy repurchase experience for those brands,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So we can harness the power of text message on the backend to power repurchase experiences between brands and consumers automatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup today has a couple of hundred <a href="https://www.whymwallet.com/shopper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brands</a> using its service, and charges a 3% + 10¢ transaction fee on each order. Now that the company is scaling upmarket to brands between $50 million and $250 million in annual GMV (gross merchandise volume), it&#8217;s beginning to offer tiered pricing. But these rates aren&#8217;t yet publicized.</p>
<p>Brand integrations with Whym take around 10 minutes on average, via its self-serve platform. In addition, the startup has a sales team that can demo the product and walk clients through onboarding and strategy, and aid with the creation of their first campaigns.</p>
<p>The startup, a team of under 50, plans to use the funding to reach more brands and further develop its roadmap of product features, many of which have come from customer feedback. To date, Whym has raised a total of $7 million in funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things have been more fascinating and frustrating to witness in 2021 than the rise of million-dollar NFT profile pic projects. The collections of 10,000 procedurally generated JPGs earning market caps of hundreds of millions at the hands of seemingly naked speculation have bewildered skeptics and enriched acolytes.</p>
<p>The promise for most of these projects has that, given enough money and community support, a culture and brand can emerge from the ether. Such has been the pitch of Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC), which has become the break-out NFT project of the year as more users have raced to buy the pictures of monkeys and sent floor prices soaring to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Part of that value has been centered on the belief that BAYC can become a cultural touchstone, and the group took a big step toward that goal today, announcing that they&#8217;ve partnered with blockchain gaming unicorn Animoca Brands to release a Bored Apes-themed game next year.</p>
<p>The game has an admittedly steep challenge ahead of it, building a mainstream game around a community with a prohibitively expensive barrier to entry. Weighing the exclusivity of the core NFT project with the democratization of assets needed to build up a substantial user base is a balance that has yet to be achieved, or even attempted, at scale.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s press release announcing the title had scant details to share other than that the game will feature so-called &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; mechanics and is targeting a Q2 2022 release date. Yuga Labs, the developer behind BAYC, has previously detailed that they are working on a token tied to the project.</p>
<p>In October, Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands raised $65 million at a $2.2 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security teams around the globe are scrambling to fix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/apple-icloud-twitter-and-minecraft-vulnerable-to-ubiquitous-zero-day-exploit/">Log4Shell</a>, a critical security flaw in Log4j, an open source logging software that&#8217;s found practically everywhere from online games to enterprise software and cloud data centers. Its ubiquity has put the internet on high alert as attackers ramp up their efforts to target vulnerable systems.</p>
<p>Log4Shell is a zero-day vulnerability — named as such since affected organizations have zero days to patch their systems — that allows attackers to remotely run code on vulnerable servers running Log4j, which developers use to keep a record of what&#8217;s happening inside an application as it runs. The vulnerability is tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2021-44228</a> and was given the maximum 10.0 severity rating, meaning attackers can remotely take full control of a vulnerable system over the internet without any interaction from the victim — and it doesn’t require much skill to pull it off.</p>
<p>Initial reports said exploitation of Log4Shell first began last Thursday, with Minecraft outed as Log4Shell&#8217;s first big-name victim. But security researchers at Cisco Talos and Cloudflare say they found evidence that Log4Shell was first exploited two weeks earlier. Talos said it first observed attacker activity related to the flaw on December 2, while Cloudflare said it observed a successful exploit a day earlier on December 1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Earliest evidence we’ve found so far of #Log4j exploit is 2021-12-01 04:36:50 UTC,” Matthew Prince, Cloudflare co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1469800951351427073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>. “That suggests it was in the wild at least 9 days before [it was] publicly disclosed. However, don’t see evidence of mass exploitation until after public disclosure.”</p>
<h2>Who&#8217;s affected?</h2>
<p>Since the news of Log4Shell first broke, the growing number of victims suggests thousands of big-name companies and services are likely affected by the flaw. According to <a href="https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a GitHub list that’s being regularly updated</a>, Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Google, IBM, Tesla, Twitter and Steam are among the organizations impacted. Separately, VMware released an <a href="https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advisory</a> to warn customers that many of its products are affected, and Cisco has <a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that some of its products are impacted by the flaw.</p>
<p>Many of these companies have been quick to act. Cloudflare tells TechCrunch that it has updated systems to prevent attacks and saw no evidence of exploitation, Microsoft said it had issued a software update for Minecraft users, and Valve has confirmed that it &#8220;immediately reviewed&#8221; its services and concluded that there are no risks to Steam associated.</p>
<p>Apple — whose iCloud service was vulnerable — <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/12/12/last-week-on-my-mac-when-the-internet-caught-fire/comment-page-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly patched</a> its cloud service, but did not respond to our request for comment. Researchers found that iCloud&#8217;s web interface was vulnerable on December 9 and December 10, but that the exploit no longer worked on December 11.</p>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation, which maintains the Log4j software, released an emergency security patch, as well as mitigation steps for those unable to update immediately. There are also a number of third-party mitigations available; Huntress Labs has created a <a href="https://log4shell.huntress.com/">free Log4Shell scanner</a> that companies can use to assess their own systems, and Cybereason has released a Log4Shell “vaccine&#8221; that is<a href="https://github.com/Cybereason/Logout4Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> available on GitHub</a> on free.</p>
<h2>How bad is the flaw?</h2>
<p>As the number of companies and services impacted by Log4Shell grows, so does the number of attacks exploiting the vulnerability. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">blog post</a> over the weekend, Microsoft said it has “observed activities including installing coin miners, Cobalt Strike to enable credential theft and lateral movement, and exfiltrating data from compromised systems.”</p>
<p>Security firm Kryptos Logic also said on Sunday that it detected more than 10,000 different IP addresses probing the internet, which is 100-times the number of systems that were probing for Log4Shell on Friday.</p>
<p>Cado Security has also seen an increase in active exploitation. Speaking to TechCrunch, the company said that on December 11, there were a number of Mirai botnet activities exploiting Log4Shell, as well as Mushtik activity from a number of IP ranges. The company said it believes that, based on the typical chain of events for exploits, “there is a very strong likelihood of targeted ransomware attacks stemming from Log4Shell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the wide-ranging nature of Log4Shell, and the likelihood that ransomware will follow, this is likely the calm before the storm. Patching or mitigating the vulnerability should be at the top of every security team&#8217;s priority list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.unique.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unique</a>, a video calls platform that uses AI to teach sales teams how to improve their pitches, has closed a $6 million seed round from a bunch of angel investors. These include Philipp Stauffer (U.S based founder and general partner of Fyrfly Venture Partners) and Daniel Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Unique uses AI to analyse customer conversations. The video recordings of these then help sales people work out which parts of their pitch work best.</p>
<p>It can do this in 12 languages, including tough ones like Swiss German. The upside, says the company, is that this can reduce the time to train salespeople and improve their performance. It will also capture key moments of the sales video call that are securely shared in a “Deal Room” in one place that buyers can refer back to and share with their own teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company was founded by serial entrepreneurs Manuel Grenacher and Andreas Hauri, following their own experiences of building and guiding a sales team at Coresystems, a B2B SaaS startup they previously sold to SAP.</p>
<p>Grenacher said: “With remote and hybrid working here to stay, sales teams are often far away from their customers, prospects, and from their own colleagues and team leaders. This makes it difficult for them to connect with customers and to learn from their team, to get feedback and to ramp up. We are building Unique to reinvent the sales process, using AI to analyse conversations to light up key moments of insight and connection to help sales teams and customers build deeper, more productive relationships.”</p>
<p>Philipp Stauffer, investor, said: “The intersection of the sales force automation and the conversational intelligence markets will see itself catapulted ahead both in terms of buying priority at Fortune500 companies as well as growth rates. The value creation opportunity to enhance sales outcomes is simply massive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unique competes with the likes of Gong.io and People.AI, (both unicorns). Where the startup may have an edge, however is with its &#8220;Deal Room&#8221; approach, plus the fact it’s built in Europe and therefore complies with strict GDPR privacy regulations. It may also eat into Zoom&#8217;s market as well, if sales teams start using it more than the latter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third-party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Poland&#8217;s competition watchdog is the latest to investigate Apple over policy changes to its mobile platform that impact how third-party apps can track iOS users by requiring they request permission before they can grab data.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) <a href="https://www.uokik.gov.pl/news.php?news_id=18092" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> that it&#8217;s opened an investigation into changes to how Apple&#8217;s mobile platform operates in relation to the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature that requires app developers to ask iOS users for permission to track them for ad targeting.</p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant announced ATT back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/apple-ios-14-ad-tracking/">summer last year</a> &#8212; launching it, after some delay and ongoing advertiser objections, with iOS 14.5 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In practice, this means that Apple has significantly reduced the ability of third-party apps to obtain personal data on iOS in order to send personalised ads,&#8221; the UOKiK writes in a press announcement of the probe. &#8220;However, this does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads. At the same time, doubts have arisen as to whether the rules established by Apple were not designed to promote their own advertising service, Apple Search Ads, which could be a violation of competition principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The actions of digital giants are a challenge for antitrust authorities all around the world,&#8221; added Tomasz Chróstny, the president of UOKiK, in a statement<em>. &#8220;</em>During the course of our investigation, we want to examine whether Apple&#8217;s actions may be aimed at eliminating competitors in the market for personalised advertising services, the objective being to better sell their own service. We will investigate whether this is a case of exclusionary abuse of market power.&#8221;</p>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog already took at look at ATT, following advertiser complaints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">earlier this year</a>, France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence declined to block Apple&#8217;s launch of ATT &#8212; saying, back in March, that it did not consider the introduction of the feature to be an abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p>Although the Autorité said it would continue investigating the policy change &#8212; specifically saying it wanted to check whether Apple was applying less restrictive rules for its own apps versus third-party developers&#8217; ads (which appears to be a key part of the concern driving UOKiK&#8217;s probe).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/">France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France&#8217;s competition authority declines to block Apple&#8217;s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking/embed/#?secret=gznIL5MQxK" data-secret="gznIL5MQxK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Cupertino has been accused of hypocrisy by advertisers who pointed to earlier defaults on iOS opting users into Apple&#8217;s own tracking-based ads versus the new requirement that third parties must ask for permission.</p>
<p>Back in October, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/074b881f-a931-4986-888e-2ac53e286b9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> also reported that the switch had created what it described as &#8220;a windfall&#8221; for Apple, suggesting the company&#8217;s advertising business has more than tripled its market share in the six months after it introduced the changes that obstructed rivals from targeting ads at users. (Although it&#8217;s worth noting that Apple&#8217;s Search Ads comprise only a tiny fraction of the entire mobile ad market, so 3x of a tiny amount is still very small beer.)</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: In iOS 15, Apple quietly changed its earlier default that had opted iOS users into receiving its own personalized ads, as <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/02/apple-personalized-ads-targeting-ios-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9to5Mac</a> reported in September &#8212; when it started prompting users for their consent to its ad targeting, bringing it more in line with its policy mandate that third parties must request user permission to track.</p>
<p>Although &#8212; again important to note &#8212; iOS users have always been able to switch off tracking for Apple&#8217;s ads via their device settings, unlike some third-party apps (like Facebook) that offer users no choice over ad tracking at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting element of the Polish investigation is &#8212; therefore &#8212; not the question of whether Apple is playing fair but its observation that ATT &#8220;does not mean that users&#8217; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalised ads&#8221;. Although the probe sounds more narrowly focused on whether or not Apple is self-preferencing. (We&#8217;ve reached out to the UOKiK with questions about its investigation and will update this report if the regulator responds.)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://blog.lockdownprivacy.com/2021/09/22/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> of ATT&#8217;s &#8220;effectiveness&#8221; at stopping third-party tracking, carried out by an ad blocker called Lockdown Privacy and published this fall, questioned whether the feature creates merely &#8220;an illusion of privacy&#8221;, given the researchers found no difference in the total number of active third-party trackers; and what they described as &#8220;a minimal impact&#8221; on the total number of third-party tracking connection attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We further confirmed that detailed personal or device data was being sent to trackers in almost all cases,&#8221; the study also concluded.</p>
<p>Whether increased transparency should lead to a reduction of tracking scripts &#8212; and therefore whether that&#8217;s a good way to measure ATT&#8217;s &#8220;efficiency&#8221; &#8212; is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>Another is how the market may be shifting in response to platform flexes like ATT &#8212; or, well, <em>pretending</em> to shift.</p>
<p>Last week, another report in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FT</a> suggested Apple might have reached what the newspaper described as a &#8220;quiet truce&#8221; with advertisers &#8212; claiming it was loosely interpreting the ATT policy to continue to allow third parties to collect reams of personal data, so long as the data they gobbled up is &#8220;anonymised and aggregated rather than tied to specific user profiles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thing is, the adtech industry has a long history of making bogus claims of anonymization. While an unholy host of faceless adtech entities have spawned and proliferated in the space by trading and &#8220;syncing&#8221; user data with each other &#8212; to undermine people&#8217;s privacy and erode their ability to protect themselves from tracking exactly by re-identifying individuals (via their devices, ad IDs, cookie data etc., etc.) so they can continue the lucrative business of building profiles to target individuals with ads.</p>
<p>So whether suggestions by a handful of major advertisers cited in the FT article &#8212; including Snap and Facebook &#8212; that they&#8217;re shifting their ad targeting efforts to &#8220;cohort&#8221;-based advertising would survive careful scrutiny of what actually gets done with any in-flows of &#8220;aggregated&#8221; iOS user data remains to be seen. (And may indeed require regulatory oversight &#8212; such as through legislative proposals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Europe&#8217;s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act</a> &#8212; actually doing the due diligence.)</p>
<p>Ad giant Google has also &#8212; in recent years &#8212; been pressing for the industry to switch to cohort-based targeting &#8212; which it claims is better for privacy, even as its suggested &#8220;federated learning of cohorts&#8221; (aka FloCs) tech would do nothing to prevent vulnerable groups being selected for targeted manipulation. (Indeed, some critics of Google&#8217;s proposal suggest it will actually make predatory targeting worse.)</p>
<p>In the U.K., Google&#8217;s self-styled &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan has attracted close regulatory interest.</p>
<p>It is currently being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">overseen by the U.K.&#8217;s competition watchdog</a> &#8212; which has said it wants to ensure that the market-shifting changes are implemented in a way that&#8217;s both fair to advertisers and Google competitors <em>and also</em> not terrible for user privacy (although oversight of the latter piece is handed off to the U.K.&#8217;s ICO, which has a reputation for roundly failing to enforce against any of the adtech industry&#8217;s myriad privacy breaches, so&#8230; ).</p>
<p>All of this is to say that the (power) balancing act is real. But also that regional regulation is far more muscular on the antitrust side than it has <em>ever been</em> in standing up for privacy and data protection &#8212; which risks an unbalanced outcome where adtech versus privacy is concerned. So the stakes for users remain eye-wateringly high.</p>
<p>The European Union, meanwhile, has been a bit of a bystander on this front.</p>
<p>It has its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">active antitrust case ongoing against Apple</a> &#8212; related to rules it applies to its App Store. However the Commission&#8217;s complaint is narrowly focused on the music streaming market, so only on concerns that Apple is potentially distorting competition in that specific segment.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s antitrust division <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">has its eye on Apple Pay</a> too &#8212; but, so far, the Commission hasn&#8217;t taken action in relation to ATT &#8212; which leaves national competition regulators across the bloc, such as Poland&#8217;s UOKiK and France&#8217;s Autorité de la concurrence free to pursue probes if they believe concern is merited.</p>
<p>The Commission did finally open a formal probe of Google&#8217;s adtech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">this summer</a> &#8212; which includes scrutiny of its Sandbox proposal. But it&#8217;s fair to say the EU&#8217;s executive has lagged behind on adtech scrutiny and interventions. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">As have gatekeeping national data protection regulators</a>.)</p>
<p>So a lack of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">joined up thinking</a> at a national level &#8212; between Europe&#8217;s competition enforcers and privacy regulators &#8212; could risk putting chilling limits on even the (limited) pro-privacy changes that a powerful platform-operating company like Apple can bring in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Our Notus algorithm identified you as the most impactful journalist for our audience.”</p>
<p>As a slight narcissist &#8212; as all writers are &#8212; I saw this line in a cold email and had two immediate thoughts: first, is the founder just saying this because they want me to write about their funding round, and second, how in the world did my name come up?</p>
<p>So, I hopped on the phone with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ybel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yuliya Bel</a>, the co-founder of <a href="https://getnotus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notus</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to help other companies identify the best journalists and influencers to work with, based on a deep scan of the social web.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246579" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ask any marketing folk and they’ll tell you about the term “earned growth,” otherwise known as the exposure that companies get naturally through other media, whether it be a podcast shout-out or heck, even a mention in this article. With that background, Bel and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stormtv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Storm</a>&#8216;s vision &#8212; to make companies be better at speaking to their target audience through external media &#8212; made a lot of sense. </span></p>
<p>For their fundraising announcement, Bel said that Notus first decided what the goal outcome was: tell the story of the company to data engineers and designers for eventual recruitment purposes. Then, the company began identifying different startups they think have done a good job at building networks and gaining media attention. Finally, it looked for reporters that have the most impact and are most relevant to those audiences.</p>
<p>While Bel wouldn&#8217;t share more on how she defines impact and relevance, I think it prioritizes how certain, public-facing people speak and engage on topics via Twitter (the company’s goal is to be cross-platform eventually). She said that Notus eventually found my name because I co-host <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/equity-podcast/">Equity</a>, a thrice-weekly podcast about tech and startup news.</p>
<p>This process still didn’t feel entirely clear, so I asked for more information about Notus’s algorithm. All Bel shared is that the startup analyzes an audience by looking at the interactions of their audience members, through retweets, mentions, likes, replies and more on Twitter. The algorithm then produces “a list of trending voices” for brands to explore and filter. Within the private beta, Notus has analyzed 182 million Tweets and 129 million interactions for its insights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The entrepreneur explained how one of Notus’ partners, who is well known in tech and venture capital, is trying to expand awareness of them to different demographics. “They start by picking a company or a person that already has market penetration with the target audiences they want to get in front of, and then use Notus to analyze the audiences and understand the creators and voices that they engage with,” she explained.</p>
<p>It’s not all about reaching out to fintech folks on Twitter with the most followers. The co-founder said the startup also amplifies folks “who may not have the largest audience, but they’re fanatically evangelizing this product&#8230;those are the people that you want to empower to continue to post more things but also give them more ways to create more content,” she said. “For example, giving them an exclusive look as they grow the company public; or having a VIP experience for power users.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s biggest challenge long-term will be around proving outcomes. Bel explained how brands &#8220;can&#8217;t create a cult-like following by buying ads.&#8221; But can they by paying a third-party platform, like Notus, to show them who is worth making a connection with? Some may think that the future needs to be organic, while others could see how more data can lead to compounded influence.</p>
<p>As you figure out where you stand, Notus has already convinced a slew of investors to pour money into the ambitious vision. The startup confirmed that Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s 776 recently led a $1.25 million round, with participation of angels from Glossier and Tesla.</p>
<p>Ohanian spoke in a statement about the importance of software, even with a goal as amorphous as influence.</p>
<p>“As the internet unbundled media, influence fragmented, so Notus is the only way a brand can understand, reach and grow their audience,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://studyfree.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StudyFree</a> — which connects students with international educational opportunities via a community-driven B2C SaaS model — has raised a $3 million seed investment round led by I2BF Global Ventures, TMT Investments and Techstars. Also participating was PandaDoc CEO Mikita Mikado and Google&#8217;s ex-director of product, Andrey Doronichev. StudyFree has now received a total of $3.6 million in funding. The new funds will be used to attract new members to the community, expand into new markets, marketing and platform development.</p>
<p>Founded in November 2018, StudyFree helps students and alumni to enroll in universities and graduate schools internationally, by listing scholarships and grants. It claims that international students using its platform have now received scholarships and grants worth $10.3 million to study in universities across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. It offers more than 300,000 programs for various degrees with scholarships, with a user base of 90,000 students.</p>
<p>Dasha Kroshkina, CEO and founder of StudyFree said: “As someone who was born in a small town, but managed to study internationally, I know more than most how important it is for everyone in the world to have this opportunity. We estimate the international overseas education market is 15 million students per year.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>StudyFree&#8217;s main competitors is <a href="https://www.applyboard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ApplyBoard</a> (a unicorn) and traditional consulting agencies, but unlike the latter, StudyFree leverages its independent community of students with study abroad experience who act as mentors and assist new users with enrollment. These alumni, who have a strong desire to &#8220;give back&#8221;, can host community events and network with these new students. The service then generates revenue through a subscription model.</p>
<p>Mikita Mikado, CEO of PandaDoc said: “StudyFree has become a leading expert in international university admissions with a proven 98% success rate for its students over the last 3 years. It’s changed the adviser market, not only by digitizing the advising process throughout the application process, but also by making human capital and community the foundation of its product.”</p>
<p>Kroshkina is the first female founder to win the Seedstars global competition in its seven-year history. StudyFree was also selected by Techstars New York City Accelerator and Berkeley SkyYDeck, in addition to attracting investment from Techstars twice. Previous investors included Acrobator VC, the fund launched by Bas Godska and Joachim Laqueur to invest in Western and Eastern Europe, and Chris Adelsbach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While OpenSea has already seemed to win the lion&#8217;s share of NFT marketplace traffic, competing storefronts are still striving to find their niche and prepare for a future where NFTs mean more than tradable JPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fractal.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fractal</a>, a new NFT marketplace co-founded by serial entrepreneur Justin Kan, is looking to capture that opportunity on a rising network, the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>The platform is being built around opportunities in gaming and so-called play-to-earn titles, allowing users to shop for avatars and digital goods. The platform has been focusing on bulking up support for existing crypto games ahead of launch, but Kan and the Fractal team are hoping to turn the platform into a sort of Kickstarter for blockchain games, allowing users to buy exclusive NFTs in pre-sales that help fund the creation of the games themselves.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kan and the rest of the team hope to launch the Fractal platform publicly in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Like many other networks in the crypto space, it&#8217;s been a good year for Solana, though the blockchain&#8217;s backers have had a better year than most as they&#8217;ve watched the value of the currency tied to the network balloon from kess than $2 to over $250 this year (though the currency has seen a substantial correction in recent months). The network is a bet on a future where the Ethereum network&#8217;s modularity and slow-moving central foundation fail to keep up with the needs of the web3 user base. Proponents see the low-fee high-bandwidth structure as an ideal place to build NFT projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that Solana is the future of gaming,&#8221; Kan tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Kan previously co-founded Twitch, which famously exited to Amazon. Since shuttering his last startup, Atrium, Kan has been focusing on his entrepreneurship-focused YouTube channel and podcast as well as the incubator/investment fund<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/with-goat-capital-justin-kan-and-robin-chan-want-to-keep-founding-alongside-the-right-teams/"> Goat Capital</a>, which he&#8217;s been building with partner Robin Chan. Fractal is a product of this incubator and an effort Kan is hoping to put some of his founder star power behind by joining as co-founder and president. Chan will also be taking the role of head of Business Development alongside Fractal&#8217;s other co-founders, CTO Mike Angell and CPO David Wurtz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fractal is, in part, a bet on the importance curation will play in a blockchain future where fees and listing friction are eliminated by more consumer-friendly blockchains and scaling solutions. To date, Ethereum&#8217;s expensive listing costs have been one of the few things stopping spammers from flooding existing marketplaces with thousands of low-effort NFTs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $19.7 billion acquisition of speech-to-text specialist Nuance by Microsoft, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">earlier this year</a>, has attracted the attention of the U.K.&#8217;s active antitrust watchdog &#8212; which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/microsoft-corporation-slash-nuance-communications-inc-merger-inquiry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said today</a> it&#8217;s taking a first look to assess whether there are reasons to be concerned about the proposed deal.</p>
<p>A decision on whether the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will open a phase 1 investigation will follow in due course.</p>
<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no stated time frame for the regulator to take a decision on that &#8212; but a consultation period in which the CMA is inviting interested parties to comment runs until January 10, 2022.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Antitrust oversight of proposed acquisitions can stretch to many months &#8212; and can, at the least, lead to major delays to clearing transactions.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft is acquiring Nuance Communications for $19.7B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/embed/#?secret=WTxn7wgXmR" data-secret="WTxn7wgXmR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a statement on the development, the CMA said it is &#8220;considering whether it is or may be the case that this transaction, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the merger provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 and, if so, whether the creation of that situation may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time Microsoft announced the Nuance acquisition, back in April, the software giant said it was buying the speech-to-text firm in order to strengthen its presence in the healthcare vertical &#8212; where Nuance has developed a number of clinician-support products (such as tech for documenting telehealth visits; a speech recognition tool for clinical documentation; and AI-powered radiology reporting, among other software tools).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s antitrust regulator may decide the planned acquisition merits further scrutiny &#8212; at which point it would open a phase 1 investigation. If after that it decides there is still reason to be concerned it may open a deeper, phase 2 probe.</p>
<p>It may also decide during one of the stages of its process that there are no competition issues of concern and clear the acquisition.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the flip side, if it has concerns it could decide remedies are required before it can go ahead or even order the transition blocked.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been contacted for comment on the CMA&#8217;s preliminary probe of its planned purchase of Nuance.</p>
<p>Healthcare has been a vertical of growing interest to tech giants for a number of years &#8212; with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/amazon-will-expand-its-amazon-care-on-demand-healthcare-offering-u-s-wide-this-summer/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/google-completes-controversial-takeover-of-deepmind-health/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-takes-wraps-off-40m-ai-for-health-initiative/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/facebook-unveils-its-first-foray-into-personal-digital-healthcare-tools/">even Facebook</a> all taking an interest in building tools for tracking, monitoring or otherwise supporting health &#8212; raising concerns that their ambitions in such a sensitive area will further entrench their dominance and market power as a vital sector steps up digitization.</p>
<p>The U.K., meanwhile, is in the process of retooling domestic competition law to take account of platform power &#8212; and has said it will be bringing in a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition&#8221; regime which it wants to protect smaller innovators from the market muscle of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of legislation to empower a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a>, which sits inside the CMA, to oversee big tech the competition watchdog continues to scrutinize M&amp;A activity and other major moves (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">Google&#8217;s strategic &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8221; plan</a>).</p>
<p>Most <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">recently, the regulator ordered Meta (aka Facebook) to undo a completed acquisition</a> of animated GIF platform Giphy &#8212; a notable development in competition oversight given how few big tech M&amp;As have been challenged, historically &#8212; underscoring how the CMA is at the forefront of challenging platform power and ambition (even when &#8212; in that instance &#8212; the order requires a messy transaction reversal).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/12/chinas-ai-giant-sensetime-postpones-ipo-after-us-blacklisting/">the SenseTime IPO is on hold</a> leaves the stock market with just one major tech listing on the horizon: Samsara&#8217;s public debut, which is <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/ipo-calendar/">currently anticipated</a> to price Tuesday and trade Wednesday. That makes it the perfect moment to sit back and chat through a few of the year&#8217;s biggest offerings and how they performed post-debut.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Two things are on my mind. First, what happened to some of the most famous IPO pops from the last year? With rising retail trading around the world thanks to companies like Robinhood and WeBull, some recent tech offerings have had simply massive early trading sessions. Did those initial gains persist? Or did they evaporate, leaving the IPO mispricing conversation somewhat overblown?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, second, what happened to the handful of SPACs that we felt made some reasonable sense before their combination was completed? How is Latch doing? And SoFi?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about public offerings now that the IPO season is essentially behind us.</p>
<h2>So, what about those insane IPO pops?</h2>
<p>If you turn the clock back to one year ago, DoorDash and C3.ai had just gone public, and both racked up simply excellent early returns. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">TechCrunch noted on December 9</a>, 2020:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="speakable-summary">Haters gonna hate, IPOs gonna pop. That’s the story today as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/how-doordash-and-c3-ai-can-defend-their-red-hot-ipo-valuatons/">richly valued DoorDash and C3.ai</a>, two American technology unicorns, saw their values skyrocket after they began trading today.</p>
<p>DoorDash shares are up just under 83% to $186.51. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/doordash-ipo-pricing/">priced its IPO at $102 per share</a> last night, ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/doordash-amps-its-ipo-range-ahead-of-blockbuster-ipo/">raised IPO range of $90 to $95 per share</a>. &#8230; [S]hares of C3.ai are up an even sharper 151% to $105.58, after pricing at $42 per share earlier today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>discourse</em> at the time was that those IPOs were bad in that they were priced incorrectly. That, essentially, bankers had sold their IPO share too cheaply, effectively rewarding their own client base while undercutting the fundraising results of both DoorDash and C3. Well, how have things gone since?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe today launched <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Cloud Express</a>, a mobile and web app that brings some of the best features of the company&#8217;s sprawling Creative Cloud Suite and Acrobat PDF tools into a single application to help users quickly create anything from social media posts to promotional posters and videos. Creative Cloud Express replaces Adobe Spark (<em>see update below</em>).</p>
<p>Using a template-first approach with built-in access to stock images and other assets, Creative Cloud Express is meant to be far more accessible than the individual Creative Cloud apps. The app will come in both a free version and a paid $9.99/month edition with additional capabilities and a library of more complex templates. Access to the new application will also be included in Adobe&#8217;s Creative Cloud All Apps and flagship single-app <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246376" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246376" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246376" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Besides the web app, a free app is now available in Apple&#8217;s app store, Google Play and the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>The general idea behind Creative Cloud Express is to give non-professionals the tools they need to bring their vision to life. As Adobe&#8217;s Ashley Still noted, the company has seen a lot of growth from non-professional users in recent years. But while a lot of these users may initially think they want the precision and control of a full Creative Cloud app, the reality is that what they often really want is a fast and easy way to accomplish the same tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing with Creative Cloud Express is we&#8217;re taking all the learnings from our breadth of web and mobile apps, as well as our core Creative Cloud technology &#8212; whether it&#8217;s Photoshop and imaging or video &#8212; and we&#8217;re bringing it into a unified offering called Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; Still said. &#8220;This is really for people who are focused on outcome and not process. They don&#8217;t want to start with a blank page, they want to start with an image from the 175 million-strong Adobe Stock library. They don&#8217;t want to create a font, they want to get access to one of our 20,000 amazing fonts from the Adobe Font library. They don&#8217;t want to go to multiple applications to create a flyer and then create a PDF so they can print it. They want to be able to do it all in one place.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246377" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246377" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-2.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246377" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In practice, this means you get access to a vast library of templates to get started, but also tools to quickly remove the background from an image or apply Photoshop-style filters and effects to these images. Thanks to an integration with Creative Cloud Libraries, users will also be able to take assets from Photoshop and Illustrator that maybe a colleague created for them and then re-use them in the Creative Cloud Express app.</p>
<p>There are also tools to convert videos to GIFs, convert documents to PDFs and more. One interesting aspect here is the integration of <a href="https://stock.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Stock</a>, which doesn&#8217;t feature a free plan but which is integrated (with some limitations) into the free version of Creative Cloud Express. Free users will get access to about 1 million images and other assets. Premium plan users will get access to 175 million Adobe Stock photos, 20,000 fonts and access to Photoshop Express and Premiere Rush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less is more in Creative Cloud Express,&#8221; Still said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be able to do everything in Photoshop. Like you don&#8217;t need neural filters, but you do need to be able to do a few simple things like remove a background or make simple edits to an image. With Acrobat, you don&#8217;t need to password-protect a PDF, you need to be able to create a PDF, edit a PDF. A lot of the simplicity comes with our own editing of what are the few most important things that that people need to achieve. What are their intentions?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246379" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246379" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2246379" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ccx-3.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2246379" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p><del>In some ways, Creative Cloud Express feels a bit like Spark, its tools for building social graphics, short videos and web sites, on steroids. Adobe wouldn&#8217;t say so, but if you think of this as Spark on steroids, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re very far off, as Creative Cloud Express shares a lot of the user interface design and overall philosophy. Indeed, if you went to <a href="http://adobe.com/express" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adobe.com/express</a> before the launch, it would redirect you to the Spark homepage.</del></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <em>Creative Cloud Express replaces Adobe Spark, something the company failed to mention (to us and everybody else) in its press materials or pre-launch briefing. Why? I don&#8217;t know. I guess updating Spark didn&#8217;t have the same ring to it as launching a new application.</em> <em>We have asked the company for a statement.</em></p>
<p>As Still noted, the company isn&#8217;t seeing this as a replacement for applications like <del>Spark</del>, Photoshop Express or Premiere Rush, all of which are also meant to take some of Adobe&#8217;s core features and AI tools and make them more accessible.</p>
<p>The target audience is also a bit wider for Creative Cloud Express. Adobe wants it to become the go-to content creation tool for anybody from students to small business owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has a story to tell and it’s our mission to empower everyone to express their ideas,&#8221; said Scott Belsky, chief product officer and executive vice president, Creative Cloud, Adobe. &#8220;In this unique time, where millions of people are building a personal and professional brand, we’re excited to launch Creative Cloud Express as a simple, template-based tool that unifies the creation, collaboration and sharing process so anyone can create with ease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We love the communities that creators have built on Instagram,&#8221; Instagram said in a tweet announcing the new feature. &#8220;That’s why we’re excited to launch Reels Visual Replies, a new feature to interact with your audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1469444419656896515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s newest feature further integrates Reels into its wider social media platform. It&#8217;s worth noting that the new feature is similar to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/product-tutorial-reply-to-comments-with-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok&#8217;s video replies</a>, which allow users to reply to comments on their content with video responses. TikTok rolled out the feature last year to give users a way to offer more context about their videos and answer questions. Considering the popularity of the feature, it&#8217;s no surprise that Instagram has launched a similar feature for its own TikTok-clone.</p>
<p>The launch of Reels Visual Replies comes as Instagram has been rolling out several new features. Most recently, the company introduced a new end-of-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/facebook-and-instagram-roll-out-personalized-year-in-review-features/">&#8220;Playback&#8221; IG Stories</a> time capsule feature. The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. Instagram suggests Playback posts for you, but you also have the option to pick what you want to share. The new feature is currently available to users for &#8220;several weeks.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram has also rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/">“Rage Shake”</a> feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. The social media giant also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/instagram-rolls-out-new-rage-shake-feature-and-the-option-to-delete-posts-from-a-carousel/"> introduced the ability</a> to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this update, you can delete items from an existing carousel.</p>
<p>The company is also testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">“Take a Break,”</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. There&#8217;s also a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">“Add Yours” sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users’ Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “last mile” in the supply chain has gotten lots of attention during the pandemic. Even e-commerce giants like Amazon have struggled to surmount the challenges of distributing product fast enough to keep up with demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But <a href="https://www.factor.io/">Factor</a>, a startup created in 2018 by manufacturing industry veterans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doug Shultz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Szewczyk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just raised a seed round to streamline a different part of the supply chain process, which it calls the “first mile.” For Factor’s 250+ customers, mostly manufacturing companies, the “first mile” consists of processes like ordering raw materials, choosing the ideal supplier for each order and paying them on time, Factor CEO Shultz told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people look at the supply chain and they think about the shipping containers stuck in LA or the boats outside the port of Long Beach. The exciting thing for us is the problems that we&#8217;re solving more upstream in the chain can really help companies avoid getting in those types of bottlenecks in the first place,” Shultz said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ventilator shortage at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from inefficiencies in the “first mile” of manufacturing, Shultz said. It took six months for supply to meet demand in that scenario because of “manual and tedious” standard practices across the industry, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What caused it to take six months, even with Elon Musk and Tim Cook personally involved, was that inside of that process, there are 700 components that are coming from 200 first-tier suppliers, and then hundreds more underneath that first tier. If you think about how companies order stuff and pay each of these suppliers when there are literally thousands of different moving parts, that’s what takes six months,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246393" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?w=300" alt="Factor cofounders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk" width="450" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg 4475w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DSC08497.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246393" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor co-founders Doug Shultz and Michael Szewczyk.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor’s product helps companies manage transaction infrastructure throughout the “first mile” by leveraging artificial intelligence to automate core supply chain processes. It provides payment tools, data to aid in supplier selection and order tracking and execution features to its customers, who tend to make complex products for industrial use in areas like robotics, medical devices and aerospace and defense, Shultz said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies using Factor bring their own suppliers onto the platform, and Factor helps them measure data about each supplier’s outcomes &#8212; for example, how many times a supplier has delivered goods to them on time. Factor is “less so a marketplace, more so an infrastructure to help you make decisions,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that don’t use Factor typically use manual tools like spreadsheets to manage their “first mile” processes. Others use enterprise resource planning (ERP) software through providers like Oracle and SAP, which is more easily customizable but often prohibitively expensive for mid-size and small companies to use, Shultz continued.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246394" style="width: 3781px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246394" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2246394 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png" alt="Factor's parts status tracking feature" width="3771" height="2620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png 3771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=680,472 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=1536,1067 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=2048,1423 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Factor-Parts-Status-on-Computer.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3771px) 100vw, 3771px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246394" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Factor&#8217;s parts status tracking feature<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Factor</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factor hopes to provide a more reasonably priced supplier management service for these sorts of companies, but it also sees its payment features as key differentiators from other ERPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manufacturing industry accounts for over 20% of B2B payments globally, Shultz said, but many of the largest companies in the industry are still transferring vast amounts of money through paper checks. Factor’s platform offers automated payment features built on top of infrastructure from payment processors like Stripe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re layering on top of that infrastructure applications that can essentially coordinate where the payments are going, and also provide additional value. We have all this data about your order history or suppliers, and we can now pull in the financial services on top of that,” Shultz said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which has seen customer order volume grow 10x in the past nine months, announced today it had raised $6 million in seed funding to grow its platform. Google’s AI-focused fund, Gradient Ventures, led the round alongside Xfund, Afore and South Park Commons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to use the capital to further develop its financial services capabilities by adding new banking partners and offering financing products, Shultz said. It is currently working with a credit provider to develop a credit functionality for companies to fund their short-term working capital needs, he added, though he declined to name the credit provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shultz, who hired Factor’s first head of sales a few weeks ago, said he was excited to receive backing from Darian Shirazi at Gradient Ventures because of Shirazi’s big-picture view of the company’s growth potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirazi understood that “buyers are always suppliers, suppliers are our buyers, and we can turn on this viral engine to [become] the base transaction layer for all of manufacturing,” Shultz said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.siriusxm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sirius XM</a>, home to the satellite radio business and streaming music app Pandora, is bringing on a new head of product and technology, as the company plans to expand its focus beyond the car to better compete with streaming rivals, like Spotify. The company this morning announced its hiring of former MLB and Disney exec Joseph Inzerillo as its new chief product and technology officer. He will begin his new role on January 10, 2022.</p>
<p>Jim Cady, Sirius XM&#8217;s chief innovation officer, who has been serving as interim head of Product Development, will be retiring after eight years with the company. He will work with Inzerillo through February 2022 during the transition.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the audio entertainment company, Inzerillo was an executive vice president and chief technology officer for Disney&#8217;s streaming arm, where he helped to oversee all aspects of that business, including the streaming, commerce, platform development and globalization plans for Disney+, ESPN+, Star+ and Hulu. Inzerillo first joined Disney in 2017 with its acquisition of BAMTech Media, where he had served as EVP and chief technology officer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://press.hulu.com/?hulupress_executive=joe-inzerillo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previously</a>, Inzerillo had been CTO for Major League Baseball, including its flagship media companies MLB Advanced Media and MLB Network. In this role, he launched MLB.tv, the first over-the-top sports offering, &#8220;instant replay&#8221; and wireless connectivity in all 30 ballparks, and shaped MLB&#8217;s digital business. This ultimately led to the spinoff of its streaming technology platform, BAMTech Media, which he helped found.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2246547" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2246547" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2246547" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?w=411" alt="" width="300" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=104,150 104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=208,300 208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-176552507.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2246547" class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>While not necessarily a household name, the BAMTech platform has powered big names in streaming, including HBO Now, WWE Network, Eurosport Player, Fox Sports and the NHL.</p>
<p>At Sirius XM, the exec will be tasked with helping oversee the company&#8217;s Information Technology and Broadcast Infrasture and the team that builds and operates those platforms. In total, he will lead a team of 1,500+ engineers and product professionals across Sirius XM, Pandora and Stitcher. He will also be in charge of Sirius XM&#8217;s product roadmap, satellite infrastructure and its overall technology vision and innovation, and will report directly to Sirius XM CEO Jennifer Witz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hire is a big win for Sirius XM, which has been struggling to compete with Spotify and others in terms of consumer interest. Though the company delivered on its last earnings, its stock <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/02/sirius-xm-performed-investors-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has lost 3% of its value</a> over the last five years versus a 120% gain in Spotify during the same time, for example. In its most <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent quarter,</a> Sirius XM reported year-over-year revenue growth of 9% to reach $2.2 billion in its third quarter and a record 616,000 net new self-pay Sirius XM subscribers to its satellite radio business. At the end of Q3, Sirius XM had 34.1 million total subscribers, down from 34.3 million in the same quarter last year, but projected that by Q4, this year will be its biggest yet on subscriber growth since 2018.</p>
<p>Still, much of Sirius XM&#8217;s business is reliant on automaker partnerships and preinstalls, and catered to a workforce that spent a lot of time commuting to and from the office. The pandemic has reshaped how people work &#8212; now often from home &#8212; and autos come equipped with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integrations that allow customers to easily use their own preferred streaming apps. Combined, these factors could make satellite radio a harder sell long-term, as its cross-platform experience &#8212; particularly on the mobile app side &#8212; is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s 2018<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion/"> $3.5 billion acquisition</a> of Pandora hasn&#8217;t gone that well, either. The streaming app continues to lose traction with consumers, <a href="https://musically.com/2021/10/29/siriusxm-financial-results-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropping</a> to 52.6 million monthly active users in Q3 down, from 55.1 million in Q2 and 58.6 million a year ago. Meanwhile, Sirius XM has invested in podcasting with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">another for Simplecast</a> for analytics and distribution tools. And it has pursued other initiatives to try to connect with consumers, like Pandora&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/pandora-is-partnering-with-soundcloud-to-launch-a-new-station/">new SoundCloud station</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/siriusxm-partners-with-tiktok-on-a-new-music-channel-pandora-playlists-and-more/">TikTok partnership</a>.</p>
<p>Inzerillo&#8217;s hire could shake things up at the company, allowing it to better capitalize on the products and services it offers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a long-time listener and huge fan of SiriusXM, and I could not be more excited to join this team,&#8221; said Inzerillo, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-names-joseph-inzerillo-chief-product--technology-officer-301443050.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a>. &#8220;Streaming and over-the-top offerings have revolutionized the entertainment industry – and audio is no exception. This opportunity is the culmination of all of my professional experiences over the last 30 years, and one I simply could not pass up. From the moment I accepted the role, my mind has been racing with ideas for how we can expand digital capabilities across SiriusXM&#8217;s business. Together, our team will develop a product and technology roadmap that will further differentiate SiriusXM and bring creative new entertainment options to consumers at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>CEO Jennifer Witz also praised Inzerillo&#8217;s 30 years of digital media experience and hinted toward forthcoming product changes in a staff memo, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>With Joe’s wide breadth of experience in building and leading innovative digital platforms, I am confident that he will be instrumental in the development and evolution of our growth strategies across our entire suite of products. As a long-time listener, Joe is eager to come on board and work collaboratively with all of the top-notch talent we have at our Company. His excitement about our products and what the future holds is energizing, and I look forward to all that we will accomplish under Joe’s leadership of this expanded Product and Technology organization.</p></blockquote>
