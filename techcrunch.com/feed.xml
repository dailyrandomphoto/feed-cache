										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a> last night priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210420006244/en/UiPath-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $56 per share</a>, above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised price target range of $52 to $54</a>. The company sold 9,416,384 shares at that price, alongside 14,474,393 from existing shareholders. Its underwriters can purchase 3,583,616 shares at its IPO price if they so choose.</p>
<p>UiPath raised $527.3 million on a gross basis for the primary shares that it sold in the transaction, a deal that values the company at around $29.1 billion on a non-diluted basis. On a fully diluted basis, The Exchange calculates that UiPath is worth up to $31 billion.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>UiPath&#8217;s pricing run has been fascinating to watch. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">proposed a $43 to $50 per-share IPO price range</a>; at that price, UiPath was worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion on a non-diluted basis. A coup? For a company that valued at just over $10 billion a year ago, you&#8217;d think so. The company&#8217;s final IPO price is nearly a tripling of its 2020 worth.</p>
<p>But for UiPath, things are complicated by a 2021 private round that valued the company at $35 billion, a figure that weighs somewhat heavily around the company&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Not that we should hold the final down-round IPO price differential against UiPath. It got away with raising $750 million at an inflated price before turning around and raising another half-billion at a more reasonable (more on that in a moment) valuation while providing all but its very final investors with excellent returns.</p>
<p>Its employees should do well, too, I reckon. (And Alphabet. Perhaps the company can now <a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-contractors-forced-unemployment">afford to bring more of its contractors on full-time</a> thanks to, say, the nearly 21x return that its late-stage group CapitalG made on the 13 million UiPath shares it purchased during its Series B.)</p>
<p>Regardless, after watching the UiPath IPO pricing dance from its first S-1 filing through settling at $56 per share, I think the only parties that should feel a bit silly are the investors who decided that pushing up the value of the former startup by 3.5x in a less than a year was durable logic. Let&#8217;s talk about why.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the world’s organizations shifted to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But even as more people are vaccinated and offices are planning re-openings, it’s clear that for some organizations, remote work is here to stay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel, a startup which provides payroll, compliance tools and other services to help businesses hire remotely, has seen increased demand in the wake of this shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the San Francisco company has announced that it has raised $156 million in Series C funding led by the YC Continuity Fund and existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, former Stripe payments guru Lachy Groom, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jeff Wilke, and Anthony Schiller also participated in the round, among others. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise is notable for a few reasons. For one, it comes just over seven months after Deel raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $30 million Series B </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing. So it is essentially more than 5x the size of that round. It’s also a big deal because it propels Deel, a 3 year-old company, to unicorn status with a $1.25 billion valuation. The raise also comes after a massive year of growth for Deel, which says it saw a “20x” increase in revenue in 2020 with over 1,800 business clients. That’s up from 500 at the time of its September raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founded by MIT alumni Alex Bouaziz and Shuo Wan, Deel aims to allow businesses “to hire anyone, anywhere, in a compliant manner.” It claims that by using its services, businesses can hire and onboard international employees or contractors in under 5 minutes, with no local entity required and that “paying them in 120+ currencies takes just a click.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel plans to use its new capital to continue an international expansion and set up 80 new Deel-owned entities across the world in 2021. Deel also plans to do some hiring itself, and grow its product offerings. The company’s own team is entirely remote, and has grown from 7 employees to over 120 across 26 countries since January 2020. CB Insights projects the industry for virtual HR software will grow to</span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/remote-hiring-startups-gaining-traction/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$43 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026 as technology platforms like Deel help businesses make the transition to remote-first work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC Continuity’s Ali Rowghani, who has joined Deel’s board as part of the funding, believes Deel was already at the forefront of remote work pre-pandemic and that “it will be long after.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way people work is fundamentally changing&#8230; the [Deel] team is uniquely equipped to remove the obstacles of remote work so companies hire the best talent in the world, instead of only those nearest to them,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch previously reported, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel today already provides various tools to employees and the organizations that they work for, such as payroll services, tax compliance information, assistance on building contracts, invoicing services and a range of insurance options covering health and other areas related to working life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the plan is to continue building out that stack with more services aimed at both the workers and their employers. That includes loans based on salary for workers, more insurance and benefits options and other offerings.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and Danny wanted to chat crypto. No, not cryptography, but cryptocurrency. The topic has been hot in recent months thanks to Coinbase, recent weeks thanks to the rapid price appreciation in the value of many coins, and in recent days because dogecoin went crazy.</p>
<p><em>Vote for <a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/technology">Equity to win a Webby</a> so that our parents are proud!</em></p>
<p>So with our minds tuned to the future of money, and commerce, and content, here&#8217;s the show&#8217;s rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent crypto news has been more than busy, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">Venmo adding crypto support</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-giant-binance-hires-former-top-bank-regulator-11618912800">Brian Brooks joining Binance</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">the Coinbase direct listing</a>.</li>
<li>But that&#8217;s not all, there have been a host of NFT marketplaces that have raised millions in the past week. We talk about <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93707/nft-marketplace-rarible-raises-1-75-million-in-seed-funding-round">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/99869/nft-marketplace-superrare-funding-round">SuperRare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">OpenSea</a>, and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation">Dapper Labs. </a>We talk about differentiation, UX, and if more than one marketplace can win.</li>
<li>Dogecoin&#8217;s <em>to the moon </em>moment had reached a new price high and come down some before our show recorded, but the cryptocurrency&#8217;s joke apparently is still funny after all these years. Here&#8217;s a<a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1384459900147933184/photo/2"> tweet</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dogecoin-traders-whip-up-doge-day-frenzy-in-push-toward-1-11618842535?mod=hp_lead_pos11">an article</a> about it.</li>
<li>And the idea that Coinbase&#8217;s successful direct listing will matter for investors betting on crypto-focused startups is true, at least according to investors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">More on that here, </a>and hit us up if you want a sweet discount code to get past that paywall.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://welcome.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built a digital platform aimed at immigrants and their families, has raised $35 million in a Series B funding round co-led by TTV Capital, Owl Ventures and SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/softbank-launches-100m-opportunity-growth-fund-to-invest-in-founders-of-color/">Opportunity Fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosscut Ventures, Mubadala Capital, Next Play Capital and Owl Capital also participated in the financing, which brings the Los Angeles-based company&#8217;s total raised to $50 million since its 2010 inception. Welcome Tech, which has an office in San Antonio, Texas, raised an $8 million Series A in March of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built by immigrants for immigrants, Welcome Tech aims to do just what its name indicates &#8212; help immigrants feel more welcome, have an easier transition and achieve greater success when moving to the United States.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s approach was different in that rather than launch a banking product and then set out to earn the trust of the community it aims to serve, it first worked hard to earn that trust and understand the community’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in its first years of existence, Welcome Tech has focused on building out a platform that provides educational resources, information and services that “they need to thrive in a  new country.” Its efforts are initially primarily focused on the Hispanic community in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of its platform, dubbed </span><a href="https://saberespoder.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SABEResPODER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning Knowledge is Power in Spanish),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to serve as “a widely recognized and trusted resource” to members of the Hispanic community in the U.S., the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with knowledge and data that it has gathered over the years, Welcome Tech six months ago launched a banking service, including a debit card and bilingual mobile app. And in January, it launched a monthly subscription offering that gives users access to discounted resources such as medical and dental professionals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardiner Garrard, co-founder and partner, TTV Capital, points out that the Hispanic market represents the </span><a href="https://multicultural.com/articles/the-2020-hispanic-market-report-now-available-from-claritas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest minority cohort in the U.S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">., with a population of 62.8 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, less than half of Hispanic households are ‘fully banked’, meaning they cannot open an account, which then negatively impacts their ability to secure other products or services,” Garrard said. “To not serve this community is a major failure. Welcome Tech is addressing this issue head on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Welcome’s platform is approaching 3 million active users, according to co-founder and CEO Amir Hemmat. Its ultimate goal, he said, is to serve as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital Ellis Island.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we leave immigrants’ success to chance is pretty crazy,” he told TechCrunch. “If you think of countries the way you think of companies and the way they want to attract and retain&#8230;here, we almost do the opposite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Hemmat and co-founder Raul Lomeli-Azoubel recognized that access to financial services was crucial to immigrants’ success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although we ultimately see ourselves building towards a better future for immigration and a broader platform, the foundation and beachhead for that is definitely in financial services,” Hemmat said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome offers a free banking account that is fully bilingual for English and Spanish speaking communities with “key features that are very tailor made for this community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of new digital banks targeting Latino and immigrant communities in general have emerged in recent years, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Welcome aims to differentiate itself from competitors in being a more broad-based platform. Its subscription offering &#8212; at $10 a month &#8212; does things like offer discounts to healthcare professionals and free televisits, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we dug in, we realized that immigrants are not being provided data-driven recommendations,” Hemmat said. “It’s very much a word of mouth and trial of error, and in some cases highly predatory, experience. We’re working to aggregate a historically fragmented audience and that gives us massive leverage to source better offerings, pricing and experiences for consumers across multiple categories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to build more partnerships so that it can do the above, as well as spread awareness about its services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosia Karas, investment director and head of growth stage investments at SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund, told TechCrunch that the fact that the immigrant population in the U.S. is “growing really fast and underserved creates an opportunity for someone to come in and serve them well with a financial services offering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, SoftBank was attracted to Welcome Tech’s approach to truly understand, and gather data around, its target market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before even jumping head first into building a fintech company, they did a lot of work prior,” Karas said. “They spent years building an understanding of this audience of the immigrant population, including building trust within that demographic. And at the same time, they have been building targeted content. This serves as a really great backbone to build a company that is very well-suited to serve that audience and to roll out things like the debit card and other financial services offerings.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.misfitsmarket.com">Misfits Market</a>, a startup known for selling &#8220;ugly&#8221; fruits and vegetables at discount prices, announced this morning that it has raised $200 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>The company says this brings its total funding to $301.5 million and moves its valuation into unicorn territory (i.e., above $1 billion). It isn&#8217;t getting any more specific about that valuation, though <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/misfits-market-funding-round-brings-valuation-to-1-1-billion">Bloomberg reports</a> that it&#8217;s $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Abhi Ramesh told me that the Delanco, New Jersey-based startup has expanded beyond produce into a variety of grocery categories. At the same time, he said all of its products remain united by a focus on &#8220;a single word, which is value.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Misfits Market products are discounted by up to 40 percent compared to what you&#8217;d find in other grocery stores (in-person or online), which Ramesh said the company achieves by purchasing products that regular stores won&#8217;t buy or sell, often for &#8220;crazy, random&#8221; reasons. For example, he said the company had recently purchased 50,000 bottles of perfectly good olive oil &#8220;where the labeling was just angled the wrong way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says its active customer base and order volume grew 5x last year, when it shipped 77 million pounds of food to more than 400,000 customers. Ramesh said it was a big challenge to meet increased consumer demand (and it did have to create a long wait list for a while), but Misfits had advantages that many other grocery companies did not.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141622" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141622" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?w=680" alt="Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/0319_Abhi_Ramesh-0313.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141622" class="wp-caption-text">Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, because we operate our own fulfillment centers and we have our own internal tech built around this, we were not constrained by the same constraints that physical grocery stores have, where we have to close at 9pm every day, where we have to make room for regular foot traffic and Instacart shoppers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For us, we just have to scale our fulfillment centers, which is easier said than done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new round was led by Accel and D1 Capital, with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Sound Ventures, Third Kind Ventures and others. Accel&#8217;s Ryan Sweeney is joining Misfits&#8217; board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Direct-to-consumer models aren&#8217;t anything new in the food industry, but the approach Misfits Market has taken is,” Sweeney said in a statement. “Instead of focusing only on their end customer, they’ve managed to create a dynamic solution that also supports food suppliers at every level.”</p>
<p>With the new funding, Misfits Market plans to continue expanding into new grocery categories and new geographies. For example, it&#8217;s taking its first orders from Oregon and Washington today, and Ramesh said his goal is to be shipping to &#8220;100 percent of zip codes in the 48 lower states&#8221; in the next 12 months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon is bringing its new biometric device, the Amazon One scanner, to Whole Foods store. The retail giant this past fall first introduced the Amazon One scanner, which allows shoppers to enter a store by having their palm scanned. The customer&#8217;s palm signature can be associated with their payment mechanism in a retail environment &#8212; [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle">bringing</a> its new biometric device, the Amazon One scanner, to Whole Foods store. The retail giant this past fall first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/introducing-amazon-one-a-new-innovation-to-make-everyday-activities-effortless">introduced</a> the Amazon One scanner, which allows shoppers to enter a store by having their palm scanned. The customer&#8217;s palm signature can be associated with their payment mechanism in a retail environment &#8212; like Amazon&#8217;s cashier-less Amazon Go stores, where customers shop then walk out without having to go through a traditional checkout process. Now at Whole Foods, the Amazon One scanner will be added as a payment option at checkout.</p>
<p>That means customers could choose to scan their palm over the reader to pay for their purchases, instead of paying with cash or a credit or debit card, for example. It will not replace other payment options, Amazon stressed.</p>
<p>Amazon says it&#8217;s initially adding the Amazon One palm scanner to the Whole Foods Market store at Madison Broadway in Seattle, but plans to roll it out to seven more Whole Foods Market stores in the greater Seattle area in the months to come. Seattle will likely serve as a test market for the new technology before Amazon chooses to roll it out more broadly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-introduces-the-amazon-one-a-way-to-pay-with-your-palm-when-entering-stores/">its launch in September</a>, Amazon One scanners have already been installed in several Amazon stores in the Seattle area, including Amazon Go, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up. The retailer says &#8220;thousands&#8221; of customers have now enrolled their palm signatures.</p>
<p>With the Whole Foods launch, customers will be able to sign up for Amazon One at a kiosk or device in the participating Whole Foods stores, where they can choose to enroll one or both palms. The scanner uses computer vision technology to create the unique palm signature, which is associated with the payment card the customer inserts into the device.</p>
<p>Existing customers who had previously enrolled in Amazon One at a different location will have to re-insert their credit card one time in the Whole Foods store to continue to use the service in those stores, Amazon said.</p>
<p>In addition, customers will be able to link their Amazon One ID with their Amazon account in order to get their Prime membership discount to apply to their Whole Foods Market purchases via the Amazon One device in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Whole Foods Market, we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the shopping experience for our customers,&#8221; said Arun Rajan, senior vice president of technology and chief technology officer at Whole Foods Market, in a statement about the expansion. &#8220;Working closely with Amazon, we’ve brought benefits like Prime member discounts, online grocery delivery and pickup, and free returns to our customers, and we’re excited to add Amazon One as a payment option beginning today. We’re starting with an initial store at Madison Broadway in Seattle and look forward to hearing what customers think as we expand this option to additional stores over time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The device, of course, comes with concerns given Amazon&#8217;s track record with biometric technology. The company has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S.; its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>; and its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a> It was also found to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/">keeping Alexa voice records indefinitely</a>, with no option for customers to delete them. (Amazon later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">changed</a> that &#8212; and, to be fair, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">Apple</a> were mishandling customer voice data, too.)</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/amazon-is-opening-a-london-hair-salon-to-test-ar-and-other-retail-technologies/">announced tests</a> of other retail and AR technology in a London area hair salon, which would involve cameras capturing customer images. The company said it wasn&#8217;t retaining &#8220;customer data,&#8221; but declined to answer a question about the non-personal data being collected at the salon.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s announcement, Amazon notes that the Amazon One device is &#8220;protected by multiple security controls, and palm images are never stored on the Amazon One device.&#8221; It says the images are encrypted and sent to a secure area built for Amazon One in the cloud where Amazon creates the customers&#8217; palm signatures. It also offers a way for customers to unenroll from Amazon One from either a device itself or from one.amazon.com, which also deletes their biometric data when all their transactions have completed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like <a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a> and <a href="https://www.forhims.com/">Hims</a> have capitalized on the need for more seamless and discreet access to health and wellness products that are part of everyday life. For men.</p>
<p><a href="https://getstix.co/">Stix</a> is looking to do the same for women, and has today announced the raise of a $3.5 million seed round. The financing was co-led by Resolute Ventures and SWAT equity partners, with participation from Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, Bullish, and a variety of strategic angels. This brings the total amount raised by the company to $5 million.</p>
<p>Stix launched in 2019 with a D2C pregnancy test that was easy to buy and use, and that eliminated some of their associated stigma. For example, some pregnancy tests show a smiley face when a woman tests positive, despite the fact that not all women taking a pregnancy test want to be pregnant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company then expanded to ovulation tests and prenatal supplements. Most recently, Stix has moved into UTI diagnostics tests, pain relief products, and preventative supplements. This last product category is particularly important. First of all, women are 30 times more likely to get a UTI than men, according to <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/urinary-tract-infections">womenshealth.gov</a>, and more than half of all women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime. It&#8217;s a huge market.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, there are few if any diagnostic products out on the market that women can buy over the counter. In other words, it&#8217;s taxing for a woman to diagnose a UTI (usually having to go see a doctor) despite the fact that UTIs are incredibly common.</p>
<p>The FDA-cleared UTI test makes it much easier for women to take action and get some answers from the comfort of their own home. Stix offers these products as a subscription and gives customers the option to choose how frequently they&#8217;d like them delivered.</p>
<p>Stix was cofounded by <a href="https://twitter.com/cynplotch?lang=en">Cynthia Plotch</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamienorwood_">Jamie Norwood</a>. The startup is looking to build a full suite of not only products, but educational resources and content to help guide women through these hyper common, but difficult, experiences.</p>
<p>Stix has eight people on the team, including the cofounders, three of whom are people of color. All are women.</p>
<p>The startup is not alone in the market. <a href="https://modernfertility.com/">Modern Fertility</a>, for example, is selling ovulation and pregnancy tests direct to consumer and has distribution through big box retailers like Wal-Mart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://onesoil.ai/en/">OneSoil</a>, a company selling technology to help farmers monitor fields and increase yields, has raised $5 million from international investors Almaz Capital and PortfoLion.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tech integrates satellite imagery with mobile and desktop applications for farming analytics. These offerings include both remote crop monitoring, variable-rate seed and fertilizer applications that can reduce the time spent on field scouting and improve efficiency as it relates to inputs.</p>
<p>OneSoil already has more than 200,000 farmers and consultants using its service across over 180 countries just two and a half years after its launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that roughly 5% of the world&#8217;s total arable land (197 mln acres) is covered by OneSoil users, which include major ag companies like BASF and Krone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing from Almaz and PortfoLion will be used to expand on its market position in the Americas and Europe, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to help farmers make informed decisions for their agricultural operations, reduce input waste, and increase their profits. To do that, we provide digital tools that combine real-time, global-scale satellite imagery processing for the best analytics and insights for our users,&#8221; says Slava Mazai, CEO at OneSoil, in a statement. &#8220;We aim to build the biggest digital platform for informed solutions and precision agriculture. To move faster down this path, we will hire tech and marketing professionals in Europe and the CIS, and we&#8217;re looking for consultants and business partners in the field of agronomy in North and South America&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For Almaz investor, Pavel Bogdanov, it was the company&#8217;s impressive adoption rates among farmers that convinced the firm to invest in the OneSoil round. &#8220;[F</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">armers&#8217;] adoption of new tools has been slow due to the complexity of the products, cost, and a degree of risk aversion among farmers. At least, we thought adoption was slow before we met OneSoil. OneSoil is very popular with farmers; the growth in global usage was so impressive that we decided to invest in OneSoil to help them add even more valuable solutions for farmers&#8221;, said Bogdanov, in a statement.</span></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve hung out with us on an ECL before, you know we start with a bit of top news, chat with our speakers about how to successfully fundraise and finish with the Pitch Deck Teardown, where we take a look at decks submitted by you, the audience members, and give live feedback.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, with the help of Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand, we&#8217;re going to shake things up a bit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprises are adopting an ever-wider range of SaaS applications to work and interface with customers, and that is proving to be a major security concern: it&#8217;s not just the prospect of phishing, credential stuffing and other malicious tricks to get into systems that are a worry, but the fact that more applications mean more attack surfaces, and more integrations between apps mean more inadvertent holes that get exposed in the process.</p>
<p>And that is leading to surge of interest in security applications that can help. Today, a startup called <a href="https://appomni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppOmni</a> &#8212; which has built a platform to help monitor SaaS apps and their activity, provide guidance to warn or block when things might go wrong, and fix problems when they do occur &#8212; is announcing some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>The startup has raised $40 million in a Series B round led by Scale Venture Partners, with Salesforce Ventures and ServiceNow Ventures, as well as previous backers ClearSky, Costanoa Ventures, Inner Loop Capital and Silicon Valley Data Capital also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the back of a huge year for AppOmni. The company grew 900%, co-founder and CEO Brendan O&#8217;Connor told TechCrunch, and it has managed to stay at 100% customer retention &#8212; that is, AppOmni has yet to lose a single customer since it was founded.</p>
<p>The company today integrates with over 100 connectors, platforms used by developers and IT teams at companies to manage the apps that their businesses use, tools Splunk and Sumo Logic. Through this, AppOmni is able to aggregate and normalize event data around those apps, in addition to deeper monitoring in cases where it can integrate with apps themselves (those integrations to date include some of the most popular apps that enterprises use today, including Salesforce and Slack, Zoom, Microsoft 365, Box and Github).</p>
<p>As O&#8217;Connor describes it, the sheer number of apps that enterprise teams use and adopt has made managing security around them very complex. Partly because of how SaaS is set up for usage by as many people in and outside the organization as possible (to make the apps more useful), AppOmni estimates that some 95% of enterprises &#8220;overprovision&#8221; permissions for external users.</p>
<p>On top of that, some of the biggest problems occur indirectly, specifically when applications are linked up together, creating a flow of sensitive data. AppOmni says that some 55% of companies have sensitive data living in SaaS systems that has been inadvertently exposed to the anonymous internet, sitting there completely unguarded, in this way. (See <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zack&#8217;s story here</a> for a recent example of how this can play out.)</p>
<p>This is an issue, he said, that is unique to SaaS, which he describes different architecturally to any software that companies might have used in the past. &#8220;There is no operating system, no network that is exposed to customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The idea is that AppOmni provides a dashboard to make that monitoring much less murky. &#8220;One of our customers described using AppOmni as being akin to turning a light on in a dark room,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor and his co-founder, Brian Soby (the CTO), have first-hand knowledge of the challenges of securing SaaS applications: both spent years at Salesforce &#8212; with O&#8217;Connor the company&#8217;s SVP and &#8220;chief trust officer&#8221;, a role he left to join ServiceNow as its security CTO, before leaving there to co-found AppOmni with Soby.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly that track record, along with AppOmni&#8217;s own track record, that has given the startup the attention that it has from investors. Interestingly, Scale came to know AppOmni not over a coffee or a pitch deck, but as one of those satisfied customers, which eventually led the VC to offer to invest.</p>
<p>“Scale Venture Partners became an AppOmni customer in 2020. We know firsthand how powerful and differentiated the AppOmni product when it comes to protecting our sensitive SaaS data, and we’re excited to now be both a customer and an investor,” said Ariel Tseitlin, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, in a statement. “AppOmni’s 9x growth last year, driven by the acquisition of customers across a wide range of industries, proves that AppOmni is the market leader in the increasingly important SaaS Security Management market. We expect the momentum to continue in 2021 and beyond as companies accelerate their shift to cloud applications to support their larger remote workforces.”</p>
<p>The company has raised $53 million to date, and it is not disclosing valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://authzed.com/">Authzed</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to build permissions in their applications, announced a $3.9 million seed round today. The investment was led by Work-Bench with participation from Y Combinator and Amplify Partners.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Jake Moshenko says the service is an API that is designed to help developers quickly add permissions to an application. &#8220;Authzed is a platform to store, compute and validate application permissions. So based on our experience at Google and Red Hat and Amazon, we think that this is the proper way that companies should be doing application permissions,&#8221; Moshenko told me.</p>
<p>The way the service works is by helping to define groups of users, and based on the membership of a given group, defining what data they can see and what functions they have permissions to access. While it may rely on Active Directory or LDAP as the basis of permissions groups, he says that it simplifies the actual permissions implementation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So, by itself Active Directory doesn&#8217;t actually fully solve the problem. You still have to bind to that group membership to a set of permissions that it implies. With our system, you can actually unify the way that you talk about both the permissions and group members,&#8221; Moshenko said.</p>

<p>The company has built out the framework for the service, But Moshenko says the links to Active Directory and other directory services are on the road map. For now, they have been working with design partners to get the basics of the product down, and today the company is opening the service for any developer who wants to use it.</p>
<p>For starters, it will be free, but over time he expects they will have pricing tiers. He likens his service to other API companies like Twilio for communications or Stripe for payments and expects the cost will be low when an application is just starting out and then go up over time as it gets more popular and needs to check the permissions more regularly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for the company and other than the three co-founders, they have just one employee. The plan is to hire additional engineers using the money from this round, while trying to build traction in the developer community for the product. He says that the number of new employees they add this year will really depend on how well the product is doing in the market.</p>
<p>The founders previously founded Quay, a private registry for Docker containers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/coreos-acquires-quay-io-to-launch-its-private-docker-repository/">they sold to CoreOS in 2014</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cadillac Lyriq, the all-electric crossover and flagship of GM&#8217;s luxury brand, will start at a skosh under $60,000 when it comes to the U.S. market in early 2022.</p>
<p>The price, which doesn&#8217;t include destination charges, is one of the last remaining details to be shared about the production version of the Lyriq. GM first revealed a showcar version of the Lyriq back in August. On Wednesday, the automaker announced the pricing along with the final specifications of the production vehicle.</p>
<p>The Lyriq is just one in a roster of 30 electric vehicles that GM plans to bring to market by 2025. It will be a critical one for Cadillac and aims to set the benchmark for the brand that has seen lagging sales. The big message from GM: this car is coming soon, messaging that includes an invitation to customers to place order reservations beginning in September 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Cadillac Lyriq was supposed to go into production in the U.S. in late 2022, but executives said that virtual development tools and along with the underlying flexible Ultium platform used in the vehicle allowed the brand to speed up development.</p>
<p>The Ultium electric architecture and Ultium batteries will be used in a broad range of products across GM&#8217;s Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands, as well as the Cruise Origin autonomous shuttle. This modular architecture will be capable of 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, 400-volt and 800-volt packs with storage ranging from 50 kWh to 200 kWh, and front, rear and all-wheel drive configurations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141470" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141470" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141470 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg" alt="2023 Cadillac Lyric" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-CHARGE-PORT-FINAL.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141470" class="wp-caption-text">The 2023 Cadillac Lyric charge port.</p></div></p>
<p>The rear-wheel drive Lyriq will be equipped with a 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack that can travel more than 300 miles based on Cadillac&#8217;s internal estimates. The EPA estimates have yet to be shared. The Lyriq will be able to handle fast charging at 190 kW, which translates to an estimated 76 miles of range in about 10 minutes of charging time. For home charging, there&#8217;s a 19.2 kW charging module, which can add up to 52 miles of range per hour of charge, the company said.</p>
<p>The vehicle aims to ooze luxury, a look that GM tries to achieve with exterior and interior touches like the &#8220;black crystal&#8221; grille, 33-inch vertical LED touchscreen display and AKG sound system. The vehicle has fast roofline and wide stance that is meant to give it a modern and even aggressive-looking look. That &#8220;black crystal&#8221; grille is a dynamic feature with &#8220;choreographed&#8221; LED lighting that greets the owner as they approach the vehicle. The LED lighting continues in the rear with a split taillamp design.</p>
<p>The vehicle will be offered in two exterior and interior colors. On the outside, the vehicle can come in satin steel metallic or stellar black metallic paint and sky cool gray or noir for the interior. Cadillac adds in laser etched patterns through wood over metal décor to complete the interior look.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141471" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141471" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141471 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg" alt="2023 Cadillac Lyric" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MY23LYRIQ-INTERIOR-MAJOR-GALVANO-FINAL.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141471" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cadillac</p></div></p>
<p>The Lyriq will also offer Super Cruise, GM&#8217;s hands-free driver assistance system, which combines lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Like the GM&#8217;s Chevy Bolt, the Lyriq will offer what it describes as one pedal driving. Electric vehicles typically have a regenerative braking feature. In the Lyriq, drivers are able to control how quickly the vehicle slows down or comes to a complete stop using a pressure-sensitive paddle located on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>The vehicle will be produced at GM&#8217;s Spring Hill, Tennessee assembly facility. GM has said it is investing $2 billion into the plant to support electric vehicle production. The automaker and its joint venture partner LG energy Solution also announced in April plans to invest $2.3 billion to build a battery cell manufacturing plant at next to the Spring Hill assembly plant.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European Union lawmakers have presented their risk-based proposal for regulating high risk applications of artificial intelligence within the bloc&#8217;s single market. The plan includes prohibitions on a small number of use-cases that are considered too dangerous to people&#8217;s safety or EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights, such as a China-style social credit scoring system or certain types [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have presented their <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-approach-artificial-intelligence">risk-based proposal</a> for regulating high risk applications of artificial intelligence within the bloc&#8217;s single market.</p>
<p>The plan includes prohibitions on a small number of use-cases that are considered too dangerous to people&#8217;s safety or EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights, such as a China-style social credit scoring system or certain types of AI-enabled mass surveillance.</p>
<p>Most uses of AI won&#8217;t face any regulation (let alone a ban) under the proposal but a subset of so-called &#8220;high risk&#8221; uses will be subject to specific regulatory requirements, both ex ante (before) and ex post (after) launching into the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are also transparency requirements for certain use-cases of AI &#8212; such as chatbots and deepfakes &#8212; where EU lawmakers believe that potential risk can be mitigated by informing users they are interacting with something artificial.</p>
<p>The planned law is intended to apply to any company selling an AI product or service into the EU, not just to EU-based companies and individuals &#8212; so, as with the EU&#8217;s data protection regime, it will be extraterritorial in scope.</p>
<p>The overarching goal for EU lawmakers is to foster public trust in how AI is implemented to help boost uptake of the technology. Senior Commission officials talk about wanting to develop an &#8220;excellence ecosystem&#8221; that&#8217;s aligned with European values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we aim to make Europe world-class in the development of a secure, trustworthy and human-centered Artificial Intelligence, and the use of it,&#8221; said Commission EVP, Margrethe Vestager, announcing adoption of the proposal at a press conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, our regulation addresses the human and societal risks associated with specific uses of AI. This is to create trust. On the other hand, our coordinated plan outlines the necessary steps that Member States should take to boost investments and innovation. To guarantee excellence. All this, to ensure that we strengthen the uptake of AI across Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Under the proposal, mandatory requirements are attached to a &#8220;high risk&#8221; category of applications of AI &#8212; meaning those that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> present a clear safety risk or threaten to impinge on </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN">EU fundamental rights</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (such as the right to non-discrimination).</span></p>
<p>Examples of high risk AI use-cases that will be subject to the highest level of regulation on use are set out in annex 3 of the regulation &#8212; which the Commission said it will have the power to expand by delegate acts, as use-cases of AI continue to develop and risks evolve.</p>
<p>For now cited high risk examples fall into the following categories: Biometric identification and categorisation of natural persons; Management and operation of critical infrastructure; Education and vocational training; Employment, workers management and access to self-employment; Access to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits; Law enforcement; Migration, asylum and border control management; Administration of justice and democratic processes.</p>
<p>Military uses of AI are specifically excluded from scope as the regulation is focused on the bloc&#8217;s internal market.</p>
<p>The makers of high risk applications will have a set of ex ante obligations to comply with before bringing their product to market, including around the quality of the data-sets used to train their AIs and a level of human oversight over not just design but use of the system &#8212; as well as ongoing, ex post requirements, in the form of post-market surveillance.</p>
<p>Other requirements include a need to create records of the AI system to enable compliance checks and also to provide relevant information to users. The robustness, accuracy and security of the AI system will also be subject to regulation.</p>
<p>Commission officials suggested the vast majority of applications of AI will fall outside this highly regulated category. Makers of those &#8216;low risk&#8217; AI systems will merely be encouraged to adopt (non-legally binding) codes of conduct on use.</p>
<p>Penalties for infringing the rules on specific AI use-case bans have been set at up to 6% of global annual turnover or €30M (whichever is greater). While violations of the rules related to high risk applications can scale up to 4% (or €20M).</p>
<p>Enforcement will involve multiple agencies in each EU Member State &#8212; with the proposal intending oversight be carried out by existing (relevant) agencies, such as product safety bodies and data protection agencies.</p>
<p>That raises immediate questions over adequate resourcing of national bodies, given the additional work and technical complexity they will face in policing the AI rules; and also how enforcement bottlenecks will be avoided in certain Member States. (Notably, the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation is also overseen at the Member State level and has suffered from lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement.)</p>
<p>There will also be an EU-wide database set up to create a register of high risk systems implemented in the bloc (which will be managed by the Commission).</p>
<p>A new body, called the European Artificial Intelligence Board (EAIB), will also be set up to support a consistent application of the regulation &#8212; in a mirror to the European Data Protection Board which offers guidance for applying the GDPR.</p>
<p>In step with rules on certain uses of AI, the plan includes measures to co-ordinate EU Member State support for AI development &#8212; such as by establishing regulatory sandboxes to help startups and SMEs develop and test AI-fuelled innovations &#8212; and via the prospect of targeted EU funding to support AI developers.</p>
<p>Internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said investment is a crucial piece of the plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under our Digital Europe and Horizon Europe program we are going to free up a billion euros per year. And on top of that we want to generate private investment and a collective EU-wide investment of €20BN per year over the coming decade &#8212; the &#8216;digital decade&#8217; as we have called it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also want to have €140BN which will finance digital investments under Next Generation EU [COVID-19 recovery fund] &#8212; and going into AI in part.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaping rules for AI has been a key priority for EU president Ursula von der Leyen who took up her post at the end of 2019. A white paper was published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">last year</a>, following a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM-2018-237-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF">2018 AI for EU strategy</a> &#8212; and Vestager said that today&#8217;s proposal is the culmination of three years&#8217; work.</p>
<p>Breton added that providing guidance for businesses to apply AI will give them legal certainty and Europe an edge. &#8220;Trust&#8230; we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,&#8221; he said. [Applications of AI] need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory &#8212; that is absolutely crucial &#8212; but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology&#8230; We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines &#8212; we&#8217;ll say &#8216;hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden&#8217;. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also in the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.</p>
<p>&#8220;So come here &#8212; because artificial intelligence is about data &#8212; we&#8217;ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A version of today&#8217;s proposal </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/">leaked last week</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; leading to </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">calls by MEPs to beef up the plan</a>, such as<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> by banning remote biometric surveillance in public places.</span></p>
<p>In the event the final proposal does treat remote biometric surveillance as a particularly high risk application of AI &#8212; and there is a prohibition in principal on the use of the technology in public by law enforcement.</p>
<p>However use is not completely proscribed, with a number of exceptions where law enforcement would still be able to make use of it, subject to a valid legal basis and appropriate oversight.</p>
<h2>Protections attacked as too weak</h2>
<p>Reactions to the Commission&#8217;s proposal included criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement as well as concern that measures to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p>Criminal justice NGO, Fair Trials, said radical improvements are needed if the regulation is to contain meaningful safeguards in relation to criminal justice. Commenting in a statement, <span class="m_8756477441385340195normaltextrun">Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for the NGO said: &#8220;</span><span class="m_8756477441385340195normaltextrun">The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure <wbr></wbr>meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.</span><span class="m_8756477441385340195eop"> <u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p class="m_8756477441385340195paragraph"><u></u><span class="m_8756477441385340195normaltextrun">&#8220;The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice.</span><span class="m_8756477441385340195eop"> </span><u></u><u></u><span class="m_8756477441385340195normaltextrun">The framework must include <wbr></wbr>rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.&#8221;</span><span class="m_8756477441385340195eop"> </span></p>
<p>The Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties) also hit out at loopholes the NGO said would allow EU Member States to get around bans on problematic uses of AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are way too many problematic uses of the technology that are allowed, such as the use of algorithms to forecast crime or to have computers assess the emotional state of people at border control, both of which constitute serious human rights risks and pose a threat to the values of the EU,&#8221; warned Orsolya Reich, senior advocacy officer, in a statement. &#8220;We are also concerned that the police could use facial recognition technology in ways that endanger our fundamental rights and freedoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patrick Breyer, German Pirate MEP, also warned that the proposal falls short of meeting the claimed bar of respect for &#8216;European values&#8217;. The MEP was one of 40 who signed a letter to the Commission<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/eu-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-set-fines-as-high-as-4-of-global-turnover-per-leaked-draft/"> last week</a> warning then that a leaked version of the proposal didn&#8217;t go far enough in protecting fundamental rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must seize the opportunity to let the European Union bring artificial intelligence in line with ethical requirements and democratic values. Unfortunately, the Commission&#8217;s proposal fails to protect us from the dangers gender justice and equal treatment of all groups, such as through facial recognition systems or other kinds of mass surveillance,&#8221; said Breyer in a statement reacting to the formal proposal today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biometric and mass surveillance, profiling and behavioural prediction technology in our public spaces undermines our freedom and threatens our open societies. The European Commission&#8217;s proposal would bring the high-risk use of automatic facial recognition in public spaces to the entire European Union, contrary to the will of the majority of our people. The proposed procedural requirements are a mere smokescreen. We cannot allow the discrimination of certain groups of people and the false incrimination of countless individuals by these technologies&#8221;</p>
<p>European digital rights group, Edri, also highlighted what it dubbed a &#8220;worrying gap&#8221; in the proposal around &#8220;discriminatory and surveillance technologies&#8221;. &#8220;The regulation allows too wide a scope for self-regulation by companies profiting from AI. People, not companies need to be the centre of this regulation,&#8221; said Sarah Chander, senior policy lead on AI at Edri, in a statement.</p>
<p>Consumer rights umbrella group, BEUC, was also swiftly critical &#8212; attacking the Commission proposal as weak on consumer protection because it focuses on regulating &#8220;a very limited range of AI uses and issues&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The European Commission should have put more focus on helping consumers trust AI in their daily lives,&#8221; said Monique Goyens, Beuc director general, in a statement: &#8220;People should be able to trust any product or service powered by artificial intelligence, be it ‘high-risk’, ‘medium-risk’ or ‘low-risk’. The EU must do more to ensure consumers have enforceable rights, as well as access to redress and remedies in case something goes wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tech industry group Dot Europe (formerly Edima) &#8212; whose members include Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other platform giants &#8212; welcomed the release of the proposal but had yet to offer detailed remarks at the time of writing, saying it was formulating its position.</p>
<p>Other tech lobby groups didn&#8217;t wait to go on the attack at the prospect of red tape wrapping AI &#8212; claiming the regulation would &#8220;kneecap the EU&#8217;s nascent AI industry before it can learn to walk&#8221; as one Washington- and Brussels-based tech policy thinktank (the Center for Data Innovation) put it.</p>
<p>The CCIA trade association also quickly warned against &#8220;unnecessary red tape for developers and users&#8221;, adding that <span class="il">regulation</span> alone won&#8217;t make the EU a leader in <span class="il">AI</span>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s proposal kicks off the start of plenty of debate under the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, with the European Parliament and Member States via the EU Council needing to have their say on the draft &#8212; meaning a lot could change before EU institutions reach agreement on the final shape of a pan-EU AI regulation.</p>
<p>Commissioners declined to give a timeframe for when legislation might be adopted today, saying only that they hoped the other EU institutions would engage immediately and that the process could be done asap. It could, nonetheless, be several years before the regulation is ratified and comes in force.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As content moderation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/instagram-launches-tools-to-filter-out-abusive-dms-based-on-keywords-and-emojis-and-to-block-people-even-on-new-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues</a> to be a critical aspect of how social media platforms work &#8212; one that they may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/attorneys-general-from-twenty-states-call-on-facebook-to-do-more-to-fight-discrimination-disinformation-and-harrassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured</a> to get right, or at least do better in tackling &#8212; a startup that has built a set of data and image models to help with that, along with any other tasks that require automatically detecting objects or text, is announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://thehive.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive</a>, which has built a training data trove based on crowdsourced contributions from some 2 million people globally, which then powers a set of APIs that can be used to identify automatically images of objects, words and phrases &#8212; a process used not just in content moderation platforms, but also in building algorithms for autonomous systems, back-office data processing, and more &#8212; has raised $85 million in a Series D round of funding that the startup has confirmed values it at $2 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the heart of what we’re doing is building AI models that can help automate work that used to be manual,&#8221; said Kevin Guo, Hive&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;We’ve heard about RPA and other workflow automation, and that is important too but what that has also established is that there are certain things that humans should not have to do that is very structural, but those systems can&#8217;t actually address a lot of other work that is unstructured.&#8221; Hive&#8217;s models help bring structure to that other work, and Guo claims they provide &#8220;near human level accuracy.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding is being led by Glynn Capital, with General Catalyst, Tomales Bay Capital, Jericho Capital, and Bain &amp; Company, and other unnamed investors participating. The company has now raised $121 million, making this latest round a particularly big leap. </span></p>
<p>The company has been somewhat under the radar since it was founded in 2017, in what appears to have been a pivot from founder Kevin Guo&#8217;s previous startup, a Q&amp;A platform that was called Kiwi, which itself was a product of a project out of his time at Stanford. But since then it has quietly picked up some interesting customers, including Reddit, Yubo, Chatroulette, Omegle, and Tango, along with NBCUniversal, Interpublic Group, Walmart, Visa, Anheuser-Busch InBev, and more. In all it has some 100 customers and has grown more than 300% in the last year.</p>
<p>Hive had its start with image identification, and working with companies building autonomous systems. In fact, if you talk with Guo over Zoom, chances are you&#8217;ll get a screenshot of some of that work as a background, with cars darting across Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>These days, however, most of Hive&#8217;s activity (pardon the pun) comes around moderation, some of which includes images, but others including text and streamed audio &#8212; which is converted into text and then moderated as that would be. (The autonomous car modelling is still used as a backdrop, I believe, because it&#8217;s a little less disturbing than a content moderation image, as you can see below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141561" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141561" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141561" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hive-Content-Moderation-Landscape.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://thehive.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CC BY 2.0 <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> license.</p></div></p>
<p>In part because it&#8217;s a very classic problem that you can imagine will be solved or helped with the use of AI, and in part because it&#8217;s such a big issue on the internet today, there are a number of other startups building platforms to help manage online abuse, including harassment, and to help with content moderation.</p>
<p>They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentropy-launches-tool-for-people-to-protect-themselves-from-social-media-abuse-starting-with-twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sentropy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Block Party</a>, <a href="https://l1ght.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L1ght</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum Labs</a>, not to mention a lot of tools being built in-house by big technology companies themselves. (Instagram for example launched its latest tools to help users combat abuse in DMs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/instagram-launches-tools-to-filter-out-abusive-dms-based-on-keywords-and-emojis-and-to-block-people-even-on-new-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just today</a>: it built the whole thing in-house, the company told me.)</p>
<p>But as Kevin Guo describes it, what has set Hive apart from the crowd has been the crowd, so to speak. Over the last several years, the company has slowly been building up a trove of data by crowdsourcing feedback from some 2 million users, who get paid &#8212; either in &#8216;normal&#8217; money or Bitcoin &#8212; to go through various images and items of text in order to identify &#8220;abuse&#8221; or other things. (Bitcoin started as a fringe offering and now accounts for the majority of how contributors get paid, Guo said.)</p>
<p>That database in turn powers a set of APIs used by Hive&#8217;s customers to help them run their own moderation tools, or whatever workflow requires frequent and rapid identification.</p>
<p>Most of the language learning in the system right now is based around English and several other popular global languages such as Spanish and French. Some of the funding will be used to help expand its reach and global coverage, including into a wider set of tongues. This is also leading to a wider set of use cases for the data and technology that Hive has built.</p>
<p>One of these, Guo said, includes a new approach to advertising that is based around serving ads associated with something you may have just read or seen on the screen. Very GDPR friendly because it involves absolutely no involvement of data based you or your online browsing activities (anonymised or not), this is picking up traction with brands who initially may have come to Hive to help protect their IP or reputation management, and are now considering how they can use the tool to spread the word about themselves in more effective ways.</p>
<p>The possibilities for how Hive&#8217;s AI can be used in the future, is part of what attracted the investment today. The focus on how it has been built in the cloud underscores that extensibility.</p>
<p>“Cloud computing has seen tremendous adoption in recent years, but only a small fraction of companies currently leverage cloud-based machine learning solutions,” said Charlie Friedland, principal at Glynn Capital, in a statement. “We believe cloud-hosted machine learning models will represent one of the most significant components of cloud growth in the years to come, and Hive is well-positioned as an early leader in the space.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable to me that for now at least Hive doesn&#8217;t disclose any big technology companies among its customers. That may partly be due to NDAs, but Guo points out that their in-house activities, which include heavy doses of human involvement, have made them somewhat less willing customers up to now. That could be changing however, not just because AI tools are improving, but because of the problems that have arisen from some of the current routes, such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run of controversial stories</a> about social media content moderators and the traumas that they have faced.</p>
<p>In terms of future deals, those might come by way of some of Hive&#8217;s strategic backers and strategic partnerships. The company currently works with companies like Cognizant, Comscore and Bain (which is an investor), who in turn provide consulting and services to larger tech companies that have opted to outsource some of their human moderation work. Whether those human moderators shift up practices or not, chances are that tech will be playing an increasing role in the bigger process of trying to give more structure both to shaping and adhering to abuse policies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some of the most popular running apps are still lagging behind on security and privacy. That&#8217;s the verdict from security researchers who examined the leading running apps five years apart and found only a few apps had improved — and not by much.</p>
<p>Running apps know and learn a lot about you as you use them. Your health data, like your height and weight, are used to calculate how many calories you burn, and your location data can track your workout route from door-to-door.</p>
<p>But in the wrong hands, this data can identify where you live or where you work. In 2018, Strava said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/strava-simplify-privacy-options-review-features/">simplify its privacy features</a> to allow its users greater control over their data, after researchers found Strava app users were <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/strava-anonymized-fitness-tracking-data-government-opsec/">inadvertently sharing their workout data</a> and revealing military bases and secret government facilities.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at U.K. cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners say many of the top apps — Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Nike Run Club, and Runtastic — still <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/training-apps-have-their-privacy-settings-improved-in-5-years/ ">don&#8217;t use basic security measures</a> to prevent hackers from breaking in, or health and fitness data spilling out.</p>
<p>Only Runtastic had set a stronger password policy over the past five years, while the other apps still allow some of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords">the most basic passwords</a> like &#8220;123456&#8221; and &#8220;password,&#8221; the researchers found in their testing. Malicious hackers often automate their attacks by targeting user accounts with known or easy-to-guess passwords. Worse, none of the apps allow users to set up two-factor authentication, a feature that puts an additional barrier in place to prevent malicious hackers from reusing stolen passwords. Data from Google shows even the simplest form of two-factor authentication <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/google-data-two-factor-security/">can prevent most</a> automated password reuse attacks.</p>
<p>We asked each of the app makers why they had not implemented two-factor authentication. None of the companies commented.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that while Runtastic, Nike Run Club, and MapMyRun had improved their privacy controls, Strava had seen &#8220;no significant change.&#8221;</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/training-apps-have-their-privacy-settings-improved-in-5-years/ ">their report</a>: &#8220;Strava and Runkeeper are configured to publicly share user data by default. It is possible to change these settings in the application, but it takes some time to find them and set them correctly, which is probably not the first consideration for a regular user.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nike Run Club, Runtastic and MapMyRun [were] found to have better privacy policy settings enabled, which means they do not share users’ data by default, like the other applications do. They only share your training information with friends or followers,&#8221; the report said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Late-stage Fintech startup <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en">Pleo</a>, which offers expense management tools and ‘smart’ company Mastercards, says it plans to raise a Series C round of funding this summer. It’s also launching a B2B bill payments service this week.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jeppe Rindom told me via a call: “We have money until 2022, but we&#8217;ve seen incredible momentum in the past couple of quarters, and we are getting a lot of inbound interest so we will be fundraising a Series C round in the Summer and will be raising around $100 million.”</p>
<p>Pleo has raised $78.8 million to date. Its last funding round was $56M in May 2019. Its main investors include Seedcamp, Creandum, Kinnevik, Stripes and  Founders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup competes on some levels with Dext, Soldo, Spendesk and Expensify.</p>
<p>Pleo is today launching Bills, a platform to consolidate, track and pay business-to-business bill payments and a supplier’s terms of service. It will offer free-of-charge domestic transfers.</p>
<p>Bills are automatically processed using Pleo’s OCR technology and cross-referenced for duplication and validated for authenticity before being approved for payment</p>
<p>In addition, it will offer approval control for admins and free domestic transfers.</p>
<p>Rindom added: “Since 66% of admins told us that they spent half their time on processing bills as well as authenticating the validity of them, it became our mission to simplify this complicated process and provide an end-to-end overview of it.”</p>
<p>Pleo was founded in Copenhagen in 2015 by Rindom and Niccolo Perra, who were early team members Tradeshift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As businesses continue to adopt new digital tools to get their names out into the world, a startup that&#8217;s built a sales and marketing platform specifically for small and medium businesses is announcing a big round of funding. <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActiveCampaign</a>, which has built what it describes as a &#8220;customer experience automation&#8221; platform &#8212; providing a way not just to run digital campaigns but to follow up aspects of them automatically to make sales and marketing work more efficiently &#8212; has closed a $240 million round of funding. The Series C values the Chicago startup at over $3 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by a new, big-name investor, Tiger Global, with participation from another new backer Dragoneer, along with Susquehanna Growth Equity and Silversmith Capital Partners, which had both invested previously.</p>
<p>This funding round represents a huge leap for ActiveCampaign. It was only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/chicagos-activecampaign-raises-100m-for-an-all-in-one-marketing-and-sales-automation-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2020 that it raised $100 million</a>, and before that, the company, which was founded in 2003, had only raised $20 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But as we have seen in many other ways, the pandemic resulted in a surge of interest among businesses to do more &#8212; a lot more &#8212; online than ever before, not least because so many people were spending more time at home, carrying out their consumer lives over the internet. That led to ActiveCampaign growing to a customer base of 145,000 customers, up from 90,000 16 months ago.</p>
<p>That points not just to the company already growing at a decent clip before the pandemic, but how it capitalized on that at a time when companies were looking for more tools to run their businesses in the new world.</p>
<p>The growth was not about ActiveCampaign throwing more money into business development, founder and CEO Jason VandeBoom said in an interview. &#8220;It was the network effect of people finding success. Even today, organic word of mouth is our primary driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s tools fit into a wider overall trend in the world of business: automation, built on the back of new, cloud-based technology, is being adopted to carry out some of the less interesting and repetitive aspects of running a business.</p>
<p>In the case of sales, an example of what ActiveCampaign might provide is a way for an e-commerce business to identify when a logged-in customer (that is, a user who has an account already and is signed in) might have &#8216;abandoned&#8217; a visit to a site before buying a product that had already been searched for, or clicked on, or even added to a cart. In these cases, it sends an email to customers reminding them of those items, with options for other follow-ups, in the event that the choice was due to being distracted or having second thoughts that might be persuaded otherwise.</p>
<p>Users can opt-out of these, but they can be useful given the genuine distraction exercise that is browsing online &#8212; with all of the unrelated notifications, plus other options for considering a purchase. Tellingly, ActiveCampaign integrates with 850 different apps, a measure of just how fragmented the online landscape is, and also how many ways your attention might be distracted, or snagged depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Abandoned carts can cost a company, in aggregate, a lot of lost revenue, yet chasing those down is not the kind of task that a company would typically assign to a valuable employee to carry out. And that&#8217;s where companies like ActiveCampaign come in.</p>
<p>This, plus some 500 other actions like it around sales and marketing campaigns &#8212; Vandenboom calls them &#8220;recipes&#8221; &#8212; some of which have been contributed by ActiveCampaign&#8217;s own users, form the basis of the company&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The marketing and sales automation market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars today, and, thanks to the rise of social media and simply more places to spend time online (and more time spent online) is expected to be <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-marketing-automation-software-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth more than $8 billion by 2027</a>, so it&#8217;s going after a lucrative and much-used tool for doing business online. (And others are looking at it as well, of couse, including newer entrants like Shopify coming from a different angle to the same problem. Shopify today is a valued partner of the company, Vandeboom said when I asked him about it.)</p>
<p>That gives ActiveCampaign not just a big opportunity to continue targeting, but possibly also makes it a target itself, for an acquisition.</p>
<p>The other key aspect of ActiveCampaign&#8217;s growth that is worth watching is related to its customers. While the company has a client base that includes recognized names like the <a href="https://www.msichicago.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Museum of Science and Industry</a> based out of ActiveCampaign&#8217;s hometown, it also has <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 145,000 others</a> across nearly 200 countries with a big emphasis on small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>SMBs form the vast majority of all businesses globally, collectively representing a huge win for tech companies that can capture them as customers. But traditionally, they have proven to be a challenging sector, given that they cover so many different verticals, are in many ways more price-sensitive than their enterprise-sized counterparts, among other factors.</p>
<p>So for ActiveCampaign to have found successful traction with SMBs &#8212; including with pricing that works for many of them (using it starts at $9 for accounts with less than 500 contacts) &#8212; is likely another reason why the startup has caught the eye of investors keen to back winning horses.</p>
<p>While the company did not need to raise money, Vandeboom said he &#8220;saw it as an opportunity to bring in more partners, saying that investors like how it purposely went after the idea of customer experience not on vertical or locale.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric scooters powered by <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/">Gogoro</a>’s swappable, rechargeable batteries now account <a href="https://www.gogoro.com/news/2019-25-of-total-taiwan">for nearly a quarter of monthly sales in Taiwan</a>, its home market. But one of the most frequent questions co-founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke gets asked is when will Gogoro launch its scooters in other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always said, ‘we’re getting ready, we’re getting ready, we’re getting ready,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. Gogoro answered that question today by announcing a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.heromotocorp.com/en-in/">Hero MotoCorp</a>, one of the world’s largest two-wheeled vehicle maker and <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/auto/industry/top-10-two-wheeler-manufacturers-india-2020-market-share-hero-motocorp-honda-tvs-bajaj-royal-enfield/2174956/">the market leader in India</a>, where it is headquartered.</p>
<p>Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp’s agreement includes a joint venture to build a battery swapping network in India. Hero MotoCorp will also launch electric two-wheelers based on Gogoro technology under its own brand. This will mark the first time the company has launched electric vehicles. (The partnership is not to be confused with <a href="https://heroelectric.in/">Hero Electric</a>, which is run by relatives of Hero MotoCorp’s founders, but <a href="https://www.livemint.com/">is a separate company</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The deal will focus on India before expanding into Hero MotoCorp’s other markets (it serves a total of 40 countries). Details, like the first vehicle, launch cities and pricing, will be announced later, but Luke said Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp &#8220;are deploying very rapidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luke described the strategic partnership as a validation of Gogoro’s goal to become a battery swapping and smart mobility platform, packaging its technology as a turnkey solution for companies that want to produce energy-efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We designed our technology, capabilities and business model in the hope that one day we can solicit a giant like Hero,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>The first Gogoro Smartscooter was launched in 2015. Since then, it has struck partnerships with manufacturers like Yamaha, PGO and A-Motor to build electric scooters with its technology under their own brands, but Gogoro’s international rollout has been very gradual: for example, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/gogoro-launches-its-electric-scooters-for-businesses-in-south-korea/">delivery fleet in South Korea</a> and a partnership with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/coup-shuts-down-its-electric-moped-scooter-service/">now-defunct</a> scooter-sharing service Coup in Europe. Its first product launch in the United States was for Eeyo, its electric bike brand, instead of scooters.</p>

<p>Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp have been talking for more than a year and Luke described the the strategic partnership as one of the most important deals the company has made so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to make a massive change, we need really massive adoption, and Taiwan has served really well as a pilot market for us to develop technology, refine it and show the world that it is possible, through this swap-and-go technology rather than tethered plug-and-charge scenario, for lightweight personal mobility to take off,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>But India is obviously a much larger market, in terms of geography and population, than Taiwan. The Indian government wants to put more electric vehicles on the road <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/govt-aims-to-support-through-subsidies-62000-e-cars-buses-15l-electric-3-2-wheelers-gadkari/articleshow/80865193.cms?from=mdr">with subsidy programs</a>, and the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/industry/energy/indias-record-high-pump-prices-threaten-road-to-recovery-11614817160798.html">high cost of fuel in the country</a> is another incentive for people to make the switch from gas to electric. One major barrier for many consumers, however, is &#8220;range anxiety,&#8221; or concerns about how long their electric vehicle can run on a charge.</p>
<p>This is why Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp&#8217;s swapping station joint venture is important. In Taiwan, Gogoro now has more than 375,000 riders and 2,000 battery swapping/charging stations, which handle 265,000 swaps a day. That density is a key selling point because riders can find a nearby swapping station quickly through Gogoro’s smartphone app.</p>

<p>Gogoro’s batteries and charging stations are connected to its Gogoro Network cloud service, which monitors the condition of battery and manages how quickly they are charged. This allows the batteries to last longer&#8211;Luke said that the company has not retired any of its Smart Batteries in six years. Data from the Gogoro Network also shows the company where it needs to place more stations. In India, Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp will start with densely-populated areas, before adding stations based on demand, similar to Gogoro’s approach to its network in Taiwan.</p>
<p>After India, Gogoro and Hero MotoCorp plan to enter other markets, furthering Gogoro’s international expansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is really important about this partnership is their influence on the two-wheel market, and the importance of the two-wheel market in emerging markets,&#8221; said Luke.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Hero MotoCorp chairman and CEO Dr. Pawan Munjal said the strategic partnership is an extension of the research and development has already put into creating an electric vehicle portfolio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks another major milestone in our journey, as we bring Hero’s leadership in two-wheelers, our global scale and innovation powerhouse, with the leadership of Gogoro in the swapping business model, as they have demonstrated over the years in Taiwan and the rest of the world,&#8221; Munjal added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv’s <a href="http://www.orca-ai.io/">Orca AI</a>, a computer vision startup that can be retrofitted to cargo ships and improve navigation and collision avoidance, has raised $13 million in a Series A funding, taking its total raised to over $15.5 million. While most cargo ships carry security cameras, computer vision cameras are rare. Orca AI hopes its solution could introduce autonomous guidance to vessels already at sea.</p>
<p>There are over 4,000 annual marine incidents, largely due to human error. The company says this is getting worse as the Coronavirus pandemic makes it harder for regular crew changes. The recent events in the Suez Canal have highlighted how crucial this industry is.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by OCV Partners, with Principal Zohar Loshitzer joining Orca AI’s board. Mizmaa Ventures and Playfair Capital also featured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by naval technology experts, Yarden Gross and Dor Raviv. The latter is an former Israel navy computer vision expert. Customers include Kirby, Ray Car Carriers and NYK.</p>
<p>Orca AI’s AI-based navigation and vessel tracking system supports ships in difficult to tricky to navigate situations and congested waterways, using vision sensors, thermal and low light cameras, plus algorithms that look at the environment and alert crews to dangerous situations.</p>
<p>On the raise, Yarden Gross, CEO, and co-founder said: “The maritime industry… is still far behind aviation with technological innovations. Ships deal with increasingly congested waterways, severe weather and low-visibility conditions creating difficult navigation experiences with often expensive cargo… Our solution provides unique insight and data to any ship in the world, helping to reduce these challenging situations and collisions in the future.” </p>
<p>Zohar Loshitzer, Principal from OCV added: “Commercial shipping has historically been a highly regulated and traditional industry. However, we are now “witnessing a positive change in the adoption of tech solutions to increase safety and efficiency.</p>
