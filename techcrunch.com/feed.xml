					<description><![CDATA[Clarifai enables customers to make sense of the 90% of unstructured data they have using artificial intelligence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.clarifai.com/">Clarifai</a> wants to bring artificial intelligence into the lives of developers, business operators and data scientists so they can automate and accelerate their model development.</p>
<p>Matt Zeiler founded the New York-based company in 2013 focused on computer vision. Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">$30 million Series B in 2016</a>, Clarifai has been rolling out new capabilities and products targeting a company’s unstructured image, video, text and audio data files.</p>
<p>The new functionalities include natural language processing, audio recognition, scanning and an automated data labeling feature, Scribe, that was launched last year. It is also deploying its Edge AI capability that layers AI on top of data streams using various local hardware, from high-powered servers to cameras and drones. The company plans to unveil even more at its annual deep learning conference, Perceive 2021, on October 20.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218308" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amid all of that activity — and to keep it going — Clarifai on Friday announced a $60 million Series C funding round, led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from existing investors Menlo Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital, LDV Capital, Corazon Capital and NYU Innovation Venture Fund, and new investors CPP Investments, Next Equity Partners, SineWave Ventures and Trousdale Capital. The latest round brings the company’s total funding raised to $100 million.</p>
<p>“We managed to go a long time without raising more funding,” Zeiler told TechCrunch. “We grew our revenue significantly while controlling costs and operating efficiently. We saw an opportunity and raised the round.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clarifai raises $30M to give developers visual search capabilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/embed/#?secret=NowhkikKWZ" data-secret="NowhkikKWZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That opportunity included having the right team in place to execute enterprise sales, he added. In the early days of the company, the market was immature, so Clarifai started selling to small businesses and individuals. Now it is closing deals with Fortune 500 companies as the market has matured.</p>
<p>To the company, “unstructured data&#8221; is data that the human brain is good at, but computers are not, like images, videos and text. This is something that enterprises have steadily realized has huge value, and in fact up to 95% of a company’s data is unstructured, providing “a huge opportunity” for Clarifai, Zeiler said.</p>
<p>When the company started to see those enterprise signals in the market, it went after the Series C. It also partnered with Snowflake with an integration to link Clarifai with recently released unstructured data support from Snowflake.</p>
<p>“Snowflake has a $100 billion business built on structured data, and now it is doing unstructured data,” Zeiler added. “If customers are storing data with Snowflake, they can get value from it, they need AI from Clarifai to make sense of it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2218355" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218355" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218355" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png" alt="Clarifai" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png 1904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=1536,850 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218355" class="wp-caption-text">Clarifai product pipeline. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clarifai</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company more than doubled its revenue over the last year and topped 130,000 users. The Series C funding enables Clarifai to scale its global team of 100 employees with plans to double that by next year.</p>
<p>The company will also invest in sales and marketing, as well as an international expansion. It already has an office in Estonia, and Zeiler is looking at Australia, India and Turkey, where it is amassing more customers. It will also continue to work on its Edge AI product, which just attracted its first commercial client.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Andrew Schoen, partner at NEA, joins Clarifai’s board of directors. The company was on his radar for a number of years, but Schoen felt at the time Clarifai was too early for investment.</p>
<p>“The early winds in AI were all around structured data, which was the low-hanging fruit since 90% of data is unstructured,” he said. “Now that the ecosystem is mature, companies realize the bottleneck of having squeezed everything they can out of the structured data. Now they have all that unstructured data they can’t use and it isn’t neatly organized. Clarifai is aimed at solving that problem.”</p>
<p>He sees Clarifai demystifying and democratizing AI and machine learning. Due to the company’s early focus on unstructured data, it was able to get some early adopters and is now leading in this area.</p>
<p>In addition, he says the team began an inflection point over the past 12 months with revenue projections and has a business “that is growing nicely.”</p>
<p>“The company had to work to land customers and educate the market, but now instead of pushing the market, it is pulling as companies look for solutions and see Clarifai is the right product,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">January 2020 seems like a long time ago: Billie Eilish swept the Grammy Awards, Tesla&#8217;s market cap made it America&#8217;s most valuable car company, and Visa announced plans to purchase Plaid for $5.3 billion.</p>
<p>A year later, the credit card giant balked at the deal after it attracted regulatory scrutiny, but Ryan Lawler reports that &#8220;the year wasn&#8217;t a total loss for the data connectivity startup.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/inside-plaids-plans-to-build-a-new-global-finance-network/">He spoke to CEO Zach Perret, CTO Jean-Denis Greze and COO Eric Sager</a> about what they learned while working with Visa, and looked at some new platform features designed to build customer trust while eliciting better insights.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Despite the outcome not being what we predicted when we went in, I think we as a company grew a lot and learned a lot,” said Perret.</p>

<p>Account-based marketing makes it easier to engage with key customers at the right moment, but for many early-stage startups desperate to reach takeoff velocity, ABM isn’t viewed as something they can do.</p>
<p>“This couldn’t be further from the truth, and both startups and SMBs can, and should, invest in ABM strategies,” advises Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, an Amsterdam-based growth agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a post that offers a detailed overview, van de Poel identifies “distinctive characteristics” of businesses that should consider ABM strategies, along with specific recommendations for implementing them.</p>
<p>“With a handful of smart growth tactics and clever tools, ABM strategies don’t have to break the bank to be successful,” he writes.</p>

<p>Global startup funding has soared this year, but a number of exits and large funding rounds are drawing new attention to India&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm interviewed GV Ravishankar, managing director with Sequoia India, and Kunal Bajaj, head of capital for Blume Ventures, about the trends they&#8217;re seeing.</p>
<p>“Whether it is product-led growth, community-led, customer-led or what have you,” Bajaj said, “modern go-to-market playbooks have caused a fundamental shift in the software-as-a-service market by creating 10x+ as many buying/retention signals.</p>
<p>Accordingly, super-specialized GTM strategies are now the norm, not the exception.”</p>

<p>Analytics startup Mixpanel burst out of the gate in 2009, scoring big wins as it scooped up new users and approached the $100 million ARR mark, but by 2017, &#8220;it lacked focus, it was losing customers, and many of the customers it had weren’t terribly pleased with it,&#8221; reports Ron Miller.</p>
<p>To learn more about how the company course-corrected by returning to its roots, he interviewed Mixpanel CEO Amir Movafaghi, VP of people and strategy Amy Hsuan, and VP of product and design, Neil Rahilly.</p>
<p>“When you decide to make a huge strategic shift like this, it’s really a case of taking a step backward to take two steps forward, because in the short-term, there’s lots of pain,&#8221; Rahilly said.</p>

<p>GitLab stock popped 35% in its first day of trading, but before the bell rang, Alex Wilhelm shared his thinking about its $77 debut price, up from an initial range of $55 to $60. His conclusions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue growth is good, but revenue growth with top-tier SaaS metrics is god-tier.</li>
<li>You can go public with a top-five public multiple.</li>
<li>Public markets could be, somehow, warmer than private markets.</li>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My fiancé and I got engaged early this year. We’re planning a wedding for later in the year when my family can travel to the U.S. from Estonia, where I’m originally from. I’ve been living and working in the U.S. for almost two years on an L-1A visa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company is sponsoring me for an EB-1C green card, but the process has been slow. I’m thinking about getting a green card through my spouse when we’re married.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular that I should keep in mind? Also, would it be a problem if I keep my maiden name after my fiancé and I get married?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fantastic Fiancée</strong></p>

<p>Predictive modeling is used for customer relationship management, health care and forecasting TV ratings, but more startup founders should be using it to inform their fundraising, suggests Billy Libby, CEO and co-founder of hybrid fund Upper90.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data can separate the healthy and experimental parts of all businesses, making it easier to utilize earnings, marketing ROI and inventory to make predictions about or get credit for future revenue streams,&#8221; he writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post.</p>

<p>Blockdaemon CEO Konstantin Richter is hiring at least 10 engineers a month.</p>
<p>“You can’t overlook the elephant in the room — money talks,” the CEO writes in a guest column for TechCrunch+.</p>
<p>Setting aside the $100,000 bounty the company now offers its recruiters, Richter also shares his company&#8217;s compensation framework. For example, instead of a yearly salary review, Blockdaemon revisits the matter every six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;This helps build a meritocratic and less bureaucratic culture, and ensures our team reaps the benefits commensurate with their work product,&#8221; he says.</p>

		Ran Ronen is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://equally.ai/">Equally AI</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The technology sector is filled with amazing examples of innovation and collaboration coming together to make the world a better, more accessible place for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>For example, hearing aids empower millions of people to perceive once-unimaginable sounds, and today’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hearing-aids-are-getting-smarter-11568599441">next-generation hearing aids</a> are making that process even more immersive and effective.</p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/08/the-five-technology-to-help-disabled-people-blindness-paralysis-research-ai">scientists are developing gloves</a> that translate sign language into speech, enabling a real-time dialogue with people who are not proficient in sign language. Even everyday technologies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/accessibility-in-tech-2020-150002855.html">like smartphones and video games</a>, are becoming more accessible, proving that tech innovators have the inspiration and capacity to build a more equitable society.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216259" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These are just a few of the incredible technological developments enhancing accessibility every day. Tech accessibility is critical to social connection, professional proliferation and civic engagement.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t stop now. Here are three ways we can harness those efforts today to build better technology for everyone.</p>
<h2>Engage your community</h2>
<p>Tech products and services require unique accessibility solutions, and what makes one product more usable for people with disabilities may not apply to another. Therefore, tech companies should engage their community to identify existing accessibility pain points.</p>
<p>For instance, web accessibility, a significant challenge for people with disabilities, includes a cadre of potential solutions, models that tech innovators will need to assess, select and implement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only will community engagement help direct developers’ efforts, but it will help create cohesion between tech platforms and their users, allowing them to continually adapt their products and services to maximize accessibility.</p>
<p>In addition, it will help web developers avoid implementing haphazard or ineffective solutions by engaging the community to determine what’s needed and what works best.</p>
<h2>Focus on where you can be most effective &#8212; and set goals</h2>
<p>Using the insights from community engagement initiatives, focus your efforts on where you can be most effective. Determine the most pressing accessibility hurdles and establish concrete milestones to measure progress.</p>
<p>For tech innovators looking to make digital assets more accessible, this might include setting internal goals for content creators and developers to make strategic alterations to existing or upcoming digital content.</p>
<p>While the scope and sequence will look different for every company, focusing on where you can be most effective and measuring that progress will help ensure that accessibility goals become a reality.</p>
<h2>Commit your resources</h2>
<p>Better accessibility is an obvious win-win, empowering more people to participate in digital platforms and services while increasing tech companies&#8217; user numbers and engagement levels.</p>
<p>However, it will require an investment to make forward progress, and f<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ailing to plan properly can diminish overall outcomes. The back-end ROI is incredible, so consider the upfront investment a down payment on a more engaged, committed and empowered user base.</span></p>
<p>As digital products change and evolve, accessibility standards and best practices will need to adapt as well. Don’t make accessibility a one-time priority that fails to deliver long-term, sustainable results. Instead, routinely engage your community and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Technology can make the world a better place, which is best achieved when more people can participate in these platforms and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Saturday, some Instacart shoppers will go on strike, protesting the company&#8217;s low pay and lack of communication with its laborers. The action is led by the <a href="https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/home">Gig Workers Collective</a>, formed in early 2020, though Instacart shoppers have organized several walk-offs since 2016. At the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S., for instance, the collective <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/27/instacart-shopper-strike-covid-19/">rallied</a> for better safety precautions amid the outbreak.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gigworkerscollective.org/home">Gig Workers Collective</a> &#8212; representing a body of about 13,000 of Instacart&#8217;s 500,000 shoppers &#8212; launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/?tpcc=ECTW2020">a campaign last month</a> urging customers to delete the Instacart app as a show of solidarity with shoppers&#8217; demands. But Instacart didn&#8217;t address <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/deleteinstacart-b1e138ed88f3">the collective&#8217;s demands</a>, which include being paid by individual order, not by a batch of orders; to re-introduce item-based commissions; to ensure the rating system doesn’t punish shoppers for issues beyond their control; to provide occupational death benefits; and to make the default tip at least 10%, up from the current 5% default. Now, the shopper activists will <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-shoppers-announce-walk-off-3db7f7208ef3">go on strike</a> until these demands are met.</p>
<p>Some shoppers are frustrated that despite Instacart&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/instacarts-valuation-doubles-to-39-billion.html">$39 billion valuation</a>, they feel it&#8217;s becoming harder to make a reasonable hourly rate on the platform. In the past, Instacart had a $10 minimum on earnings for each batch a shopper completed (batches can contain between one and three individual customers&#8217; orders). But after founder and former CEO Apoorva Mehta<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts"> publicly apologized</a> in February 2019 for subsidizing this $10 minimum with shoppers&#8217; tips, the minimum batch pay changed to $7 for full-service shoppers, who both pick the groceries and deliver them. Instacart framed this as &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/instacart-ceo-apologizes-for-tipping-debacle/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts">a higher guaranteed floor</a>&#8221; &#8212; the previous minimum batch payment was $3, though shoppers always got at least $10 b<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ecause of the established minimum (which was paid for in part with shoppers&#8217; own tips, unbeknownst to them at the time). But with that policy removed, some shoppers are making even less money than they were before the policy change. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218080" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Now, a shopper might fill three customers&#8217; individual orders for a minimum total of $7 base pay, before tips. Instacart told TechCrunch that it considers items, mileage, weight and other factors when determining payment for a batch. But Willy Solis, a lead organizer for the Gig Workers Collective and Instacart shopper, told TechCrunch that there&#8217;s &#8220;no rhyme or reason&#8221; to the way orders are combined into batches.</span></p>
<p>“You would think that they would be in the same geographic location that you’re delivering to, but they’re not,” he said. “It can be totally different parts of the city, so you have to drive east for one and west for the other.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instacart told TechCrunch that batching orders makes it possible for shoppers to earn three individual tips off of one trip to the grocery store. But this means that shoppers can only earn decent compensation if their customers tip appropriately. When customers go to check out, the default tip option is 5%. One of the collective&#8217;s goals of the strike is to raise the default to 10%, which was standard on the platform in 2016. If a customer tips higher than 5%, that percentage will auto-populate as the default for their next order, but shoppers are still finding that they aren&#8217;t making adequate hourly wages.</p>
<p>The Gig Workers Collective told TechCrunch that workers have seen a significant slash to their earnings over the last three months. A shopper in Canada, Daniel Feuer recently wrote an open letter to Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, who took the helm of the company <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/pressreleases/instacart-appoints-board-member-fidji-simo-to-chief-executive-officer-and-announces-founder-and-current-ceo-apoorva-mehta-will-serve-as-executive-chairman-of-the-board/">in July</a>. He created a graph that shows his hourly wage over the last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not gone unnoticed that, in the company’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/upcoming-ipos/">pre-IPO</a> drive to profitability, batch earnings pay has been drastically cut,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;See how it starts dropping in May this year?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218151" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218151" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218151" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="421" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png 976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instacart-earnings-chart.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218151" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daniel Feuer</p></div></p>
<p>Other shoppers have also observed that their pay has gone down over time. Shoppers pay for their own gas, car insurance and car expenses, so their take-home pay stretches less far than it might seem.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;My pay has gone down probably 70% since I started four years ago,&#8221; said Sharon Goen, a 58-year-old Instacart shopper based in Las Vegas, Nevada. “It used to be that anything over 24 items, you get a bump in pay. Now, it’s $7 a batch. I saw one the other day that had 77 unique items, 100 units, for $7. You can’t go through the store and get 77 items in 15 minutes. You’re there for an hour and a half.”</span></p>
<p>Anni McClung, a shopper based in Houston, Texas, started shopping on Instacart four months ago. But she&#8217;s already confused by how pay is calculated.</p>
<p class="p1">“I would like someone to explain to me why for one batch I get $7, for two batches I get $7, and for three batches I get $7. Seems like they have to pay me $21,&#8221; McClung told TechCrunch. “Why is it $7 for half a mile, and also $7 for 6.8 miles?&#8221;</p>
<p>McClung, who will participate in the strike, said that she tried to contact Instacart&#8217;s customer service line for shoppers to learn how mileage is calculated into base pay for a batch. She said that she was routed to three different representatives without receiving an answer.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Instacart to clarify how base pay is impacted by the distance a shopper has to drive. The company said that mileage is incorporated into a shopper&#8217;s base pay at a rate of $0.60 per mile from store to customer delivery, except in California, where the rate is $0.30 per mile. But shoppers aren&#8217;t seeing that value reflected in their batches. Instacart declined to tell TechCrunch whether or not the $7 minimum is inclusive of the $0.60 per mile driven. If that is the case, then that would explain why shoppers might see a batch that&#8217;s 5 miles away for less than $8 &#8212; if the mileage were added to the minimum labor fee, then a 5-mile drive would give the shopper an extra $3 to their $7 base.</p>

<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Instacart contracted </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/instacart-will-bring-on-300000-new-full-time-shoppers-due-to-coronavirus/">300,000 more shoppers</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> during the coronavirus pandemic since the demand for grocery delivery was higher than ever. Instacart told TechCrunch that its shopper population has remained steady at around 500,000 shoppers since then, and that customer demand is four times higher than it was at the start of 2020. Since March 2020, Instacart said shoppers have earned more than $5.5 billion on the platform. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But as customers adapt to the conditions of the pandemic, shoppers observe that fewer customers are using the service, making it harder to get work on the app. Instacart said that there are waitlists in many regions to become a shopper. Shoppers that spoke to TechCrunch from Nevada, Texas, and New York all reported that their markets are oversaturated with shoppers&#8217; demand for batches to fill.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning of the pandemic, it was great. I was making anywhere from $1200 to $1500 a week only working about 30 hours or so,&#8221; said JoJo Spatafora, a shopper in Staten Island, New York who has been with Instacart for three years. &#8220;But it seems as if things have changed and they over-hired. Instacart has been aware of this and has not done anything about it. They only care about customers, not their shoppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, shoppers would set the hours they wanted to work, and during that time, they would be individually assigned batches &#8212; they had four minutes to look it over and decide if they wanted to accept before it would be assigned to someone else. Since 2019, Instacart has used an on-demand system, where shoppers can choose to work at a moment&#8217;s notice. Because of that, many shoppers will be offered a batch at once, which shows the base pay, tip, distance to drive, and a preview of the items in the order &#8212; whoever swipes on the batch first gets the job. Goen told TechCrunch that her area is so oversaturated with shoppers that when a batch pops up, she needs to accept it without taking much time to look over the details.</p>
<p class="p1">“I’m 58 years old, and if I see something that’s got a decent pay, I don’t have the time to see how many cases of water are going to a third-floor apartment,&#8221; Goen said. &#8220;I just can’t physically do those kinds of orders anymore, and if I were to accept that and then cancel it, that would go against my acceptance rate.” If a shopper has canceled around 15% of their last 100 orders, they will start to receive notices from Instacart before their account is suspended.</p>
<p>Shoppers going on strike hope that this action will get the attention of CEO Fidji Simo. Instacart told TechCrunch that Simo has been regularly conversing with shoppers about their experiences on the job, but Simo hasn&#8217;t responded to the Gig Workers Collective&#8217;s open letters.</p>
<p class="p1">“As far as the strike, I don&#8217;t participate in such nonsense because it does not make a difference,&#8221; Spatafora told TechCrunch. &#8220;Once when shoppers went on strike, Instacart decided to punish us by removing the three-dollar bonus every time a customer gives us a five-star rating.”</p>
<p>Spatafora is referring to a past Instacart policy that would give shoppers an extra $3 for each order they completed with a 5-star rating. Workers were <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/instacart-removes-worker-bonus-just-days-after-shoppers-strike-625aa71cf6b4">tipped off</a> that the bonus would last through January 2020. But when shoppers went on strike in November 2019 to demand that the default tip be raised from 5% back to 10%, the company <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/instacart-removes-worker-bonus-just-days-after-shoppers-strike-625aa71cf6b4">removed the bonus</a> soon after. Instacart said that it always planned to end the bonus in November 2019, but the Gig Workers Collective claimed that this was <a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-has-retaliated-against-us-update-a3de66cd713">an act of retaliation</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">“Are we really going to impact business? Probably not,&#8221; said Goen. Instacart affirmed to TechCrunch that they don&#8217;t expect to see a change in their revenue. &#8220;But this will be my sixth walk-off I think. I’m going to keep doing it ’til we make progress. And we have made progress every now and then.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Continuum’s model does the outbound work for companies and presents a list of executives, within 48 hours, who are available to start that day, working 15 or 20 hours per week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s difficult for startups on a small budget to attract executives with the knowledge base to propel them forward, but <a href="https://www.joincontinuum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuum</a>, a talent marketplace for fractional employees, doesn’t think it should be.</p>
<p>The remote-first company, which launched today, has been quietly developing a tool that matches venture-backed companies with executives who have been-there-done-that, but don’t want to be tied down again by a full-time position.</p>
<p>Continuum was founded in 2020 by Nolan Church, former Carta chief people officer and DoorDash head of talent; Greg White, former Carta head of DevOps and security engineering; and Mary Nelson, former Voxer head of product and design. They set out to build a way for companies to access world-class talent, but not be locked into hiring someone full time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“There is an extreme talent shortage, which has been covered at length, but it is harder than ever to hire someone; the process is taking longer than ever and the best people have more options than ever before,” Church told TechCrunch. “That got us thinking about full time as one path that exists among a couple of others.”</p>
<p>The shortage, combined with more startups raising seed and Series A investments, means that these burgeoning companies aren’t seeing the kind of inbound attention from job seekers, but instead have to do outbound, either themselves or through a recruiter.</p>
<p>Continuum’s model does the outbound work for companies and presents a list of executives, within 48 hours, who are available to start that day, working 15 or 20 hours per week. Executives create a profile and set their availability and rate and can accept or reject an opportunity. Continuum charges a 15% fee on top of that.</p>
<p>On the company side, it enables them to avoid acquiring massive amounts of “people debt,” while also learning from someone who has already done it. Continuum also manages the back office management of the worker: contracts, taxes and payouts, invoicing the startup monthly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To continue developing its marketplace, the company announced Friday a $2.85 million seed round. Uncork Capital led and was joined by Day One Ventures and a group of angel investors, including Lattice founder Jack Altman, Carta CEO Henry Ward, Flippa founder Matt Mickiewicz and DoorDash founder Tony Xu.</p>
<p>Altman, in people management himself, said he sees what Continuum is doing — more flexible working opportunities — as the future of work. He got involved with the company early on and found Church and his co-founders to be mission-driven and putting together the kind of talent marketplace that fits with where he believes the working world is headed.</p>
<p>“Employees have more choice than ever before,” he added. “People are also not just staying in one area, but are multifaceted humans with lots of interests. The world of work is swinging toward the employer every year, and companies have to support people in order to build successful companies.”</p>
<p>Continuum launched its product in June, and since then is seeing an increase of five times the gross volume. Church says product features are about 80% of the way there, so the new funding will go toward building additional executive back office tools and hiring engineers to finish that out.</p>
<p>The company is beginning to scale supply and demand acquisition and is working with 100 executives on that side and three dozen startups on the other side.</p>
<p>“COVID has pushed everyone into a remote world being OK,” Church added. “Location is now agnostic and we can solve the global problem of it being hard to hire specialists and executives.”</p>

According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>Electrek</em></a>, though, the insurance available to Texans is quite different than the one owners can get in The Golden State: It calculates for a customer&#8217;s insurance premium using their real-time driving behavior. Their credit, age and gender that are typically used by other insurance providers apparently don&#8217;t matter to Tesla. The automaker says it won&#8217;t even look at customers&#8217; claim history and driving records.</p>
<p>Instead, Tesla will look at their &#8220;safety scores,&#8221; which is a feature it introduced with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Full Self-Driving Beta</a> version released in September. That could make things quite tricky, since the premium that needs to be paid can change every month based on the conditions the driver encounters on the road. Every forced collision warning and forced Autopilot disengagement will affect their score. Following other vehicles from an unsafe distance, braking too hard and turning corners aggressively could lower their score, as well. Safety score is still a beta feature at this point, and Tesla said it should improve over time.</p>
<p>Owners can now <a href="https://www.tesla.com/insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">apply for a quote</a>, wherein which the automaker will assume a 90 safety score to start their policy. The price will depend on the client&#8217;s performance after that, and it could be higher or lower than what a traditional provider charges. During Tesla&#8217;s shareholder meeting, where its new home state was also revealed, Elon Musk <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/08/tesla-insurance-expands-to-texas-next-week-aspirationally-most-of-the-us-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">said</a> the company plans to upgrade its offering in California to be based on real-time driving behavior, as well. It&#8217;s not allowed to implement the change just yet, but it&#8217;s currently trying to ask permission from regulators.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse added a new &#8220;music mode&#8221; this week, doubling down its commitment to centering social audio in all its permutations. The new music mode will give musicians who play live on the social network their own special set of tools to optimize sound quality and will hit iOS first before rolling out to Android.</p>
<p>Clubhouse didn&#8217;t get too into the audiophile weeds with the <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/music-mode-hallway-search/">announcement</a>, but the company said the new feature would allow users to &#8220;broadcast with high quality and great stereo sound&#8221; — prerequisites for a rich listening experience. The company says that music mode will also make it possible to hook pro-level audio equipment like mixing boards and mics into Clubhouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218582" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218582" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218582" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/clubhouse-music-mode.gif?w=680" alt="Clubhouse music mode" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218582" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218580" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In late August, Clubhouse made another investment in audio quality with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/clubhouse-spatial-audio/">spatial audio</a>, a feature that gives listeners a sense that different speakers in one of its group audio rooms are speaking from different physical locations — an effect more akin to how we&#8217;d perceive a real-life social interaction.</p>
<p>To turn on music mode as a speaker, tap the three dots in the upper right corner and choose &#8220;audio quality&#8221; then select &#8220;music.&#8221; Clubhouse&#8217;s replayable clips will also support the higher quality audio in their recordings. Beyond music mode, Clubhouse is moving its search bar to the top of the feed, and users can now wave at each other through the search bar on iOS.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It seems there&#8217;s news every day about startup funding reaching record highs, new unicorns being minted and tech firms going public. There&#8217;s no question that we are in the middle of a long-running and accelerating venture bull market.</p>
<p>All of this impresses upon us that every indicator in startup funding points up and to the right: Venture firms have more dry powder, deal sizes are growing rapidly, valuations are soaring and investment terms are more founder-friendly than ever. And all that is indeed happening.</p>
<p>But a closer inspection reveals that these trends are a lot more nuanced and apply very unequally across the funding continuum from seed to the late stage. What&#8217;s more, most of the underlying truths and rules are not changing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The venture alphabet soup of &#8220;A, B, C rounds&#8221; suggests it’s all the same, just one after the other, but it is not. It is more like playing an entirely different sport.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Beware of the outliers</h2>
<p>The stage definitions in venture, from seed to late-stage Series D, E or F rounds, have always been open to interpretation, and general patterns are challenged by outliers at each stage. Outliers — unusually large financings with high valuations relative to the company’s maturity — are as old as the industry itself. But these days, there are more of them, and the outliers are more extreme than ever before.</p>
<p>For example, Databricks raised two massive private rounds, a $1 billion Series G and a $1.6 billion Series H, in 2021. These funding rounds are bigger than many IPOs in the recent past, and Databricks is far from the only company to do something like this. There were an average of 35 &#8220;megadeals&#8221; (with over $100 million raised) per month from 2016 to 2019, according to Crunchbase. In 2021, that number stands at 126 per month.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to two major trends. First, the extremely lucrative exit market has created the economics to support mega late-stage rounds and venture rounds of $100 million or more. And, companies are staying private longer, and they need additional late-stage capital before an IPO that companies historically did not need. More on that below.</p>
<p>What is important for now is to acknowledge the simple truth that aggregates and averages don’t tell the real story of the broader market. The median of funding round sizes and valuations give a better view of how the market is really doing. So when you see the next report on a record venture funding month, pay close attention to what is being heralded.</p>
<h2>Stages behave very differently</h2>
<p>Most people think the substantial growth applies across the funding continuum, but that is not really the case. In fact, the venture bull market affects different stages very differently. The following is based on Cloud Apps Capital Partners&#8217; analysis of PitchBook data on fully documented U.S. financings (seed through Series D) in the cloud business application space since 2018 through the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>The biggest impact appears to be in the late stage. For Series C and D financings as a group, median round sizes more than doubled to $63 million in 2021 from $31 million in 2018. Pre-money valuations grew by 151%, and ownership — the share equity investors in the round collectively own after the financing — dropped to 12% from 18%. So the money involved has doubled, but Series C and D investors ended up owning a third less than they used to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A self-described “endless arcade,” Core feels like a 90s cyberpunk fever dream come to life. Half playable game library, half no-code game creator, all neon lights, the new platform is a surprisingly well-realized vision of this metaverse thing everyone sure seems to be talking about lately.</p>
<p>Billing itself as your &#8220;portal to the multiverse,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/manticore-games-raises-100-million-to-build-a-creator-multiverse/">Core is primed to test the age-old proposition</a><em> If you build it, they will come.</em> Giant companies like Roblox and Facebook might have huge established platforms, but Core has laid some very compelling groundwork for creators and players alike.</p>
<p>Logging in, players are transported to Core&#8217;s central hub, a fitting cross between a theme park, a high-tech mall and a casino, with entertainment and shopping a few gravitationally unburdened strides away in every direction. Giant neon signs beckon, enticing players to hop into myriad user-generated virtual worlds. Swapping out clothing and in-game gear or inviting a friend to jump in with you takes only a few clicks, and just cruising around and people watching is plenty interesting.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218472" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Core <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fortnite/">looks a lot like Fortnite</a>, that&#8217;s not a coincidence. Core, made by Manticore Games, runs on Fortnite-maker Epic&#8217;s Unreal engine. And those ties are even deeper: Epic led a $15 million round of investment in the company last year and the platform is exclusively available through the Epic Games Store for PC. In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/manticore-games-raises-100-million-to-build-a-creator-multiverse/">Manticore raised $100 million</a> more from a grab bag of major investors and took its creator platform live.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218506" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218506 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?w=680" alt="Core character creator" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoreCharacterEditor.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Manticore Games</p></div></p>
<p>Core might not be a household name yet, but it&#8217;s already nailed one of the challenges that any metaverse aspirant has to crack. In my time playing around with Core, the experience of getting from one place to another was often so seamless I wound up in the wrong place by accident. Chalk this up to user error, but instantly being transported — <a href="https://oberhasli.coregames.com/">to a Deadmau5 show</a>, to an overgrown dystopian wasteland, to a isometric pirate game — after walking through various portals was one of the more seamless online multiplayer experiences I&#8217;ve had in more than a decade of those games.</p>
<p>Core looks great. That&#8217;s one strike against Roblox, one of the most successful companies building out a vision for the metaverse. Much like Fortnite, Core&#8217;s graphics are cartoony but not <em>too</em> cartoony. Roblox&#8217;s under-13 crowd is aging up — a factor that company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/">actively planning around</a> — and those not-so-young players may soon be looking for a new virtual home with more mature vibes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any aspiring edgelord would be able to take themselves plenty seriously with Core&#8217;s wide selection of custom outfits and avatars. Or you could be a kitty.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218513" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218513" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218513 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CompositeScreenshots_2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218513" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Manticore Games</p></div></p>
<h2>Deadmau5, metaverse resident</h2>
<p>Most of Core&#8217;s content is UGC, a.k.a. user-generated content, a new-ish name for an era-defining online phenomenon (don&#8217;t blame yourself if the acronym evokes mixed martial arts). But Manticore also has plenty of room to partner up with musicians and brands for elaborate themed in-game experiences.</p>
<p>This week, DJ and EDM festival perennial Deadmau5 launched his own, a sprawling, colorful series of experiences described as a “<a href="https://oberhasli.coregames.com/">permanent residency in the metaverse</a>.” Core is mostly home to user-made games, but it’s also a natural fit for entertainment and even education — the team noted that some users started hosting game development classes.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Unlike recent shows in other virtual worlds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/roblox-to-host-its-first-virtual-concert-featuring-lil-nas-x/">Lil Nas X in Roblox</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/fortnite-ariana-grande-concert-metaverse/">Ariana Grande in Fortnite</a>, the Deadmau5-themed content will stay live after it debuts for anyone to explore. The team at Manticore likened this to how performers like Penn and Teller camp out in Las Vegas for ongoing shows, and the metaphor is very appropriate. But unlike Vegas, performers can be in two places at once: Deadmau5 also announced he&#8217;d participate in a music festival hosted on the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/14/decentraland-books-deadmau5-paris-hilton-and-more-for-metaverse-music-festival/">Ethereum-based virtual platform Decentraland</a> this week.</p>
<p>I watched the show with Deadmau5, né Joel Zimmerman, for an early sneak preview. He wore one of his signature giant animal helmets (I think a cat?) and cyborg angel wings, while I opted for an understated black hoodie, the little black dress of the metaverse.</p>
<p>“I think what drew me to it was the modularity of it all and how it gives more tools to creators,” Zimmerman told me, hopping around wildly in Core while reclining IRL in a gaming chair emblazoned with the Deadmau5 mouse.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218499" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218499" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218499 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/core-deadmau5.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218499" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Manticore Games</p></div></p>
<p>Like we&#8217;ve come to expect from virtual concerts, the interactive performance is well-stocked with melting psychedelic visuals, mini games and a menacing Chain Chomp-esque mouse with turntable ears. Zimmerman and Core co-founders Frederic Descamps and Jordan Maynard who also ran around the show with me had seen it at least 10 times, but everyone still seemed to genuinely be having fun.</p>
<p>At some point I either fell into lava or got smashed on a conveyer belt by a massive metal fist while a Deadmau5-themed villain loomed nearby. “I think it’s the only interactive concert you can die in,” Maynard said. The show was visually a lot of fun, creatively interactive and ultimately a lot like concerts in Fortnite, which sets a high bar for this stuff.</p>
<p>The elaborate virtual experience, <a href="https://oberhasli.coregames.com/">called Oberhasli</a>, also showcases some unique worlds created by fans with no prior game dev experience, from an eerie jungle ruin to a spooky world full of floating space debris. The Core Deadmau5 performance kicks off on Friday at 3 PM PT. It&#8217;ll replay over the weekend and be available on demand afterward, for anyone else who’d like to be smashed into an EDM pancake.</p>

<h2>Core for creators</h2>
<p>Later on our call, held on Discord, the Core tour devolved into everyone running through a secret gate behind a destructible wall and world-hopping wildly through game genres, each remarkably polished for something that doesn&#8217;t require any code or game development experience. Moving from one game world to another took seconds even with a terrible Wi-Fi connection, including the time I ran through something that looked like World of Warcraft’s dark portal and wound up sailing an isometric pirate ship.</p>
<p>The WoW nod is probably not a coincidence. Descamps waxed nostalgic about the heyday of <a href="https://blizzardwatch.com/tag/wow-machinima/">WoW machinima</a>, narrative movies built through captured gameplay, like only a serious longtime player could. Descamps and Maynard also previously worked on <a href="https://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/">Rift, another fantasy MMO</a> that still commands a loyal following a decade on. (Maynard was employee No. 7.) Everyone is raving about the metaverse these days, but surprisingly few companies in the space trace their roots back to the seamless virtual gaming worlds that have brought people together for years.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218502" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218502" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218502" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?w=680" alt="Core screenshot gameplay" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TheForsakenTemple.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218502" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Manticore Games</p></div></p>
<p>To underline how easy it is to make stuff in Core, Maynard quick-built a first-person shooter for us to play, a drag-and-drop process that took maybe two minutes of dipping into Core’s huge library of original in-game assets that were created using its system. Grab a handful of 3D objects and pick a game mode from the template choices (battle royale, racing or dungeon crawler?) and you’re most of the way to a polished-looking playable game built in Core’s modular sandbox. Setting your game in a chilly snowscape or a barren desert is also as simple as dragging and dropping, lending the environments an expansive feel.</p>
<p>Gameplay aside, out of the box Core games look light years better than the UGC you’d run across in Roblox, though that platform’s users have never seemed to mind. The breadth of visual styles and game genres is also mind-boggling for anyone who&#8217;s bounced out of samey UGC on other platforms.</p>

<p>Core users who create content have a pretty good swath of monetization options, which Manticore calls “perks.” That includes offering in-game cosmetic items, but also charging for premium games, selling Fortnite-like battle passes or implementing a subscription model. The revenue split is 50/50, which looks generous next to the 25% that Roblox passes on to creators. And in Core, like in other modular game-making platforms, everyone is a creator — no development experience needed.</p>
<p>Core is PC-only for now, but Manticore plans to bring it to other platforms, including iOS, starting next year. Game creation will likely stay limited to PC, but the idea is that anyone could play Core games anywhere, a platform agnostic vision that certainly boosted Fortnite early on and Roblox more recently.</p>
<p>“[Game development] is kind of like baking: a very precise formula, technical, can take weeks to iterate,” Descamps said. But in Core, the technical stuff gets out of the way and a process that would normally drag on can happen in minutes, leaving the rest of the time for experimentation and play.</p>
<p>“What if you put a portal gun into Mario Kart?” Maynard asked, and I’m fairly certain we could have found out right then.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 14, 2021. It’s Thursday, which means that the news cycle spent the day trying to expend itself before Friday dwindles into the weekend. Let’s hope it succeeded; we have a lot to get to!</p>
<p>Before we start, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/the-early-bird-countdown-48-hours-left-to-save-on-passes-to-tc-sessions-space-2021/">space event has discounts for the next day or so</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/announcing-the-final-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas-2021/">our SaaS confab is ticking closer</a>! – <a href="twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">Microsoft to pull LinkedIn from China:</a> </strong>Microsoft made waves in technology, regulatory and international domains today by announcing the eventual end of its LinkedIn service in China. The company had previously made certain profiles unavailable in the country due to regulatory pressure. It was a crap sandwich for the U.S. tech company to handle — if it didn’t do what the CCP demanded in-country, it could harm its business in other ways, and folks in other markets didn’t like it bending to state censorship. Microsoft’s choice could wind up being a key moment in the longer saga of China’s digital decoupling from the rest of the world.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">GitLab’s IPO prices strongly, soars:</a> </strong>After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/gitlab-raises-ipo-range-targeting-valuation-of-as-much-as-11b/">raising its IPO price range</a>, the DevOps unicorn priced above that interval at $77 per share. Then it shot to more than $90 in its first day’s trading. We have some takeaways, past the obvious <em>holy heck</em> response that you are having at the moment. No one knows what anything is worth!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/investors-say-indian-startup-funding-could-get-even-hotter-after-record-q3/">The Indian startup market’s exceptional Q3:</a> </strong>While venture capital results are proving strong around the world in the third quarter, India may have posted the single most impressive set of data of any country during the three-month period. TechCrunch dug into the data with the help of a few investors to figure out just how long the party may persist.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have more startup news today than you could shake any sort of proverbial stick at.</p>
<p>To start, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/cannabis-investment-jumps-82-the-second-half-of-2021-165-over-2020-levels/">TechCrunch has data concerning the cannabis startup market</a>. We might say that it is sparking up, taking flight or simply flaring brighter. Startups building weed-focused businesses are floating in a blissful wave of capital, likely providing more than a small dose of relaxation. It’s a good time to be selling emotional resets in plant format.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/outschools-after-school-enrichment-marketplace-is-now-valued-at-3-billion/">Outschool proves U.S. edtech isn’t dead:</a></strong> With more kids back in school than at the end of the last academic year, you’d be forgiven for expecting venture investment in edtech startups to dip. But a new $110 million round values educational-enrichment unicorn Outschool at $3 billion.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/space-perspective-raises-40m-series-a-for-stratospheric-balloon-rides/">Take me to space, cool balloon company:</a></strong> It’s not only rockets that will offer trips into the lower regions of space, if Space Perspective gets its way. The <em>balloon</em> company just raised $40 million for its work. It may have flights — soars? — in 2024, where you will find me in line with all $74 that I have, hoping to get a ticket.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/regher-solar-is-ready-to-meet-the-new-space-industrys-demand-for-cheaper-better-solar-panels/">Regehr Solar wants to bring down the cost of space-ready solar panels:</a></strong> Sticking to the space theme for a moment, here’s a good one. Regher Solar thinks that we’re going to put a lot of satellites into space in the coming years, which is correct. And it thinks that lower costs of goods for that work would be popular. Again, correct. What we’ll have to see is if its solar tech fits neatly into both facts.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/zeus-living-closes-on-55m-to-offer-flexible-furnished-rentals-as-it-expands-beyond-corporate-housing/">Zeus Living raises $55M, doubles down on medium-term stays:</a> </strong>Pivoting from its original corporate focus, Zeus now wants to let all sorts of folks book longer stays in housing it has ready for guests. So now Zeus is akin to a long-form Airbnb? Perhaps. Let’s see how it competes with the domestic giant.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/writing-helper-copy-ai-closes-on-its-second-funding-round-this-year/">Copy.ai raises $11M against its $2.4M in ARR:</a></strong> Translating that for you, startup Copy.ai, which uses GPT-3 to help folks write, has raised an $11 million funding round on the back of its $2.4 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. The startup now has 13 employees.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/bird-nabs-150m-up-from-40m-in-vehicle-financing-from-apollo-investment-corp/">Our parent company’s parent company just gave Bird access to its (our?) money:</a></strong> Scooter company Bird, which is approaching the public markets via a SPAC — something that this new capital is contingent upon — has raised a larger credit facility with Apollo. Its $40 million line will be worth $150 million after it goes public.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more, much more: Tala <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tala-grabs-145m-to-offer-more-financial-services-in-emerging-markets/">just raised $145 million</a> to bring its lending service to more markets. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/evolution-equity-partners-closes-on-400m-for-new-cybersecurity-fund/">Evolution Equity Partners just raised $400 million</a> to invest. An <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/ai-shopping-assistant-karma-raises-25-million-in-series-a-funding-led-by-target-global/">AI-focused shopping assistant called Karma just raised a $25 million Series A</a>. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/berlins-mayd-bags-15m-seed-to-deliver-meds-fast/">German Mayd just raised a sheaf of big bills to speed up drug delivery</a> in Europe.</p>
<h2>Smart growth tactics can put account-based marketing within reach for startups and SMBs</h2>
<p>Account-based marketing makes it easier to engage with key customers at the right moment, but for many early-stage startups that are desperate to reach takeoff velocity, ABM isn&#8217;t viewed as a necessity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This couldn’t be further from the truth, and both startups and SMBs can, and should, invest in ABM strategies,&#8221; advises Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, an Amsterdam-based growth agency.</p>
<p>In a post that offers a detailed overview, van de Poel identifies &#8220;distinctive characteristics&#8221; for businesses that should consider ABM strategies, along with specific recommendations for implementing.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a handful of smart growth tactics and clever tools, ABM strategies don’t have to break the bank to be successful,&#8221; he writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After announcing a deal with Beyond Meat back in February, McDonald’s this morning announced that it is<a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.mcplant-usrestaurant.html"> set to start selling plant-based Beyond Meat burgers</a> in select locations next month.</p>
<p>Starting November 3, the McPlant will be available at eight of the fast food giant’s restaurants, including in Irving and Carrollton, Texas, Cedar Falls, Iowa, Jennings and Lake Charles, Louisiana and El Segundo and Manhattan Beach, California.</p>
<p>Still very much in the early stages, McDonald’s is positioning the deal as a “test” of Beyond’s patties, which are made from plant-based ingredients, including peas, rice and potatoes. The deal follows similar piloting in a number of international locations, including Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and the U.K./Ireland, the latter of which launched last month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Says McDonald’s, “The patty is served on a sesame seed bun with tomato, lettuce, pickles, onions, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard and a slice of American cheese. It has the iconic taste of a McDonald’s burger, because it is one.” Your mileage may vary, depending on how that last sentence strikes you.</p>
<p>The company says it also will be broadening the McPlant line to include plant-based versions of chicken, pork and egg.</p>
<p>In February, Beyond struck a partnership with Yum Brands, which includes KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Competitor Impossible Foods, meanwhile, has deals with Burger King, Starbucks and White Castle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When flying cargo from one part of the world to another, you typically need a pilot for two parts: The take-off and the landing. As so elegantly outlined in the 1980 Jim Abrahams movie !Airplane &#8212; the rest of the time, you&#8217;re pretty much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ7cxAUeZZw">on instruments</a>. <a href="https://reliable.co/">Reliable Robotics</a> is aiming to solve that pesky needing-to-have-a-pilot-in-the-plane problem by, instead, putting the pilot on the ground when you need it, and leave the plane to find its destination on its own the rest of the time. Coatue Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, Teamworthy Ventures and Pathbreaker Ventures all believe this is the future, to the point of backing the Mountain View, California-based company with a $130 million of total funding. The company today announced its $100 million Series C funding, led by <a href="https://www.coatue.com/">Coatue Management</a>.</p>
<p>The funds will go toward scaling the team and supporting its first aircraft certification program &#8212; working toward commercial cargo operations. In the first instance, the company is working on automation systems for existing aircraft. They have been experimenting and developing using a Cessna 172, which started flying unmanned flights a couple of years ago.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LufAdPIwkrk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><em>Back in September 2019, Reliable Robotics flew a Cessna 172 with no one on board in airspace just outside of San Jose, California. </em></p>
<p>The company was founded in 2017, and was operating in stealth mode until last year. Its technology handles all phases of flight, including taxi, takeoff, landing and parking, while licensed pilots remotely supervise the flights from a control center. Reliable Robotics suggests that the systems they&#8217;ve developed are able to auto-land on smaller airstrips in rural or remote areas without requiring additional infrastructure or technology to be installed at the airports.</p>
<p>The business case is simple: Pilots are the most expensive aspects of running cargo operations, with similar restrictions to road-based trucking operations: The vast majority of trucking is boring and monotonous work where the drivers are the most common source of failure. In the air, replacing the qualified pilots with autonomous systems that can be overridden from the ground means that the cost goes down, and the utilization of the aircraft skyrockets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218459" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218459" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2218459" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?w=300" alt="An aircraft flying" width="300" height="171" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/where-did-the-pilot-go.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218459" class="wp-caption-text">Who needs pilots, anyway? <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reliable Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We believe Reliable Robotics is a leader in aircraft automation for commercial aviation,” said Jaimin Rangwalla, a senior managing director at Coatue. “We were impressed by the team&#8217;s clear vision, measured certification progress and track record of industry achievement. We are proud and excited to support Reliable’s goal to be the first to deliver FAA-certified, remotely piloted systems to market.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s main selling point is connecting regional and municipal airports across the country. For starters, the company is focusing on increasing efficiency and decreasing the cost of hauling cargo around. Reliable Robotics also hints at a future where passengers can step aboard the remotely piloted planes. The company is also evaluating emerging electric and hybrid aircraft platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, people are a little twitchy about the safety aspects of self-driving cars &#8212; and planes add a literal additional dimension to the mix. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is keeping a close eye on Reliable and other commercial operators in this space, but the agency has greenlit a number of authorizations for experimental unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span>We appreciate our public-private partnership with the FAA and NASA as we work to integrate our Remotely Operated Aircraft System into the airspace. We intend to bring unprecedented safety and reliability to today’s commercial aircraft,&#8221; said Robert Rose, co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. &#8220;Close collaboration with our public institutions, strong backing from visionary investors and keen interest within the cargo industry further accelerates our mission to expand everyone’s access to air transportation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting as a Facebook support group for founders, the Female Founders Alliance community has done a lot of evolving and changing since its inception. Today, it announces a name change and the fact that it&#8217;s started writing checks out of its inaugural fund. With $10 million to play with, the newly minted <a href="https://grahamwalker.com/">Graham &amp; Walker</a> is focusing its attention on &#8220;the potential of all women in business,&#8221; including through community-building, investments and various programs.</p>
<p>The fund has its work cut out, too &#8212; even in an extraordinarily frothy market. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/1-change-that-can-fix-the-vc-funding-crisis-for-women-founders/">VC Claire Diaz-Ortiz points out in a column last month</a>, only 9% of all funds deployed to technology startups went to founding teams that included at least one woman. Solo woman founders and all-women teams raised just 2% of all VC dollars. As far as we are aware, Diaz-Ortiz is not involved with Graham &amp; Walker, but echoing her sentiments: it&#8217;s encouraging to see initiatives like Graham &amp; Walker coming into the picture with an agenda to change that.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Women founders] need to be unleashed in the hard local and global problems,&#8221; says Merrie Williamson, Corporate VP for Microsoft Azure Apps, Infrastructure &amp; IOT &#8212; and an investor in Graham &amp; Walker. &#8220;My participation in this fund is in part a nod to all women and their potential.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217312" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The name &#8220;Graham &amp; Walker&#8221; might be tripping you up, conjuring up old-school partnerships from days gone by. Shed your first impressions &#8212; the firm isn&#8217;t named after its founders or investors, but includes an elegant nod to influential women in history.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that when people first hear Graham &amp; Walker, they imagine that it is named after two men, like a very old-school law firm,&#8221; explains Leslie Feinzaig, founder and managing director. &#8220;But when you dig deeper and see who we are and what we do, that makes you question what inspired your own assumption. The ampersand also has a lot of significance, it represents you and me, it represents our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the firm is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Graham">Katharine Graham</a> &#8212; newspaper publisher of The Washington Post and the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company &#8212; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madam_C._J._Walker">Madam C. J. Walker</a>, an African American woman who is widely recognized as the world&#8217;s first female self-made millionaire.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217327" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217327" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2217327 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Graham &amp; Walker team" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg 4965w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Graham-Walker-Team-2-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217327" class="wp-caption-text">The Graham &amp; Walker team: Rohre Titcomb (COO) Es Famojure (program manager), Leslie Feinzaig (founder and managing director), Amanda Eldridge (VP of Business Development), Divya Kakkad (VP of Marketing)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A big reason for this rebrand is our own evolution of seeing the world as binary (founders and non-founders) and realizing we are all the same person. It is women who want to take ownership of their careers,&#8221; says Feinzaig. &#8220;Graham &amp; Walker is a way for us to grow into serving that woman at any point in her trajectory &#8212; not just in the time she’s a founder but as an investor, advisor, corporate leader, board member and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fund started investing in early 2021. Early investments include adoption facilitation software <a href="https://pairtreefamily.com/">PairTree,</a> culturally aware telehealth marketplace <a href="https://healthinherhue.com/">Health in Her Hue</a>, eco-friendly living and shopping community <a href="https://brightly.eco/">Brightly</a> and data marketplace <a href="https://datacy.com/">Datacy</a>.</p>
<p>The fund&#8217;s investors include Bank of America, Carta and a slew of private investors. In total, more than 100 investors contributed to the $10 million fund. Graham &amp; Walker reports that two-thirds of the investors are women, a third are people of color and almost half of the investors are first-time fund investors.</p>
<p><em>Updated: TechCrunch previously reported that the fund was $9M. The figure has been corrected to $10M after a spokesperson from Graham &amp; Walker made us aware of the mistake. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google’s Arts &amp; Culture team launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/google-is-building-digital-art-galleries-you-can-step-into/">&#8220;Pocket Gallery&#8221; experiences in 2018</a> to allow AR-enabled smartphone users to view artwork from artists like Johannes Vermeer for the first time in history, including pieces that are usually inaccessible publicly. Today, the team <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/explore-impossible-exhibitions-3d/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">announced</a> that it’s making the entire series of Pocket Galleries available to anyone on the web.</p>
<p>The company’s original goal with Pocket Galleries was to digitally bring never-before-seen exhibitions straight to users in a 3D format. The new web expansion means that the galleries can now be viewed on desktop and on smartphones with or without AR capabilities, bringing even more visibility to the exhibitions.</p>
<p>“Simply open your favorite browser to discover all our Pocket Galleries in 3D. Take an art tour of the world in sound, go spelunking among some of the oldest paintings known to man at Chauvet Cave, marvel at miniatures scenes from ancient India, or discover the man of contradictions in Klimt vs. Klimt,” Joe Shepherd, the associate product manager at Google Arts &amp; Culture, said in a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/arts-culture/explore-impossible-exhibitions-3d/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29">blog post.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218410" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users are now able to read about the history of certain artifacts and closely examine specific details in several artworks. In some galleries, an audio tour will guide users through the highlights of the exhibitions to offer historical context and other details.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218416" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218416" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218416" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-pocket-gallery.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="577" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218416" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The mobile gaming economy has been in a state of flux for the past couple of years, and it has become quite difficult to predict what will come next. China has had its own set of unique issues, mainly stemming from the nation’s desire to rein in the market and provide more security and privacy to all parties.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Chinese mobile economy has continued to thrive over the past 18 months. Last year was a big one for China’s mobile scene as mobile app publishers found new audiences and explored new mobile advertising channels, many of which are here to stay — <a href="https://nikopartners.com/china-mobile-games/">681.7 million mobile gamers</a> were reported in China in 2020. To add to this, the country also <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/60-mobile-gaming-revenue-came-apac-region-2020-led-china-35-says-globaldata/">leads the way</a> for gross revenue, accounting for over 35% of mobile gaming revenue worldwide in 2020.</p>
<p>Western publishers have taken note, but recent regulatory crackdowns have given pause to some. What can be done to quell some of these concerns and help open the market to global gaming publishers?</p>
<h2>China’s top developers are going global</h2>
<p>It can be argued that Chinese tech giants like Tencent and Netease have actually seen these restrictions as an eventuality and have acted accordingly by investing and acquiring global studios. Tencent alone has invested in over 30 gaming companies, including Roblox, Supercell, Riot and Voodoo.</p>
<p>Chinese publishers that employed a global strategy increased their revenue by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/27/niko-partners-chinas-game-market-will-hit-55b-and-781m-gamers-by-2025/">36.7% in 2020</a> and are seeing more revenue in international markets than in China. Some of this is fueled by publishers pivoting away from ISBN-restricted games with in-app purchases (IAP) to fan-friendly free-to-play (F2P) games with well-executed ad monetization models.</p>
<p>Given that mobile gaming giants such as Zynga and Scopely hold a winning formula for gaming IP as well as ample resources, there is an opening in the market for cross-platform growth. To be clear, it is an ambitious goal, but could be seen as a necessity to sustain user and revenue growth.</p>
<h2>What Western publishers are learning from China</h2>
<p>Publishers wanting to go East are seeing the success of Chinese studios capitalizing on intellectual property (IP) such as Journey to the West in their domestic markets. Zynga has taken notice of this and is making wise investments into the market with IP titles from Harry Potter and an upcoming Star Wars mobile game.</p>
<p>Kabam’s Marvel IP has also been successful, with its F2P game Contest of Champions <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/ip-in-mobile-games-market-2021">tops the U.S. charts for licensed action mobile games</a>. Subsequently, Kabam partnered with Netease and localized the game for the Chinese market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If China once seemed to be committed to the free market economy, over the course of 2021, it has shattered that illusion entirely by abruptly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/27/technology/china-didi-crackdown.html">disempowering</a> its own tech companies and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2021/10/11/china-moves-ban-news-outlets-not-funded-communist-party/">turning up the dials</a> on media censorship at the direction of a president who, three years ago, oversaw the erasure of presidential limits from the country&#8217;s constitution. (These were a short-lived experiment, in any case, given that China has been &#8220;dominated for thousands of years by absolute monarchs,&#8221; as NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/14/593155818/why-abolishing-chinas-presidential-term-limits-is-such-a-big-deal">noted</a> at the time, with term limits first introduced in the 1980s.)</p>
<p>The U.S., and Silicon Valley in particular, needs to be paying <em>much</em> closer attention to this consolidation of power, suggests Jacob Helberg, who is co-chair of the Brookings Institution China Strategy Initiative, a former senior adviser to Stanford&#8217;s Cyber Policy Institute and a former news policy lead at Google. (He was also an adviser to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg during his presidential campaign.) In a gripping new book titled <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Wires-of-War/Jacob-Helberg/9781982144432">&#8220;The Wires of War: Technology and the Global Struggle for Power,&#8221;</a> Helberg lays out how China&#8217;s &#8220;techno-totalitarian&#8221; regime may be first impacting the Chinese people (its &#8220;first victims,&#8221; he says), but why its efforts to increasingly control the software and the hardware of the internet are a real and present and fast-escalating danger to the U.S. and democracies everywhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, one need look no further than India &#8212; which seemed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/us/politics/china-india-hacking-electricity.html">receive a warning</a> by the Chinese government last year when the power went out in a city of 20 million people &#8212; of what could be coming to the U.S. absent drastic and unified action on the part of private industry and the federal government. He talked to us yesterday in a chat that has been edited for length.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217894" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TC: You started your job at Google, focusing on its global news policies, just ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Given that so much attention was paid at the time to Russia and its misinformation campaigns, I&#8217;m surprised you didn&#8217;t write a book about U.S.-Russia relations.</strong></p>
<p>JH: Well, there are really two fronts to this &#8220;gray&#8221; war: the front-end software battle to control what people see on their screens, which has a lot of different players, with Russia one of the first movers in the space with respect to foreign interference. Then there is the back-end hardware front of the war that&#8217;s focused on the physical internet and the physical infrastructure of the internet. Ultimately, one of the reasons that the book primarily focuses on China is because the most decisive area of this war is going to be about controlling that physical internet infrastructure. If you control the infrastructure of the internet, you can basically control or compromise anything that runs on top of it. If you control the back end, you can also compromise and control the front end. That&#8217;s why we should be placing far more substantial effort [on the latter].</p>
<p><strong>By back end, you mean things like cellular phones, satellites, fiber optic cables, 5G networks and artificial intelligence.</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is interesting because it&#8217;s obviously a combination of software and hardware, but yes, it&#8217;s basically fiber optic cables, 5G satellites, low-orbit satellites and so forth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>In the book, you quickly highlight China&#8217;s alleged attacks on India last year, which shut down trains and the stock market and forced hospitals to rely on emergency generators. Do you think we&#8217;ve seen [attacks] in the U.S. that the public, at least, didn&#8217;t connect to China?</strong></p>
<p>One of the core attributes of the gray war &#8212; one of the reasons why governments are leaning so heavily into new gray zone tactics is because sometimes it&#8217;s really hard to [assign] attribution. We have a system where a lot of our internet is run by private companies. Unlike in China, we actually have private companies that are completely separated from the U.S. government. Because of our privatized system, there are certain market and legal incentives for private companies to underreport cyber security breaches. If you&#8217;re a company that experiences a cyber security breach, you are a victim [that] can also be held to [account] because you can be held to be negligent in certain cases. So companies sometimes are very wary of reporting cyber security breaches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also really genuinely hard to do attribution sometimes. So it&#8217;s not impossible that we&#8217;ve seen similar types of cyber attacks in the U.S. as were carried out in India, but we do know [for a fact] that we have had substantial cyber attacks on the U.S., with many people from the intelligence community concerned about the integrity of our energy grid. The Office of Personnel Management has obviously been hacked, which is important because that basically means that China now has a list of a lot of government employees with access to top-secret information. The list [of cyber attacks] is very long.</p>
<p><strong>But you think the India hack was still a warning to us all.</strong></p>
<p>The reason that hack was so historically significant is it was the first signal that if this gray war were to turn hotter, it could potentially be one of the first wars that we have experienced since the the Revolutionary War where we actually see significant physical destruction on our homeland carried out by a foreign actor. With the exception of 9/11 and with the exception of the Civil War, which was an internal war, we&#8217;ve never seen a foreign power actually reach our shores and carry out mass destruction. [Given] the cyber attack that was carried out on India, you could imagine a scenario where, if our relationship with China really went south, that&#8217;d be a potential … well, we would have to make sure that our nuclear power plants are awfully safe.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think we should we respond to this threat? The U.S. government has taken a very strong position against Huawei and its bid to build infrastructure in the United States. You point out that companies like Zoom have a lot of Chinese employees and potential exposure to Chinese intelligence. Where do we draw the line? And how does the government marshal a response that also protects the rights of businesses?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s such an important question for the critical juncture that we find ourselves in currently, especially with the looming risk of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan. I&#8217;m a very big proponent of the idea of the U.S government establishing an outbound CFIUS framework. We right now have a framework that provides the U.S. government with the ability to review and potentially block any inbound investments from a foreign country on the grounds of national security; the basic idea would be to apply the same framework for outbound investments. So basically, give the U.S. government the tools to review on grounds of national security any investment from the United States to outside of the United States and particularly to China, because over time, as we&#8217;ve seen when American companies pour billions of dollars into China, that can sometimes pose some real problems.</p>
<p><strong>How realistic do you think that is given the financial incentives that companies have to continue expanding into China?</strong></p>
<p>There are already proposals making their way through the halls of Congress that trend in that direction and that are somewhat analogous to what I&#8217;m suggesting, so I think these ideas are very much on the horizon. As for when these issues are going to become pressing enough to be prioritized by Congress and get the kind of support needed to make it to the President&#8217;s desk might actually be driven by a crisis, because obviously in Washington, a lot of things happen in moments of crisis, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>Yes and no. Look at gun control in the U.S. But it&#8217;s interesting the way you frame this away from the idea that the U.S. versus China is a competition because there really are no mutually observed rules, even if at times in the past, it has seemed so.</strong></p>
<p>When you say that it&#8217;s a competition, you&#8217;re communicating the embedded assumption that you can afford to lose, because when you&#8217;re in a competition, you can afford to win or lose. We compete with the Germans and the Japanese commercially all the time, but if Toyota sells more cars than General Motors, it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal. It&#8217;s the marketplace; we operate on a level playing field along rules that we mutually abide by. The reason &#8220;war&#8221; is much more accurate and apt for the current set of circumstances with China is because we&#8217;re talking about a political struggle and the outcome is about the political survival of our system and it gives you a certain level of mental clarity about how to prioritize certain things that are necessary to treat this challenge with the level of determination and urgency that&#8217;s needed to produce a successful outcome.</p>
<p>The other thing is that when you&#8217;re in a war, you&#8217;re much more willing to absorb short-term costs to produce a successful result. During World War Two, General Motors was building tanks and airplanes and we really mobilized as a country. Here, we&#8217;re obviously not asking Apple to build aircraft carriers, but one of the short-term costs that we need to seriously start thinking about is: How much is it going to cost for us to move our supply chains out of China? Because that&#8217;s going to cost money and require effort, and it&#8217;s going to be hard. But the potential cost of us being cut off from access to our supply chains is so high that it&#8217;s worth the relatively lower costs of putting in the effort, energy and time to do this before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p><strong>In the book, you note that this decoupling of economic foreign policy from national security objectives dates back to the Cold War. Now you&#8217;re suggesting an outbound CFIUS program and moving all of our supply chains out of China. What other incentives do you think that private industry needs in order to wean itself off China or focus less on it as huge market opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of the programs that have worked in the past often boil down to carrots and sticks, and I think a combination of certain penalties that are applied to disincentivize [investors and outfits] from engaging in highly sensitive investments in China, [while also] incentivizing other types of behavior, like trading with other countries that do not pose risks to the U.S. or democracy, is probably going to be the mix that succeeds and resonates with the business community.</p>
<p><strong>You also make the distinction that the U.S. is at war with the authoritarian government of China, not the people of China. Very unfortunately, that message doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting through to everyone.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s really worth repeating when I talk about a gray war and during our national debates about our issues with China that this is not about anything that has to do with the Chinese people or Chinese culture but instead the political regime and the [Chinese Communist Party].</p>
<p>Part of why we&#8217;re on the right side of this equation is that the first victims &#8212; and the people who have suffered the most at the hands of the CCP &#8212; are the Chinese people. It&#8217;s important to remember that Uyghurs, Tibetans and political dissidents are Chinese nationals, too, even though they&#8217;re treated as third-class citizens. And those are who we also need to keep in mind because Chinese state news media will often try to promote the narrative that any talk of a hard stance against China is racist.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Radenbaugh to talk about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain and building a product that's made for how people want to use it.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rad Power Bikes founder Mike Radenbaugh grew up among the Redwood trees on the Lost Coast of Northern California with &#8220;tree hugger parents and tree hugger neighbors,&#8221; and a life connected to nature. This exposed the founder not only to alternative ways of living that are more responsible to the planet but also to alternative energy. As a young teenager watching the electric vehicle space, Radenbaugh became energized seeing electric motorcycles and cars popping up but was impatient with their slow commercialization.</p>
<p>When Radenbaugh was 15, he built his first e-bike hacking together parts he ordered from Radio Shack and eBay with the money he saved from his job as a bellboy at the one hotel in town. This was back in 2007, and despite his young age, Radenbaugh says this is the year Rad Power Bikes was founded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started advertising in the local newspaper and they gave me the first ad free I think because I went in as this punk kid and they felt sympathy for me,&#8221; Radenbaugh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Radenbaugh continued as a sole proprietor building bespoke e-bikes for people who&#8217;d reach out looking for something fast and powerful to replace their car journeys. Along the way, he says he really got to understand what it was customers wanted and what was missing from the marketplace.</p>
<p>With all this knowledge and hands-on experience buffering him, in 2015, Radenbaugh relaunched Rad Power Bikes as a direct-to-consumer business. He and his growing team set to work perfecting the business model, adding in company-owned retail stores and mobile service centers around the country, partnering with a big network of bike shops and building a massive-scale supply chain.</p>
<p>Now, the company has 615 staff members with plans to hire more, over 350,000 customers and is producing bikes in six countries. The company&#8217;s getting big, and it&#8217;s getting big fast, with reported sales in 2019 of $100 million.</p>
<p>That number only increased in 2020, in large part due to the COVID-related boom in e-bike sales generally. Earlier this year, the company raised $150 million to scale globally, the largest funding round of a U.S. electric bike startup. But as the world begins to wrangle coronavirus to a point where cities are opening up, will this boom in e-bike sales last?</p>
<p>We sat down with Radenbaugh to talk about the e-bike revolution, diversifying the supply chain and building a product that&#8217;s made for how people want to use it.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><b>What would you say is different about your business model compared to the competition? Companies like VanMoof have also been scoring large funding rounds lately.</b></p>
<p>Being user-friendly is consistent across the whole lineup. We popularized fat tires on e-bikes, we popularized throttles on e-bikes, so our customers could have more power. None of those things really existed; they were just super nascent and more part of the DIY community until we commercialized them. So both of those features I think are kind of pivotal to the DNA of our business, and it just so turns out that we just knew something early on that a lot of people didn&#8217;t by listening to the customer — that the bike shouldn&#8217;t only be pedal assisted. They should be more substantial and really move your butt from point A to point B.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">Twitch hack</a> last week was just the latest example of a high-profile breach that has the security industry in a frenzy. Everyone is asking themselves how this could happen, how such a large store of critical data — the source code! — could be taken out without tripping any alarms, how a company with Amazon-level security resources, literally, seemed to find out about the breach only once it started spreading on 4chan.</p>
<p>While security pros wait anxiously to unpack and understand the “part 2” reveal from the hackers, it’s becoming apparent that passwords and user emails are probably coming next, though evidence of this data is already being uncovered by researchers, <a href="https://threatpost.com/twitch-leak-emails-passwords/175390/">according to Threat Post.</a></p>
<p>The PR nightmare for Twitch is only just beginning, and now millions of users’ personal, plain text information will soon percolate among threat actors looking to capitalize on the trove of data released in this hack.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First, it goes without saying that Twitch users need to cycle their passwords immediately and enable multifactor authentication on their accounts if they haven’t done so already; that’s just good security hygiene. Twitch, for its part, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1446033897234513920?s=20">reset all stream keys</a> “out of an abundance of caution” and has been able to keep its platform online throughout the crisis. In itself, that’s impressive and notable during such a massive incident.</p>
<h2>Ongoing shifts in attack tactics</h2>
<p>Beyond the immediately compelling parts of this story — from the enormity of creator payouts to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22716184/twitch-hack-jeff-bezos-pictures-defaced">trolling Jeff Bezos</a> — the nature of this attack and the shift toward extortion rather than demanding ransoms is serious and significant.</p>
<p>Breached organizations who’ve lost control of their data no longer have the binary choice of paying for decryption keys or rebuilding from backups. It’s a signal that the calculus for businesses in times of crisis is becoming exponentially more complex when a threat actor’s objective is extortion instead of a straightforward ransomware payout.</p>
<p>Twitch won’t be the last example of this emerging and vexing tactic; one that seems to be gaining momentum.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Staying ahead of the game</h2>
<p>I’ll give Twitch the benefit of the doubt and assume it had fairly mature security operations and incident response planning — two elements that companies often woefully underinvest in until it’s too late.</p>
<p>But the situation is a sobering reminder that even when an organization does everything right, there’s still no 100% prevention, and threat actors just have to find one vulnerability to take action. The name of the game, now, is a well-tested, well-documented plan and establishing the response your company wants to have when the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p>Who makes the ultimate decisions? What do you need to shut down and when? Who gets called and in what order? It’s infinitely easier to have these discussions when it’s not a <em>hair-on-fire</em> situation. When the inevitable happens, the company and its response need to be battle tested.</p>
<p>While the full scope of Twitch’s hack remains to be seen, it’s an eye-opening situation that everyone should study as a cautionary tale. Even mature, well-resourced systems can be penetrated, and threat actors are keen to wreak havoc and take control of data without locking it up in ransomware.</p>
<p>Companies must plan and be diligent on process and documentation, and also ensure they’re doing everything possible to detect and minimize the impact to keep themselves protected. They must keep playing an unfair game that’s getting progressively more complicated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-10-14-Tinder-Launches-A-New-Way-to-Find-a-Plus-One-Ahead-of-Busiest-Wedding-Season-in-35-years">announced on Thursday</a> that it’s rolling out a new way for its users to find a plus one for the upcoming end-of-year wedding season. Starting today, users will be able to join the &#8220;Plus One&#8221; option within the app to signal that they are either looking for a date to a wedding or are willing to be one. The new feature is accessible within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">Tinder’s Explore</a> section, which launched last month and offers ways to discover matches by interests and more.</p>
<p>“We know many of our members are looking for a Plus One for their next wedding and we’re excited to now give them a way to do exactly that on Tinder,” said Kyle Miller, the vice-president of product innovation at Tinder, in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-10-14-Tinder-Launches-A-New-Way-to-Find-a-Plus-One-Ahead-of-Busiest-Wedding-Season-in-35-years">blog post.</a></p>
<p>Tinder is also partnering with WeddingWire, a wedding planning resource company, to help single guests cover the costs of wedding season through a new Wedding Grant giveaway.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starting today, the first 100 eligible Tinder users to join Plus One will receive $460 to help cover the costs associated with upcoming weddings, such as travel, gifts and accommodations. WeddingWire found that guests spend an average of $460 to attend a wedding, which is why this amount was chosen for the giveaway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218278" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218278" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tinder-plus-one.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>Tinder says users are already gearing up for wedding season, as mentions of a “plus one” in Tinder bios have increased 45% since the beginning of the year. With this latest feature, Tinder users will be able to directly search for a date to a wedding instead of having to weed through uninterested candidates.</p>
<p>This latest launch comes as Tinder has been rolling out new features to engage with users and give them more options to find and interact with dates. For instance, the aforementioned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">new Explore section</a> features events, as well as new ways to discover matches by interests. It also allows users to dive into quick conversations with others before a match is made.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tinder also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/lyft-now-lets-you-pay-for-your-tinder-dates-ride/">partnered with Lyft</a> last week to allow users to pay for their date’s ride. The feature doesn’t require users to exchange addresses or locations and instead lets you send a credit to your date that lets them book a ride.</p>
<p>In addition to these social features, Tinder has also been focused on releasing safety tools for its users. For example, the company announced in August that it plans to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/tinder-will-soon-make-voluntary-id-verification-available-globally/">voluntary ID verification</a> available globally. In June, Tinder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/tinder-finally-adds-a-block-contacts-feature/">released a feature</a> that lets users upload their phone contacts and block certain people that they’d rather not see on the app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new version of Nintendo&#8217;s hit Switch console is just different enough to justify itself, but hardly a must-buy for any of the millions who bought the launch version. With a bigger, brighter and better screen, it&#8217;s a good choice for someone buying now who intends to use it mostly as a handheld — but if you&#8217;re planning or already using your Switch primarily as a stationary console, there&#8217;s pretty much no reason to upgrade. All the same, there will probably be a lot of units moving this holiday season.</p>
<p>Even at the best of times it can be hard to tell what Nintendo&#8217;s hardware strategy is, or whether there is indeed a strategy at all. The $350 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/">Switch OLED</a> provides a perfect example of this: At a time when rivals Sony and Microsoft are striving to show that their next-gen console is the most powerful, Nintendo releases an almost identical version of a console that was underpowered when it came out five years ago. Is it faltering? Or is it just that confident?</p>
<p>Signs point to neither — the rumor being that a <em>new</em> new Switch, with upgraded internals and a new screen but identical form factor, was planned for this year but the pandemic and chip shortage rendered this impossible. Making the best of the situation — or so the story goes — Nintendo slapped the OLED screens on the original hardware and is selling it as a minor quality-of-life update, the way it iterated on the 3DS for years. Nintendo has denied pretty much all accounts and speculation, but this story (again, just rumors) has the right smell.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2213919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know what to say about the result; on one hand, it&#8217;s plainly better than the original. On the other, it&#8217;s only better by a small amount, and for some people, no amount at all.</p>
<p>The screen itself is obviously the biggest improvement. I had the pleasure of playing Metroid: Dread on it, and the game&#8217;s fast-moving, colorful, high-contrast environments looked fantastic on it. The darker darks of the OLED screen made the light areas and colors pop more (though measurements have shown peak brightness is actually lower), and the additional screen real estate, while it looks minimal in photos, does in fact matter in person, making details, UI and text that much more comprehensible.</p>
<p>Oh, and the dust it attracts really stands out on that all-black frontage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218220" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218220" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218220" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-6.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218220" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>The clarity seems improved in motion by the OLED&#8217;s faster individual pixel refresh rate, leaving less of a feeling of one frame blurring into the next. The original Switch&#8217;s screen is just fine, to be clear, but it&#8217;s clearly outmatched here.</p>
<p>The color has a different cast to it than the original&#8217;s LCD, but in games most people won&#8217;t notice: a shift toward the green where the old one tends toward magenta to my eye. Interestingly there are &#8220;vivid&#8221; and &#8220;standard&#8221; options on the OLED model deep in the settings; &#8220;vivid&#8221; was pre-selected and I certainly found it pleasant, giving a bit more saturation to the image but not to the point where it&#8217;s bothersome.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218218" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218218" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218218" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg" alt="The Nintendo Switch OLED on a table." width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218218" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to this, the build quality feels better in general. The flimsy kickstand has been made far more beefy and adjustable, and the whole thing feels better put together. Although there are no significant changes to the internals, a slightly improved thermal profile should mean it runs a little cooler and uses the fans more sparingly. The speakers have supposedly been improved, but are still pretty much a last resort.</p>
<p>The Switch OLED comes with 64 GB of internal space, which is a nice upgrade from the 32 on the original. Of course everyone is going to put a micro SD card in there anyway, but the system volume is preferred and now there&#8217;s just that much less need to archive old games.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone who plays their Switch games primarily on the device itself, or plans to, the Switch OLED is simply a superior device. I would not say it&#8217;s worth paying full price again to upgrade, but it&#8217;s definitely worth the $50 extra should you need to buy a new console after gifting or selling your first. (It&#8217;s $150 more than the handheld-only Lite, but to me the tradeoff of no TV mode has always been too much to justify.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218216" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218216" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218216" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg" alt="The Nintendo Switch OLED on a table." width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nintendo-switch-oled-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2218216" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, if you — like me — tend to keep the Switch in its dock at all times except when traveling, almost nothing will change. There is technically a new dock, a bit more solid feeling as well and featuring an ethernet connection for those who love wires, but pretty much everything else will be the same for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beyond question that the Switch OLED is the best way to play Switch games right now, but even so no one should feel the need to upgrade. Who knows when the next generation of Nintendo consoles will arrive? I think even Nintendo isn&#8217;t quite sure on that. So for now hold onto your cash unless your existing Switch is beat up or would do more good in someone else&#8217;s hands.</p>
