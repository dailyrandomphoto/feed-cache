					<description><![CDATA[Brands wanting to get into influencer marketing can use ProductWind's platform to set up campaigns with hundreds of influencers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some big brands spend millions of dollars on marketing each year and may only drive thousands of dollars in sales as a result. At the same time, influencers are steering thousands, or even millions, of their followers to certain brands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.productwind.com/">ProductWind</a> aims to connect brands with influencers in one click. The company is building a platform to enable brands to launch influencer marketing campaigns. Today, it announced $1.67 million in seed funding led by Early Light Ventures.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jason Kowalski is familiar with the marketing challenges facing brands. He was building Amazon’s self-service marketing platform and saw the disconnect between marketing and sales.</p>
<p>“We want brands to come in and have 100 or 200 influencers working with them,” he said. “Before, you might go on a platform and sort through a list of influencers and find them, but not know who would drive sales the best. It was mostly at the top of the funnel rather than the bottom.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="L6iOfDBVhO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/">5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/embed/#?secret=L6iOfDBVhO" data-secret="L6iOfDBVhO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kowalski brought in former Uber engineer Tom Hirschfeld as his co-founder, and together, applied automation and other proprietary technology to a database of influencers so that brands can join the ProductWind platform, describe what they want to achieve and set up a 100-influencer campaign within minutes versus the traditional weeks.</p>
<p>On the influencer side, they have their own platform and receive notifications when brands want to work with them. Rather than the old way of calling and texting with a brand, the influencer can see a list of available sponsorships, apply and get approved. They can purchase products online, or set up to receive them, and integrate with social media. ProductWind monitors when the posts appear and then pays the influencer through the platform.</p>
<p>As a result, ProductWind is able to generate better return on investment, for example, boosting a product from page 5 to page 1 on Amazon, because the platform creates a flywheel effect: the more value created brings in more sales and more influencers joining the campaign, Hirschfeld said.</p>
<p>For the company’s first 18 months, Kowalski and Hirschfeld bootstrapped the company, which was profitable from the first day, Kowalski said. During this period, revenue increased 10 times. The new funding will be invested in hiring more technology and sales employees to join ProductWind’s 15-person workforce.</p>
<p>“Profitability is key for us because we are producing big campaigns,” Kowalski added. “We are driving marketing and sales, and we want to be the next paradigm shifter.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early Light principal Mike Leffer said the company’s profitability came as a result of not only Kowalski and Hirschfeld being scrappy, but also due to Kowalski attracting some of ProductWind’s early customers by walking through a trade floor and talking to companies even before there was a finished product.</p>
<p>The status quo in influencer marketing is slow, but ProductWind is able to unlock influencer sales predictions. When speaking to customers and potential customers, Leffer said they were already seeing value and ROI. On the influencer side, the company is able to democratize access to the creator economy so that the opportunities aren’t just limited to professionals, he added.</p>
<p>“The company was in the right place at the right time and bootstrapped from nothing to a lot of revenue,” Leffer said. “They hit upon a need in the market where brands are knocking on their door to launch campaigns and then a space for the creator economy where anyone can be an influencer.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the e-commerce aggregator market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/e-commerce-aggregator-rainforest-raises-20m-just-months-after-its-last-funding/">continues to heat up</a>, the U.S. e-commerce industry is on track for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">first $1 trillion year by 2022</a>. At the same time, marketing channels are getting expensive: Amazon ad costs are up <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-ads-are-getting-more-expensive">30% since the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Joining Early Light Ventures in the round was Ben Narasin, who recently spun out of NEA to launch Tenacity Fund, and Broom Ventures.</p>
<p>Narasin says the influencer market is huge and considers ProductWind the “DoubleClick of influencer marketing.” He explained via email that the company reminds him of what he saw during the start of the internet in the early 1990s when DoubleCLick allowed brands to aggregate relevant sites across a diverse and cluttered landscape with one relationship. Similarly, “Product Wind does that for the ‘wild west’ of influencer marketing,” he added.</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">May</a> the EU&#8217;s executive said it would be strengthening the (still) voluntary code which is aimed at driving joined-up industry action to counter the spread of harmful disinformation online.</p>
<p>It called on smaller digital services and adtech firms to sign up &#8212; saying it particularly wanted broader participation, not just the usual platform giants (some of whom were among the first group of signatories).</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla were among the first clutch of tech platforms to sign up to the EU disinformation code back in 2018, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/tiktok-joins-the-eus-code-of-practice-on-disinformation/">TikTok joined last summer</a>.</p>
<p>Eight newbies are said to be preparing to agree to the beefed-up code now.</p>
<p>In addition to the three aforementioned startups, the Commission said organisations that provide specific expertise and technical solutions to fight disinformation, such as Avaaz, Globsec, Logically, NewsGuard and WhoTargetsMe, are also preparing to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;Substantial additional efforts are needed to reduce the flow of harmful disinformation, as illustrated by recent electoral campaigns and by the signatories&#8217; reports on the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/covid-19-disinformation-monitoring">COVID-19 disinformation monitoring program</a>,&#8221; the EC writes in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the shortcomings the Commission has said it wants the revised code to address are: Inconsistent and incomplete application of the Code across platforms and Member States; gaps in the coverage of the Code&#8217;s commitments; a lack of appropriate monitoring mechanism, including key performance indicators; a lack of commitments on access to platforms&#8217; data for research on disinformation; and limited participation from stakeholders, in particular from the advertising sector.</p>
<p>So quite the laundry list, then.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iGtiTjLf7q"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/eu-lawmakers-say-its-time-to-go-further-on-tackling-disinformation/">EU lawmakers say it&#8217;s time to go further on tackling disinformation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers say it&#8217;s time to go further on tackling disinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/eu-lawmakers-say-its-time-to-go-further-on-tackling-disinformation/embed/#?secret=iGtiTjLf7q" data-secret="iGtiTjLf7q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the intention is to beef up the code, it will remain self-regulated. So whether it will become a &#8220;strong EU instrument&#8221;, as the Commission puts it &#8212; without having any real legal teeth &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For large internet platforms there will be, if not literal fangs then some threatening growling as compliance with the beefed-up code will be taken into consideration under wider, incoming digital regulations &#8212; aka, the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> &#8212; which seeks to increase internet companies&#8217; accountability across a number of areas.</p>
<p>And if self-regulation still fails to move the needle on harmful online disinformation like bogus information about COVID-19 vaccines or election interference the Commission could still propose legislation. However it seems reluctant to do that in such a subjective and controversial area given the risks of being accused of censoring free speech.</p>
<p>Pan-EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">rules for political ads transparency</a> are slated for introduction next year, in one targeted piece of planned legislation.</p>
<p>In a statement on the eight new &#8220;prospective signatories&#8221;, who have joined in the revision process as a beefed-up version of the disinformation code is drafted, Věra Jourová, the VP for values and transparency, said: “I am pleased to see new actors from relevant sectors answering our call and engaging in the overhaul of the Code of Practice. I encourage others, including platforms, messaging services and actors in the online advertising ecosystem, to join as soon as possible to co-shape the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strengthened Code cannot fall short of the expectations we have set out in our Guidance from May,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Online players have a special responsibility regarding spreading and monetising disinformation. They must become more transparent, accountable and safe by design.”</p>
<p>Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the internal market, added: “I welcome the fact that more and more online platforms, technology providers, civil society and expert organisations are formally committing to fighting disinformation. The private sector should be ambitious and anticipate the new EU rules on digital services (DSA). Now is the time to show they walk the talk.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith wasted no time responding to allegations of a hostile work environment, sending an internal letter to employees Thursday encouraging staff to speak to him directly or via an in-house anonymous hotline with their concerns. Of course, it&#8217;s standard practice for companies like Blue Origin to prefer handling complaints internally rather than in the public arena.</p>
<p>The letter from Smith, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-email-response-to-toxic-workplace-essay.html">which was first obtained by CNBC</a>, comes on the heels of an essay jointly <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">composed by 21 current and former Blue Origin employees</a> detailing serious concerns regarding safety and sexual harassment at the company.</p>
<p>Alexandra Abrams, former head of employee communications, is the sole named author of the essay. She told TechCrunch in a new interview that she decided to go public with her identity because she felt a sense of responsibility for other employees.</p>
<p>“I really felt like I had compromised my integrity at Blue Origin,” she said. “I did my best, but I was Bob&#8217;s executive communicator and helped make him look good.”</p>
<p>The essay details two instances of alleged sexual harassment by senior executives, including one instances of a senior leader being let go after groping a female employee — notably, Abrams said, only five of the 21 people who contributed to the essay are men. The essay also alleges that safety at Blue Origin took a backseat to speed of execution, with leadership insisting on a breakneck pace that wasn’t supported by adequate staffing or resources.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has always been much better staffed than Blue Origin,” Abrams said.</p>

<p>Blue Origin said in a statement that Abrams was dismissed “for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.” However, Abrams said she never received any warnings, verbal or written, from management regarding issues related to federal export control regulations.</p>
<p>Instead, she says her termination came after initiating a project to develop an internal employee app. Two weeks after that app, called Voyager, went live, it was discovered that part of its architecture was not secure — this is a major concern in the aerospace industry, as all communications tools must be compliant with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a set of regulations governing tech related to defense and space.</p>
<p>Abrams says she immediately escalated the issue. While senior management conducted an investigation and found no export violations occurred, senior executives reportedly told her that “she could no longer be trusted” and fired her.</p>
<p>“As a communications professional, and part of the non-technical staff, I was not responsible for certifying or approving any compliance of any third-party software architecture. And to-date, as far as I’m aware, the software in question is still used by Blue Origin and Amazon,” she added.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was “reviewing the information” detailed in the essay. Abrams said that the agency has not reached out to her, but that she would “very much welcome” that.</p>
<p>“I feel like I&#8217;m fulfilling my job description as employee communications for the first time.”</p>
<p>Bob Smith&#8217;s full internal team email on Abram&#8217;s letter follows below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Team Blue,</p>
<p>Today, you may have seen that some claims were made against our team.</p>
<p>As with any criticism, whether personal or professional, and whether the criticism is fair or baseless, it is never easy to hear. It requires reflection and humility to sort through what is useful and what is not.</p>
<p>It is particularly difficult and painful, for me, to hear claims being levied that attempt to characterize our entire team in a way that doesn’t align with the character and capability that I see at Blue Origin every day.</p>
<p>Yet, one of our Blue Leadership Principles states that “Leaders are sincerely open-minded, and examine their own strongest convictions with humility. They value diversity, in all of its forms, since different viewpoints result in novel ideas. Their openness enables them to trust those around them — and to earn the trust of others in turn.”</p>
<p>We wrote and published that principle, and others, and will today, and always, be self-critical and hold ourselves to the highest standard.</p>
<p>While we reflect on what we can learn and improve, I do want to reassure the team on a few points.</p>
<p>First, the New Shepard team went through a methodical and pain-staking process to certify our vehicle for First Human Flight. Anyone that claims otherwise is uninformed and simply incorrect. That team is appropriately proud of the work they’ve done and we should be as well.</p>
<p>It should also be emphatically stated that we have no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues including a 24/7 anonymous hotline for employees, we investigate and act on any findings, and we will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct. As always, I welcome and encourage any member of Team Blue to speak directly with me if they have any concerns on any topic at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, it should never be doubted that we have an amazing team that is doing amazing work.</p>
<p>Our team is comprised of the best and brightest professionals in the aerospace industry. People who are dedicated, work hard and are passionate about our mission.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to rapidly grow that talented team, stay focused on our efforts and support each other. And, step by step, we will make even greater strides.</p>
<p>Gradatim Ferociter,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Vice President Al Gore has invested $600 million of equity into U.K. energy startup <a href="https://octopusenergy.group/">Octopus Energy Group</a> via his <a href="https://www.generationim.com/">Generation Investment Management</a> vehicle, taking a stake of approximately 13% in the business. The investment means Octopus has attained a valuation of around $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>Octopus has made a name for itself in energy circles largely because of its &#8220;Kraken&#8221; technology platform, which it claims is able to reroute energy from renewable sources around a network far more efficiently than competitors. Octopus is now managing 17 million energy accounts in 12 countries in this manner.</p>
<p>Generation is a $36 billion fund management business with a specific remit to back sustainable businesses.  Octopus will use the proceeds of Generation’s strategic investment to push further into the U.S. market, where it already has a toe-hold in Texas.</p>
<p>The Generation investment follows an earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/ai-driven-energy-startup-octopus-hits-2bn-mark-after-200m-investment-from-tokyo-gas/">equity investment from Origin Energy</a>, Tokyo Gas and the acquisition of Upside Energy, specialists in smart grid technology. Octopus’s retail businesses are now in the U.K., U.S., Germany, Spain and New Zealand, plus it has licensing agreements with Good Energy, Hanwha Corporation, Origin Energy, Power and E.ON.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI-driven energy startup Octopus hits $2B mark after $200M investment from Tokyo Gas&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/ai-driven-energy-startup-octopus-hits-2bn-mark-after-200m-investment-from-tokyo-gas/embed/#?secret=hdieWxS9t2" data-secret="hdieWxS9t2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Octopus has also earlier launched Electric Juice, an electric vehicle &#8220;roaming network&#8221; of 100,000 charge points across Europe that allows users to charge their personal Octopus Energy account when they charge their EVs. It’s also partnered with Tesla to launch Tesla Power in the U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Speaking for Octopus Energy, founder and CEO, Greg Jackson said: “Whilst the U.K. energy market is currently in a tough state, it’s highlighted the need for investment in renewables and technologies to end our reliance on fossil fuels. So we are delighted to announce our agreement with Generation Investment Management, created to back sustainable companies changing the world for the better.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We run 300 stress tests, twice a week. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re … doing it on spreadsheets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking for Generation Investment Management, Tom Hodges, partner in the long-term equity strategy, said: “Octopus Energy has an extraordinarily good fit with Generation’s mission of investing over the long term to support system and climate-positive companies. The world is at the early stages of an unprecedented energy transition which is essential to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. This can be done in a way that is better for the environment and consumers.”</p>
<p>In an interview via Zoom, Jackson told me that there are two parts to the current global energy crisis: “One is the energy wholesale price crisis. Global gas prices have trebled or quadrupled in the last year. That&#8217;s not only causing gas to be expensive but because a lot of electricity comes from gas it’s pushing up electricity prices. I think this is really revealing the extent to which companies have been selling long and buying short. So companies that are currently folding are larger ones which had sold a one-year contract, but only bought six months worth of energy and they were keeping their fingers crossed for the rest of it.”</p>
<p>He said Octopus has “always been 100% hedged. For us, energy retail is just one of our businesses. And we&#8217;ve got 13 businesses in the group. What we&#8217;ve always sought to do is serve an outstanding service and a really, really risk-managed back end. We run 300 stress tests, twice a week on our hedging position. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re either not doing that or they are doing it on spreadsheets and it just doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>“The reality is this crisis is entirely a fossil-fuel crisis. And if we&#8217;d been using renewables as a primary source and then gas as a backup we wouldn&#8217;t be in this situation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Octopus is an owner-operator of wind, solar and biomass renewable energy sources, with £3.5 billion in generation assets and plans to 10x that over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The generation deal consists of a $300 million immediate investment, with $300 million to follow by June 2022, subject to certain further funding conditions.</p>
<p>Octopus has also established the <a href="https://www.centrefornetzero.org/">Centre for Net Zero</a>, an independent London-based research facility that is taking the fight against climate change to the government level and also invested £10 million into an R&amp;D and Training Centre for Decarbonisation of Heat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All good things must come to an end, and this proverb totally applies to our early-bird price on passes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>. Today’s the final day you can save $100 on the price of admission, folks. Join the global SaaS community to connect, inspire, network and learn how to build a stronger startup — without reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your TC Sessions: SaaS pass</a> by <strong>11:59 pm (PT) tonight</strong> to score the early-bird price and save $100.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from and engage with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#ab40f8e4-b236-4c11-8767-8fd7d75a618c">top leaders</a> in a sector that’s both evolving and expanding at a rapid pace. These presentations and breakout sessions are interactive, so bring your questions and opinions (we know you have plenty of both) and shape the conversation as you learn more about the direction of the next generation of SaaS products, platforms and technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">The TC Sessions: SaaS agenda</a> covers a range of topics. This discussion on open source is just one great example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Future Is Wide Open:</strong> Many startups today have an open source component, and it’s no wonder. It builds an audience and helps drive sales. We’ll talk with Abby Kearns from Puppet, Augusto “Aghi” Marietti from Kong and Jason Warner, an investor at Redpoint, about why open source is such a popular way to build a business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Automation is an essential SaaS element, and these two panel discussions take a deep dive into the role it plays now and in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to be more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll talk with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG, and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</li>
<li><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, AKASA co-founder and CTO, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries. Presented by AKASA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early-bird savings come to an end <strong>tonight</strong> <strong>at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your TC Sessions: SaaS pass</a> before the deadline, and you’ll save $100.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AutoLeap is bringing the auto repair shop into the 21st century by digitizing their workflow and reducing the manual double-entry shop owners are used to doing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/">$5 million seed round</a>, Toronto auto repair software company AutoLeap is back with $18 million in Series A funding, this time led by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>Joining Bain in the round is existing investor Threshold Ventures, which led the seed round, to give the company $23 million in total funding.</p>
<p>Co-CEO Steve Lau told TechCrunch that AutoLeap is bringing the auto repair shop into the 21st century by reducing the double- or triple-entry shop owners typically have to do through the digitization of their workflow — customer quoting, invoices and job estimates — and the processing of all of that in the backend accounting. It also provides a sales and marketing component via customer relationship management, scheduling via app, customer texting or emails and online reviews.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AutoLeap says it will repair your lousy relationship with car shops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/embed/#?secret=kVbi3gkxez" data-secret="kVbi3gkxez" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since the seed round and launching last year, the company has grown “well beyond expectations, Lau said. From a team perspective, the company has grown five times and increased 10 times in customer base. Revenue also continues to grow month over month.</p>
<p>“We are more convinced about the market opportunity and our fit in it,” he added. “One of our first customers also recently shared that in the first 10 months of using AutoLeap, his shop doubled its revenue. This is having a real impact in their lives.”</p>
<p>Growing a business is second nature to Lau, who with co-CEO Rameez Ansari spent four years as the co-CEOs of FieldEdge, a SaaS company that helps contractors run their small businesses. They grew the company to 200 employees in over three years, which allowed them to hit the ground running with AutoLeap, Lau said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s team is spread out in Canada, the U.S. and Pakistan. Most of its customers are in the U.S. — 85% — with the rest in Canada.</p>
<p>Lau estimates that the automotive aftermarket is a $700 million industry, with 1 million technicians and 300,000 shops.</p>
<p>“We are only in the second inning of this market transitioning from pen to digital,” he said. “A  lot of the new capital will be used to capture that market opportunity and hire a world-class team to help us put out a better product and customer service.”</p>
<p>He expects to triple AutoLeap’s workforce in the next 12 months and will be focusing on creating a diverse employee base.</p>
<p>Ajay Agarwal, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said via email that “small businesses are the backbone of our economy” and as seen in other sectors, like consumer brands, restaurants and retail, business owners are seeking modern cloud software that enables them to remain competitive and deliver a better experience for customers.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Steve and Rameez as they tackle the enormous opportunity of helping the 300,000 independent auto repair shops move their businesses into the digital age,” Agarwal added. “AutoLeap is bringing a combination of a comprehensive SAAS platform with embedded payments and a marketplace to auto repair shops, one of the last verticals yet to make the leap to the cloud.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA['It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market today has a lot of activation energy, even as the pandemic continues to play out. We&#8217;re seeing ample capital, a focus on distributed investing, more first-check investors than ever before, and, fittingly, a parade of new startups.</p>
<p>That said, momentum has a way of overwhelming even the most ambitious. For founders at the earliest stages of building a company, it’s imperative to spend in a balanced yet growth-focused manner. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, Harlem Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hpierrejacques">Henri Pierre-Jacques</a> and BBG Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Nish67">Nisha Dua</a> explained how founders should allocate their recently raised dollars in today’s environment.</p>
<p>Personal finance — even for founders — varies for everyone, but the investors drew from their experience with their portfolio companies and their own ethos to give general advice on everything from the importance of an emergency-day fund to how much energy to actually put into hiring new talent.</p>
<h2>Hiring 101</h2>
<p>Dua addressed the elephant in the room right away: Hiring. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">As we’ve seen</a>, hiring has always been hard for startups, which are more strapped for resources than, say, a Facebook that can offer an engineer a $1 million signing bonus without blinking an eye. Founders and investors tell me that hiring is only getting harder as an increasing number of well-capitalized startups are rising up with impressive valuations.</p>
<p>Dua feels it&#8217;s right for hiring to be at the top of every founder’s list, but she urged those listening to start by thinking backward.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent. The answer for where to spend is going to be different for every company across many different industries.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us would admit that we&#8217;re not really great at planning or budgeting in our own lives. But we have to be great at that for our companies to succeed, to grow and to get to profitability. And so what we like to sort of challenge founders on is, ‘Can you articulate your North Star? And then what is your plan? And is that plan executable to get to that North Star?’ That’s really where the plan for how to spend comes in. You&#8217;re not going to reach that North Star in the first 18 months after your first check, obviously, but you&#8217;re going to have a set of milestones that get you to the first hurdle.</p>
<p>[So, think about] the things that are going to make this company most successful in the pursuit of achieving that greater North Star? Hiring is certainly going to be at the top of that list.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pierre-Jacques drew from his portfolio company, Miami-based Pangea, which recently raised a $70 million Series B, to illustrate one way he&#8217;s seen entrepreneurs navigate the talent wars. In short, founders should permit themselves to step away from the hiring process.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The capital market for startups has perhaps never been more attractive than it is today. Not only are venture capitalists <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/07/venture-pulse-q2-2021.pdf">raising more capital than ever</a>, but new methods of financing startup activity are maturing. The result is a capital market that is increasingly competitive for startup attention, and business, which may lead to better prices for founders and their startups.</p>
<p>Venture debt is not new, but twists on this model are taking new prominence in how startups pay for their growth, for example.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>The expanding value of what young technology companies create could be helping change the market for how they are financed: Many tech startups build software, and the value of software revenues has grown in recent quarters. This means that when startups grow their revenues, they generate more value than in times past. In turn, that bolsters the value of shares in the company more rapidly than in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>Selling equity, then, is more costly than before. That fact may lead to startups not wanting to pursue equity-only transactions when possible. Why? Because if a company can borrow capital at rock-bottom effective rates, it will nearly always prove more inexpensive over the long term than selling shares in its business that have essentially uncapped upside.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/videos/?video=2206216">held a panel on revenue-based financing at Disrupt the other week</a>, from which we’ve pulled a number of quotes to help frame our thinking around venture capital investment and when startups may want to pursue other methods of funding.</p>
<p>With alternative capital concerns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/pipe-snaps-up-former-stripe-and-hubspot-execs/">like Pipe attracting top talent while expanding to new markets</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">Clearbanc rebranding to Clearco while raising $100 million earlier this year</a>, it’s clear that the market for funds outside of traditional venture checks is maturing. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Not just SaaS</h2>
<p>While we tend to view the larger startup market through the prism of software, the recent Warby Parker public offering makes it clear that venture-level returns are possible for companies with a number of business models. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though Twitter has introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">monetization</a> options for popular tweeters, it hasn&#8217;t widely introduced different profile types for businesses, which its competitors at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/facebook-launches-facebook-business-suite-an-app-for-managing-business-accounts-across-facebook-instagram-and-messenger/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/instagram-officially-announces-its-new-business-tools/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/tiktok-launches-tiktok-for-business-for-marketers-takes-on-snapchat-with-new-ar-ads/">TikTok</a> have already had for a while.</p>

<p>Twitter classifies anyone who uses Twitter for work as a professional &#8212; to qualify for a professional account, users must have no repeated history of violating guidelines, and they must be authentic, with an account name, bio and profile picture. That means no fictional characters, parody accounts or pet accounts allowed (but some pets do have enough of a social following to make their owners money, in which case&#8230; is the dog a professional? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>
<p>Not all users have the capability to switch to a professional account just yet. But, when it&#8217;s available, users will be able to find a Twitter for Professionals tab by swiping open the sidebar from the Home timeline on the app. A &#8220;Switch to Professional&#8221; tab will also appear under profile settings. Then, select the most accurate category and either a business or creator account type. Once you&#8217;ve converted to a professional account, you will be prompted to follow topics, promote a tweet in an ad campaign, or customize your profile with modules. These include an about module, a shop module and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">newsletter module</a> for users on Revue, the newsletter service Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquired</a> early this year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211165" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211165" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?w=680" alt="Professional Twitter accounts can add modules for shopping, their newsletter, or more info about their business." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-professional-profile-modules.jpg.twimg_.1920.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>If you decide that maybe you&#8217;re more of an amateur tweeter than a professional, it&#8217;s possible to switch your account back by navigating to edit profile, then edit professional profile, then switch account type. You also can toggle between whether you&#8217;re a business or a creator account, because at this point, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell! Twitter also wrote in its <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/account-setup/professional-accounts.html">FAQ</a> that you can only convert an existing Twitter account to a professional account (you can&#8217;t make a new account professional to begin with), and as of now, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have plans to allow for ads targeting professional accounts specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vareto.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vareto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup aiming to help companies conduct more forward-looking financial planning and analysis, is coming out of stealth today with $24 million in total funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GV (formerly Google Ventures) led its $20 million Series A this year, and Menlo Ventures led its $4.2 million seed financing in the summer of 2020. Menlo also put money in the company’s latest round, in addition to 40 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investors, including tech unicorn founders and chief financial officers. The angels who either backed the company in its seed or Series A round are a high-profile bunch, and include Asana COO <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Anne Raimondi&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:1317825,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1136076},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;21&quot;:1,&quot;23&quot;:1}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneraimondi/">Anne Raimondi, Salesforce President and ex-CFO Mark Hawkins, Splunk CFO Jason Child, Facebook CFO Dave Wehner, Affirm CFO Michael Linford, Egnyte CEO and co-founder Vineet Jain, Microsoft CVP Manik Gupta and Hippo Insurance&#8217;s VP of Finance Roy Hefer. Talk about validation.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its own words, Mountain View-based Vareto is developing a new platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning &amp; analysis) teams with the goal of “building the future of financial planning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that stands out about Vareto &#8212; besides its impressive list of early investors of course &#8212; is its founding team. Before stints as an investor, CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katorekhova/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kat Orekhova</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was head of product at Ironclad and held a variety of roles at Facebook, including head of forecasting and analytics. While at the social media giant, Orekhova says she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built Facebook&#8217;s “first-ever” data science team within FP&amp;A. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">President </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ls17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lalit Singh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the former COO of Udacity and essentially led that company to being cash flow positive after being on the verge of shutting down. Prior to joining Udacity, he spent several years at Hewlett-Packard Enterprises where he did things such as lead that company’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital transformation of HPE’s $3 billion software business and serve as COO of its $2 billion Cloud business and VP of operational performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair teamed up in 2020 to come up with a platform that would give FP&amp;A teams the ability to “seamlessly” work across planning and reporting cycles. In other words, it wants to help such teams be more proactive and look toward the future instead of reactive and “looking in the rearview mirror.” Their goal was to create a strategic finance platform for the enterprise that had the look and feel of a consumer offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Orekhova, Vareto’s aim is perhaps even more simple &#8212; to h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">elp companies run better with an integrated planning and reporting tool that aims to streamline the entire FP&amp;A process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Questions such as ‘How are we doing as a business and how could we be doing even better? are hard to answer today,” she said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the teams tasked with answering these questions (FP&amp;A) are the ones trying to set business targets. So those teams are the main focus of Vareto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we spoke to a hardware company whose team takes four weeks to put together the business summary for the prior month,” Orekhova explained. “So this means they&#8217;re always a month behind in the visibility into their business performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s particularly difficult, she added. To understand how a business is doing, especially a very large enterprise business with many acquired companies across different business lines and different geographies, “you have to pull data from many different systems, you have to talk to many stakeholders” to understand what&#8217;s going on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And so assembling this view of your business is actually really hard today, and planning is even worse,” Orekhova added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of planning on average takes five months for a large company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So as you can imagine, by the time this process ends, the plan is very much out of date,” she told TechCrunch. “And that&#8217;s really why we started Vareto &#8212; because we saw this incredible lag between understanding how your business is doing, and actually being able to make an operational change to make things better.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211013" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211013" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211013 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211013" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vareto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B SaaS startup thus aims to become a command center for the finance and executive teams to see how a business is doing in real time and to be able to make necessary operational changes faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you see a gap in an opportunity, you can immediately put resources toward that in days, not months,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time running HP’s cloud business, Singh recalls getting “three different answers from three different teams” about customer churn, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be confused, which answers should I believe?” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Singh ended up assembling a 10-person “shadow finance and ops team” to get “the right information at the right time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later when he joined Udacity, he struggled with getting a forecast for a given year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have multiple systems and multiple businesses and getting information from them, and putting the right layer of information, just takes tons of time,” he said. “At both companies, I didn’t have the luxury of having a solution like we are building.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, the startup declined to reveal any hard revenue figures, saying only that its customers span different industries such as sales enablement, security and property tech and include Mindtickle and Landing, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vareto’s investors are naturally bullish on what the startup is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naomi Pilosof Ionita, partner at Menlo Ventures, led Vareto’s seed round last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw an authenticity in the founding team that appealed to her. In addition, she said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she loved how Vareto “marries financial metrics with operating metrics”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often, these are composite metrics and the underlying levers are worth understanding,” Pilosof Ionita told TechCrunch. “Forecasting can’t be an ivory tower process. It’s a collaborative exercise with executives across the business who own the various inputs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VC says she experienced that firsthand when running product growth and monetization at Invoice2go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regarding established incumbents in this space, we hear from their users that a lot of analyses and forecasts still default to Excel files being emailed back and forth,” she added. “FP&amp;A teams need a more modern platform that’s collaboration first and handles data interoperability well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Clark, general partner at GV, said he was not only impressed with the founding team and their combined experience, but also the ease of use of the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clean and easy to learn and use,” he told TechCrunch. In fact, he was so taken with the platform, he backed the company at the Series A stage &#8212; a departure from his usual investing at B and C stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping companies make business better decisions continues to attract investor dollars at an increasingly rapid pace.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are all the rage at the moment. We’re seeing explosive growth in this sector as people experiment with building companies on top of tokens and smart contracts. And where new organization types bloom, so does the need for infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.utopialabs.io/">Utopia Labs</a> is a team of four founders who met on Discord and Twitter over the past few months &#8212; a story that is getting increasingly familiar in the crypto-driven web3 space where everything is moving incredibly fast at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/0xkaito">Kaito Cunningham</a> recently worked at crypto firm M31 and is in the On Deck Catalyst program. Utopia’s co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/pryceandstuff">Pryce Adade Yebesi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderwu2000">Alexander Wu</a> and Jason Chong also have held a scattering of tech builder background gigs, from Facebook internships to LunchClub to Microsoft. The collective interest in DAOs, though, was what brought them together to begin chatting and eventually building for the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not familiar with the DAO explosion happening, what we’re seeing is communities come together around a thesis that in the past may have required an LLC or C-corp structure in order to execute instead turning to blockchain solutions. Basically, company structure governed by a smart contract instead of legacy legal structures. Some current estimates put the value governed by DAO </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/biggest-daos-now-hold-6b-worth-of-digital-assets-consensys/#:~:text=The%2020%20largest%20decentralized%20autonomous,ConsenSys%2C%20an%20Ethereum%20software%20company."><span style="font-weight: 400;">treasuries at over $6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up from $1 billion earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plot the curve, you’ll see the potential for growth is pretty enormous. And with the vast majority of DAOs operating across international boundaries on a global scale, there is a big need for infrastructure build out that takes over where the contract ends, namely in areas like payroll, expenses, token distribution and HR management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utopia Labs is building out a stack of infrastructure tools for DAOs and they’re starting with the payments bit. They’ve raised $1.5 million from a group of investors to begin hiring a </span><a href="https://utopia-labs.notion.site/47eac0e68b9a461c8daf473d0f61ca06#8839ae25306b473ea0f1bdcaf61e4d6a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full stack engineer and front-end engineer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Kindred Ventures, which has invested in other bleeding-edge crypto </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/crypto-driven-marketplace-zora-raises-2m-to-build-a-sustainable-creator-economy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platforms like Zora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Bitski. Other investors participating include Syndica DAO, 4th Revolution Capital and angels like Trevor McFedries at Brud, Alex Zhang at Friends With Benefits (another major DAO), Tyson Battistella from Zora, Anirudh Pai at On Deck, Colin Goltra at Binance, Gabby Dizon from YGG, Jason Choi from Spartan Fund, Jeff Weinstein from Stripe and several others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2211232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="642" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png 1662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=1536,963 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all of this sounds incredibly bleeding edge, it is. The team literally founded the company earlier in September &#8212; yes, the month that we are at the end of currently. They saw the opportunity to build out in this space that has energized the web3 space and dove in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many DAOs pay members in their own tokens, increasing ownership stakes to provide members with an opportunity for greater rewards down the line or immediate liquidity. Utopia is building right on top of Gnosis SAFE, the financial core of most DAOs. The V1 product is focused on member payments and invoice workflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of DAOs are operating token distribution and payments based on raw dumps of data. As the saying goes, where you see a CSV, there’s a business opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team says they’ve built invoices and reimbursements workflows so that DAOs can receive, pay out and manage invoices and reimbursement requests. They’ve also built all-in-one transactions to allow DAOs to batch payments in one transaction across multiple people and coins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is financial analysis and accounting to attach labels and metadata to payments in order to avoid manual accounting via Etherscan dump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forward-looking roadmap includes traditional fiat currency services, cross-chain DAOs, real-world compliance workflows and DAO ecosystem partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of DAOs is currently on fire, with dozens of viable organizations that have significant momentum &#8212; but not nearly enough infrastructure to make them truly efficient. It&#8217;s a truly interesting and diverse landscape that has come a long way since The DAO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/the-only-thing-that-really-worried-me-was-the-ether/">nearly derailed Ethereum</a> back in 2016. Today&#8217;s DAOs are more company scale than network scale but are moving faster and building cooler things than containers for money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On-chain payroll make DAOs truly crypto-native,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa">Cooper Turley</a>, a co-founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/fwbtweets">FWB</a> and full-time DAO explorer. “In a world where dozens of members are contributing from every corner of the world, automating salaries, incentives and bounties are the only way in which DAOs can scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to what Utopia Labs is doing, Multisafe, Commonwealth, Parcel and Colony are all names to watch in the DAO infrastructure space. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were all aboard this week under the guidance of <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, meaning that we were running full-strength for our roundup of this <em>super</em> busy week.</p>
<p>Before we hop into the topics, you can follow the show on Twitter &#8212; all the cool kids do! &#8212; and keep in mind that on Mondays Equity provides a short kickoff to the week, we chat a single topic on Wednesdays and Fridays are when we go through the full week. Make sense? Hell yeah:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiveable landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/fiveable-lands-10m-series-a-to-become-the-hallways-of-the-educational-internet/">$10 million Series A to become the digital hallways of the educational internet</a>. It&#8217;s their words, not ours, and Mary Ann had some fair questions on how they&#8217;ll differentiate from other competitors.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/cobalt-launches-from-beta-with-a-2-8m-seed-to-help-creators-launch-products/">Cobalt raised $2.8 million</a> to help creators build and sell more stuff. As part of our continuing focus on creators more broadly, we had a few questions!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/weight-health-startup-found-comes-out-of-stealth-with-32m-in-funding-former-bumble-exec-as-new-ceo/">Found came out of stealth</a> with $32 million in total funding from GV, Atomic and Define Ventures. The startup is focused on &#8220;weight care management&#8221; and it&#8217;s notable that the co-founder of Atomic, which incubated this company, also co-founded hims and hers &#8212; which also has a telehealth component. Found&#8217;s new CEO is the former COO of Bumble, who drafted its S-1 while getting chemo treatment for stage 3 breast cancer.</li>
<li>From there we dug into trends! First up was the trend of startups going full-stack, which we kicked off with a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">AngelList&#8217;s new Stack &#8212; har har &#8212; product</a>. The suite screams Carta and Stripe, but then again, doesn&#8217;t everything compete with each other these days?</li>
<li>Next up was consolidation, which echoed our first conversation. Discussing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rpa-industry-consolidation-continues-with-sale-of-blue-prism-to-vista-for-1-095b/">recent deal in the RPA space</a>, the Equity team made predictions about which sectors in the startup world are the most likely to see consolidation in the coming quarters.</li>
<li>And we closed with climate tech, a startup niche that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">could bring a small sliver of hope to our heating planet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this, and we still managed to sneak a Froyo metaphor into the running for best Official Equity comment of all time.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, GM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-to-exclusively-sell-zero-emissions-cars-by-2035-164418993.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">announced</a> plans to go green by 2035 with the vehicles it produces and by 2030 with how it produces them. Now, the company has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-expects-renewable-energy-powered-us-sites-by-2025-ahead-plan-2021-09-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">announced</a> that it will be early on the &#8220;how&#8221; part, using 100 percent renewable energy across its US operations by 2025 — five years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal, GM said it would increase energy efficiency and source renewables for its facilities. It also plans to create technology to store renewable energy over the medium and long term and &#8220;create microgrids that help deploy renewable energy.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>“We know climate action is a priority and every company must push itself to decarbonize further and faster,” said GM Chief Sustainability Officer Kristen Siemen. “That’s what we are doing by aiming to achieve 100 percent renewable energy five years earlier in the US.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It also detailed plans to work with a company called PJM Interconnection to track energy usage based on carbon output of the grid at any given time. &#8220;When the power being supplied consists mostly of fossil fuels, GM can make informed decisions about tapping into stored renewable energy or reduce the amount of power being consumed,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>As for the vehicles it produces, GM plans to have 30 EVs globally by 2025, and still plans to &#8220;eliminate tailpipe emissions for new light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars, SUVs and pickups) by 2035.&#8221; The wording suggests that could include hydrogen-powered cars, though GM appears to be focusing mostly on EVs.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s plans to reduce pollution have drifted with the political winds, however. It was one of several automakers that backed the Trump administration&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-trump-administration-national-emissions-standards.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">plan</a>to bar California and other states from setting their own pollution and zero-emission requirements. That would have allowed manufacturers to raise fuel efficiency by just 1.5 percent per year, well below the previous administration&#8217;s five percent requirement. GM withdrew from the litigation shortly after Joe Biden was elected President.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Orchest is building a tool for data scientists to develop and deploy data pipelines without having to rely on an infrastructure or engineering team.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.orchest.io/">Orchest</a> co-founder and CEO Rick Lamers calls himself, his co-founder Yannick Perrenet and his team “a bunch of data nerds” that love making data tools.</p>
<p>In this case the company is building an open source integrated development environment tool for data scientists so they can develop, iterate and deploy data pipelines without having to rely on an infrastructure or engineering team.</p>
<p>On Friday, the company announced a $3.5 million seed round led by Gradient Ventures and Basis Set Ventures. Joining the round were Seedcamp and Data Council founder Pete Soderling.</p>
<p>“Data scientists get overwhelmed with technology that they have to know,” Lamers told TechCrunch. “They have it the worst: they have a good understanding of mathematics, modeling and what you can say from the data, but they are not as familiar with cloud computing, containerization and the infrastructure side.”</p>
<p>Orchest makes that type of workflow more autonomous so data scientists don’t have to solve those technology issues themselves, but can go from an initial idea to deployment in the same environment, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210933" style="width: 3186px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210933" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2210933 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png" alt="" width="3176" height="2042" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png 3176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=768,494 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=680,437 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=1536,988 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=2048,1317 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3.-Orchest-UI-Environment-builds.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3176px) 100vw, 3176px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210933" class="wp-caption-text">Orchest&#8217;s user interface environment. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orchest</p></div></p>
<p>The company, founded in 2020, started out as an open source project on GitHub before running a private beta of clouding hosting. Today is also the debut of the company’s first public version, Lamers said. It has a SaaS business model and offers a version where Orchest takes care of all of the operational hosting and an enterprise version with additional features.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He and Perrenet were studying computer science at Delft University of Technology and dropped out to start the company. They were already coding open source software and were racking up a large amount of GitHub stars in a short period of time when investors began reaching out, Lamers recalls.</p>
<p>Orchest already has over 1,300 stars, and over 150 companies signed up for the private beta. It saw over 2,500 unique installs of the open source software, including from organizations like Accenture and Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Chang Xu, partner at Basis Set, met Lamers and Perrenet early in 2020 and recalls them standing out as “exceptional founders,” and ended up participating in the company’s pre-seed round at the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Xu’s area of expertise is early-stage B2B infrastructure and developer tools. She said that software engineers often have many tools at their disposal, but data scientists don’t. They may learn how to use certain resources, like Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab, during their education, but once they have a job and are out there manipulating the data, they realize they don’t have the software engineering prowess.</p>
<p>“Rick and Yannick were telling us that once data scientists get to companies they don’t know how to apply what they have used, and companies don’t have the money to staff a full engineering team, so there is white space in the tools there,” she said. “Orchest enables data scientists to self-serve what they need and can just use it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company is partnering with restaurants to share their food across a city via a network of satellite kitchens without having to put up any upfront costs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic ushered in the popularity of shared workspaces, known as cloud kitchens or ghost kitchens, for restaurants to cook meals exclusively for delivery.</p>
<p>But for small, independent restaurants that couldn’t afford the upfront costs for expansion, Uber Eats alums Ken Chong and Matt Sawchuk came up with another approach. They founded <a href="https://alldaykitchens.com/">All Day Kitchens</a> in 2018 to partner with restaurants to share their food across a city through use of a network of satellite kitchens, without having to put up any upfront costs.</p>
<p>With their model, distributed kitchens are situated in residential and business areas, closer to customers. When a new restaurant is onboarded to the platform, their food goes to all locations, which streamlines how restaurants expand in large geographies and delivery zones, CEO Chong told TechCrunch. The model also enables the ability for customers to order from multiple restaurants in one order and it will all be delivered together.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210985" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210985" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210985" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg 8103w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/VKC_335.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210985" class="wp-caption-text">All Day Kitchens founders Ken Chong and Matt Sawchuk</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumer preference was spoken for pre-COVID and the entire restaurant world was not going to be the right model for how digital demand was to be filled,” he added. “We set out to build a turn key solution for restaurants for which warehouse ghost kitchens were not working for them. Instead, we built a platform for micro-fulfillment so they could expand their reach.”</p>
<p>On Friday, the food tech and logistics company announced a $65 million Series C round of financing led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from GIC to fund expansion into new markets, R&amp;D and hiring. Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures and Base10 also participated in the round along with new investors, including Tishman Speyer, Lime CEO Wayne Ting and Forward co-founders Adrian Aoun and Ilya Abyzov.</p>
<p>The new investment brings All Day Kitchens’ total funding to date to $102.5 million. It is the latest company in the ghost kitchen space to receive funding in a hot industry that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/30/muy-raises-15m-to-grow-its-new-cloud-kitchen-concept/">Muy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/justkitchen-is-using-cloud-kitchens-to-create-the-next-generation-of-restaurant-franchising/">JustKitchen</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/robotic-kitchen-startup-ypc-raises-a-1-8m-seed-round/">robotic kitchens like YPC</a>.</p>
<p>The company doubled the number of satellite kitchens in its network this year and now operates more than 15 locations throughout the Bay Area and Chicago, with new markets expected to go into Texas and Southern California next year, Chong said. It is also hiring at its headquarters in San Francisco and as it opens the new markets.</p>
<p>Though the global pandemic was a tough environment for its restaurant partners, All Day Kitchens saw the number of partners joining the platform grow by four times over the past year. It is working with brands like Honey Butter Fried Chicken, Mott St and HaiSous. It’s revenue has also increased 18 times over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>“The part that we honestly found surprising and striking is the misconception that restaurants are late adopters,” Chong said. “Similar to Uber, it is really that no one was building something like this for them. A lot of the apps out there are for consumers, and that is why restaurants are our focus. The restaurant partners we work with are always looking to improve.”</p>

<p>As part of the investment, Alex Taussig, partner at Lightspeed, is joining the company’s board as a director and GIC&#8217;s Jeremy Kranz is joining as a board observer.</p>
<p>Taussig met Chong over a year ago and said Lightspeed has made a number of investments in the food and commerce space over the past decade. One of the areas Taussig was looking into was ways to solve the demand for delivery. He recalls looking at different startups and models and was “underwhelmed” by the warehouse models.</p>
<p>In talking to Chong about All Day Kitchens, Taussig saw something different: a model where the focus was getting the food closer to the customer. It not only correlated with the quality of food, but also delivery times so that items weren&#8217;t sitting in someone’s car for an hour. As a result, there would be higher utilization of the platform, he said.</p>
<p>“I was blown away by that insight and spent a year watching Ken build the company,” Taussig added. “The Chicago launch was also a big deal because most companies start in the Bay Area. This market size is measured in billions and is almost limitless and faster growing on the independent side. It is going to be hard for another company to come in and do what All Day Kitchens is already doing.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://leadiq.com/">LeadIQ</a>, a startup working in the sales software market, announced that it has closed a $30 million Series B led by <a href="https://cathayinnovation.com/">Cathay Innovation</a>. Other investors in the transaction include <a href="https://fresco.vc/">Fresco Capital</a>, <a href="http://www.strongvc.com/">Strong Ventures</a> and <a href="https://eightroads.com/en/">Eight Road Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>LeadIQ frames its product from the perspective of missed revenue targets at companies, which it claims impact nearly two-thirds of today&#8217;s deals. The startup&#8217;s service is designed to save sales staff time by taking on the brunt of data entry work from the sales prospecting process by automating lead capture. The LeadIQ product also <a href="https://leadiq.com/features">includes analytics</a> covering a customer&#8217;s prospecting efficiency, which can then be segmented by worker performance and more general breakdowns like industry and company size.</p>
<p>Previously, LeadIQ <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/leadiq/company_financials">raised around $12 million</a>, though the company told TechCrunch that it had only spent $6 million of that total, despite reaching eight-figure ARR (the $10 million threshold).</p>
<p>Why raise more capital if it didn&#8217;t need the funds? According to CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/djiaoMei">Mei Siauw</a>, LeadIQ is moving toward supporting account management instead of merely lead management. Building new products is expensive, and thus more capital will help the company staff up for the work.</p>
<p>Why work toward sales account management over simply focusing on leads? According to Siauw, the effort will help sales teams better work with marketing teams, allowing for more complete information sharing and hopefully better sales results. The CEO likened marketing as similar to fishing with a net. Sales, she said, is more akin to hunting fish with a spear. With account-level tooling leading to more complete information sharing, she hopes to give sales teams a better shot at catching more fish, to extend the analogy.</p>
<p>The company has been efficient to date, as noted above. Frugality, however, is only a virtue in startup-land when it is coupled to rapid growth. LeadIQ hits that mark, having grown its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by around 3x in the last year. The company also sports net retention figures of around 125%, and a strong ratio of account size versus customer acquisition costs. Those are the sorts of metrics that SaaS investors covet.</p>
<p>The LeadIQ round is another data point in our understanding of the current market for sales-focused software. It appears to be an active sector with fellow sales software service Gongo.io raising rapid-fire rounds in recent quarters, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/">a $250 million investment earlier this year</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/">$200 million check in August of 2020</a>. Gong works in what it calls &#8220;the revenue intelligence&#8221; market when it raised this June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sales software market has also seen exits recently, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">a $575 million deal between ZoomInfo and the smaller Chorus.ai</a>. Chorus had posted rapid revenue growth ahead of its exit, raising north of $100 million before it sold to the larger company.</p>
<p>LeadIQ has around 115 employees, its CEO said, a number that it intends to double in the next 18 months or so. Today those workers hail from 22 countries, making LeadIQ the epitome of the now-standard micro-multinational model that many early-stage startups are pursuing. Notably LeadIQ has two main hubs, one in the United States and one in Singapore. Siauw says that Europe may be next.</p>
<p>Now flush with more funds than ever, let&#8217;s see how quickly LeadIQ can expand its revenues in the next year. That next milestone should help us understand both if the company will become an IPO candidate, and how deep its market truly is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before Gene Berdichevsky became the co-founder and CEO of battery chemistry company Sila Nano, he was the seventh employee at Tesla Motors. As principal engineer on the Roadster battery, Berdichevsky was one of the first people crazy enough to experiment with shoving a lithium-ion battery pack into a combustion engine vehicle. The result? The Roadster became the first highway legal serial production all-electric car fueled by lithium-ion battery cells and able to travel over 200 miles per charge.</p>
<p>In 2011, Sila was founded with a mission of not only building the next generation of battery chemistry, but also being able to scale it. Since then, the company has figured out how to replace the graphite in the anode of a lithium-ion cell with silicon, which Berdichevsky says makes for a denser, cheaper battery cell. He explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are four key components in a battery. The anode stores lithium when the batteries charge. The cathode stores lithium when the battery is discharged, and the lithium goes back and forth between charge and discharge, moving through an electrolyte liquid. The separator keeps them from short-circuiting.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, the anode has been graphite, and that material in graphite requires a ring of six carbon atoms for one lithium atom to come and sit in the middle when the battery is charging. So it takes six carbon atoms to store one lithium atom. In silicon, you can have one silicon atom bonding with four lithium atoms. So instead of six to one, you&#8217;re one to four. You literally have 42x atomic advantage with silicon, which means you can use a lot less material to store the same amount of lithium. Essentially, you&#8217;re using a lot less material in a much smaller space to store your energy, the lithium, in the anode.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sila&#8217;s first commercial product, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sila-nanotechnologiess-first-next-gen-battery-will-launch-in-whoop-wearables/">released in September on the newest Whoop fitness tracker wearable</a>, proves not only that the company&#8217;s recipe works, but that it can scale — the launch also marks Sila&#8217;s 10-year anniversary. The next step is scaling up 100x to put the same chemistry in automobiles.</p>
<p>The company already has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">joint battery ventures</a> with BMW and Daimler and aims to provide battery chemistry for electric vehicles at scale by 2025. With nearly every major automaker promising new lineups of EVs, ensuring a sustainable and affordable battery pack is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>As a battery technology pioneer, Berdichevsky is playing the long game, already thinking in terms of the next few decades worth of work, not just the next few years. He talks us through his long-term strategy, his thoughts on fundraising and his insights into the battery industry.</p>
<p><i>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><b>What is Sila&#8217;s long-term vision? </b></p>
<p>We want to be a world leader and do for the energy storage industry what Intel did for the personal computing industry. Intel didn&#8217;t make every single chip or the motherboards or the PCs. They made the most important components whose performance drove the adoption of the devices people actually wanted, and the better the microprocessor got, the better computers got, the more people used them and the more the world changed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An under-the-radar, bootstrapped startup from Vienna, Austria &#8212; a hit with developers for technology that underpins user experience for some of the world&#8217;s most popular apps &#8212; is doubling down on momentum and announcing its first outside investment, in the form of a large growth round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://pspdfkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSPDFkit</a> &#8212; which provides APIs and an SDK that developers use to power document processing features like e-signing, document viewing and editing, collaboration and <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more</a> &#8212; has raised €100 million ($116 million). The funding is coming from a single investor, Insight Partners.</p>
<p>PSPDFkit is already profitable, and it has been for a while, so this investment is about stepping up its pace of growth. It plans to use the investment to build more developer tools, make strategic acquisitions (co-founder and CEO Jonathan Rhyne is mum about what, except to say that it will be to expand the suite of useful tools that it provides); and, for the first time, make some concerted efforts in the areas of sales and marketing.</p>
<p>A lot of PSPDFkit&#8217;s growth to date, in fact, has been by word of mouth, a strategy that has gotten it very far up to now. Its customers include Dropbox, DocuSign, SAP, IBM, Volkswagen, Fabasoft, Wolters Kluwer Deutschland, and the European Patent Office, among a number of others that it works with under NDA.</p>
<p>In many cases, not every company is happy to admit just how much of their user experience and technology have been built by third parties, and that&#8217;s the situation with where and how PSPDFkit is used, too, but the fact remains that it&#8217;s quietly huge: altogether, PSPDFkit&#8217;s tech, by way of its APIs and SDKs, is now approaching 1 billion users in 150 countries.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this traction has also meant that PSPDFkit has had a lot of acquisition interest over the years. Large technology companies building productivity tools, working with developers already, and are already very active in mobile apps and cloud services have all knocked on PSPDFkit&#8217;s door. Although the startup is not disclosing its valuation, you can guess that, given its size and profitable status, with this latest round, it&#8217;s definitely become a more expensive buy. (And if all goes to plan, will become even more so.)</p>
<p>The story of PSPDFkit is an interesting one that mirrors a lot of how mobile development itself has grown up over the years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Originally the company started out around 2011 as a framework and toolset created by Austrian engineer Peter Steinberger, who was already involved in the iOS developer community and could see a need in the market from a number of apps for document-manipulation features like e-signing, document editing, and document viewing. Apps were letting us turn a lot of things into virtual experiences, and paper was shaping up to be one of the first things to go.</p>
<p>That need turned out to be a classic use case for building that functionality and making it something that many others could access by way of SDKs and APIs: document manipulation tools &#8212; even something so basic as previewing a file that is contained in a cloud-based folder &#8212; are very hard to build from scratch, are not necessarily part of companies&#8217; core businesses, yet are nevertheless central to how they work.</p>
<p>Steinberger&#8217;s framework thus became one of the early examples of how SDKs and APIs could be used to integrate different services and functionality into other apps &#8212; a basic principle has now been applied to a whole host of other features: embedded financial services, eg, those used to build neobanks, neobrokers, insuretechs; embedded payments, eg payment APIs from Stripe and others; embedded communications, eg, messaging, voice or email API from Twilio, Sinch, etc; and so on.</p>
<p>(The name PSPDFkit was a reference to Peter Steinberger&#8217;s initials; PDF because PDFs were, and largely remain, the company&#8217;s initial focus; and &#8220;kit&#8221; in reference to the SDK that it was.)</p>
<p>As mobile app creation and usage started to really take off, so did Steinberger&#8217;s framework, and soon Martin Schürrer joined him in building it. Rhyne, meanwhile, was working in the U.S. as an attorney representing developers, and he became their lawyer after meeting them at a developer event.</p>
<p>Soon into that relationship, the three realized that not only was there a proper, growing business to be managed, but Steinberger and Schürrer had little interest in doing that. By 2014, Rhyne gave up practicing law and came on as a third co-founder, with Steinberger and Schürrer in Vienna, and Rhyne based out of North Carolina in the U.S.</p>
<p>With this round, Steinberger and Schürrer are stepping away from full-time roles but remain &#8220;significantly invested&#8221; in the business, while Rhyne is staying on as CEO.</p>
<p>Things evolved rapidly from there for PSPDFkit, in keeping with the meteoric rise of apps themselves.</p>
<p>Starting out on iOS, today PSPDFkit provides tools that can be used for building apps on Android and the web, using Flutter and React Native. The strategy is to work on building out a bigger platform to handle multiple, related functionality that developers might want to use related to documents, and perhaps the wider world of productivity.</p>
<p class="p1">Rhyne&#8217;s basic description of what PSPDFkit and its customers do today is &#8220;obsoleting paper.&#8221; But over time &#8212; not unlike how Stripe has progressed from its core feature, providing APIs to power payments, to a wider suite of services related to transactions &#8212; PSPDFkit sees an opportunity to do more, not least because the world&#8217;s expectations have also changed.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, Rhyne recalled how PSPDFkit put out a real time collaboration platform in 2015, &#8220;but we were like, &#8216;Man, it&#8217;s not getting traction, people don&#8217;t really want to use this.'&#8221; Then Covid-19 happened, he continued: &#8220;Now every single customer is saying, &#8216;This looks great. Yeah, we want to use that&#8230;&#8217; I think that we&#8217;re seeing a change in the way people interact with documents.&#8221;</p>
<p>That speaks of a lot of opportunity both for the startup, and for its investors.</p>
<p>“Software developers and engineers are on the cutting edge of work simply by the nature of their craft,” said Ryan Hinkle, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “How they work and collaborate should be on the cutting edge, too. With PSPDFKit’s software development kits and hosted solutions, the company is revolutionizing document processing for enterprises and the developers they task with keeping the company at the forefront of innovation. Insight is thrilled to play a role in the company’s growth journey.” Hinkle is joining the board with this round.</p>
<p>Yet for all of that, for PSPDFkit itself, expectations will change a little less: the company is run as a &#8220;distributed&#8221; operation as it has been since well before the Covid-19 pandemic, with a main R&amp;D base in Vienna, but employees in many parts of the world. It&#8217;s now hiring more on the same model.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">SIM swapping scams have been on the rise these past couple of years, and since most online services these days are tied to people&#8217;s phone numbers, the technique has the potential to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-cell-phone-hack-is-ruining-lives-identity-theft.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">ruin victims&#8217; lives</a>. Now, the Federal Communications Commission is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-prevent-sim-swapping-and-port-out-fraud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">seeking</a> to create new rules that would help prevent SIM swapping scams and port-out fraud, both of which are techniques designed to hijack people&#8217;s phone numbers and identities.</p>
<p>The commission said it has received numerous complaints from consumers &#8220;who have suffered significant distress, inconvenience and financial harm&#8221; as a result of both hijacking methods. SIM swapping is a technique wherein a bad actor convinces a wireless carrier to transfer a victim&#8217;s service to a phone they control. When a bad actor successfully transfers the victim&#8217;s service and number to another carrier, that&#8217;s called port-out fraud.</p>
<div id="max-player-injector" class="vmmi-si" data-maxi="0">
<div class="vdb_player">
<div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To make it harder for scammers to gain control of potential victims&#8217; phone numbers, the FCC wants to amend the Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and Local Number Portability rules. In particular, it wants to require providers to adopt more secure methods in authenticating a person&#8217;s identity before agreeing to transfer their service to a new phone or to another carrier. The commission also proposes a rule that would require providers to notify customers whenever a SIM switch or a port-out request is made on their accounts. </span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As part of the FCC&#8217;s rulemaking process, the public can now comment on these proposals. The commission still has to read those proposals and offer the public another chance to make their voice heard before it can decide whether to amend the aforementioned rules.</p>
