										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Working remotely has become the norm for a lot of desk-based employees, and there have been a number of tech companies that have seen their business explode in catering to that shift. But today comes news of a different kind of startup called <a href="https://www.turingsaas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Labs</a>, which is addressing the same challenges, but as they apply to people who work in laboratories. It has now raised $16.5 million in funding on the back of its growth.</p>
<p>The Series A round of funding is being led by Insight Partners, with previous backers <span class="s1">Moment Ventures</span> and <span class="s1">Y Combinator (where it was part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/turing-cpg-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 cohort</a>)</span> and new individual investor <span class="s1">Borge Hald</span> (CEO and co-founder of <span class="s1">Medallia</span>), also participating. The investment will be used to accelerate R&amp;D, grow the engineering team, widen operations, and a further build a go-to-market organization.</p>
<p>Turing Labs&#8217; platform helps labs speed up the process of making new products. So far<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, Turing has been working with companies in the consumer packaged goods space, where its technology is being used to come up with new formulations for home care products, food and drink, and cosmetics. It</span> uses AI to simulate working through different ingredient combinations for new product formulations to determine a smaller subset that actual technicians then put together &#8212; and it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will be using the investment to continue working on its own R&amp;D (adding more functionality to the platform to extend for example deeper into packaging and alternative ingredients for processed food) as well as on hiring and business development.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259360" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We initially focused on formulation but now we are moving into other areas like ingredients or packaging &#8212; anything that can be digitally simulated or optimized,&#8221; said <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Manmit Shrimali, Turing Labs&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ajith Govind</span>it, in an interview. The opportunity is in how the whole R&amp;D game has shifted, he added. &#8220;The process used to be 90% manual but now its 90% digital.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Shrimali also</span> said the startup is also seeing a growing opportunity in moving into altogether new categories, too: for example, the rise of plant-based alternatives to, say, meat or dairy is opening the door to applying AI to come up with new foodstuffs altogether.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While Turing Labs already works with some of the world&#8217;s biggest consumer packaged goods companies, it doesn&#8217;t disclose who they are publicly, but they are household names you would know well. The plan is to expand that list, as well as engagement with the companies that are already using Turing. </span></p>
<p>As we have noted when previously profiling Turing, R&amp;D labs play a specific and critical role in the world of CPG.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before eventually being shipped into production, the labs are where products are discovered; tested; tweaked in response to input from customers, marketing, budgetary and manufacturing departments and others; then tested again; then tweaked again; and so on. One of the big clients that Turing works with spends close to $400 million in testing alone.</p>
<p>Even before Covid-19, R&amp;D departments were under a lot of pressure. They are seeing their budgets getting cut, while facing an increasing number of demands and variables to which to be accountable. They are still expected to meet timelines in producing new products (or often more likely, extensions of products) to keep consumers interested. There are a new host of environmental and health concerns around goods with huge lists of unintelligible ingredients, meaning they have to figure out how to simplify and improve the composition of mass-market products. And smaller direct-to-consumer brands are undercutting their larger competitors by getting to market faster with competitive offerings that have met new consumer tastes and preferences. Running through combinations of formulations, with all of the other variables involved, is a time-consuming and expensive process.</p>
<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The pandemic has complicated this even further, with companies aiming to reduce time spent in physical environments, including labs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Turing Labs&#8217; approach is to solve these various challenges with AI. Not unlike other complex computational applications where machines take on the role of caus lculations and do them faster than any team of humans could do, here that concept is applied to the products that are being built or reformulated, cutting down steps to minimize what the technicians need to do. In theory this gives them the opportunity to focus on coming up with newer innovations that they can then try in different combinations, although &#8212; as is the case with any AI innovations &#8212; it will be worth watching to see how and if Turing Labs&#8217; platform eventually grows smart enough to cut the technicians out of the process altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;With rapidly changing consumer preferences, including ingredient inputs, as well as the emergence of competitive independent brands, CPG companies today are under pressure to develop new products faster and evolve their existing portfolio. Turing Labs allows users to automate the formulation process and predict outcomes, helping CPG companies bring innovative products to market faster,” said Josh Fredberg, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “Turing Labs’ ability to systemize and speed up market discovery and product formulation across CPG organizations makes it a stand-out in the industry. We look forward to partnering with the team at Turing Labs as they continue to grow.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wrangle.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wrangle</a> raised $2 million in an oversubscribed pre-seed funding to advance its technology that automates workflows, approvals and tickets so that a company can track work and provide call-to-action tasks within chat platforms like Slack.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Beta and Eniac Ventures co-led the investment, with participation from Liquid 2 Ventures, Hustle Fund, TDF Ventures and more than 20 founder angel investors.</p>
<p>Adam Smith and Adam Long founded Wrangle in 2020 and bootstrapped the remote company until now. This is the third company where they have worked together. Most recently they were COO and CTO, respectively, at Automated Insights, which was <a href="https://www.statsperform.com/press/vista-equity-partners-and-stats-acquire-automated-insights-2-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Vista Equity Partners</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While growing a startup, they saw firsthand how software could play into the new remote way of working.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get operations done when you are in the same office and with five people around the table, but when you are growing really fast, and real departments begin to emerge, you need a process to handle the team-to-team handoffs,” Adam Smith said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, as more people live in different time zones and are working with different goals and processes, that can throw a wrench in the gears. Add into that the global pandemic where everyone was home, and it separated teams further, Smith added.</p>
<p>In their research, they saw Slack direct messages and channels get busy as people dealt with up to 100 requests per week with little way to audit/track where people were in the process.</p>
<p>Wrangle is solving this problem by giving companies a new way to run operations directly in the tools where employees are already talking to each other, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. The company’s no-code software can automate any kind of process: employee onboarding, contract approvals, help tickets or any other recurring work. It also gathers requests with forms, assigns and notifies people to follow-up and tracks the progress for everyone to follow.</p>
<p>Now when colleagues are assigned a task, like onboarding an employee, an automated checklist pops up, and employees check off their steps and don’t have to worry about what to do because all the work is automated for them, Long said.</p>

<p>Wrangle launched in February 2021, initially with Slack, and now more than 800 organizations have used the workflow builder to complete over 10,000 workflows. One of their customers, Reuben Doetsch, co-founder and CTO of AvantStay, started using Wrangle for bug reports and future requests.</p>
<p>“The AvantStay team has been growing rapidly and Wrangle is the tool behind the scenes that keeps our workflows on track in Slack,” Doetsch said in a written statement. “We use it for everything from processing refunds to managing changes to property listings. Wrangle saves us hundreds of hours a month while also ensuring nothing gets lost in the chaos of Slack.”</p>
<p>The new round of funding will enable Wrangle to grow its team from just the two founders, invest in product development and accelerate its marketing efforts. The tool is expanding into Microsoft Teams and will be launching a web app for building workflows and analyzing them to move the work along. The company has dozens of paying customers and is growing revenue at 20% to 30% every month.</p>
<p>Investor Karin Klein, founding partner of Bloomberg Beta, said via email that her firm looks at the future of work and how to make work better.</p>
<p>She says that as Slack and Teams become the places where more people work together, the Wrangle team has created a way to have ticketing workflows happen where the work happens without being siloed in with other products.</p>
<p>“Adam and Adam are exceptional founders who have created an easy to use approach to ticketing so we don’t have to switch between multiple applications, saving everyone time and ensuring important approvals don’t get missed,” Klein added. “The need for Wrangle is only going to grow as work remains hybrid and distributed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parallel Systems, a company founded by three former SpaceX engineers to build autonomous battery-electric rail vehicles, came out of stealth mode on Wednesday with a $49.55 million Series A raise. The company, which has raised $53.15 million to date, including a $3.6 million seed round, is working to create a more efficient, decarbonized freight network that flows on top of existing railway infrastructure.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build Parallel System&#8217;s second-generation vehicle and launch an advanced testing program that will help the startup figure out how to integrate its vehicles into real-world operations, according to co-founder and CEO Matt Soule.</p>
<p>Parallel Systems also intends to use the new investment &#8212; which was led by Anthos Capital and includes investments from Congruent Ventures, Riot Ventures, Embark Ventures and others &#8212; to hire about 60 engineers, most of whom will deal with software, says Soule.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259100" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s rail vehicle architecture aims to solve a few problems: carbon emissions in freight, supply chain constraints of trucking and limits of railway freight. In the U.S., <a href="https://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview#:~:text=Heavy%20freight%20such%20as%20coal,length%20and%20weight%20freight%20travels)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">rail network accounts for 28% of all freight movement</a>, but most of that is bulk movement activity &#8212; large trains that move primary resources like coal and lumber. A smaller portion of rail freight movement is referred to as intermodal activity, which essentially involves moving steel containers between a range of different modes of transportation, like boats and trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rail has a lot of opportunity to grow when it comes to intermodal, and we focus on this because this is where we think there&#8217;s competition and appetite for innovation,&#8221; Soule told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Parallel&#8217;s patent-pending vehicle architecture involves individually powered railcars that can load and transport standard shipping containers as a single or double-stacked load. They can join up to form &#8220;platoons&#8221; or split off to multiple destinations while en route, which means they don&#8217;t need to hold large volumes of freight to make the service economical, although Soule says they can actually carry much more weight than trucks, which handle most freight transportation in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the unit economics of freight trains to get competitive with trucks, you need really long trains, and you&#8217;re amortizing the cost of that locomotive and crew over that one really long train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;When that becomes a problem is when you&#8217;re figuring out where to park that big train, and the answer is, not many places.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Relying on long trains to transport goods means it&#8217;s harder to do high-volume turnovers that handle all our e-commerce wonders because those trains can&#8217;t always access urban communities or ports. They require specially built, large terminals to accommodate their physical size, said Soule.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our unit economics don&#8217;t depend on a very big train,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;We can move in smaller platoons and rather than dwelling all day for the unloading and loading operation, we&#8217;re in and out within an hour or two, leaving room for other platoons to come in. It&#8217;s the more efficient footprint and it enables things like serving ports and creating inland port shuttle systems so you can move the containers from a seaport to an inland port, which is often a better place for trucks to go and are closer to warehousing activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to autonomy, Parallel sees the railroad&#8217;s closed network as the ideal operational design domain for safe and early commercialization of autonomous technology due to limited track access and centralized traffic control. It&#8217;s important to note, however, that while Parallel&#8217;s long-term vision seems promising, the company has yet to test on national networks &#8212; it has been testing its prototype vehicle on a small rail in Los Angeles that&#8217;s insulated from national networks.</p>
<p>Rail in the U.S. is privately owned by owner-operators, which makes it difficult for Parallel to test its vehicles and the autonomous systems running the vehicles on a large scale. Parallel is targeting private rail companies as its customers, hoping to sell or lease its tools for them to operate the service on a day-to-day basis while offering a supporting role in terms of providing and integrating the technology. Until the startup gets a legacy railroad partner on board, it won&#8217;t be able to see if its tech can handle real-world operations.</p>
<p>The early-stage company is a few years off from developing tech that could go to market, says Soule, but it has an opportunity to own this sector of the market, particularly as shippers around the world not only want faster freight, but also cleaner freight.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platoon technology features self-propelled rail cars that push against each other to distribute the load, which, the company predicts, will lead to Parallel vehicles using just 25% of the energy compared to a semi-truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental reason we&#8217;re doing this is to accelerate the decarbonization of freight, but the problem that we see is rail&#8217;s scale of operations is limited to a market it can serve,&#8221; said Soule. &#8220;So we&#8217;re trying to embrace this energy efficiency, but then break down its operational and economic barriers at the same time. And by the way, we&#8217;re making our powertrain electric, which further accelerates the decarbonization benefits because our grid itself is not clean. So when you look at a diesel truck, compared to what we&#8217;re building, and looking at the average, real-world CO<sub>2</sub>content of the U.S. grid, we&#8217;re going to be 90% less CO<sub>2</sub> per mile to move a unit of freight with our technology versus a diesel truck today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a>, a startup from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">AppDynamics founder</a> Jyoti Bansal, has been building a platform of developer tools over the last five years. In 2020, the company made its first foray into open source when it bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/harness-makes-first-acquisition-snagging-open-source-ci-company-drone-io/">continuous integration tool Drone</a>. Today, they embraced openness further with the release of a free and open version of the company&#8217;s continuous delivery product.</p>
<p>Bansal is reluctant to use the term &#8216;open source&#8217; because it carries some big connotations with it and he doesn&#8217;t want to misrepresent what the company is doing. But starting today, he is making the source code for the community edition of the continuous delivery tool available for any developer to use under the &#8220;source-accessible <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/">Polyform Shield</a> license.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything [in the same way] as what the power of open source would be, but we are using the source available licensing strategy, where we are putting 100 percent of our source in open repos…Everything is similar to a fully open source project except that our competitors are not allowed to monetize it,&#8221; Bansal explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over the last several years, companies like Elastic and MongoDB saw some cloud providers like Amazon taking advantage of the open source license to create their own versions of the same product. They took exception and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/">created a slightly more restrictive license</a> to prevent wholesale poaching by competitors.</p>
<p>Stefano Maffulli executive director at the Open Source Initiative (OSI) says Harness is being careful and respectful when it comes to how they frame this product. &#8220;Harness is doing the right thing by making clear where they are using an OSI-approved license and where they are not. Doing so respects the community and builds trust,&#8221; Maffulli said.</p>

<p>Bansal said they are trying to balance the idea of having an open and available product, while protecting the significant investment they have made into building the product. He believes that by making it open, he can remove any friction from the process, allowing developers to download the open version without having to check with a manager or get permission, which is often the case when a purchase is involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have provided a free version of our product since the beginning, but we wanted to take it to the next level of where we just remove the barriers so there is no reason for a developer to ask for permission from their managers. They can go and download and try it and use it. And only when the product starts working in their environment and they&#8217;re successful will we have the commercial discussion if they need to,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Harness also offers a paid enterprise version and a hosted version of the product in addition to the open product. Bansal says the plan is to eventually move every product on the platform where it makes sense into this model, but they are starting with the continuous delivery product since the Drone continuous integration product is already open source.</p>
<p>Bansal adds that the Drone founders really showed him the value of a community and how having outside developers involved in a project can improve the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;What [the Drone founders] brought to us was showing us that you could build a great community. We have been building great products, and we know how to build great products, but if we can involve our community of users much more closely and the developer community outside of the company, we can even build even better products.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s ad-fuelled boom in crypto trading looks to be headed for major speed restrictions: The country&#8217;s financial watchdog said it will beef up rules around marketing of crypto assets and could even put limits on who can invest, following government confirmation yesterday that it will extend the regulator&#8217;s remit to cover crypto.</p>
<p>In recent years, ads for crypto have been plastered over billboards across the UK capital &#8212; fuelling a boom in trading that has led to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">a few slaps </a>from the advertising standards watchdog.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59638313">December</a>, the Advertising Standards Authority banned seven crypto ads for &#8220;irresponsibly taking advantage of consumers&#8217; inexperience and for failing to illustrate the risk of the investment&#8221; &#8212; saying it hoped to produce new guidance on crypto advertising.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the financial watchdog&#8217;s intervention looks set to put a more significant dampener on the UK crypto bubble.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/strengthen-financial-promotions-rules-protect-consumers">announcement</a> trailing the proposed changes, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it&#8217;s acting in response to concerns about the &#8220;ease and speed&#8221; that people can make high risk investments &#8212; in line with a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy">Consumer Investment Strategy</a> it published last year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4b43wzyPsD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/google-tightens-uk-policy-on-financial-ads-after-watchdog-pressure-over-scams/">Google tightens UK policy on financial ads after watchdog pressure over scams</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google tightens UK policy on financial ads after watchdog pressure over scams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/google-tightens-uk-policy-on-financial-ads-after-watchdog-pressure-over-scams/embed/#?secret=4b43wzyPsD" data-secret="4b43wzyPsD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The plan for new crypto rules &#8212; which the FCA said will be confirmed by summer 2022 &#8212; include proposed restrictions on the marketing and uptake of cryptoassets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[T]he FCA plans to categorise qualifying cryptoassets as ‘Restricted Mass Market Investments’, meaning consumers would only be able to respond to cryptoasset financial promotions if they are classed as restricted, high net worth or sophisticated investors,&#8221; the regulator writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firms issuing such promotions would have to adhere to FCA rules, such as the requirement to be clear, fair and not misleading,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The regulator is consulting on the proposals &#8212; with a deadline of March 23 for responses.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sarah Pritchard, the FCA&#8217;s executive director of markets, added: &#8220;Too many people are being led to invest in products they don’t understand and which are too risky for them. People need clear, fair information and proper risk warnings if they are to invest with confidence, which is the central aim of our consumer investments strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">government c</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">onfirmed</a> it will legislate to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation to tackle misleading advertising &#8212; writing (or, well, warning) that: &#8220;This means the promotion of qualifying cryptoassets will be subject to FCA rules in line with the same high standards that other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products are held to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, chancellor, Rishi Sunak, added: &#8220;Cryptoassets can provide exciting new opportunities, offering people new ways to transact and invest &#8212; but it’s important that consumers are not being sold products with misleading claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ensuring consumers are protected, while also supporting innovation of the cryptoasset market.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/research-note-cryptoasset-consumer-research-2021">Cryptoasset consumer research</a>, published by the FCA last summer, suggested that some 2.3 million Brits owned crypto (out of a UK population of ~52M) &#8212; which amounts to just under 4.5% of Brits holding crypto. In 2020 the FCA said that around 1.9M Brits held cryptoassets &#8212; suggesting there&#8217;s been a percentage increase of ~21% year over year, per the research.</p>
<p>Other estimates of the number of Brits holding crypto that have been bandied around by crypto press in recent months have <a href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/most-popular-cryptocurrency-2021-uk-093057693.html">touted even bigger figures</a> (but, well, the crypto trading press is itself often located inside the hype bubble).</p>
<p>The marketing frenzy around crypto trading in the UK certainly appears to have fuelled rising awareness among the population, with the FCA finding that 78% of adults had heard of cryptocurrencies &#8212; up from 42% in 2019; and 73% in 2020.</p>
<p>However in another finding that likely sharpened its concern, the regulator found that despite rising awareness the level of understanding of cryptocurrencies was declining &#8212; suggesting &#8220;some crypto users may not fully understand what they&#8217;re buying&#8221;, as it (politely) puts it. Ya think?!</p>
<p>The FCA research also found fewer crypto users regard buying the assets as a gamble (38%, down from 47%); and more see them as an alternative or complement to mainstream investments, with half of crypto users saying they intend to invest more&#8230;</p>
<p>Ergo, it&#8217;s not difficult to see why the UK government and financial regulator have decided it&#8217;s past time to step in with regulatory limits to stop clueless Brits from throwing money at Ponzi-like schemes wrapped in shiny crypto marketing.</p>
<p>Other countries are taking similar steps.</p>
<p>Just this week, Singapore&#8217;s financial regulator announced its own clamp down on crypto marketing (via <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Singapore-clamps-down-on-ads-for-highly-risky-crypto-trading">Nikkei Asia</a>).</p>
<p>Some other countries are going even further &#8212; with planned cryptocurrency bans in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">China</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/india-plans-law-that-will-prohibit-all-private-cryptocurrencies-with-certain-exceptions/">India</a>.</p>
<p>The free-for-all trading party isn&#8217;t over yet but regulators around the globe are slowly closing in on cryptoland&#8217;s gangsta paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Big banks are under a lot of pressure to modernize their services to meet demands of consumers who now view things like mobile apps that identify who and where you are; or instant, on-demand products, as table stakes &#8212; consumers that are in turn increasingly looking at neobanks to give them a better level of service when it comes to their money and managing it. Today a startup that is building tools to help incumbent address this challenge is announcing a round of funding on the back of a lot of demand for its services.</p>
<p><a href="https://personetics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personetics</a>, which has built AI-based technology for banks to personalize their offerings &#8212; for example understanding a users&#8217; spending habits, and combining that with larger datasets, to offer advice for savings, based on a customer&#8217;s spending patterns &#8212; has raised $85 million, funding that will go towards expanding the tools that Personetics provides to banking customers, as well as to expand its base of users.</p>
<p>That base is already pretty impressive. It currently has 80 banking customers, a list that spans some of the world&#8217;s biggest names in financial services. (Names that it can disclose include <span class="s3">Metro Bank, Santander, U.S. Bank, Huntington Bank, UOB, Hyundai Card, and MUFG.) Altogether Personetics&#8217; technology interacts with some 120 million users across 30 countries. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It has also been on a fundraising run, with this round adding up to $160 million raised since the start of 2021. This latest round is being led by Thoma Bravo with Viola Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Nyca Partners and Warburg Pincus &#8212; all previous investors in the company &#8212; also participating. It&#8217;s not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Although we hear a lot of talk these days about digital transformation being synonymous with migrating to the cloud, Personetics typifies a persistent trend in the world of enterprise that runs contrary to that. David Sosna, its CEO and co-founder, said that although the company offers a SaaS version of its personalization tech, &#8220;many&#8221; of its customers &#8212; including some of the names that have made a big point of trying to modernise, such as Santander &#8212; are actually using Personetics on-premises.</p>
<p class="p9">&#8220;Sending financial data out is something banks are doing, but it’s not 100%,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see them moving there, but I don’t see them rushing there. Financial data is probably the last thing that you will see migrate to the cloud.&#8221; More commonly, they may build new services in the cloud, which they will then run in tandem with legacy services, which are not. Even in those cases, he added, &#8220;we are part of that infrastructure on services like Azure, or Google Cloud or AWS, but they own it &#8212; not us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the mechanics of how the services get implemented, the more salient fact is that they <em>are </em>being implemented full-stop. They are moving to personalisation for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the rise of challenger banks lighting a fire under them and getting them moving.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hey are seeing the impact of the alternatives,&#8221; he said, with the migration away from the incumbents happening gradually. &#8220;25% of your customers may be adopting external lending providers or BNPL. That&#8217;s a common thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Secondly is the fact that this is simply what consumers are demanding now, the &#8220;table stakes&#8221; in this territory, as Sosna puts it. &#8220;They really have no choice.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p9">Third of all has been the impact of Covid-19 and wider market forces. With more banks closing down physical branches, they have become more &#8212; and in some cases, completely &#8212; reliant on digital platforms to run and grow their businesses. This too is leading them to build and run better sites and apps to get this done.</p>
<p>Given that it&#8217;s not a big leap between financial services and fintech &#8212; indeed, in cities like London which have strong industries in tech and financial services, the two have long competed heavily to recruit technical talent &#8212; it&#8217;s surprising that we haven&#8217;t seen more banks trying to built personalization in house rather than look to a third-party provider like Personetics.</p>
<p class="p9">Sosna said that some have indeed tried this. &#8220;The big ones are trying and have built certain capabilities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The big ones believe they need to own it.&#8221; However, much of this has been slow to take off, and so in many cases working with a third party has been an easier way for them to experiment. &#8220;That’s the case and I don’t think it will change,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In the midst of a fintech revolution that has seen a huge wave of challenger banks emerge, and an equally impressive group of banking infrastructure startups surface to provide API-based, embedded services to neobanks to build their products, there has been a smaller set of companies that have seized an opportunity to address the needs of incumbents to compete against these newer players. Others in the same category include 10x, which was founded by ex-incumbent banking executives and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/10x-a-uk-fintech-raises-187m-to-build-new-services-for-old-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised significant funding</a> to build tools specifically for the behemoths.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if Personetics over time works with more neobanks, alongside the incumbents. After all, neobanks have gone all-in on embedded services, so it would make sense for them to look to third parties potentially to improve personalization, too.</p>
<p>Personetics does have some digital banks as customers, Sosna said, although most of these have grown out of the bigger incumbents. &#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">e like that segment because they have more muscle to start with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span>A lot of these fintechs start and stop and go right and left. It&#8217;s hard for us to understand their strategy, so once they get to a certain size it might make more sense to partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the line, the company is likely to bring on more services to underpin the personalization it already offers, such as in more specific areas like lending, where it might, for example, give banks the ability to evaluate loan applications faster and using a wider set of data comparable to what new-wave fintechs are providing. It&#8217;s already doing a lot of automated work in moving money around so lending is a natural step.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When it comes to savings and lending and investing one of the things we like is to provide an automated capability to move money on your behalf,&#8221; he said. This might happen, for example, between a current account and moving surplus money every month into a higher-interest account to accrue better returns. &#8220;We have multiple banks using that now, where you opt in and then automatically moves the money without asking your permission every time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>“As the range and complexity of financial products continues to grow, Personetics simplifies and personalizes banking for consumers with its industry-leading AI technology,&#8221; said Robert Sayle, a partner at Thoma Bravo, in a statement. &#8220;We are thrilled to partner with Personetics and leverage our operational expertise in software and financial technology to help accelerate the company’s momentum, the introduction of new products and technology, and the platform‘s reach to financial institutions and their customers across the globe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://revolut.com">Revolut</a> is rolling out stock trading in its app in the U.S. The company already lets you buy and sell shares if you’re a British user. And now, Revolut has received approval to become a licensed U.S. broker-dealer in the U.S.</p>
<p>Revolut users will be able to trade 1,100 securities, such as shares on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. The company will also offer access to 200 ETFs. When it comes to features, Revolut offers fractional shares and several order types, such as limit and stop-limit orders.</p>
<p>In the app, you’ll find market graphs, a selection of news headlines and information about the top ten holdings of each ETF. Users can set up price alerts as well. When you buy and sell an asset, you don’t pay any commission. Like on all trading platforms, there’s some spread between the buy and sell price though.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258906" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With this new feature, Revolut competes more directly with <a href="https://robinhood.com">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://cash.app">Cash App</a>. Over the past few years, Revolut has positioned itself as a financial super app.</p>
<p>In the U.S., users can use it as an alternative to a traditional checking account. You can order a debit card, create a virtual card, send and receive money, and put some money aside in a savings vault.</p>
<p>More recently, Revolut has started to expand beyond payments. In the U.S., it has partnered with Paxos to launch the ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/revolut-partners-with-paxos-to-bring-cryptocurrency-trading-to-the-us/">trade cryptocurrencies</a> in the app. And now, there&#8217;s stock trading.</p>
<p>Of course, Revolut users in the U.K. still have access to more features. But it’s interesting to see that Revolut is still releasing new features in the U.S. in order to build a financial super app that works across multiple markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Many consumer fintech companies that started in Europe have ditched plans to enter the U.S. For instance, <a href="https://n26.com/en-us">N26</a> recently announced that it’ll stop its operations in the U.S. Revolut currently has 18 million customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ancient8.gg/">Ancient8</a>, Vietnam&#8217;s blockchain gaming guild, develops a community and software platform to enable everyone to play P2E (play-to-earn) games and build the metaverse while earning rewards.</p>
<p>“We lend our P2E game assets to the scholars, or guild players, so they can play P2E games and enable them to earn rewards. Vietnam has a monthly average income of $250, which is not particularly privileged compared to <a href="https://www.worlddata.info/average-income.php#:~:text=The%20average%20gross%20annual%20wage,than%20in%20the%20previous%20year).">approximately $5,800 for the United States</a> and about $1,000 for the Philippines. We are demonstrable able to improve the financial income and life of our scholars by offering them this opportunity,” co-founder of Ancient8 Howard Xu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Ancient8 partners with P2E games to produce educational content for local communities in Vietnam and educate people about both blockchain and P2E games, Xu said. It helps more than 10,000 blockchain game players by providing scholarship and educational opportunities, community, blockchain and software products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Vietnam is the third-largest country in Southeast Asia with a population of 100 million and skews young in demographics, making the country a ripe market for mainstream adoption of GameFi, Xu added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnering with our community of gaming enthusiasts and game developers, we are democratizing social and financial access for the first native generation of Metaverse citizens,&#8221; said Xu. &#8220;Innovative play-to-earn games such as Axie Infinity have changed the status quo, empowering gamers to own a piece of the games that they play and share social and financial rewards by contributing to the community, all while having fun. We are excited to build the infrastructure layer for the future of blockchain gaming and the Metaverse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ancient8 was founded in July 2021 by Xu, Nathan L and William Phan with a mission to reach, educate and empower the next 100 million metaverse citizens.</p>
<p>Xu also said Nathan and William are pioneers in Vietnam’s crypto ecosystem, educating Vietnamese users from their time at <a href="https://twitter.com/coin68">Coin68</a> and <a href="https://kyros.ventures/">Kyros Ventures</a>, a Vietnamese blockchain media outlet and incubator, in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ancient8 announced today it has raised a $4 million seed financing led by <a href="https://www.dcp.capital/">Dragonfly Capital</a>, <a href="https://panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.hashed.com/">Hashed</a>. Strategic investors including Mechanism Capital, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ventures">Coinbase Ventures</a>, Alameda Research, 3Tweleve Capital, Alameda Research, <a href="https://guildfi.com/">GuildFi</a>, 3Twelve Capital, Coin98 Ventures, Kyros Ventures, Raydium, Jump Capital and <a href="https://sipher.xyz/">Sipher</a> also participated in the round along with previous backers Trung Nguyen (Axie Infinity), Santiago R Santos, Nick Chong and Loi Luu (Kyber Network).</p>
<p>Ancient8 plans to use the latest funding to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for all community members to easily learn about developments in GameFi and build more GameFi tools. The proceeds also will be used to develop more blockchain and software products to serve as the infrastructure layer for the metaverse. As more blockchain games come out, Ancient8 will continue to increase its game coverage, the company said.</p>
<p>“[Gaming] guilds represent an important building block in the GameFi ecosystem, offering users a powerful community to adopt new technologies and earn rewards for gameplay,” said Mia Deng, partner at Dragonfly Capital.</p>
<p>Global crypto venture capitals are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/21/crypto-vcs-are-making-a-big-bet-on-gaming-guilds-why/">flocking to the gaming guilds</a>. Andreessen Horowitz invested in the Philippine-based crypto gaming guild <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yield-guild-games">YieldGuildGames </a>last year.  In November, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/guildfi">GulidFi, </a>a Thailand-based gaming guild, secured $6 million from crypto venture capital firms, including Defiance Capital, Pantera Capital, and Coinbase Ventures.</p>
<p>“Vietnam is one of the most exciting and fast-growing markets in the world today for blockchain adoption. Local communities are realizing the potential impact of this emerging financial system and, in particular, the opportunities in play-to-earn gaming. Ancient8 has built an incredible gateway for the play-to-earn ecosystem as Vietnam’s largest blockchain gaming build and we’re excited to partner with them,” said partners at Pantera Capital Paul Veradittakit.</p>
<p>“We believe that blockchain is the opportunity for Vietnam and Southeast Asia to shine and demonstrate explosive growth. We have already seen a huge warm welcome from the Vietnamese community for blockchain technology,” Xu said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first electric bus by Swedish-Kenyan EV startup, <a href="https://www.opibus.se/">Opibus</a>, has hit Kenya&#8217;s roads marking the beginning of the company’s venture into the mass transit industry. Opibus first announced plans to roll out electric public transport buses last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-conversion-startup-opibus-raises-7-5m-to-start-bus-and-motorcycle-mass-production/">when it raised $7.5 million in a pre-Series A round</a>.</p>
<p>The startup is now running a pilot in readiness for the commercial launch of EV buses in Kenya later this year, and across Africa by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Opibus has over the last five years been in the business of future-proofing existing gasoline and diesel vehicles by converting them to electric. EVs come with a range of benefits including a reduced cost of transport and no carbon emissions. The startup, which was founded in 2017 by Gardler, Filip Lövström and Mikael Gånge, has so far converted over 170 vehicles for different clients including mining companies and tour firms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is now slowly pivoting to the building of EVs and supportive infrastructure like public charging stations. Brand new Opibus electric buses will cost $100,000 and $60,000 for conversions (which the startup is using in the pilot program).</p>
<p>“This first year, we will be testing 10 buses commercially in Nairobi to ensure that the product fits and is optimized for the usage patterns. Once we get this valuable feedback, we will make the required changes and get all our production partners lined up to scale the roll out as rapidly as possible,” Opibus chief strategy and marketing officer, Albin Wilson, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259333" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259333" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg 4122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Opibus-Electric-motorcycle.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259333" class="wp-caption-text">Opibus specializes in making electric buses and motorcycles.  <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opibus</p></div></p>
<p>Opibus says its vehicles are designed and built locally, giving them a competitive advantage in terms of a lower price by the time they reach the market. Additionally, local production means that the output can be tailored for local market needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our strategy is to design and develop a bus that is viable in price, durable and accessible for this region…We are building a product that allows for a rapid scale up, that can leverage global and local manufacturers. Meaning our design is easily implemented across the African continent, as it is a product tailored for the use case, and very cost effective,” said Wilson.</p>
<p>The startup is now eyeing the rest of Africa through partnerships that will drive the adoption of EVs across the continent..</p>
<p>Uber’s partnership with Opibus, which was announced last month, for example, will see the deployment of up to 3,000 electric motorcycles, manufactured by the startup, across Africa by 2022. Motorcycles under Uber are used as taxis and for deliveries in its different markets.</p>
<p>The EV sector in Kenya is budding and has over the recent years attracted new players including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/ev-startup-basigo-debuts-in-nairobi-after-1-million-pre-seed-funding/">BasiGo, which made its debut in Kenya in November last year</a>. BasiGO, which recently imported two EV mass transport buses for its pilot, plans to sell locally-assembled electric buses using parts from China’s EV maker BYD Automotive. The BasiGo buses come in 25 and 36-seater capacities, with a range of about 250 kilometers while those by Opibus come in 51-seater capacity with a range of 120 kilometers.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multinationals like Amazon and Alibaba have leveraged logistics infrastructure such as UPS and FedEx to create large businesses. It’s not the same in Africa, where few third-party infrastructure players exist to provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> end-to-end logistics to e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paps.sn/">PAPS</a>, a Senegal-based logistics and delivery company, is filling this gap in its region by offering customers various logistics services. Today the company is announcing that it has raised a $4.5 million pre-Series A round to expand its tech-enabled logistics solution across the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">4DX Ventures</a> and regional telecom operator Orange</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Participating investors include existing funds Uma Ventures and Saviu Ventures and new investors Yamaha Motor, LoftyInc Capital, Proparco, Google Ventures, To.org, Kepple Ventures and Enza Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://sn.linkedin.com/in/bamba-l%C3%B4-%E8%92%82%E5%B8%83%E5%85%B0-54972031">Bamba Lo</a> founded PAPS in 2016 to provide end-to-end logistics solutions for businesses with offline and online operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, PAPS operated a consumer-to-consumer logistics model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it immediately pivoted after noticing how infrequent and disorganized most requests were. It was hard to precisely predict</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the delivery flows in the space, which is different from the B2B model, where deliveries are planned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform caters to small to large businesses, assisting them with their logistics needs, from storage and international transport to last-mile delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS also provides merchants with visibility features to track and know the status of deliveries from takeoff to the point of destination. Merchants can also schedule deliveries on the platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we launched PAPS, the first thing we wanted to give to our clients was visibility on their transactions, they had to know when the driver has picked their goods up, where the goods are during transit, and when it arrives,” Lo, the chief executive, told TechCrunch on a call. “So that’s what we are trying to do to build &#8212; an infrastructure that can serve all B2B clients from warehousing and dispatching to the last-mile delivery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senegalese company owns the warehouses used to store clients’ goods and parcels. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also owns motorcycles, vans, cars and trucks to carry out inter- and intra-city logistics and deliveries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, the logistics company has a relay network of hubs close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its clients that act as delivery points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief executive said that PAPS wants to create that infrastructure and an enabler for those businesses to access clients they cannot reach today because of logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The gap that we are filling is one that all these big corporations didn’t want it to address, which is the domestic market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one addressed the domestic market except PAPS and that’s why we want to give quality and reliability,” he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAPS clients span a range of industries, such as banking, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals (Lo said that the company currently handles distribution for 70% of all pharmacies in Senegal).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major logistics players such as DHL and FedEx and consumer and business-focused e-commerce brands like Jumia, Glovo and Sokowatch also use PAPS for their operations in Senegal and Ivory Coast, the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, PAPS claims to be the largest last-mile fleet in Senegal, making over 10 million deliveries across its two markets since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And according to Lo, the company’s delivery numbers are growing 150% year-on-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use this pre-Series A round to strengthen its tech team, build out physical infrastructure to onboard more warehouses, hubs and fleets and extend its offering to more African companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walter Baddoo, co-founder and general partner at 4DX Ventures, said in a statement, “We have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Paps team’s execution thus far and their dedication to creating a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovative business in the logistics space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology has a critical role to play in modernizing Africa’s logistics infrastructure and we look forward to further partnering with Bamba and the paps team on this next phase of their growth”.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lattice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lattice</a>, a platform that helps with workforce people management &#8212; the ability to carry out performance reviews, employee feedback, and praise; tools to set and track goals and other long-term career plans; and analytics to get a bigger picture of how a workforce is working &#8212; has really come into its own as a business in the last two years, as our concepts of &#8220;office&#8221; and &#8220;team&#8221; have been stretched by the challenges of a global health pandemic. Now, the eponymous startup has closed a big funding round at a big valuation &#8212; $175 million, a Series F that values Lattice at $3 billion &#8212; underscoring the ground it has gained in the market, and the ambitions it has for the future.</p>
<p>Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, Tiger Global, and Dragoneer led the round, with previous backers Founders Fund, HighSage Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Fuel Capital, Khosla Ventures, and several new, unnamed angel investors, also participating. The funding brings the total raised by Lattice to $330 million, and it&#8217;s coming just 10 months after the company last raised (a Series E at a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lattice-raises-60m-in-series-e-funding-round-at-1-billion-valuation-301253586.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 billion valuation</a>). Jack Altman, the founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that Lattice was proactively approached this time around on the back of strong growth.</p>
<p>The company today focuses on desk-based, so-called &#8220;information&#8221; or &#8220;knowledge&#8221; workers. It now has 3,550 businesses as customers, up by more than 1,000 since that last round in March 2021. Lattice&#8217;s customer base is heavy on tech companies that are resident in its own backyard. These make up about half of its users today and the list includes the likes of Slack, Turo, Clio and more. Front-line, deskless employees are not currently part of Lattice&#8217;s remit &#8212; they require a significantly different set of tools and, often, priorities from those sitting at computers all day, but Altman didn&#8217;t rule out that this would be a segment it would like to tackle in the months and years ahead.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lattice&#8217;s traction in the market is partly due to the fact that its tools match up well with today&#8217;s work climate.</p>
<p>The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years. Thanks to Covid-19, many people who had traditionally gone into offices are now working at home or other smaller, more localized environments. What hasn&#8217;t changed, though, is that this workforce still needs to operate as a cohesive team, where people can communicate about what they are achieving, and what they want to do, and managers can get a picture of what they&#8217;re doing to reward them or identify ways to work better.</p>
<p>Lattice had been growing at a steady pace for several years before Covid-19 descended, but it was the pandemic that really put a spotlight on how important people management could be when it is effective (and being effective means having tools that people are actually willing to use, since there are so many out there now that feel more like chores to get through than helpful aides).</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d built many products and got a lot of traction [before the pandemic] but the world we’re living in today has accelerated things for a lot of reasons,&#8221; Altman said in an interview. &#8220;The office environment allows for a lot of interpersonal exchanges, connection, and apprenticeship. It’s not that you don’t need software for people management in the office environment but when you don’t have those connections you still need to feel like you work for a bigger purpose. We are staring at a box all day now, and we don’t have a manger who comes by and says great job and makes us feel appreciated. Systems like Lattice give a process for how we connect and interact and make sure that I know that I am cared for by our manager as a professional and a person. Covid-10 created that tailwind.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another helpful, if surprising, factor has been the economy. Many presumed in the spring of 2020 that everything would tank with a drop in demand, collapsing supply chains, and a veil of uncertainty that would inhibit growth. Some sectors did indeed struggle &#8212; travel and tourism for example really did grind to a halt initially &#8212; but the whole economy did not collapse, unemployment stabilized, and some people even started to realize that they had some bargaining power due to hiring demands. This in turn led to a bigger drive for better people management tools, Altman said.</p>
<p>He characterized the thinking as: &#8220;&#8216;Geez, we&#8217;ve got to invest in people more if we want to keep them.&#8217; That became the economic backdrop.&#8221;</p>
<p>People management as a wider part of enterprise IT has seen a lot of evolution in the last several years. Companies like Workday that dominate HR software have created ever-wider toolsets within their platforms to manage aspects of performance and compensation; alongside that, a number of pure-play companies like 15Five have emerged to focus specifically on areas like goals and praise. Lattice both partners with larger platforms and also competes against them. I suspect that the latter will become a more dominant part of those relationships as Lattice continues to add more functionality to its own platform. In the last several years, for example, it has added performance management, and then engagement surveys, and now a host of career development tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The longer term plan is to keep building and expanding,&#8221; Altman said. Within that, the company might push into more traditional HR tools, although whatever it brings into the mix &#8212; which could also include more AI-based automation, but only, he added, when it becomes something useful to helping people be more mindful about work performance &#8212; Altman believes that Lattice will always stand in contrast to these simply because it&#8217;s always been conceived of with the individual employee, not the HR team, at the center of the wheel.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The world of work has changed, and the dimension we&#8217;re in is moving from companies to employees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The result of that swing is that companies need to update from being company-centric to employee-centric. We are based on that thesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The widening of the platform and the functionality within it, serving a fast-growing and slow-churing base of customers, holds a lot of promise for investors.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve seen a few broad trends come together in recent years — the rise of remote work, the evolution of the role of HR — that have fuelled the HR market,” said investor Elad Gil, in a statement. “Lattice&#8217;s approach of creating a broad suite of interconnected offerings has resonated and led to really exciting growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! --></p>
<p>In a move rarely made by Western venture capitalists, QED Investors announced today that it has hired an African partner, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gbengaajayi">Gbenga Ajayi</a>. He will focus on Africa investments as part of QED’s international team.</p>
<p>Last September, the fintech-focused venture capital firm announced closing $1.05 billion for its oversubscribed seventh fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">reported</a> that Fund VII, made up of a $550 million early-stage fund and a $500 million growth-stage fund, will be used to back “fintech companies primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Latin America and Southeast Asia.” Today’s announcement adds Africa to the mix.</p>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch, QED co-founder and managing partner <a href="https://www.qedinvestors.com/team/nigel-morris">Nigel Morris</a> said that adding Africa is the final jigsaw puzzle that makes QED Investors a fully global fintech-specialist firm.</p>
<p>Preparations for QED to get into Africa started some 18 months ago when the firm began seeing a lot of inbounds and pitches from the region. This period &#8212; particularly throughout 2021, during which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/african-tech-took-center-stage-in-2021/">five unicorns were minted &#8212;</a> saw an explosion in venture capital like never before as seasoned founders emerged with willing local and international VCs to back them.</p>
<p>With so much demand for capital on a continent with more than a billion people but low financial inclusivity, adding Africa as QED’s next frontier was a no-brainer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We do fintech. It’s all we do; it’s what we know. And we are subject-matter deep, and hopefully, potentially experts, in the space,” Morris said. “Gbenga and I talked at length on how the traditional banks try to engage through an analog distribution system of branches when its population is a mobile-native generation that desires to be able to engage via mobile.</p>
<p>“So, as we saw investable opportunities starting to come to us and as we started to be avalanched by inbound from Africa, it became really clear that there was enormous amounts of demand in those markets like what we had seen across other geographies, particularly in other developing countries.”</p>
<p>The fintech-focused firm isn’t the only investor to notice these opportunities. Other global investors have as well, but most of their multiple investments have been led by partners without local market know-how.</p>
<p>But QED decided not to take this approach. By hiring an African partner to lead its charge, the firm may be setting an example of how foreign VCs will operate on the continent in the future.</p>
<p>Before QED Investors, Ajayi worked in different roles across Africa and global fintech/tech. He worked at Google as product partnerships lead in Europe and Africa before transitioning to other positions within the company, including managing telecom industry partnerships and leading parts of the internet giant’s mobile app business in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The partner was also a product director for SMB growth at Wise, a global cross-border remittance fintech. He also worked as head of strategic partnerships at Europe’s biggest neobank, Revolut.</p>
<p>Away from operational roles, Ajayi is also the co-founder of Kanza Ventures, a boutique seed investment and advisory firm focused on fintech in Africa.</p>
<p>As an investor and operator with experience working in different regions across Africa, Ajayi brings much-needed experience, especially in a region where fintechs seemingly face more troubling regulatory and compliance hurdles than their counterparts globally.</p>
<p>“Being able to be part of the fintech and tech boom that we have today and helping large tech companies that have now become household names take off means that I’ve had the opportunity and the privilege to sit at the very forefront,” Ajayi said.</p>
<p>“And so combining that and my fintech experience, and the fact that I’ve worked with a bunch of companies, I think it’s like a collective coming together to join QED.”</p>
<p>Ajayi is the first of two African investor professionals hired this past month by QED. The firm also brought on <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chidinma-iwueke-b1b8491a">Chidinma “Chid” Iwueke</a> as a principal.</p>
<p>Iwueke, who was previously an equity research associate at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and a partner at Nigeria-based early-stage venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a>, will focus on domestic and international investments for the firm.</p>
<p>“We started off to find one wonderful person, and we found two. And I think that speaks louder than bombs about how much talent there is in Africa,” Morris said.</p>
<p>As a global firm, QED has hubs in Washington, D.C., New York and London. On the call, Morris said Ajayi would be based out of London and Iwueke in New York.</p>
<p>Both hires are based off the continent to connect founders and startups to valuable resources such as making hires and getting customers outside of Africa. Yet, they will spend lots of time on the ground, as a large part of their job will be forming partnerships and sourcing deals with local VCs, accelerators and founders across Africa, said Ajayi.</p>

<p>QED expects its upcoming portfolio companies to take advantage of its specialization in fintech, operational expertise and willingness to roll up its sleeves to build and scale financial products Africa’s mass-market needs.</p>
<p>But despite the seeming commitment, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">QED doesn’t have a dedicated amount of capital or range of ticket sizes to deploy in the continent’s startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/qed-investors-closes-on-1-05b-to-invest-in-fintech-companies-globally/">In an interview last September</a>, the firm mentioned that it plans to invest between $5 million and $15 million in 40 to 50 companies via its early-stage fund and $10 million to $40 million in 20 to 25 startups in its growth fund).</span></p>
<p>Thus, no one knows what to expect of QED’s deal-making process yet. Morris opines that people shouldn’t read that to mean a lack of activity and non-commitment. “We will build something special here. But we’ll do it in a very balanced and thoughtful businesslike way,” he said.</p>
<p>One thing is sure, though: Just as it is with its global strategy, QED, which has invested in 23 unicorns with over $4.6 billion AUM, will back African companies across the entire spectrum of investing, from pre-seed stage to IPO.</p>
<p>The company has made 170 investments globally. It’s yet to make its first in Africa, but hiring two investment professionals on the continent &#8212; a partner and principal &#8212; is a welcome start for the continent’s tech ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan B2C e-commerce company <a href="https://copiaglobal.com/">Copia Global</a> has raised $50 million in a Series C equity round led by Goodwell Investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing round welcomed new investors such as Zebu Investment Partners, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and Koa Labs, as well as past investors Lightrock, German development finance institution DEG, and Perivoli Innovations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round comes three years after Copia’s Series B round of $26 million. According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/copia-global">Crunchbase</a>, the company has raised $53 million. But including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its Series C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Copia’s total funding since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2013 now stands at $103 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258885" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia Global </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kenya by Tracey Turner and Jonathan Lewis as a B2C e-commerce platform to serve Africa’s middle- and low-income African consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said in a statement that it harnesses mobile technologies, a network of local agents, and proprietary Copia Logistics to reach a market that traditional retail and Western e-commerce models cannot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer spending in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach over $2 trillion in the next three years, according to the IMF</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The continent’s middle class is the primary driver of this growth. However, their shopping needs are not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> served because of the high logistics costs that make Western-style e-commerce companies such as Jumia operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unprofitably.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, runs a profitable business because of how it approaches the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The e-commerce company focuses on customers in rural areas that struggle to access the same goods and services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> choice, price value and reliability that similar consumers in urban areas or of higher income levels can access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though this target market can be hard to locate and individuals may have smaller wallet sizes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their number &#8212; which Copia says is about 750 million people across Africa &#8212; and collective purchasing power present an opportunity, especially when a company thinks hyperlocal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole premise of Copia was to find a solution that was sustainable and profitable to serve consumers that we could improve their quality of life and that of their families,” said CEO Tim Steel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is building a sustainable business that involves a three-way relationship with customers and 30,000 agents in different communities across Kenya and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a well-known fact that low-income customers in Africa often distrust e-commerce platforms. Most of them would prefer to go to a physical store and get what they want, even if it means traveling long distances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a strategy, Copia recruits small business owners, who have already established some level of familiarity and trust with customers, and trains them to become agents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They wear branded Copia uniforms and advertise the platform to individual customers within their communities, eventually getting them to make their first transaction on the e-commerce store. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, these agents play a second role as aggregated delivery points</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia’s value proposition is solid with goods not generally available in proximity to the average consumer, said the CEO. Goods such as building materials or medicine where c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ustomers would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> travel to the nearest city or send a relative to get. On average, rural Kenyans spend over an hour and $4 per commute to buy such goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Copia, for instance, 20 customers within a particular location can make various orders, and the company will deliver them to its agents, whose shops and stores are close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to customers in that location. This way, customers can pick up their orders whenever they want. Copia says it also facilitates deliveries to customers’ homes upon request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This helps to create the viability of the model from a cost and unit economics perspective. But it also means that we don’t suffer the same issues many e-commerce companies face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where deliveries fail because the receiver is not available at the location. Our agents are always there because they’re running their businesses,” Steel said about how logistics costs don’t affect Copia the same way it does others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban and diaspora-based consumers can also use the service to shop for loved ones in rural areas. So instead of buying the goods themselves and driving to their home location or sending the goods or money home on a bus, these middle- to high-income consumers can purchase the products through Copia’s website or app and send them to their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agent network model allows customers to choose how they interact with Copia – online or offline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The e-commerce company pays agents a commission on every sold product, increasing their income by more than 30%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And of the 30,000 agents of the company, 77% are women, the company said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes Copia between 24 and 48 hours to get products to its customers. According to Steel, Copia doesn’t charge customers a delivery fee, which is a big differentiator from other e-commerce models. Copia offsets these delivery costs by streamlining traditional supply chain processes as it gets many goods </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from suppliers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia has roughly 1.4 million unique customers and a CAGR of about 200%, Steel said. In a statement, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia said it delivers products to thousands of customers daily and has fulfilled more than 10 million orders to date</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kenyan company intends to use the Series C funding to grow its model across East Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya, Steele believes Copia can access 80% of its serviceable market over the next couple of years, up from 50% currently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copia is eyeing other African markets and, depending on what socioeconomic and political macroeconomic conditions dictate, might expand into Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, South Africa, Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Copia’s e-commerce model is built for the unique requirements of the African market and will save many Africans a lot of time and money. We see it as one of the next big leapfrogging technologies; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like mobile phones leapfrogged landlines and solar power leapfrogged the grid, Copia is leapfrogging retail</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,”</span> Els Boerhof, the managing partner at Goodwell Investments, said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bikayi is in talks to raise about $50 million in a new financing round, four people familiar with the matter told me, as the Indian startup looks to scale its platform that helps small businesses set up and run their e-commerce stores.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India are holding conversations with the Indian startup to lead its Series B round, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are ongoing and private. Sequoia Capital India, which led Bikayi&#8217;s $10.8 million Series A funding in September last year, is positioning to lead the round, two sources said.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Bikayi, Sequoia Capital India, and Tiger Global declined to comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259272" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://bikayi.com">Bikayi</a> allows businesses to collate and fulfil orders from various online and offline sources and accept payment digitally. Its platform also helps businesses set up their e-commerce stores on WhatsApp and also launch their own apps that they can distribute to customers.</p>
<p>The startup additionally maintains partnerships with delivery firms to help businesses ship products to customers. As one of its investors describes it, Bikayi is “building a powerful tool that integrates the entire infrastructure of commerce onto one single platform.”</p>
<p>Several of Bikayi’s offerings are available to businesses at no charge. But it takes a small fee if they wish to broaden their online product catalogs, it says on its website.</p>
<p>“The entire platform has been designed to enable easy integration with other applications to make it a single dashboard for everything the merchants need. It’s even more exciting to see the impact their product is having on small businesses – and the country’s employment rate,” wrote Shraeyansh Thakur, a principal at Sequoia Capital India, in <a href="https://india.sequoiacap.com/build/bikayi-enabling-indias-fast-growing-e-commerce-ecosystem/">a blog post</a> last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scores of firms, including Reliance Retail (the nation’s largest retail chain), e-commerce giant Amazon as well as startups such as Nexus Venture Partners-backed Jumbotail, Tribe Capital-backed Khatabook and Lightspeed Venture Partners-backed Dukaan, are helping merchants &#8212; sometimes in similar, but also in their own unique ways &#8212;  digitize their businesses and reach more customers.</p>
<p>DotPe, another startup operating in the space, has amassed over 9 million customers and is clocking $4 million in ARR, according to an investor deck dated last month and reviewed by TechCrunch. The startup, which counts Google and Info Edge among its backers, has facilitated over 26 million transactions, it revealed in the investor deck.</p>
<p>ElasticRun, which is helping hundreds of thousands of neighborhood stores across hundreds of Indian cities and towns secure inventory and working capital, is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/softbank-in-talks-to-back-india-elastic-run/">talks with SoftBank</a> to raise about $200 million at a $1 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported earlier this month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenyan fintech <a href="https://www.zanifu.com/">Zanifu</a> is set to upgrade its platform and grow the number of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) it extends stock-financing to after securing $1 million in Seed funding.</p>
<p>Saviu Ventures, which invested in the startup’s pre-seed round early 2020, Launch Africa Ventures, Sayani Investments and a number of angel investors from Kenya and Nigeria participated in the round. This latest round brings the total funding so far received by the startup to $1.2 million.</p>
<p>Zanifu provides short-term stock-financing of up to $2,000 to MSMEs in Kenya and is eyeing an additional 15,000 FMCG retailers in the next one year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We serve FMCG retailers, especially the ones that are too small to access traditional bank finance for their businesses. The only option these MSMEs have has been digital consumer loans, which are not always suitable for them. We are filling a critical gap in providing stock financing, which enables small businesses to grow their turnovers by more than 40%,&#8221; said Zanifu co-founder and chief operating officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevebikoke/?originalSubdomain=ke">Steve Biko</a>.</p>
<p>“The FMCG segment has the highest working capital needs within MSMEs, and the velocity of the goods they sell allows us to safely underwrite unsecured business credit to them.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259268" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259268" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="837" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=768,628 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=680,556 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1255 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1674 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259268" class="wp-caption-text">Zanifu co-founders, from left to right, Steve Biko and Sebastian Mithika. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Zanifu.</p></div></p>
<p>Biko and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-kilimo-1570a240/?originalSubdomain=ke">Sebastian Mithika</a> launched the financing business a year after founding the startup in 2017. The startup said it has to date extended 85,000 working capital loans worth over $13 million to 7,000 businesses in Kenya.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mithika said that Zanifu is playing its role in bridging the $20 billion (as estimated by the World Bank) MSME financing gap in the country experienced by 5 million small businesses, most of which are informal.</p>
<p>The informal businesses in Kenya are an integral part of the economy contributing 33.8% of the country’s GDP and <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Economic-Survey-2021.pdf">providing 83.4% of employment</a> outside of small-scale agriculture. However, <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/262361468914023771/pdf/106986-WP-P151793-PUBLIC-Box.pdf">access to financing</a> remains the main impediment to growth for these micro and small businesses. And thus, over the last few years fintech companies like Zanifu have introduced products that are tailored to the financing needs of the MSMEs.</p>
<p>Zanifu works with a number of manufacturers and distributors to extend the credit to these small businesses with retailers already sourcing products from the startup’s partners qualifying for the financing. Zanifu has created platforms for manufactures, distributors and retailers that ensure seamless ordering, payment, tracking and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Retailers borrow through Zanifu’s loan app, where they upload information that includes historical purchase data. The retailers are then assigned a credit limit, after its algorithm scores them, within six hours after signing up. Retailers have up to a month to pay back the loans, which attract an interest rate of 3.5 to 5%.</p>
<p>Zanifu, which has a presence throughout Kenya, is now eyeing Ghana and Uganda. A regional presence will step-up competition for the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Uganda’s Numida</a> and Nigeria’s Payhippo, some of the fintechs providing unsecured financing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Numida, founded in 2017, extends unsecured credit of up to $3,500 in less than two hours while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/">Payhippo, in a past interview, said</a> it disburses average loans of $1,300, with the minimum being about $200. As alternative finance providers, these digital lenders are closing the financing gap for small businesses, but at a higher interest rate when compared to formal banking institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to potential marketing customers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie less” world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pyxis One, now <a href="https://pixis.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixis</a>, closed on $100 million in Series C funding to continue developing what it touts as “the world’s only contextual codeless AI infrastructure for complete marketing optimization.”</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the round and was joined by new investor General Atlantic, and existing investors Celesta Capital, Premji Invest and Chiratae Ventures. The fresh capital comes just four months after Pixis announced its $17 million Series B to bring its total funding to date to $124 million.</p>
<p>The California-based company was founded three years ago by Shubham A. Mishra, Vrushali Prasade and Hari Valiyath. This is the second company the team has started together; its first was artificial intelligence in the gaming space, Mishra told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company progressed, the team realized that most people were spelling “Pyxis” with an “i” instead of a “y,” so to make it super clean and symmetrical, the company changed its name, he said.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie-less” world that would require companies to deploy their own systems to respect privacy for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Not many are ready to do that,” Mishra said. “We are solving that by building a no-code AI solution that can be deployed in less than eight seconds.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company has 50 AI models now for self-evolving neural networks to add AI optimization to marketing campaigns and plans to scale to 200 in the next six months. Pixis believes in the vision that people will partially be data scientists driven by no-code solutions, Mishra said.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a ploy saying it’s “no code,” it’s actually no code, he noted. The infrastructure was built like a spectrum of offerings so that you could go full-out and tweak the AI marketing models, gather a team of data scientists and develop something, or just take 30 minutes of training and press a button to deploy the products and plug-ins.</p>
<p>The Series C follows 600% revenue growth since 2018. Pixis will close out January with more than 100 customers, all in the mid to large enterprise range, Mishra said. Customers using the Pixis AI infrastructure saw a 20% decrease in acquisition costs in addition to hours of manual work saved every month, he added.</p>
<p>The funding will help to scale the AI platforms and plug-ins as it expands across North America, Europe and APAC.</p>
<p>“This year is a new horizon for us,” Mishra said. “Last year, we were launching our solution to the BTC and DTC marketing, and by the end of the first quarter of this year, we will have a solution for B2B and software companies.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Priya Saiprasad, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that Pixis is unique in that it is a true end-to-end infrastructure for demand generation that “equips marketing functions with cutting-edge data science capabilities to drive better decision-making in a cookie-free world.”</p>
<p>She believes that is a “game-changer” because marketing is a big budget item for companies, but much of the spend is wasted when companies lack the tools for messaging and visuals and therefore don’t target the right customers via the right channel at the right time.</p>
<p>“A validation of Pixis’s product-market fit is the impressive growth rate the company has achieved in just three years since launching, buttressed by a loyal and engaged customer base of large global enterprises,” Saiprasad added. “We believe there is significant runway for Pixis to continue this momentum because of the size of the market — companies spent an estimated $455 billion on digital marketing in 2021 — and Pixis’s sector-agnostic platform enabling it to scale across different verticals.”</p>
<p>Shantanu Rastogi, managing director of General Atlantic, also noted that with the marketing ecosystem shifting, as a result of new limitations on data sharing, Pixis is addressing this and creating new return on investment for customers by leveraging predictive AI models to deliver marketing efficiency.</p>
<p>“Pixis is bringing automation and orchestration to an industry that, until now, has accepted platforms that we believe lean on outdated technology as ‘good enough,’” Rastogi added. “We are thrilled to support the talented team in its efforts to grow and scale globally with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now pay later (BNPL) startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bnpl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferating around the world</a> and the Philippines is no exception. Today, one of the country’s biggest BNPL providers, <a href="https://billease.ph/">BillEase</a>, announced it has raised an $11 million Series B. The round was led by BurdaPrincipal Investments, growth capital arm of Hubert Burda Media. Other participants included Centauri, a joint investment vehicle between MDI Ventures and KB Investment, and Tamaz Georgadze, CEO and co-founder of Raisin DS.</p>
<p>Operated by fintech First Digital Finance Corporation BillEase launched in 2017, with shopping marketplace Lazada as its first merchant partner. It can now be used at more than 500 merchants, including consumer electronics seller Kimstore and Philippine Airlines. Its BNPL is also available through payment gateways Xendit, Paynamics, 2C2P, Dragonpay and BUX, and it offers an app with personal loans, top-ups for digital wallets like GCash, PayMaya, Coins.ph, GrabPay and Shopee Pay and mobile phone and gaming credits.</p>
<p>Since the Philippines’ payment sector is fragmented, customers can pay back their BNPL loans through a variety of ways, including digital wallets, bank transfers, direct debit, linking their bank account or over-the-counter payments in physical stores like 7-11.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding brings BillEase’s total raised to about $15 million in equity, and will be used for customer acquisition, developing new products and hiring.</p>

<p>One of the main ways BillEase differentiates from other BNPL services in the Philippines is that it allows customers to build formal credit records.</p>
<p>Georg Steiger, First Digital Financial Corporation’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an email that BillEase’s target segment is the Philippines’ emerging middle class, specifically Gen Z and millennials who are early in their careers. “About 80% of our customers are new to the formal credit system and do not have a credit record.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those customers, BillEase also serves as an on-ramp to the financial system—we are the only credit app in the Philippines that is a member of TransUnion.” It is also part of the state-owned Credit Information Corporation.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mexican BNPL player Kueski secures $202M in debt &#038; equity as it nears $100M+ in ARR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexican-bnpl-player-kueski-secures-202m-as-it-nears-100m-in-arr/embed/#?secret=3hKKOdwpJa" data-secret="3hKKOdwpJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another differentiator is that BillEase built and owns its credit, fraud and payment software stack, and can approve more than 90% of BNPL loans instantly with it model. This means shorter checkout times and also enables BillEase to offer lower interest rates, at about 3.49% compared to 7% to 12% for other BNPL loans, Steiger said. It gives merchants customizable installment plans. For example, they can offer BNPL repayment terms of 10 to 30 days for smaller purchases, payment in four installments or monthly payments for larger purchases, and decide if those loans will be interest-free or not.</p>
<p>Since most of BillEase’s customers don’t have a credit record, it uses “a wide variety of alternative data sources to triangulate and get a good picture of our customers,” including telecom usage, phone metadata, network data and behavioral data points,” Steiger said.</p>
<p>“Credit scoring is also something we constantly tinker with,” he added. “As new data comes in or new variables become available, we upgrade our models. At any given time we usually run a few A/B tests to test new models or process improvements.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5avjJdZ-MYY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Politics and tech are certainly strange bedfellows. The Gang loves to talk about filibusters and the fall of democracy, but forget it when I try to bring up my fascination with live audio. That is understandable; we never talk about the little stuff until there’s a battling billionaire angle. So it was that Jack Dorsey’s joust with Marc Andreessen over what the meaning of web3 is is brought all the web2 superstars into the thread. Tim O’Reilly, John Battelle, Chris Dixon, Catch 22’s Milo Mindbender (ok, Moxie Marlinspike?) and even web1’s Leo Laporte weighed in.</p>
<p>Since Covid blocked physical events, we’ve reluctantly moved to another buzzword sweepstakes dubbed the Metaverse. I agree with Keith Teare that this dog won’t hunt due to the stylistic reluctance to wear large hardware objects on our forehead, but there’s a lot more to virtual events than meets the eye. Before the pandemic, more and more meetings were moving online as we tried to juggle back-to-back appointments at the office. It was easier to switch from room to room regardless of physical location, travel time or lack of it, and the innate competition with messaging systems like Slack and civilian texts over iMessage, FB Messenger, and whatever Google Chat was renamed this week. With competitive information constantly flowing in in real time, product strategy has morphed into analytic harvesting of that interactive metadata that drives feedback on the network into design, time to market, and distribution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Replacing large conferences with virtual working groups mostly goes on behind the corporate firewall, but message testing goes on in the clear. The context is the appsphere, and Clubhouse is a living tutorial in gaining scale through the same kind of access model the old conferences deployed. A gated ropeline establishes a kind of green room access where you can renew connections and establish trust with keynoters and technologists. The possibility of being asked up on stage is where the media is conscripted. Newsletter players like Josh Constine and Casey Newton advance from the tech pub ranks to serve as midwives for the startup churn and casting couch for the venture class. The elixir of media savvy and hallway access is what the conference makers charge for.</p>
<p>A few nights ago I sat transfixed as Adam McKay, the director, and two producers told the story of Don’t Look Up as the movie spooled out on Netflix. The Clubhouse room reverberated for over 2 hours as the filmmakers did a deep dive on the production of the funny, dark, and beautiful story of a meteor heading toward a fatal rendeyvous with Earth. Some of the great books of my fascination with the art and technology of making films flashed through my mind: Truffaut’s conversations with Hitchcock, Pauline Kael’s treatise on Citizen Kane, the moment in Annie Hall when Woody Allen drags Marshall McLuhan out from behind a sign to confront a know it all professor — “You know nothing of my work. How you came to be a professor of anything&#8230;.” Every frame of Kubrick’s lexicon. The great comic minds gathered around the Algonquin rountable.</p>
<p>And to hear in shared real time McKay tell his tale of what the making of the film meant to him and his team, to share the goals and strategies for producing a film which certainly resonates with the pandemic, filmed in the beginnings of the catastrophe when there were NO vaccines yet invented. The nuances of his approach to combining the script he wrote with the magical improvisations of his actors. It went on and on, and you could hear McKay’s delight at being a part of this coming together of technology and the spirit of inspiration. And you can find the link to the replay of the event for your own examination nestled at the top of the Replay list. Virtual yes but tangible in its emotion and flawless execution. I actually liked the Clubhouse a little more than the movie, yet the aftereffect was to like the movie even more for the experience. Maybe this Metaverse is a thing after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NFT marketplace OpenSea is putting some of its freshly raised funds to good use, buying up crypto wallet startup Dharma Labs, the company <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-dharma-labs-welcomes-new-cto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. The announcement follows a report earlier this month in <a href="https://www.axios.com/opensea-nft-dharma-acquire-f6df00d5-1cc0-463a-95fd-2f5039947ed8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> that detailed OpenSea was in talks to buy the startup for between $110 million and $130 million.</p>
<p>Dharma&#8217;s Ethereum wallet allowed users to connect their bank accounts, and buy and swap tokens while engaging with other elements of the DeFi ecosystem. OpenSea will be shutting down Dharma&#8217;s app as part of the deal, a move that is sure to be controversial with the crypto wallet&#8217;s users who will have just one month to offload assets from the wallet to a different account.</p>
<p>As part of the deal Dharma Labs co-founder Nadav Hollander will become OpenSea&#8217;s new chief technology officer. The startup&#8217;s previous CTO Alex Atallah will be stepping into a new role &#8220;where he’ll oversee [OpenSea&#8217;s] web3 and NFT ecosystem development efforts,&#8221; the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our teams share a vision that NFTs will be the cultural focal point of crypto’s adoption for years to come — and that vision can only be realized if using NFTs becomes easy &amp; delightful for the average person,&#8221; OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>As the OpenSea platform has grown from mom and pop NFT shop to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">$13.3 billion crypto decacorn</a>, some in its user base have grown more vocal in expressing views that the platform is too centralized for the &#8220;web3&#8221; world and that early users haven&#8217;t benefitted from the startup&#8217;s swelling valuation as much as its venture capitalist backers. Despite attention being paid to competitors like Rarible, Zora and recent upstart LooksRare, OpenSea is still far-and-away the clear powerhouse in the NFT world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month-long “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">break</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Better.com CEO Vishal Garg is back at the helm of the mortgage tech company he co-founded in 2016, according to an internal memo that circulated today that has been shared with TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the Better board of directors said it was “moving forward with strong, dynamic CEO leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes just weeks after the company announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">laying off 900 people</a>, or about 9% of its staff, via a Zoom meeting with the affected employees that drew widespread criticism from employees and even casual observers. In the 10 days after that meeting took place, the company’s reputation took a very public beating, with senior communications and public relations executives stepping down, memes of Garg circulating on TikTok and the CEO issuing </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a so-called apology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his behavior.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company hired a crisis firm in the aftermath of the botched layoffs and, according to the internal memo from the board, Better will be “implementing a company-wide training program on ensuring a respectful workplace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also said that during this time off, Garg had been working closely with an executive coach so he could “reconnect with the values that make Better great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following those discussions, direct input from an independent culture review and some organizational changes, the board said Garg would be officially resuming his full-time duties as CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the board said it was “confident in Vishal and in the changes he is committed to making to provide the type of leadership, focus and vision that Better needs at this pivotal time.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, it was a surprise to many that Garg was not asked to permanently resign. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some surmised that he had super-voting shares and thus could vote to keep himself in the role of CEO despite what others voted. But after digging into the </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/#rom154116_38" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-4 filed by Better.com’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, TechCrunch’s own Alex Wilhelm and I realized </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is not the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How does former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg still have a job?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/embed/#?secret=ffhnbDK8Q7" data-secret="ffhnbDK8Q7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While laying off employees during Zoom calls is hardly unheard of as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced more remote work, Varg was viewed as being callous and unfeeling in his delivery. As we’ve previously reported, it didn’t help that he had also sent emails to his staff in the past berating them with insults. Last year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p>Garg had also recently reportedly accused “at least 250″ terminated staffers of stealing from the company and customers by working just two hours a day</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com employees are reportedly not at all happy that Garg is not being asked to step down from his role as CEO, with one source telling TechCrunch that “everyone is upset, and many people have already quit or are planning to.”</span></p>
