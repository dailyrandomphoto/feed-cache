										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today the Apple TV+ streaming service has now arrived on the Google TV platform, starting with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-chromecast-adds-a-remote-and-the-new-google-tv-interface-for-49/">Chromecast with Google TV</a>. It will also become available on Google TVs from both Sony and TCL, with expansions to other Android TV-powered devices in the months to come, Google says.</p>
<p>Google TV was first<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-new-google-tv-brings-streaming-apps-live-tv-and-search-into-a-single-interface/"> introduced last September</a> as the new way Google will refer to its interface for Chromecast, where it combines streaming services, live TV via YouTube TV, and other Google offerings into one user interface &#8212; making it more competitive with similar offerings from Apple and Amazon. Today, the platform supports a wide range of top streaming services, like Disney+, Netflix, HBO Max, Peacock, Prime Video, CBS All Access, Hulu, Soing, and others, including, of course, YouTube.</p>
<p>With the added support for Apple TV+, users who already have subscriptions will be able to tune into its original programming, which includes movies, documentaries and series like &#8220;Ted Lasso,&#8221; &#8220;For All Mankind,&#8221; &#8220;Servant,&#8221; &#8220;The Morning Show,&#8221; &#8220;Dickinson,&#8221; and others. The app also provides access to the user&#8217;s library of movies and shows purchased from Apple, recommendations, and supports Family Sharing. The latter allows up to 6 family members to share a subscription to Apple TV+ and Apple TV channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following the app&#8217;s launch on Google TV, users in the U.S. will be able to browse Apple&#8217;s Originals in Google TV&#8217;s personalized recommendations and surface its content in search results. Users can also ask Google Assistant to open the Apple TV app or they can request an Apple Original title by name. And they&#8217;ll be able to add Apple TV+ programming to the Google TV Watchlist. Google says these features will arrive in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; however, instead of at launch.</p>
<p>The launch makes Google TV one of the last of the major streaming device platforms to support Apple&#8217;s streaming service, which is otherwise broadly available.</p>
<p>Apple TV+ had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/apple-tv-to-launch-november-1-for-4-99-month-one-year-free-comes-with-select-apple-devices/">debuted</a> in November 2019 for Apple customers, and later rolled out to non-Apple platforms including, that same year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/the-apple-tv-app-arrives-on-roku-ahead-of-apple-tv-streaming-service-launch/">Roku devices</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-app-comes-to-amazons-fire-tv-stick-and-other-devices/"> Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV platform</a>. Today, it&#8217;s also now available across a variety of smart TVs by Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Sony; gaming consoles including PlayStation (PS4 &amp; PS5) and Xbox (One, Series X, Series S): and via the web.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today we know of HubSpot — the maker of marketing, sales and service software products — as a preeminent public company with a market cap above $17 billion. But HubSpot wasn’t always on the IPO trajectory.</p>
<p>For its first five years in business, HubSpot offered three subscription packages ranging in price from $3,000 to $18,000 per year. The company <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/how-to-overhaul-pricing-in-3-steps/">struggled with poor churn</a> and anemic expansion revenue. Net revenue retention was near 70%, a far cry from the 100%+ that most SaaS companies aim to achieve.</p>
<p>Something needed to change. So in 2011, they introduced <a href="https://offers.openviewpartners.com/usage-based-pricing-playbook">usage-based pricing</a>. As customers used the software to generate more leads, they would proportionally increase their spend with HubSpot.  This pricing change allowed HubSpot to share in the success of its customers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In a usage-based model, expansion “just happens” as customers are successful.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>By the time HubSpot went public in 2014, net revenue retention had jumped to nearly 100% — all without hurting the company’s ability to acquire new customers.</p>
<p>HubSpot isn’t an outlier. Public SaaS companies that have adopted usage-based pricing grow faster because they’re better at landing new customers, growing with them and keeping them as customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108918" style="width: 914px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108918" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2108918" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png" alt="" width="904" height="374" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png 904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/comparison-of-usage-based-public-saas.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108918" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyle Povar</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>Widen the top of the funnel</strong></h2>
<p>In a usage-based model, a company doesn’t get paid until after the customer has adopted the product. From the customer’s perspective, this means that there’s no risk to try before they buy. Products like Snowflake and Google Cloud Platform take this a step further and even offer $300+ in free usage credits for new developers to test drive their products.</p>
<p>Many of these free users won’t become profitable — and that’s okay. Like a VC firm, usage-based companies are making a portfolio of bets. Some of those will pay off spectacularly — and the company will directly share in that success.</p>
<p>Top-performing companies open up the top of the funnel by making it free to sign up for their products. They invest in a frictionless customer onboarding experience and high-quality support so that new users get hooked on the platform. As more new users become active, there’s a stronger foundation for future customer growth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Doing home renovations yourself can be more cost-effective than hiring a contractor, but many people don&#8217;t know where to begin. Ian Janicki, the founder and CEO of DIY home renovation startup <a href="https://www.buildoutfit.com/">Outfit</a>, has always wanted to make architecture and design more accessible to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized I could leverage my knowledge of being handy to create a product that scaled,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For those who want to go through the Outfit process, the first step is submitting information about the space they&#8217;re looking to renovate, such as dimensions and photos, as well as the maximum amount they&#8217;re looking to spend. Outfit then provides information about the expected cost of the project, the handiness level required to complete the project and everything that would need to be done in order to complete the project.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We make sure it&#8217;s transparent and that you understand the amount of time that might be required,&#8221; Janicki said.</p>
<p>Once someone decides they want to move forward, Outfit then sends all the necessary tools and materials to the customer. Through the app, Outfit offers a step-by-step guide for completing the project. In the event someone gets stuck, they can chat with Janicki or someone else from the Outfit team for support.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114267" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114267" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="354" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png 2290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=680,354 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=1536,800 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=2048,1066 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/app-screens-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Outfit</p></div></p>
<p>Outfit has had a small set of pilot customers &#8212; some who have completed their projects and some whose projects are still underway.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The millennial generation is now starting to purchase their homes and has been accelerated because of remote work and COVID,&#8221; Janicki said. &#8220;They’re the Ikea generation and can put together bookshelves and are really used to digital experiences and now demanding this digital solution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>So far, the projects have ranged in cost from $1,000 to $15,000, but it really depends on things like how invasive the project is, how big the space is and more, Janicki said. The rendered after photo below would probably cost about $9,000. In general, Outfit charges customers the cost of the actual materials (e.g. power drills, wrenches, cabinets, tiles, etc.) and then adds a percentage of the total on top as a surcharge to the customer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114249" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114249" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114249" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?w=680" alt="outfit before and after kitchen renovation" width="680" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png 2290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=1536,1177 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=2048,1570 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/before-after-2.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114249" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Outfit</p></div></p>
<p>Down the road, Outfit envisions offering rentals of the tools themselves but Janicki said he just wanted to streamline everything in the early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reverse logistics is complicated to we&#8217;re trying to take it one step at a time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are a number of home improvement startups out there, such as <a href="https://www.eano.com/">Eano</a>, <a href="https://www.rennohome.com/">Renno</a> and others, but Janicki said he&#8217;s not aware of any direct competitors. He said he recognizes that there are some people who are fully capable of buying all the necessary items themselves, watching a video on YouTube and then completing the project. Meanwhile, homeowners are also just as capable of hiring someone to do the project for them. But with Outfit, however, Janicki sees it as somewhere in between. He calls it &#8220;DIY plus.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In terms of being handy, it’s a rare trait that everyone appreciates,&#8221; Janicki said. &#8220;If we can elevate people in their handiness level, i’m going to be super happy. It’s that pride that you were actually able to accomplish that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Outfit is currently available nationwide. To date, the company has backing from Y Combinator, and previously raised about $700,000 from investors like GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, B Capital Group&#8217;s Crissy Costa, Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost exactly a year after Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/google-launches-the-first-developer-preview-of-android-11/">announced</a> the first developer preview of Android 11, the company today released<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12"> the first developer preview of Android 12</a>. Google delayed the roll-out of Android 11 a bit as the teams and the company&#8217;s partners adjusted to working during a pandemic, but it looks like that didn&#8217;t stop it from keeping Android 12 on schedule. As you would expect from an early developer preview, most of the changes here are under the hood and there&#8217;s no over-the-air update yet for intrepid non-developers who want to give it a spin.</p>

<p>Among the highlights of the release so far &#8212; and it&#8217;s important to note that Google tends to add more user-facing changes and UI updates throughout the preview cycle &#8212; are the ability to transcode media into higher quality formates like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AV1 image format</a>, faster and more responsive notifications and a new feature for developers that now makes individual changes in the platform togglable so they can more easily test the compatibility of their apps. Google also promises that <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/android-11-beta-2-and-platform-stability.html">just like with Android 11</a>, it&#8217;ll add a Platform Stability milestone to Android 12 to give developers advance notice when final app-facing changes will occur in the development cycle of the operating system. Last year, the team hit that milestone in July when it launched its second beta release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With each version, we’re working to make the OS smarter, easier to use, and better performing, with privacy and security at the core,&#8221; writes Google VP of Engineering Dave Burke. &#8220;In <span class="il">Android</span> <span class="il">12</span> we’re also working to give you new tools for building great experiences for users. Starting with things like compatible media transcoding, which helps your app to work with the latest video formats if you don’t already support them, and easier copy/paste of rich content into your apps, like images and videos. We’re also adding privacy protections, refreshing the UI, and optimizing performance to keep your apps responsive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously, there are dozens of developer-facing updates in Android 12. Let&#8217;s look at some in detail.</p>
<p>For the WebView in Android 12, Google will now implement the same SameSite cookie behavior as in Chrome, for example. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/google-rolls-back-samesite-cookie-changes-to-keep-essential-online-services-from-breaking/">slowed down</a> the roll-out of this change, which makes it harder for advertisers to track your activity across sites,  in Chrome, simply because it was breaking too many sites. Now, with this feature fully implemented in Chrome, the Android team clearly feels like it, too, can implement the same privacy tools in WebView, which other apps use to display web content, too.</p>
<p>As for the encoding capabilities, Burke notes that, &#8220;with the prevalence of HEVC hardware encoders on mobile devices, camera apps are increasingly capturing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding">HEVC format</a>, which offers significant improvements in quality and compression over older codecs.&#8221; He notes that most apps should support HEVC, but for those that can&#8217;t, Android 12 now offers a service for transcoding a file into AVC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114890" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114890" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114890" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1362" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png 1622w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=768,1022 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=511,680 511w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=1154,1536 1154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=1539,2048 1539w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/compat_toggles_crop.png?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114890" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Android 12 now also supports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1">AV1 Image File Format</a> as a container for images and GIF-like image sequences. &#8220;Like other modern image formats, AVIF takes advantage of the intra-frame encoded content from video compression,&#8221; explains Burke. &#8220;This dramatically improves image quality for the same file size when compared to older image formats, such as JPEG.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114916" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copy-paste-drag-and-drop-in-split-screen.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114916" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2114916" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copy-paste-drag-and-drop-in-split-screen.gif" alt="" width="320" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As with every Android release, Google also continues to tinker with the notification system. This time, the team promises a refreshed design to &#8220;make them more modern, easier to use, and more functional.&#8221; Burke calls out optimized transitions and animations and the ability for apps to decorate notifications with custom content. Google now also asks that developers <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/unified-content-api">implement</a> a system that immediately takes users from a notification to the app, without an intermediary broadcast receiver or service, something it <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle#soafa">recommended before</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114914" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114914" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114914" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png" alt="" width="1024" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png 1672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=150,59 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=768,300 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=680,266 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=1536,601 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customizable-area.png?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android 12 will now also offer better support for multi-channel audio with up to 24 channels (a boon for music and other audio apps, no doubt), spatial audio, MPEG-H support, and haptic-coupled audio effects with the strength of the vibration and frequency based on the audio (a boon for games, no doubt). There&#8217;s also <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#immersive-mode-improvements">improved gesture navigation</a> and plenty of other optimizations and minor changes across the operating system.</p>
<p>Google also continues to drive its Project Mainline forward, which allows for an increasing number of the core Android OS features to be updated through the Google Play system &#8212; and hence bypasses the slow update cycles of most hardware manufacturers. With Android 12, it is bringing the Android Runtime module into Mainline, which will then let Google push updates to the core runtime and libraries to devices. &#8220;We can improve runtime performance and correctness, manage memory more efficiently, and make Kotlin operations faster &#8211; all without requiring a full system update,&#8221; Burke says. &#8220;We’ve also expanded the functionality of existing modules &#8211; for example, we’re delivering our seamless transcoding feature inside an updatable module.&#8221;</p>

<p>Developers who want to get started with bringing their apps to Android 12 can do so today by <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download">flashing a device image</a> to a Pixel device. For now, Android 12 supports the Pixel 3/3 XL, Pixel 3a/3a XL, Pixel 4/4 XL, Pixel 4a/4a 5G and Pixel 5. You can also use the system image in the Android Emulator in Google&#8217;s Android Studio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social audio app <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> has now topped 8 million global downloads, despite still being in a prelaunch, invite-only mode, according to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/clubhouse-social-audio-apps-rise/">new data </a>released today by mobile data and analytics firm App Annie. Per its estimates, Clubhouse grew from over 3.5 million global downloads as of Feb. 1, 2021, to reach 8.1 million by Feb. 16, 2021. This sharp growth is attributed to several high-profile guest appearances, including those from Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example.</p>
<p>App Annie also estimates that 2.6 million-plus of the total global installs took place in the U.S. &#8212; a figure that highlights the app&#8217;s global appeal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114892" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114892" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="440" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weekly-downloads-clubhouse-1-1024x663-1.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114892" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse, meanwhile, hasn&#8217;t officially shared its total number of downloads or registered users, but CEO Paul Davison revealed in January the app had grown to 2 million weekly active users &#8212; which means the app&#8217;s monthly active user figure and total registered user count would be much higher. Other <a href="https://bvajresh.medium.com/charting-the-growth-of-clubhouse-audio-app-9672aaa82f80">estimates</a> have put the app&#8217;s registered user base in between 6 million and 10 million (the latter citing unnamed sources.)</p>
<p>Reached for comment on App Annie&#8217;s report, Clubhouse said it doesn&#8217;t publish user numbers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that app install figures aren&#8217;t typically a valid proxy for registered users as many people often download an app but then never open it or sign up. But in Clubhouse&#8217;s case, the two figures could be more closely aligned as people who are installing the app are motivated to join. The app is not open to the public, so the users installing the app are likely either in possession of a Clubhouse invite or are aiming to get one from a friend or trusted contact who&#8217;s already joined.</p>
<p>Also in the new report, App Annie noted how Clubhouse phenomenon is having an impact on the larger app ecosystem. Local rivals to Clubhouse offering their own social audio experience have also gained downloads in recent days, including <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dizhua, Tiya and Yalla, which have attracted users in China, the U.S., Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dizhua, for example, has 174,000 downloads; Tiya has 6 million; and Yalla has 34.5 million, the report says. Yalla, notably, has been live since 2016, but Clubhouse&#8217;s popularity is giving it a boost. </span></p>
<p>Beyond this small handful, there&#8217;s been an explosion of social audio experiences, including those in  from startups like <a href="https://sonar.app/">Sonar</a>, <a href="https://joinlockerroom.com/">Locker Room</a>, <a href="https://www.beta.wearequilt.com/">Quilt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/early-snapchat-employee-debuts-yoni-circle-a-social-storytelling-app-for-womxn/">Yoni Circle</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roadtrip-listen-together/id1390884340">Roadtrip</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-audio-conversations/id1435216195">Space</a>, <a href="https://capiche.fm/">Capiche.fm</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/yac-gets-backed-by-slack-to-bring-the-intimacy-of-voice-back-when-remote-co-workers-interact/">Yac</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cappuccino-podcast-by-friends/id1506849927">Cappuccino</a>, and others. Twitter, meanwhile, is building its own Clubhouse rival with Spaces, which it said <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1362207015729266689">yesterday</a> will expand to Android by March. Facebook, too, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reportedly</a> planning a Clubhouse competitor.</p>
<p>The question on everyone&#8217;s minds now is how much of this growth is sustainable. <a href="https://medialyte.substack.com/p/portrait-of-a-clubhouse-skeptic">Skeptics say</a> Clubhouse lends itself to those who tend to dominate conversations by talking at length; that many of its conversations are just kind of boring; that the app favors the &#8220;hustle culture&#8221;-obsessed; and so on. Some also wonder to how well social audio apps will fare when the world reopens post-COVID and there&#8217;s more to do &#8212; including the return traditional networking events.</p>
<p>But these concerns don&#8217;t take into account that social audio has the potential to carve out space for itself by supplanting users&#8217; other mobile spoken-word audio activities, like podcast listening or audiobooks. Of course, questions about Clubhouse&#8217;s future can&#8217;t really be answered now, as the pandemic continues, and with an app that&#8217;s not fully open to the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://plusvolta.com/">Volta Energy Technologies</a>, the energy investment and advisory services firm backed by some of the biggest names in energy and energy storage materials, has closed on nearly $90 million of a targeted $150 million investment fund, according to people familiar with the group&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The venture investment vehicle compliments an $180 million existing commitment from Volta&#8217;s four corporate backers &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Equinor, Albermarle, Epsilon, and Hanon Systems &#8212; and comes at a time when interest in energy storage technologies couldn&#8217;t be stronger. </span></p>
<p>As the transition away from internal combustion engines and hydrocarbon fuels begins in earnest companies are scrambling to drive down costs and improve performance of battery technologies that will be necessary to power millions of electric cars and store massive amounts of renewable energy that still needs to be developed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Capital markets have noticed the enormity of the opportunity in transitioning away from carbon,&#8221; said Jeff Chamberlain, Volta&#8217;s founder and chief executive.</p>
<p>Born of an idea that that began in 2012 when Chamberlain began talking with the head of the Department of Energy under the Obama Administration back in 2014. What began when Chamberlain was at Argonne National Lab leading the development of <a href="https://www.jcesr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jcesr.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613753964828000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfxsLrsppOlykSkAgRTpM6s5_SOQ">JCESR</a>, the lead lab in the US government’s battery research consortium, evolved into Volta Energy as Chamberlain pitched a private sector investment partner that could leverage the best research from National Laboratories and the work being done by private industry to find the best technology.</p>
<p>Support for the Volta project remained strong through both public and private institutions, according to Chamberlain. Even under the Trump Administration, Volta&#8217;s initiative was able to thrive and wrangle some of the biggest names in the chemicals, utility, oil and gas and industrial thermal management to invest in a $180 million fund that could be evergreen, Chamberlain said.</p>
<p>According to people with knowledge of the organizations plans, the new investment fund which is targeting $150 million but has hard cap of $225 million would compliment the existing investment vehicle to give the firm more firepower as additional capital floods into the battery industry.</p>
<p>Chamberlain declined to comment specifically on the fund, given restrictions, but did say that his firm had a mandate to invest in technology that is battery and storage related and that &#8220;enables the ubiquitous adoption of electric vehicles and the ubiquitous adoption of solar and wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Back during the first cleantech boom the brains behind Volta witnessed a lot of good money getting poured into bad ideas and vaporware that would never amount to commercial success, said Chamberlain. Volta was formed to educate investors on the real opportunities that scientists were tracking in energy storage and back those companies with dollars.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We knew that investors were throwing money into a dumpster fire. We knew it could have a negative impact on this transition to carbon,&#8221; Chamberlain said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our whole objective was to help guide individuals deploying massive amounts of their personal wealth and move it from putting money into an ongoing dumpster fire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That mission has become even more important as more money floods into the battery market, Chamberlain said.</p>
<p>The SPAC craze set off by Nikola&#8217;s public offering in electric vehicles and continuing through QuantumScape&#8217;s battery SPAC through a slew of other electric vehicle offerings and into EV charging and battery companies has made the stakes higher for everyone, he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Battery companies are the latest SPAC target as EVs get a huge regulatory boost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/embed/#?secret=qgvFJ00AmG" data-secret="qgvFJ00AmG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Chamberlain thinks of Volta&#8217;s mission as finding the best emerging technologies that are coming to market across the battery and power management supply chain and ensure that as manufacturing capacity comes online, the technology is ready to meet growing demand.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investors who do not truly understand the energy storage ecosystem and its underlying technology challenges are at a distinct disadvantage,” said Goldman Sachs veteran and early Volta investor Randy Rochman, in a statement. “It has become abundantly clear to me that nothing happens in the world of energy storage without Volta’s knowledge. I can think of no better team to identify energy storage investment opportunities and avoid pitfalls.”  </span></p>
<p>The new fund from Volta has already backed a number of new energy storage and enabling technologies including: <a href="https://natron.energy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which develops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> high-power, fire-safe Sodium-ion batteries using Prussian blue chemistry for applications that demand a quick discharge of power; </span><a href="https://www.smartwires.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Wires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which develops hardware that acts as a router for electricity to travel across underutilized power lines to optimize the integration of renewable power and energy storage on the grid; and </span><a href="https://ionicmaterials.com/"><span>Ionic Materials</span></a><span>, which makes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solid lithium batteries for both transportation and grid applications. Ionic Materials’ platform technology also enables breakthrough advancements in other growing markets, such as 5G mobile, and rechargeable alkaline batteries. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://lotnet.com/">LOT Network</a>, the non-profit that helps businesses of all sizes and across industries defend themselves against patent trolls by creating a shared pool of patents to immunize themselves against them, today announced that TikTik parent ByteDance is joining its group.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/">ByteDance</a> has <a href="https://medium.com/@jacknwellis/bytedance-the-75b-social-media-unicorn-from-china-is-now-in-the-market-for-patents-909f25ef8182">acquired</a> its fair share of patents in recent years and is itself embroiled in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/triller-sues-tiktok-over-patent-infringement/">patent fight</a> with its rival Triller. That&#8217;s not what joining the LOT Network is about, though. ByteDance is joining a group of companies here that includes the likes of IBM, the Coca-Cola Company, Cisco, Lyft, Microsoft, Oracle, Target, Tencent, Tesla, VW, Ford, Waymo, Xiaomi and Zelle. In total, the group now has over 1,300 members.</p>
<p>As LOT CEO Ken Seddon told me, the six-year-old group had a record year in 2020, with 574 companies joining it and bringing its set of immunized patents to over 3 million, including 14% of all patents issued in the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the core features of LOT, which only charges members who make more than $25 million in annual revenue, is that its members aren&#8217;t losing control over the patents they add to the pool. They can still buy and trade them as before, but if they decide to sell to what the industry calls a &#8216;patent assertion entity,&#8217; (PAE) that is, a patent troll, they automatically provide a free licence to that patent to every other member of the group. This essentially turns LOT into what Seddon calls a &#8216;flu shot &#8216; against patent trolls (and one that&#8217;s free for startups).</p>
<p>&#8220;The conclusion that people are waking up to is, is that we&#8217;re basically like a herd, we&#8217;re herd immunization, effectively,&#8221; Seddon said. &#8220;And every time a company joins, people realize that the community of non-members shrinks by one. It&#8217;s like those that don&#8217;t have the vaccination shrinks &#8212; and they are, &#8216;wait a minute, that makes me a higher risk of getting sued. I&#8217;m a bigger target.&#8217; And they&#8217;re like, &#8216;wait a minute, I don&#8217;t want to be the target.'&#8221;</p>
<p>ByteDance, he argues, is a good example for a company that can profit from membership in LOT. While you may think of patents as purely a sign of a company&#8217;s innovativeness, for corporate lawyers, they are also highly effective defense tools (that can be used aggressively as well, if needed). But it can take a small company years to build up a patent portfolio. But a fast-growing, successful company also becomes an obvious target for patent trolls.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are a successful company, you naturally become a target,&#8221; Seddon said. &#8220;People become jealous and they become threatened by you. And they covet your money and your revenue and your success. One of the ways that companies can defend themselves and protect their innovation is through patents. Some companies grow so fast, they become so successful, that their revenue grows faster than they can grow their patent portfolio organically.&#8221; He cited Instacart, which <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-09-Instacart-Acquires-Over-250-Patents-From-IBM">acquired 250 patents from IBM</a> earlier this month, and Airbnb, which was <a href="https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/airbnb-sued-for-patent-infringement-by-ibm/">sued by IBM over patent infringement</a> in early 2020 (the companies <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-and-airbnb-announce-settlement-in-patent-litigation-301198325.html">settled in December</a>), as examples.</p>
<p>ByteDance, thanks to the success of TikTok, now finds itself in a situation where it, too, is likely to become a target of patent trolls. The company has started acquiring patents itself to grow its portfolio faster and now it is joining LOT to strengthen its protection there.</p>
<p>&#8220;[ByteDance] is being a visionary and trying to get ahead of the wave,&#8221; Seddon noted. &#8220;They are a successful global company that needs to develop a global IP strategy. Historically, PAEs were just a US problem, but now ByteDance has to worry about PAEs being an issue in China and Europe as well.  By joining <span class="il">LOT,</span> they protect themselves and their investments from over 3 million patents should they ever fall into the hands of a PAE.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynn-wu-2b587b3a/?originalSubdomain=cn">Lynn Wu</a>, Director and Chief IP Counsel, Global IP and Digital Licensing Strategy at ByteDance, agrees. &#8220;Innovation is core to the culture at ByteDance, and we believe it’s important to protect our diverse technical and creative community,&#8221; she said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As champions for the fair use of IP, we encourage other companies to help us make the industry safer by joining <span class="il">LOT</span> Network. If we work together, we can protect the industry from exploitation and continue advancing innovation, which is key to the growth and success of the entire community.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2114811" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="486" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png?resize=768,365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png?resize=680,323 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PastedGraphic-4-1.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s another reason companies are so eager to join the group now, though, and that&#8217;s because these patent assertion entities, which had faded into the background a bit in the mid- to late-2010s, may be making a comeback. The core assumption here is a bit gloomy: many companies seem to assume we&#8217;re in for an economic downturn. If we hit a recession, a lot of patent holders will start looking at their patent portfolios and start selling off some their more valuable patents in order to stay afloat. Since beggars can&#8217;t be choosers, that often means they&#8217;ll sell to a patent troll if that troll is the highest bidder. Last year, a patent troll sued Uber <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1246739/alleged-troll-sues-uber-using-newly-offloaded-ibm-patents">using a patent sold by IBM</a>, for example (and IBM gets a bit of a bad rap for this, but, hey, it&#8217;s business).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened after the last recession &#8212; though it typically takes a few years for the effect to be felt. Nothing in the patent world moves quickly.</p>
<p>Now, when LOT members sell to a troll, that troll can&#8217;t sue other LOT members over it. Take IBM, for example, which joined LOT last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;People give IBM a lot of grief and criticism for selling to PAEs, but at least IBM is giving everybody a chance to get a free license,&#8221; Seddon told me. &#8220;IBM joined LOT last year and what IBM is effectively doing is saying to everybody, &#8216;look, I joined LOT.&#8217; And they put all of their entire patent portfolio into LOT. And they&#8217;re saying to everybody, &#8216;look, I have the right to sell my patents to anybody I want, and I&#8217;m going to sell it to the highest bidder. And if I sell it to a patent troll and you don&#8217;t join LOT &#8212; and if you get sued by a troll, is that my fault or your fault? Because if you join LOT, you could have gotten a free license.'&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's hard to overvalue a startup when the public market is willing to double its valuation the moment it starts to trade.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-valuation-nasdaq-private-market">CoinDesk reported</a> yesterday that crypto trading startup Coinbase is being valued at $77 billion on private exchanges. And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/02/17/investors-are-now-valuing-stripe-at-115-billion/?sh=7b6c95824786">Forbes reported</a> that Stripe is being valued at $115 billion on secondary markets, where private shares can be bought and sold, albeit in a limited fashion.</p>
<p>I instantly wanted to write a piece headlined &#8220;Beware those super hot secondary market valuations,<em>&#8220;</em> but after a little digging, I cannot. It turns out that the public markets are so hot, there is historical precedent for seemingly aggressive secondary market transactions being conservative compared to later IPO valuations. And there is further precedent for private market transactions that are more conservative in price terms than venture-determined valuations also working out.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>

<p>The hot equities market is making stock pickers out of many startup investors, regardless of whether they are leading priced rounds or buying shares on modern secondary markets.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s explore the new prices for Coinbase and Stripe by starting with a look at their dated private valuations, their new, reported secondary prices and where some companies that went public with notable secondary prices wound up trading today.</p>
<p>This will be fun! I promise!</p>
<h2>Overprice me, I dare you</h2>
<p>Coinbase was last valued by private-market money at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/coinbase-series-e--25f6f746">around $8 billion, per Crunchbase data</a> back in October of 2018. More recently we&#8217;ve seen secondary transactions that value the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1354562917744713734">at $50 billion</a>, other notes concerning <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/14/coinbase-valuation-75-billion-bitcoin-value-cryptocurrency/">a $75 billion possible valuation</a>, and even some enthusiastic chat from a former employee <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/01/29/coinbase-investors-say-it-could-hit-100-billion-valuation-when-it-goes-public/?sh=b05f8fa5b50f">that the company could be worth $100 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Its new $77 billion price tag might seem somewhat pedestrian in that mix, but recall that we&#8217;re largely discussing the valuations associated with Coinbase set by buyers not in the know; retail secondary buyers of shares in the cryptocurrency exchange are probably not its board members.</p>
<p>So, the <em>public</em> is, to some degree, repricing Coinbase. The question is whether those prices make any sense. Hold your answer, we have more work to do.</p>
<p>Stripe at $115 billion on secondary exchanges is perhaps bonkers, or perhaps nothing more than rationality. In its last round, a $600 million Series G that came in mid-2020, Stripe was valued at around $36 billion. And, it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">rumored to be raising capital at a $100 billion valuation</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getcensus.com/">Census</a>, a startup that helps businesses sync their customer data from their data warehouses to their various business tools like Salesforce and Marketo, today announced that it has raised a $16 million Series A round led by Sequoia Capital. Other participants in this round include <span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/census-announces-4-3m-seed-to-put-product-info-in-cloud-data-warehouses-to-work/">led the company&#8217;s $4.3 million seed round last year</a>, as well as several notable angles, including Figma CEO Dylan Field, GitHub CTO Jason Warner, Notion COO Akshay Kothari and Rippling CEO Parker Conrad.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Census raises $4.3M seed to put product info in cloud data warehouses to work&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/census-announces-4-3m-seed-to-put-product-info-in-cloud-data-warehouses-to-work/embed/#?secret=IXekrbZ1Dt" data-secret="IXekrbZ1Dt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is part of a new crop of startups that are building on top of data warehouses. The general idea behind Census is to help businesses operationalize the data in their data warehouses, which was traditionally only used for analytics and reporting use cases. But as businesses realized that all the data they needed was already available in their data warehouses and that they could use that as a single source of truth without having to build additional integrations, an ecosystem of companies that operationalize this data started to form.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company argues that the modern data stack, with data warehouses like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery and Snowflake at its core, offers all of the tools a business needs to extract and transform data (like Fivetran, dbt) and then visualize it (think Looker).</p>
<p>Tools like Census then essentially function as a new layer that sits between the data warehouse and the business tools that can help companies extract value from this data. With that, users can easily sync their product data into a marketing tool like Marketo or a CRM service like Salesforce, for example.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years ago, we were the first to ask, &#8216;Why are we relying on a clumsy tangle of wires connecting every app when everything we need is already in the warehouse? What if you could leverage your data team to drive operations?&#8217; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the data warehouse is connected to the rest of the business, the possibilities are limitless.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; Census explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we launched, our focus was enabling product-led companies like Figma, Canva, and Notion to drive better marketing, sales, and customer success. Along the way, our customers have pulled Census into more and more scenarios, like auto-prioritizing support tickets in Zendesk, automating invoices in Netsuite, or even integrating with HR systems.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Census already integrates with dozens of different services and data tools and its customers include the likes of Clearbit, Figma, Fivetran, LogDNA, Loom and Notion.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Census plans to use the new funding to launch new features like deeper data validation and a visual query experience. In addition, it also plans to launch code-based orchestration to make Census workflows versionable and make it easier to integrate them into enterprise orchestration system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A couple of weeks ago SentinelOne announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/sentinelone-acquires-high-speed-logging-startup-scalyr-for-155m/">acquiring high-speed logging platform Scalyr</a> for $155 million. Just this morning <a href="http://crowdstrike.com">CrowdStrike</a> struck next, announcing it was buying unlimited logging tool <a href="https://www.humio.com/">Humio</a> for $400 million.</p>
<p>In Humio, CrowdStrike gets a company that will provide it with the ability to collect unlimited logging information. Most companies have to pick and choose what to log and how long to keep it, but with Humio, they don&#8217;t have to make these choices with customers processing multiple terabytes of data every single day.</p>
<p>Humio CEO Geeta Schmidt writing in <a href="https://www.humio.com/humio-crowdstrike">a company blog post announcing the deal</a> described her company in similar terms to Scalyr, a data lake for log information:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Humio had become the data lake for these enterprises enabling searches for longer periods of time and from more data sources allowing them to understand their entire environment, prepare for the unknown, proactively prevent issues, recover quickly from incidents, and get to the root cause,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LRa5LW16G1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity unicorn, files to go public</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity unicorn, files to go public&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/embed/#?secret=LRa5LW16G1" data-secret="LRa5LW16G1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That means with Humio in the fold, CrowdStrike can use this massive amount of data to help deal with threats and attacks in real time as they are happening, rather than reacting to them and trying to figure out what happened later, a point by the way that SentinelOne also made when it purchased Scalyr.</p>
<p>&#8220;The combination of real-time analytics and smart filtering built into CrowdStrike’s proprietary Threat Graph and Humio’s blazing-fast log management and index-free data ingestion dramatically accelerates our [eXtended Detection and Response (XDR)] capabilities beyond anything the market has seen to date,&#8221; CrowdStrike CEO and co-founder George Kurtz said in a statement.</p>
<p>While two acquisitions don&#8217;t necessarily make a trend, it&#8217;s clear that security platform players are suddenly seeing the value of being able to process the large amounts of information found in logs, and they are willing to put up some cash to get that capability. It will be interesting to see if any other security companies react with a similar move in the coming months.</p>
<p>Humio was founded in 2016 and raised just over $31 million, according to Pitchbook Data. Its most recent funding round came in March 2020,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/humio-announces-20m-series-b-to-advance-unlimited-logging-tool/"> a $20 million Series B</a> led by Dell Technologies Capital. It would appear to be a decent exit for the startup.</p>
<p>CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 and raised over $480 million along the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/crowdstrike-a-cybersecurity-unicorn-files-to-go-public/">before going public in 2019</a>. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, and is subject to typical regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles is warning of a potential data breach after a contractor was hit by ransomware.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based Automatic Funds Transfer Services (AFTS), which the DMV said it has used for verifying changes of address with the national database since 2019, was hit by an unspecified strain of ransomware earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a statement sent by email, the DMV said that the attack may have compromised &#8220;the last 20 months of California vehicle registration records that contain names, addresses, license plate numbers and vehicle identification numbers.&#8221; But the DMV said AFTS does not have access to customers&#8217; Social Security numbers, dates of birth, voter registration, immigration status or driver&#8217;s license information, and was not compromised.</p>
<p>The DMV said it has since stopped all data transfers to AFTS and has since initiated an emergency contract to prevent any downtime.</p>
<p>AFTS is used across the United States to process payments, invoices and verify addresses. Several <a href="https://www.skagitpud.org/news/pud-aware-of-potential-data-security-issue/">municipalities</a> have <a href="https://awwd.com/impact/emergency-information/afts-inc-security-issue/">already</a> confirmed that they are affected by the <a href="https://www.kirklandwa.gov/Government/Departments/Finance-and-Administration/Customer-Accounts/Utility-Billing/AFTS-FAQ">data breach</a>, suggesting it may not be limited to California&#8217;s DMV. But it&#8217;s not known what kind of ransomware hit AFTS. Ransomware typically encrypts a company&#8217;s files and will unlock them in exchange for a ransom. But since many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">companies have backups</a>, some ransomware groups threaten to publish the stolen files online unless the ransom is paid.</p>
<p>AFTS could not be immediately reached for comment. Its website is offline, with a short message: &#8220;The website for AFTS and all related payment processing website <em>[sic] </em>are unavailable due to technical issues. We are working on restoring them as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking at additional measures to implement to bolster security to protect information held by the DMV and companies that we contract with,&#8221; said Steve Gordon, the director of the state&#8217;s DMV.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evjekz/the-california-dmv-is-making-dollar50m-a-year-selling-drivers-personal-information">it was reported</a> that California&#8217;s DMV makes more than $50 million a year by selling drivers&#8217; personal information, including <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dyzeza/california-dmv-data-private-investigators">to bondsmen and private investigators</a>.</p>
<p>California has more than 35 million registered vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rise of &#8220;Zoom University&#8221; was only possible because edtech wasn’t ready to address the biggest opportunity of the past year: remote learning at scale. Of course, the term encapsulates more than just Zoom, it’s a nod to how schools had to rapidly adopt enterprise video conferencing software to keep school in session in the wake of closures brought on by the virus’ rapid spread.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a year since students were first sent home because of the coronavirus, a cohort of edtech companies is emerging, emboldened with millions in venture capital, ready to take back the market.</p>
<p>The new wave of startups are slicing and dicing the same market of students and teachers who are fatigued by Zoom University, which &#8212; at best &#8212; often looks like a gallery view with a chat bar. Four of the companies that are gaining traction include <a href="https://www.class.com/">Class</a>, <a href="https://www.engageli.com/">Engageli</a>, <a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a> and <a href="https://inspace.chat/">InSpace</a>. It signals a shift from startups playing in the supplemental education space and searching to win a spot in the largest chunk of a students day: the classroom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While each startup has its own unique strategy and product, the founders behind them all need to answer the same question: Can they make digital learning a preferred mode of pedagogy and comprehension &#8212; and not merely a backup &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">after the pandemic is over</a>?</p>
<p>Answering that question begins with deciding whether videoconferencing is what online, live learning should look like.</p>
<h2>Ground up</h2>
<p>“This is completely grounds up; there is no Zoom, Google Meets or Microsoft Teams anywhere in the vicinity,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-avida/">Dan Avida</a>, co-founder of Engageli, just a few minutes into the demo of his product.</p>
<p>Engageli, a new startup founded by Avida, Daphne Koller, Jamie Nacht Farrell and Serge Plotkin, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/14/engageli-launches-with-14-5-million-to-bring-digital-learning-to-universities/">raised $14.5 million</a> in October to bring digital learning to college universities. The startup wants to make big lecture-style classes feel more intimate, and thinks digitizing everything from the professor monologues to side conversations between students is the way to go.</p>
<p>Engageli is a videoconferencing platform in that it connects students and professors over live video, but the real product feature that differentiates it, according to Avida, is in how it views the virtual classroom.</p>
<p>Upon joining the platform, each student is placed at a virtual table with another small group of students. Within those pods, students can chat, trade notes, screenshot the lecture and collaborate, all while hearing a professor lecture simultaneously.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2114420" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png" alt="" width="683" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png 1448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Engageli_Groups.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<p>“The FaceTime session going on with friends or any other communication platform is going to happen,” Avida said. “So it might as well run it through our platform.”</p>
<p>The tables can easily be scrambled to promote different conversation or debates, and teachers can pop in and out without leaving their main screen. It’s a riff on Zoom’s breakout rooms, which let participants jump into separate calls within a bigger call.</p>
<p>There’s also a notetaking feature that allows students to screenshot slides and live annotate them within the Engageli platform. Each screenshot comes with a hyperlink that will take the student back to the live recording of that note, which could help with studying.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be better than Zoom, we want to be different than Zoom,” Avida said. Engageli can run on a variety of products of differing bandwidth, from Chromebooks to iPads and PCs.</p>
<p>Engageli is feature-rich to the point that it has to onboard teachers, its main customer, in two phases, a process that can take over an hour. While Avida says that it only takes five minutes to figure out how to use the platform to hold a class, it does take longer to figure out how to fully take advantage of all the different modules. Teachers and students need to have some sort of digital savviness to be able to use the platform, which is both a barrier to entry for adoption but also a reason why Engageli can tout that it&#8217;s better than a simple call. Complexity, as Avida sees it, requires well-worth-it time.</p>
<p>The startup’s ambition doesn’t block it from dealing with contract issues. Other video conferencing platforms can afford to be free or already have been budgeted into. Engageli currently charges $9.99 or less per student seat for its platform. Avida says that with Zoom, “it’s effectively free because people have already paid for it, so we have to demonstrate why we’re much better than those products.”</p>
<p>Engageli’s biggest hurdle is another startup’s biggest advantage.</p>
<h2>Built on top of Zoom</h2>
<p>Class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">launched less than a year ago</a> by Blackboard co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasen">Michael Chasen</a>, integrates exclusively with Zoom to offer a more customized classroom for students and teachers alike. The product, currently in private paid beta, helps teachers launch live assignments, track attendance and understand student engagement levels in real time.</p>
<p>While positioning an entire business on Zoom could lead to platform risk, Chasen sees it as a competitive advantage that will help the startup stay relevant after the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re not really pitching it as pandemic-related,” Chasen said. “No school has only said that we’re going to plan to use this for a month, and very few K-12 schools say we’re only looking at this in case a pandemic comes again.” Chasen says that most beta customers say online learning will be part of their instructional strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Investors clearly see the opportunity in the company’s strategy, from distribution to execution. Earlier this month, Class announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/class-series-a-zoom/">it had raised $30 million in Series A financing</a>, just 10 weeks after raising a $16 million seed round. Raising that much pre-launch gives the startup key wiggle room, but it also gives validation: a number of Zoom’s earliest investors, including Emergence Capital and Bill Tai, who wrote the first check into Zoom, have put money into Class.</p>
<p>“At Blackboard, we had a six to nine month sales cycle; we’d have to explain that e-learning is a thing,” Chasen said, who was at the LMS business for 15 years. “[With Class] we don’t even have to pitch. It wraps up in a month, and our sales cycle is just showing people the product.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Class adds $30 million to its balance sheet for a Zoom-friendly edtech solution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/class-series-a-zoom/embed/#?secret=YwVKyJICdk" data-secret="YwVKyJICdk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike Engageli, Class is selling to both K-12 institutions and higher-education institutions, which means its product is more focused on access and ease of use instead of specialized features. The startup has over 6,000 institutions, from high schools to higher education institutions, on the waitlist to join.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108367" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108367" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2108367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png" alt="" width="650" height="447" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png 1004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Class</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Class software is only usable on Macs, but its beta will be available on iPhone, Windows and Android in the near future. The public launch is at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>“K-12 is in a bigger bind,” he said, but higher-ed institutions are fully committed to using synchronous online learning for the “long haul.”</p>
<p>“Higher-ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they&#8217;re now taking the next step,” he said. “Whereas with a lot of K-12, I&#8217;m actually seeing that this is the first step that they&#8217;re taking.”</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually, depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>
<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” he said. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they’re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.”</p>
<h2>Asynchronously, silly</h2>
<p>Engageli and Class are both trying to innovate on the live learning experience, but Top Hat, which raised $130 million in a Series E round<a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2021/02/top-hat-raises-130m-in-series-e-funding.html#"> this past week</a>, thinks that the future is pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>Top Hat digitizes textbooks, but instead of putting a PDF on a screen, the startup fits features such as polls and interactive graphics in the text. The platform has attracted millions of students on this premise.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a lot of companies putting emphasis on creating a virtual classroom,” he said. “But replicating the same thing in a different medium is never a good idea…nobody wants to stare at a screen and then have the restraint of having to show up at a previous pre-prescribed time.”</p>
<p><a href="https://tophat.com/press-releases/top-hat-launches-community/#:~:text=TORONTO%20%E2%80%94%20July%2030%2C%202020%20%E2%80%94,communicate%2C%20collaborate%2C%20and%20build%20connections">In July</a>, Top Hat launched <a href="https://tophat.com/features/community/">Community</a> to give teachers a way to make class more than just a YouTube video. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">Similar to ClassDojo,</a> Community provides a space for teachers and students to converse and stay up to date on shared materials. The interface also allows students to create private channels to discuss assignments and work on projects, as well as direct message their teachers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will edtech empower or erase the need for higher education?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/embed/#?secret=987ODe3Rz9" data-secret="987ODe3Rz9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CEO Mike Silagadze says that Top Hat tried a virtual classroom tool early on, and “very quickly learned that it was fundamentally just the wrong strategy.” His mindset contrasts with the demand that Class and Engageli have proven so far, to which Silagadze says might not be as long-term as they think.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s definitely a lot of interest that&#8217;s generated in people signing up to beta lists and like wanting to try it out. But when people really get into it, everyone pretty much drops off and focuses more on asynchronous, small and in-person groups.”</p>
<p>Instead, the founder thinks that “schools are going to double down on the really valuable in-person aspects of higher education that they couldn&#8217;t provide before” and deliver other content, like large lecture-style classes or meetings, through asynchronous content delivery.</p>
<p>This is similar to what Jeff Maggioncalda, the CEO of Coursera, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/">told TechCrunch in November:</a> Colleges are going to re-invest in their in-person and residential experiences, and begin offering credentials and content online to fill in the gaps.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve been on the journey to create a more and more complete platform that our customers can use since almost day one,” Silagadze said. “What the pandemic has brought is much more comprehensive testing functionality that Top Hat has rolled out and better communication tooling so basically better chat and communication tooling for professors.”</p>
<p>TopHat costs $30 per semester, per student. Currently Top Hat has most of its paying customers coming in through its content offering, the digital textbooks, instead of this learning platform.</p>
<h2>College spin-out</h2>
<p><a href="https://inspace.chat/">InSpace</a>, a startup spinning out of Champlain college, is similarly focused on making the communication between professors and students more natural. <a href="https://www.champlain.edu/academics/our-faculty/hall-narine">Dr. Narine Hall</a>, the founder of the startup, is a professor herself who just wanted class to “feel more natural&#8221; when it was being conducted.</p>
<p>InSpace is similar to some of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">virtual HQ platforms</a> that have popped up over the past few months. The platforms, which my colleague Devin Coldewey aptly dubbed Sims for Enterprise, are trying to create the feel of an office or classroom online but without a traditional gallery view or conference call vibe. The potential success of inSpace and others could signal how the future of work will blend gaming and socialization for distributed teams.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvhJbVm3t54?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>InSpace is using spatial gaming infrastructure to create spontaneity. The technology allows users to only hear people within their nearby proximity, and get quieter as they walk, or click, away. When applied to a virtual world, spatial technology can give the feeling of a hallway bump-in.</p>
<p>Similar to Engageli, inSpace is rethinking how an actual class is conducted. In inSpace, students don&#8217;t have to leave the main call to have a conversation during inSpace, which they do in Zoom. Students can just toggle over to their own areas and a professor can see teamwork being done in real time. When a student has a question, their bubble becomes bigger, which is easier to track than the hand-raise feature, says Hall.</p>
<p>InSpace has a different monetization strategy than other startups. It charges $15 a month per-educator or “host” versus per-student, which Hall says was so educators could close contracts “as fast as possible.” Hall agrees with other founders that schools have a high demand for the product, but she says that the decision-making process around buying new tooling continues to be difficult in schools with tight budgets, even amid a pandemic. There are currently 100 customers on the platform.</p>
<p>So far, Hall sees inSpace working best with classes that include 25 people, with a max of 50 people.</p>
<p>The company was born out of her own frustrations as a teacher. In grad school, Hall worked on research that combined proximity-based interactions with humans. When August rolled around and she needed a better solution than WebEx or Zoom, she turned to that same research and began building code atop of her teachings. It led to inSpace, which recently announced that it has landed $2.5 million in financing led by Boston Seed Capital.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Virtual HQs race to win over a remote-work-fatigued market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/embed/#?secret=yT9bTtbfPY" data-secret="yT9bTtbfPY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The differences between each startup, from strategy to monetization to its view of the competition, are music to Zoom’s ears. Anne Keough Keehn, who was hired as Zoom’s Global Education Lead just nine months ago, says that the platform has a “very open attitude and policy about looking at how we best integrate&#8230;and sometimes that’s going to be a co-opetition.”</p>
<p>“In the past there has been too much consolidation and therefore it limits choices,” Keehn said. “And we know everybody in education likes to have choices.” Zoom will be used differently in a career office versus a class, and in a happy hour versus a wedding; the platform sees opportunity in it all beyond the “monolithic definition” that video-conferencing has had for so long.</p>
<p>And, despite the fact that this type of response is expected by a well-trained executive at a big company in the spotlight, maybe Keehn is onto something here: Maybe the biggest opportunity in edtech right now is that there is opportunity and money in the first place, for remote learning, for better video-conferencing and for more communication.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: A previous version of this story claims that TopHat&#8217;s community platform cost $30 per student, per month. TopHat has clarified since that the community platform is free, but its core product is sold for this cost. An update has been made to reflect this clarification.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://pipe17.com/">Pipe17</a>, a software startup focused on the e-commerce market, announced that it has closed $8 million in funding.</p>
<p>Pipe17&#8217;s service helps smaller e-commerce merchants connect their digital tools, without the need to code. With the startup&#8217;s service, e-commerce operations that may lack an in-house IT function can quickly connect their selling platform to shipping, or point-of-sale data to their ERP.</p>
<p>The venture arm of a large logistics investor GLP, <a href="https://glpcp.com/">GLP Capital Partners</a> led the round.</p>
<p>Pipe17 co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamadafshar/">Mo Afshar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/middleworks/">Dave Shaffer</a> told TechCrunch in an interview that the idea for their startup came from examining the e-commerce market, noting the energy to be found concerning selling platforms, and the comparative dearth of software to help get e-commerce tools to work together; Shopify and BigCommerce and Shippo are just fine, but if you can&#8217;t code you might wind up schlepping data from one platform to the next to keep your e-commerce operation humming.</p>
<p>So they built Pipe17 to fill in the gap.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wSoWxlpkKk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/why-e-commerce-startups-arent-raising-more-funding-during-this-historic-boom/">Why e-commerce startups aren&#8217;t raising more funding during this historic boom</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why e-commerce startups aren&#8217;t raising more funding during this historic boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/why-e-commerce-startups-arent-raising-more-funding-during-this-historic-boom/embed/#?secret=wSoWxlpkKk" data-secret="wSoWxlpkKk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to Afshar, Pipe17 wants to simplify operations for e-commerce merchants through the lens of connection; the pair of co-founders believe that easy cross-compatibility is the key missing ingredient in the modern-day e-commerce software stack, likening the current e-commerce maket to the IT and datacenter worlds before the advent of Splunk and Datadog.</p>
<p>The prevailing view in the e-commerce industry, the co-founders explained, is that to fix a problem e-commerce players should purchase another application. Pipe17 thinks that most ecommerce companies probably have enough tooling, and that they instead need to get their existing tooling to communicate.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s neat about the startup is that it&#8217;s building something that we might call no-code-no-code, or no-code to a higher degree. Instead of offering a interface for non-developers to visually map out connections between different software services, it has pre-built what might need to be mapped. Just pick the two e-commerce services you want to link, and Pipe17 will connect them for you in an intelligent manner. For folks who find <em>any</em> sort of coding hard (which probably describes a lot of indie online store operators), the method could be an attractive pitch.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s customer target are sellers doing single-digit millions to nine-figures in year sales.</p>
<p>Why did Pipe17 raise capital now? The co-founders said that there are only so many chances to simplify a large market, akin to what Plaid and Twilio did for their own niches, so taking on funds now made sense. In Afshar&#8217;s view, e-commerce operations is going to be simply massive. Given <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">the growth in digital selling that we saw last year</a>, it&#8217;s a perspective that is hard to dispute.</p>
<p>The niche that Pipe17 wants to fill has more than one player. While the startups themselves might quibble about just how much competitive space they share, Y Combinator-backed <a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy</a> recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/alloy-raises-4m-to-build-out-its-e-commerce-automation-service/">raised $4 million</a> to build a no-code e-commerce automation service. Which is related to what Pipe17 does. It will be interesting to see if they wind up in competition, and, if so, who comes out on top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outrage fast-followed Facebook&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">yesterday</a> that it was making good on its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/facebook-threatens-to-block-news-sharing-in-australia-as-it-lobbies-against-revenue-share-law/"> threat</a> to block Australian users&#8217; ability to share news on its platform.</p>
<p>The tech giant&#8217;s intentionally broad-brush &#8212; call it antisocial &#8212; implementation of content restrictions took down a swathe of non-news publishers&#8217; Facebook pages, as well as silencing news outlets&#8217;, illustrating its planned dodge of the (future) law.</p>
<p>Facebook took the step to censor a bunch of pages as parliamentarians in Australia are debating a legislative proposal to force Facebook (and Google) to pay publishers for linking to their news content. In recent years the media industry in the country has successfully lobbied for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">a law to extract payment from the tech giants</a> for monetizing news content when it&#8217;s reshared on their platforms &#8212; though the legislation is still being drafted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

But it&#8217;s Facebook that screwed its courage to the sticking place and flipped the chaos switch first.</p>
<p>Last night Internet users in Australia took to Twitter to report local scores of Facebook pages being wiped clean of content &#8212; including hospitals, universities, unions, government departments and the bureau of meteorology, to name a few.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the wake of Facebook&#8217;s unilateral censorship of all sorts of Facebook pages, parliamentarians in the country accused the tech giant of &#8220;an assault on a sovereign nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>The prime minister of Australia also said today that his government &#8220;would not be intimidated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed it has applied an intentionally broad definition of news to restrict &#8212; saying it has done so to reflect the lack of clear guidance in the law &#8220;as drafted&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it looks like the collateral damage of Facebook silencing scores of public information pages is at least partly a PR tactic to illustrate potential &#8216;consequences&#8217; of lawmakers forcing it to pay to display certain types of content &#8212; i.e. to &#8216;encourage&#8217; a rethink while there&#8217;s still time.</p>
<p>The tech giant did also say it would reverse pages that are &#8220;inadvertently impacted&#8221;.</p>
<p>But it did not indicate whether it would be doing the leg work of checking its own homework there, or whether silenced pages must (somehow) petition it to be reinstated.</p>
<p>“The actions we&#8217;re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content. As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted. However, we will reverse any Pages that are inadvertently impacted,” a Facebook company spokesperson said in the statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not clear how many non-news pages have been affected by Facebook&#8217;s self-imposed content restrictions.</p>
<p>If the tech giant was hoping to kick off a wider debate about the merits of Australia&#8217;s (controversial) plan to make tech pay for news (including in its current guise, for <em>links</em> to news &#8212; not just snippets of content, as under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">EU&#8217;s recent copyright reform expansion of neighbouring rights for news</a>) &#8212; Facebook has certainly succeeded in grabbing global eyeballs by blocking regional access to vast swathes of useful, factual information.</p>
<p>However Facebook&#8217;s blunt action has also attracted criticism that it&#8217;s putting business interests before human rights &#8212; given it&#8217;s shuttering users&#8217; ability to find what might be vital information, such as from hospitals and government departments, in the middle of a pandemic. (Albeit, being accused of ignoring human rights is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/un-says-facebook-is-accelerating-ethnic-violence-in-myanmar/">hardly a new look for Facebook</a>.)</p>
<p>The Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/europe-urged-to-block-google-fitbit-ahead-of-major-digital-policy-overhaul/">academic critique of surveillance capitalism</a> &#8212; including that it engages in propagating &#8220;epistemic chaos&#8221; for profit &#8212; has perhaps never felt quite so on the nose. (&#8220;We turned to Facebook in search of information. Instead we found lethal strategies of epistemic chaos for profit,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html">wrote only last month</a>.)</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s intentional over-flex has also underscored the vast power of its social monopoly &#8212; which will likely only strengthen calls for policymakers and antitrust regulators everywhere to grasp the nettle and rein in big tech. So its local lobbying effort may backfire on the global stage if it further sours public opinion against the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">scandal-hit company</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With Facebook deplatforming all news en masse, this is a good time to scrutinise the way platforms can and do take advantage of their monopoly position as ubiquitous / essential intermediaries in people&#39;s lives to throw their weight around.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s rush to censor may even encourage a proportion of its users to remember/discover that there&#8217;s a whole open Internet outside its walled garden &#8212; where they can freely access public information without having to log into Facebook&#8217;s ad-targeting platform (and be stripped of their privacy) first.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon/status/1362132589688090626">others have noted</a>, it&#8217;s also interesting to note how quickly Facebook can pull the content moderation trigger when it believes its bottom line is threatened. And a law to extract payment for sharing news content presents a clear threat.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast Facebook&#8217;s rush to silence information pages in Australia with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-in-a-reversal-will-now-ban-holocaust-denial-content-under-its-hate-speech-policy/">laid back approach</a> to tackling outrage-inducing hate speech or violent conspiracy nonsense and it&#8217;s hard not to conclude that content moderation on (and by) Facebook is always viewed through the prism of Facebook&#8217;s global revenue growth goals. (Much like how the tech giant can here be seen in a court filing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-for-years-ad-reach-estimates-were-based-on-wrong-data-but-blocked-fixes-over-revenue-impact-per-court-filing/">chainlinking revenue to its self-reported ad metric tools</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://helloabound.com">Abound</a>, an online marketplace that helps independent retailers stock their shelves with new products from up-and-coming brands, is announcing that it has raised $22.9 million in its first institutional round of funding.</p>
<p>CEO Bill Shope founded the company with Niklas de la Motte and Drew Sfugaras. He told me that small retailers are constantly on the hunt for new products, which means attending trade shows several times a year. Abound, on the other hand, allows them to find those products through an online shopping experience, with wholesale prices (a.k.a. discounts of up to 50 percent), free returns and, in some cases, Net 60 sale terms (meaning retailers don&#8217;t have to pay until 60 days after the invoice).</p>
<p>The startup actually began as a community connecting manufacturer&#8217;s representatives and retailers, but Shope said the team &#8220;kept seeing the limits of that model,&#8221; while some retailers were asking to buy from the brands directly. So the team decided to support that experience, starting out by recruiting 50 brands with an offer of free consulting — as long as they were willing to be one of the brands on the marketplace when it launched in October 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, the retail environment changed dramatically in the following months, as the pandemic forced stores to close and/or adopt social distancing measures. Shope said the startup saw a dramatic, short-term decline in sales — but things quickly bounced back and kept growing as &#8220;all the trade shows got canceled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partly, that&#8217;s because Abound also supports e-commerce retailers, but Shope noted that &#8220;the brick and mortars that were succeeding had a very powerful hybrid model,&#8221; where they continued to operate a physical store while also quickly launching websites and adding features like curbside pickup.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114762" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114762" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114762" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="Abound screenshot" width="680" height="618" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg 1268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,273 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,698 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,618 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ABOUND-homepage-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114762" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abound</p></div></p>
<p>Abound says that since the beginning of 2020, it has added 180,000 new products in categories like baby and kid products, beauty, food and drink, home and living, jewelry and more. And monthly sales volume has increased 20-fold.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a retail perspective, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any going back [to pre-COVID buying models,]&#8221; Shope said. After all, even before the pandemic, independent retailers had to compete with giants like Amazon and Walmart. &#8220;You’re not going to beat them on convenience products. The store that&#8217;s helping consumers discover new brands, or donating 10 percent of profits to charities — those are types of stories and products you need to have to draw consumers into your store.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding was led by Left Lane Capital, with participation from RiverPark Ventures, All Iron Ventures and branding firm Red Antler. This will allow Abound to grow the team, expand internationally and continue developing the product.</p>
<p>In a statement, Left Lane Managing Partner Harley Miller said:</p>
<blockquote><p>My family has been in independent retail for the last 20 years. Growing up, I attended many industry events, so I have long understood how under-optimized the wholesale buying and selling experience is. With the cancellation of most major trade shows in 2020 and 2021, emerging brands and independent retailers have been seeking new distribution channels to support their business ambitions. Abound offers an exciting and unique alternative to the legacy wholesale model at a time when small businesses need it most.</p></blockquote>

<p>Founded in 2017, Varo Bank competes with a growing number of all-digital banks operating in the U.S., including Chime, Current, N26, Level, Step, Moven, Empower Finance, Dave, GoBank, Aspiration, Stash, Zero, and <a href="https://neobanks.app/neobanks/united-states">others</a>.</p>
<p>Like most neobanks, Varo Bank offers an easily accessible bank account with no monthly fees or minimum balance requirements, and a modern mobile app experience. It also includes high-interest savings and provides customers with access to a network of 55,000 fee-free Allpoint ATMs. But Varo Bank doesn&#8217;t have any physical bank branches.</p>
<p>Varo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/mobile-banking-startup-varo-is-becoming-a-real-bank/">announced</a> last year it had been granted a national bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and secured regulatory approvals from the FDIC and Federal Reserve to open Varo Bank, N.A. &#8212; effectively becoming a &#8220;real&#8221; bank.</p>
<p>Today, Varo Bank has over 3 million bank accounts, and says it&#8217;s deposits are up by over 900% year-over-year. Spend on the Varo platform is also up by over 300%, year-over-year.</p>

<p>Westbrook&#8217;s interest in working with Varo Bank has to do with its focus on making an impact on financial inequality through its banking services. Specifically, the company is committed to bringing up to two-day early payroll deposits, savings accounts that pay higher rates than the national average, and a short-term cash advance line of credit, <a href="https://www.varomoney.com/cash-advance/">Varo Advance</a>, that gives qualifying customers access to up to $100 as needed in the Varo Bank app. The credit line was launched in Dec. 2020, and remains fee-free through March 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The new funds will be used to expand Varo Bank&#8217;s services, as well as work with Westbrook to co-create a community impact program that focuses on building financial literacy in underserved communities, the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The banking system has ignored or underserved a large portion of the American population &#8211; particularly communities of color. I’m passionate about making lasting social change and creating a stronger and more inclusive system,&#8221; said Mr. Westbrook, in a statement about his investment. &#8220;I am excited and ready to work with Varo to be a part of an economic revitalization for those who never had the access they deserved,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, that software is offered as a cloud service should be pretty much considered a given. Certainly any modern tooling is going to be SaaS, and as companies and employees add services, it becomes a management nightmare. Enter <a href="https://toriihq.com/">Torii</a>, an early-stage startup that wants to make it easier to manage SaaS bloat.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $10 million Series A investment led by Wing Venture Capital, with participation from prior investors Entree Capital, Global Founders Capital, Scopus Ventures and Uncork Capital. The investment brings the total raised to $15 million, according to the company. Under the terms of the deal, Wing partner Jake Flomenberg is joining the board.</p>
<p>Uri Haramati, co-founder and CEO, is a serial entrepreneur who helped launch Houseparty and Meerkat. As a serial founder, he says that he and his co-founders saw firsthand how difficult it was to manage their companies&#8217; SaaS applications, and the idea for Torii developed from that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We all felt the changes around SaaS and managing the tools that we were using. We were all early adopters of SaaS. We all [took advantage of SaaS] to scale our companies and we felt the same thing: The fact is that you just can&#8217;t add more people who manage more software, it just doesn&#8217;t scale,&#8221; Haramati told me.</p>
<p>He said they started Torii with the idea of using software to control the SaaS sprawl they were experiencing. At the heart of the idea was an automation engine to discover and manage all of the SaaS tools inside an organization. Once you know what you have, there is a no-code workflow engine to create workflows around those tools for key activities like onboarding or offboarding employees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114680" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114680" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?w=680" alt="Torii no code workflow engine." width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=768,448 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=1536,895 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-17-at-21.59.03.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114680" class="wp-caption-text">Torii Workflow Engine. Image Credits<strong>:</strong> Torii</p></div></p>
<p>The approach seems to be working. As the pandemic struck in 2020, more companies than ever needed to control and understand the SaaS tooling they had, and revenue grew 400% YoY last year. Customers include Delivery Hero, Chewy, Monday.com and Palo Alto Networks.</p>
<p>The company also doubled its employees from a dozen with which they started last year, with plans to get to 60 people by the end of this year. As they do that, as experienced entrepreneurs, Haramati told me they already understood the value of developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, certainly around gender. Today, the team is 25 people with 10 being women and they are working to improve those ratios as they continue to add new people.</p>
<p>Flomenberg invested in Torii because he was particularly impressed with the automation aspect of the company and how it took a holistic approach to the SaaS management problem, rather than attempting to solve one part of it. &#8220;When I met Uri, he described this vision. It was really to become the operating system for SaaS. It all starts with the right data. You can trust data that is gathered from [multiple] sources to really build the right picture and pull it together. And then they took all those signals and they built a platform that is built on automation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Haramati admits that it&#8217;s challenging to scale in the midst of a pandemic, but the company is growing and is already working to expand the platform to include product recommendations and help with compliance and cost control.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D printing has come a long way over the course of the last decade, but questions about mainstream adoption still linger around the technology. Medical devices have been a pretty compelling use case &#8212; they’re not really mass produced and require a high level of personalization. Clear orthodontics are a great example of something that falls in that sweet spot &#8212; in fact, dental in general has been a big application.</p>
<p>Audio, too, holds a lot of potential. Imagine, for example, a set of headphones custom designed for your ears. The technology has been available on high-end models for a while, courtesy of molding, but 3D printing could unlock a more easily scalable version of that kind of luxury.</p>
<p>This week, Sennheiser announced a partnership that will utilize Formlabs technology to print custom earphones. Specifically, the headphone maker will be using the Form 3B, a printer design for use with biocompatible material that has largely been utilized for dental applications. Product specifics haven’t been revealed, but the audio company’s Ambeo division will be using the tech to create custom headphone eartips. Users would be able to scan their ears with a smartphone and send that to the company to get a tip printed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114663" style="width: 406px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png" alt="" width="396" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png 396w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=119,150 119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=238,300 238w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-04-at-9.40.19-AM-1.png?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sennheiser</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our technology collaboration with Sennheiser seeks to change the way customers interact with the brands they love by enabling a more customized, user-centric approach to product development,” Formlabs audio head Iain McLeod said in a release.. “Formlabs’ deep industry knowledge and broad expertise in developing scalable solutions enable us to deliver tangible innovations to our customers. In this case, we are working with Sennheiser’s Ambeo team to deliver a uniquely accessible, custom fit experience.”</p>
<p>The product is still very much in the prototype phase. And while such a partnership seems like a no-brainer for headphone makers going forward, there are some big questions here, including pricing and scalability. Clearly such a product would come at a premium over standard headphones, but not at so high a cost that supersedes such novelty.</p>
<p>The release calls it “an affordable and simple solution is now available to mass 3D print custom-fit earphones.” What, precisely, it means by affordable remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the U.S. has seen more renters than at any point since at least 1965, according </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a Pew Research Center analysis of </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/housing.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Census Bureau housing data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competition for renters is fierce and property managers are turning to technology to get a leg up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet that demand, Seattle-based <a href="https://www.knockcrm.com/">Knock </a>– one startup that has developed tools to give property management companies a competitive edge – has raised $20 million in a growth funding round led by Fifth Wall Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Madrona Venture Group, Lead Edge Capital, Second Avenue Partners and Seven Peaks Ventures also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total capital raised to $47 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetri Themelis and Tom Petry co-founded Knock in 2014 after renting “in super competitive markets” such as New York City, San Francisco and Seattle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After meeting with property management companies, it was eye-opening to learn about the total gap across their tech stacks,” Themelis recalled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock’s goal is to provide CRM tools to modernize front office operations for these companies so they can do things like offer virtual tours and communicate with renters via text, email or social media from “a single conversation screen.” For renters, it offers an easier way to communicate and engage with landlords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Apartment buildings, like almost every customer-driven business, compete with each other by attracting, converting and retaining customers,” Themelis said. “For property management companies, these customers are renters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup &#8212; which operates as a SaaS business &#8212; has seen an uptick in growth, quadrupling its revenue over the past two years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its software is used by hundreds of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest property management companies across the United States and Canada and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has more than 1.5 million apartment units using the platform. Starwood Capital Group, ZRS, FPI and Cushman &amp; Wakefield (formerly Pinnacle) are among its users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Petry explains it, Knock serves as the sales inbox (chat, SMS, phone, email), sales calendar and CRM systems, all in one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also automate certain sales tasks like outreach and appointment scheduling, while also surfacing which sales opportunities need the most attention at any given time, for both new leases as well as renewals,” he said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114161" style="width: 4096px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114161" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2114161 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png" alt="" width="4086" height="2860" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png 4086w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=2048,1433 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/device-horizontal-large.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4086px) 100vw, 4086px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114161" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Knock</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, Themelis said, was well-prepared for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our software supports property management companies, which operate high-density apartment buildings that people live and work in,” he told TechCrunch. “You can’t just ‘shut them down,’ which has made multifamily resilient and even grow in comparison to retail and industrial real estate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when lockdowns went into effect, in-person property tours declined by an estimated 80% in a matter of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock did things like help property managers transition to a centralized and remote leasing model so remote agents could work across a large portfolio of properties rather than in a single on-site leasing office, noted Petry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helped them adopt self-guided, virtual and live video-based leasing tools, so prospective renters could tour properties in person on their own or virtually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This transformation and modernization became a huge tailwind for our business in 2020,” Petry said. “Not only did we have a record year in terms of new customers, revenue growth and revenue retention, but our customers outperformed market averages for occupancy and rent growth as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company says it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be using its new capital to (naturally!) hire across product, engineering, sales, marketing, customer success, finance and human resources divisions. It expects to grow headcount by 40% to 50% before year-end. It also plans to expand its product portfolio to include AI communications, fraud prevention, applicant screening and leasing, and intelligent forecasting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Wall partner Vik Chawla, who is joining Knock’s board of directors, pointed out that the macroeconomic environment is driving institutional capital into multifamily real estate at an accelerated pace. This makes Knock&#8217;s offering even more timely in its importance, in the firm&#8217;s view.</span></p>
<p>The startup, he believes, outshines its competitors in terms of quality of product, technical prowess and functionality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Knock team has accomplished so much in just a short period of time by attracting very high quality product design and engineering talent to ameliorate a nuanced pain point in the tenant acquisition process,&#8221; Chawla told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>In terms of fitting with its investment thesis, Chawla said companies like Knock can both benefit from Fifth Wall&#8217;s global corporate strategic partners &#8220;and simultaneously serve as a key offering which we can share with real estate industry leaders in different countries as a potential solution for their local markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Calendars. They are at the core of how we organize our workdays and meetings, but despite regular attempts to modernize the overall calendar experience, the calendar experience you see today in Outlook or <del>G Suite</del> Google Workspace hasn&#8217;t really changed at its core. And for the most part, the area that startups like Calendly or ReclaimAI have focused on in recent years is scheduling.</p>
<p><a href="https://magicalhq.com/">Magical</a> is a Tel Aviv-based startup that wants to reinvent the calendar experience from the ground up and turn it into more of a team collaboration tool than simply a personal time-management service. The company today announced that it has raised a $3.3 million seed round led by Resolute Ventures, with additional backing from Ibex Investors, Aviv Growth Partners, ORR Partners, Homeward Ventures and Fusion LA, as well as several angel investors in the productivity space.</p>
<p>The idea for the service came from discussions on <a href="https://www.supertools.ai/">Supertools</a>, a large workplace-productivity community, which was also founded by Magical founder and CEO Tommy Barav.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114524" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114524" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114524" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png 2891w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=2048,1022 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Magical_Calendar_v2.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Magical</p></div></p>
<p>Based on the feedback from the community &#8212; and his own consulting work with large Fortune 500 multinationals &#8212; Barav realized that time management remains an unsolved business problem. &#8220;The time management space is so highly fragmented,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There are so many micro tools and frameworks to manage time, but they&#8217;re not built inside of your calendar, which is the main workflow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Traditional calendars are add-ons to bigger product bundles and find themselves trapped under those, he argues. &#8220;The calendar in Outlook is an email sidekick, but it&#8217;s actually the center of your day. So there is an unmet need to use the calendar as a time management hub,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Magical, which is still in private beta, aims to integrate many of the features we&#8217;re seeing from current scheduling and calendaring startups, including AI-scheduling and automation tools. But Magical&#8217;s ambition is larger than that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114527" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114527" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png" alt="" width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png 1439w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=680,483 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CleanShot_2021-02-11_at_00.47.08.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114527" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Magical</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to redefine how you use a calendar in the first place,&#8221; Barav said. &#8220;Many of the innovations that we&#8217;ve seen are associated with scheduling: how you schedule your time, letting you streamline the way you schedule meetings, how you see your calendar. [&#8230;] But we&#8217;re talking about redefining time management by giving you a better calendar, by bringing these workflows &#8212; scheduling, coordinating and utilizing &#8212; into your calendar. We&#8217;re redefining the use of the calendar in the modern workspace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Magical is still in its early days, the team is still working out some of the details, but the general idea is to, for example, turn the calendar into the central repository for meeting notes &#8212; and Magical will feature tools to collaborate on these notes and share them. Team members will also be able to follow those meeting notes without having to participate in the actual meeting (or get copied on the emails about that meeting).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll help teams reduce pointless meetings,&#8221; Barav noted. To do this, the team is also integrating other services into the calendar experience, including the usual suspects like Zoom and Slack, but also Salesforce and Notion, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s rare that you find an entrepreneur who has so clearly validated its market opportunity,&#8221; said Mike Hirshland, a founding partner of <span class="il">Magical</span> investor Resolute Ventures. &#8220;Tommy and his team have been talking to thousands of users for three years, they’ve validated the opportunity, and they’ve designed a product from the ground-up that meets the needs of the market. Now it&#8217;s &#8216;go time&#8217; and I&#8217;m thrilled to be part of the journey ahead.&#8221;</p>
