										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given all of the…feedback <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has received, it’s hard to believe the Halo wasn’t widely available until today. Announced in late-August, the product has been offered in “early access” to invited users. That changes today, however, as the product opens to everyone in the U.S.</p>
<p>The band runs $100, a price that includes six months of membership. It was probably inevitable that the company would launch a fitness product, though Amazon’s behind the curve as far as form factors go. Smartwatches have become a dominant force in fitness tracking on the high end. Bands are still a presence on the opposite side of the market, but generally command a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>What makes the Halo different is its use of voice and the amount of data it collects and processes – neither are honestly a surprise, coming Amazon. The former involves processing the wearer’s tone of voice, which has drawn some…mixed feedback. Here’s how Amazon describes that bit,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Tone of voice analysis can help you communicate more thoughtfully with family, friends, colleagues, your favorite food truck proprietor, and everyone in between.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/a-better-measure-of-health">Body fat scanning</a> is an even bigger question mark. Early reviews have called the technology “invasive,” among other things. It has also drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. Senator Amy Klobuchar penned a letter to Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>“While new wearable fitness devices make it easier for people to monitor their own health, these devices give companies unprecedented access to personal and private data with limited oversight,”<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/5/35297230-1088-4728-80a6-6a8cd1108a9a/2B62F5B3B4E2A4E04A16A9D01759FF38.121120healthprivacyletter.pdf"> Klobuchar wrote</a>. “More must be done to ensure the privacy and security of health-related consumer devices.”</p>
<p>Amazon has actively pushed back on privacy concerns, highlighting, among other things, that the body scans exist only on the device used to capture them. “Privacy is foundational to how we designed and built Amazon Halo,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/11/amazon-halo-klobuchar-privacy/">told The Washington Post</a>. “Body and Tone are both optional features that are not required to use the product.”</p>
<p>Amazon’s got the dually difficult task of assuring consumer privacy and attempting to set the product apart in a well-saturated market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’m glistening. My heart rate is finally slowing a bit as I type this. The slightest hints of my asthma are subsiding. I’m not going to tell you I feel “good,” as relative as that term might be in a year when everything has gone to hell somehow both gradually and all at once over the course of 12 awful months. But I certainly don’t feel “bad,” either.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a kind of serendipity in today’s launch of Fitness+. While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> gets points for general prescience, one assumes the company wasn’t privy to any better information than the rest of us, and certainly couldn’t have predicted how radical a shift the exercise industry would undergo over the past nine months.</p>
<p>Most of the information on COVID-19’s impact on gyms is, at best, either myopic or anecdotal, but there seems little doubt the industry has been — and will continue to be — radically impacted by the pandemic. “Devastated” might be a more accurate term. After all, it’s mid-December as I’m writing this and many are still scared to venture back into a business that routinely ranks among the highest risk for the virus’s spread. As if people needed another excuse to skip daily workouts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What we can say for certain, however, is that Wall Street and Silicon Valley cultures have reacted, big time. In late-June, Lululemon purchased Mirror for a jaw-dropping $500 million. Shortly after, Bank of America started tossing out predictions, noting the guided workout company could generate $700 million and hit 600,000 subscribers by 2023. Peloton stock hit a slight blip with Apple’s Fitness+ launch announcement last week, but otherwise, it’s a been a terrific year from the home treadmill/stationary bike maker.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>None of this is to say, of course, that these companies weren’t already doing gangbusters, but the pandemic has certainly — in the words of an overzealous fitness instructor — kicked it up a notch. Yes, I grimaced a bit as I wrote that last sentence, but ultimately, what is a fitness class if not an exercise in swallowing one’s pride?</p>
<p>My own experience with group workouts is limited. Prior to the pandemic, I went to the gym five to seven days a week. When on a work trip, I would be the weirdo at the hotel gym, trying to figure out how to change the one giant-tube television from Fox News at 6AM. I don’t care what your political leanings are — no Fox and Friends for me before coffee and a run.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, my options have been…limited. In addition to the harrowing COVID fallout in my home of Queens in March/April, I dealt with some of my own health complications that severely limited my workout options. I’ve weaned myself back into a kind of makeshift workout regimen in the intervening few months — first through some YouTube yoga and now through five to 15-mile daily walks.</p>
<p>It’s an improvement. And I’m counting my blessings and all of that, knowing well that as bad as things had and have gotten, they ultimately could be worse. Truth is, though, like many Americans (and non-Americans, no doubt), the cost-benefit analysis of going back to the gym still doesn’t make a heck of a lot of sense for me. Given the space constraints of my New York City apartment, however, neither does a Peloton.</p>
<p>I do, however, have an Apple Watch. And a yoga mat. And just about enough space in my bedroom to make this work. I’ve been at this for a few days — doing a couple of workouts a day, ranging from about 10 to 20 minutes a piece. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/daily-crunch-first-impressions-of-the-airpods-max/">Matthew did last week with his AirPods Max</a> writeup, I’m going to opt not to call this a “review.” It’s not fair to the product and — more to the point — it’s not fair to you, the reader.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086564" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>What I can say definitely, however, is that I do plan to continue using the service beyond these first few days. Perhaps that’s a testament to the product&#8217;s potential. Or maybe it’s just a sign that I’m looking for a way to stop feeling like a wet garbage bag full of room temperature cottage cheese all of the time. The truth, as usual, probably lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Fitness — like anything health related — is a highly personal thing. There has never and likely will never be a kind of one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of working out. And while Fitness+ is the latest, shiny attempt to tackle the issue, that’s certainly the case here as well. The best I can do for you right now is discuss my own personal needs and experiences. Some will likely sound familiar, others not.</p>
<p>My biggest fitness hurdles are: time and space. The time bit should be self-explanatory — and familiar to most. Even during a year-long quarantine, there’s somehow never enough of the stuff. Space is mostly — but not entirely — a side effect of my decision to live in New York City on a journalist’s salary.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of variety. Once I find something I like at a particular restaurant, I will continue to order it until I’m sick of it. And that likely won’t be for a while. That’s usually the case with how I work out as well (likely to the detriment of my overall health). Once I discovered that I could tolerate running (and keep the pounds off doing it), I ran until I messed up both of knees.</p>
<p>As I said above, walking long distances across bridges and into different boroughs has been a small but important respite for me during hell year. In doing that, I’ve pretty consistently closed my Apple Watch rings (&#8220;Stand&#8221; can still be a stickler on work days). But while I generally don’t have an issue hitting those goals, switching up how I can get there has been something of a challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086567" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086567" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086567" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg 740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-file.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086567" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Fitness+ does offer some key benefits right off the bat. The first — and arguably most important — is convenience. For $10 a month, you get whatever peace of mind comes with knowing that every Monday, Apple is going to drop a new crop of new workout videos for you every week. That content can be accessed across a number of Apple devices. Namely: the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.</p>
<p>Another thing you should probably know about me (you’re learning all sorts of fun stuff today, right?) is that I’m one of those no TV weirdos, and therefore my own experiences are limited to the iPad and iPhone. There are a number of reasons to go for the Apple TV in this setup, but the most important of all, to be honest, is sheer screen real estate. I found the iPad Air’s 11-inch display was totally acceptable in close range, however.</p>
<p>The iPhone was a lot trickier, on the other hand, when it comes to following the trainers. The upshot of both of these, however, is flexibility. That’s a nice feature when it comes to moving between standing and sitting exercises. The other big upshot will come when we all start traveling again. I can certainly see the appeal of busting out one or two of these workouts in my hotel room, instead of gambling that the elliptical machine will be up and running (about 50/50 in my experience).</p>
<p>For now, at least, Fitness+ doesn’t have its own standalone app. Like other premium services before it, Apple’s snuck it into an update of an existing app — a move that ensures the new paid offering is instantly available on millions of devices starting today. In the iPhone app, it appears as one of three tabs. It always felt a little superfluous to have individual apps for Fitness, Health and Watch, but I suppose that now we know why they’ve kept those things separate. Today also marks the arrival of the standard Fitness app for iPadOS, where Fitness+ is more or less the entire experience.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch is required for the Fitness+ experience. There’s apparently a way to circumvent things if, say, you accidentally forgot your Watch at home or your battery dies or what have you. But on the whole, no watch, no Fitness+. Ecosystem’s gonna ecosystem, friend.</p>
<p>The necessity for this particular piece of hardware makes sense when you consider how deeply integrated it is. The Watch really is the core of the Fitness+ experience. It does its usual job collecting your metrics, which are now also displayed for you in real time on screen as you work out. The primary information at the ready is how far you are into the activity bar and your heart rate — the latter in particular seems like an important piece of information for many. And it is pretty fascinating to watch your numbers climb and drop between intervals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086570" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086570" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2086570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="643" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=680,427 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Honestly, the Apple Watch integration is probably the best-executed aspect of the entire undertaking — down to the way the wearable doubles as a start and stop button for the workout. It also ensures a more complete rundown of your workouts at the end of the day. The truth of a wrist-worn monitor — whether Apple wants to admit it or not — is that it can be hit or miss with full body workouts.</p>
<p>That’s a big part of the reason why the device asks you to start or confirm workout types during normal usage. Give the current sensor technology available for these products, there’s a limit to how precisely you can measure movement. If you’re wearing the Watch and doing pre-selected Fitness+ workouts, on the other hand, the system is able to offer a more complete picture. Collected data is also aggregated into a “Burn Bar,” which will show you roughly where you rank compared to others who have done the exercises (I generally found myself somewhere in the middle). This can be toggled off if you’re not feeling competitive.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there’s really not much in the way of gamification here. The closest Apple’s hand-selected trainers come is the fairly regular encouragement to “close your rings.” It’s tough to strike the balance of motivating without overwhelming. Go too far in either direction and you risk losing people. I’d say on the whole Apple does a decent job striking the balance, down to the fact that there are often three trainers in the videos, each showing you a different level of intensity for the on-screen exercises.</p>
<p>One key thing Apple does lose here, versus both in-person fitness classes and live-streamed ones from the likes of Peloton, is instant feedback. The company has positioned its “on-demand” approach as a way of letting users complete courses at their own pace. In a more ideal world, however, there would be some combination of the two. Apple certainly has the resources to do both — though there’s a fair bit more that goes into live-streaming with real-time bio feedback.</p>
<p>If I had to venture a guess here, I would say that in all likelihood Apple will add live classes at some point. There’s value in having a set appointment you feel obligated to attend. And for all of the Fitness+ trainers’ encouragement that “you’re doing great,” let’s be real: they’re speaking to a camera in a studio for a video that was recorded days — if not weeks — ago.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW I’M DOING!</p>
<p>The variety of exercises on offer is pretty good. I’ve mostly been alternating between Core and HIIT (high intensity interval training). Given that it’s all right there in front of me, I have found myself trying some new stuff. Turns out I still hate dancing in basically all of its forms — but it’s nice to check in every decade or so. The biggest limitation for me (beyond those outlined above) is equipment.</p>
<p>I don’t have a stationary bike or treadmill. I have a kettlebell, but not a complete weight set. I do have a yoga mat, however, which is probably the most common piece of equipment here. Honestly, if you’re thinking of trying Fitness+, I would shell out $25 for a yoga mat. Turns out you can still use it even if you cancel your account. There’s a small description letting you know what equipment is needed below the video. It would be great if Apple added an easie way to filter by equipment, though, given the percentage of workouts that require something.</p>
<p>Ditto for music. Apple really prides itself on the music choices here (and the trainers seems encourage to talk a lot about it). In fact, each course includes an Apple Music playlist of the song choices (ecosystems for the win). I recognize that music choices are every bit as personal as fitness needs, so I know I’m not speaking for everyone when I say the music is, on a whole, mostly bad. As you’d expect.</p>
<p>There are exceptions for different trainers and different exercises, but the selections I mostly encountered in my workouts are more or less the same sort of high energy Top 40 crap you’ve probably already encountered at your gym. If that’s your thing, cool. If not, you’re going to find the alternatives fewer and farther between. I would love if Apple eventually adds an option to toggle off the music or replace it with your own stuff. You can filter by genre within a given exercise category, but for obvious reasons, that&#8217;s going to limit the workout selections in the process.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed a course, a small checkmark will show up in the corner. It sticks around, which is nice if you find something you like, but it would be great if the app more dynamically cycled through things and offered quick reference for what you’ve already done. Again, this is all coming from someone who’s done six or so workouts over three or so days. The app adds customization the more you use it, and I just haven’t been using it long enough.</p>

<p>The overall execution is about as polished as you’d expect from an Apple production, down to the fact that the trainers were taught some sign language for greetings and goodbyes (in addition to closed captioning). Money has been spent on production value and hiring a diverse group of trainers. And certainly you’re getting more consistent quality here than you would just perusing YouTube for random exercises.</p>
<p>Is it worth $10 a month (or $80 a year), though? My main hesitation on that front is that it’s yet another in a seemingly endless pile of monthly fees from the ever-growing subscription economy. It’s significantly cheaper than a gym, obviously. Though the equipment here is very much bring your own, in the case of Apple, and the Watch doesn’t take the place of in-person feedback from classes or even the kind offered on some of the full-body fitness mirrors.</p>
<p>Like I said at the top I plan to keep using the app for the timing being. I’m still wary of the gym and am generally averse to working out in front of others. And thankfully, I live on the first floor, so none of my neighbors are any the wiser about all of the weird jumping around I’ve been doing lately (though my rabbit finds it amusing).</p>
<p>Here in the States, at least, it seems a safe bet we’ve got at least another four, maybe five months of this pandemic left to deal with. For Apple, that means a solid opportunity to get people on board with its new service. For me, it probably means at least that much more time doing squats in front of an iPad &#8212; especially as we&#8217;re heading into some truly cold months here on the eastern seaboard. I&#8217;ll probably check in my progress in a few weeks or months and maybe feel more comfortable calling it a proper review.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it&#8217;s hard to say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> attempted a test flight of its SpaceShipTwo Unity spaceplane on Saturday, but the flight was cut short after the spacecraft detached from its carrier aircraft. A failsafe prevented Unity&#8217;s rocket engines from firing up, because the computer that monitors the rockets somehow lost their connection to the rocket engines themselves, Virgin Galactic revealed on Monday.</p>
<p>The failsafe cut-off meant that both SpaceShipTwo Unity, and the carrier aircraft, along with all pilots on board, returned safely to Earth for a successful landing without incident. But the test flight was meant to go all the way to space, and this would&#8217;ve been a key stage-setting event to clear the way for flying the first actual paying passengers from the company&#8217;s New Mexico spaceport.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has flown to space on two prior occasions, including first in 2018, and then again in 2019. This would&#8217;ve been its first suborbital spaceflight from New Mexico, however, which is a required preparatory step before it can serve commercial customers from it&#8217;s operational base there.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic is now conducting post flight analysis and can so far report that the onboard computer which monitors the propulsion system lost connection, triggering a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor,&#8221; Virgin <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/">shared in a blog post</a> detailing what happened during the test. &#8220;This system, like others on the spaceship, is designed such that it defaults to a safe state whenever power or communication with sensors is lost. The pilots in the spaceship, as well as the engineers and pilots in mission control, are well prepared for any off-nominal results, as they plan and rehearse many potential scenarios during pre-flight simulation practice sessions, including a scenario where the rocket motor does not ignite after release from the mothership.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is obviously not an ideal outcome for the publicly-traded space tourism company, and the market&#8217;s response reflects public investor disappointment. Virgin Galactic&#8217;s CEO Michael Colglazer explained that this test&#8217;s conclusion, while far from nominal, shows that its safety measures are working as designed. He added that they&#8217;ll be continuing to progress with their test flight program, albeit with a re-do of this one before continuing on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The hectic M&amp;A cycle we have seen throughout 2020 continued this weekend when <a href="https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/">Vista Equity Partners</a> announced it was acquiring  <a href="http://pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> for $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>That comes out to $20.26 per share. The company stock closed on Friday at $18.50 per share on a market cap of over $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>With <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pluralsight" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pluralsight">Pluralsight, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vista gets an online training company that helps educate IT professionals including developers, operations, data and security with a suite of online courses. As the pandemic has taken hold, it has breathed new life into EdTech, but even before that, there was a market for upskilling IT Pros online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This trend certainly didn&#8217;t escape Monti Saroya, co-head of the Vista Flagship Fund and senior managing director at Vista. &#8220;We have seen firsthand that the demand for skilled software engineers continues to outstrip supply, and we expect this trend to persist as we move into a hybrid online-offline world across all industries and interactions, with business leaders recognizing that technological innovation is critical to business success,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

<p>As is typical for acquired companies, Pluralsight CEO Aaron Skonnard sees this as a way to grow the company more quickly. &#8220;The global Vista ecosystem of leading enterprise software companies provides significant resources and institutional knowledge that will open doors and help fuel our growth. We’re thrilled that we will be able to leverage Vista’s expertise to further strengthen our market leading position,&#8221; Skonnard said in a statement.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/a-chat-with-pluralsight-founder-aaron-skonnard-on-the-global-move-to-sharpen-tech-skills-through-online-training/">a 2017 interview</a> with TechCrunch&#8217;s Sarah Buhr, Skonnard described the company as an enterprise SaaS learning platform. It goes beyond simply offering the courses by giving professionals in a given category such as developer or IT operations the ability to measure their skills and abilities agains other pros in that category. He saw this assessment capability as a big differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform is ultimately focused on closing the technology skills gap throughout the world,&#8221; Skonnard told Buhr.</p>
<p>Pluralsight, which was founded in 2004, raised over $190 million before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/pluralsight-prices-its-ipo-at-15-per-share-raising-over-300m/">going public in 2018</a>. The company has 1700 employees and over 17,000 customers. The acquisition is subject to standard regular regulatory oversight, but is expected to close in the first half of next year. Once that happens, the company will go private once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update</strong>: It looks like services are<a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> starting to come back again</a>, but with some glitches (such as the address bar in Gmail not working correctly). We&#8217;ve contacted Google for a statement about what happened.</p>
<p>In all, it looks like a huge range of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> services were down for about an hour today. That hour that crossed into business operation times in multiple markets, leading to a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG?p=GOOG&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slight drop in pre-market trading</a> for parent company Alphabet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also an alarming reminder of just how far Google reaches, and how many of our services &#8212; productivity, entertainment, and home/utility &#8212; are tied up with a single, proprietary provider.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Not much more to update yet but we&#8217;re seeing and getting word from others that multiple Google services have gone down. Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Docs, Maps, Adwords and Adsense, Google Pay, Google Home, Nest and Google&#8217;s Chromecast are all experiencing outages, with dozens, even hundreds, of reports we&#8217;ve seen so far coming in from across Europe, the US, Canada, India, South Africa, countries in Central and South America, Australia and likely more.</p>
<p>Downtime site indicators are <a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/gmail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showing big spikes</a> for services dropping starting from around 11.30AM UK time.</p>
<p>Google.com itself appears to still be working, albeit sluggishly. Ditto Chrome.</p>
<p>Some have surmised that it&#8217;s an issue with <a href="http://account.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Accounts</a> &#8212; which is also not working &#8212; although even if you try to sign into Google services incognito they are not working.</p>
<p>So far we aren&#8217;t seeing any explanations for what is going on &#8212; please get in touch if you know something, I&#8217;m on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and do read direct messages and replies. No point in emailing me!</p>
<p>Mainly, though, it&#8217;s an unprecedented failure for a system that has grown to be one of biggest traffic and activity drivers on the internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everybody thought the deal was done — Take-Two was supposed to acquire <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/codemasters" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="codemasters">Codemasters <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201110005649/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-Reaches-Agreement-for-Recommended-Acquisition-of-Codemasters-Group-Holdings-PLC/">nearly $1 billion</a>. Take-Two even reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters. But Electronic Arts crashed the party at the last minute and offered even more money. EA now plans to buy Codemasters for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Sky News <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/games-giant-electronic-arts-gatecrashes-725m-codemasters-takeover-12160582">originally reported</a> that EA was planning a knockout bid. Since then, EA has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201213005036/en/">officially announced</a> that it has reached an agreement with the board of Codemasters.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Codemasters, the British game studio has been around since 1986, making it one of the oldest game studio still operating today. It has developed and published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Codemasters_video_games">dozens of games</a>. In recent years, the company has been focused on racing games across multiple franchises, such as Dirt, Dirt Rally, Formula One, Grid and (of course) Micro Machines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EA is offering to buy Codemasters for £6.04 per share ($7.98) in an all-cash deal. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>EA has had a tumultuous relationship with racing games. It has created the Need for Speed franchise, which is one of the most popular racing franchises. But is has also neglected racing games in recent years, which led to disappointing games.</p>
<p>Similarly, EA has acquired Criterion Games in 2004 — the game studio behind Burnout games. But Criterion Games now mostly work as a secondary studio on Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront games.</p>
<p>Codemasters will be able to take advantage of EA’s distribution resources, including <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play/">EA Play</a>, EA’s subscription service. It positions EA Play as an interesting subscription if you care about racing games.</p>
<p>Take-Two probably didn’t expect to lose the deal, but the company is going to be fine. Take-Two owns Rockstar Games (GTA, Red Dead), Firaxis Games (Xcom, Civilization), 2K Sports (NBA 2K) and a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive#Company_structure">other studios</a>.</p>
<p>2020 has been an important year of video game consolidation. Microsoft has been leading this trend with the acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-set-to-acquire-bethesda-parent-zenimax-for-7-5b/">ZeniMax Media</a>, the parent company of Bethesda, id Software and Arkane. Microsoft also acquired Double Fine Productions, Obsidian Entertainment and Ninja Theory in the past couple of years.</p>

<p>The platform offers parents of preschool children ‘gamified&#8217; educational content and structured lessons available on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The startup will now launch a Classroom feature with learning tracks in five core Kindergarten and Grade 1 courses, including Math, Phonics, Science, Arts, and Logic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the current B2C model, the founders expect in 2021 to offer primary schools and kindergartens IntellectoKids’ platform as an online supplement to support their offline educational process.</p>
<p>IntellectoKids was founded by Mike Kotlov and Andrey Kondratyuk in 2017, who each have three young children.</p>
<p>Kotlov said: &#8220;On the education scene, preschool education is becoming a highly vibrant market. The pandemic showed that preschool kids can effectively consume educational content online and autonomously. Clearly, there is a growing need for this type of product among parents and businesses now; however, once the pandemic is over the online education is here to stay for sure as it has already become intertwined with offline and benefited the overall educational process.”</p>
<p>IntellectoKids says it has more than 2 million installs across North America and Central &amp; Northern Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exoskeleton technology has been one of the more interesting developments in the world of robotics: instead of building machines that replace humans altogether, build hardware that humans can wear to supercharge their abilities. Today, <a href="https://www.germanbionic.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German Bionic</a>, one of the startups designing exoskeletons specifically aimed at industrial and physical applications &#8212; it describes its Cray X robot as &#8220;the world’s first connected exoskeleton for industrial use,&#8221; that is, to help people lifting and working with heavy objects with more power, precision and safety &#8212; is announcing a funding round that underscores the opportunity ahead.</p>
<p>The Augsburg, Germany-based company has raised $20 million, funding that it plans to use to continue building out its business, as well as its technology, both in terms of the hardware and the cloud-based software platform, German Bionic IO, that works with the exoskeletons to optimize them and help them &#8220;learn&#8221; to work better.</p>
<p>The Cray X currently can compensate up to 30 kg for each lifting movement, the company says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“With our groundbreaking robotic technology that combines human work with the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), we literally strengthen the shop floor workers’ backs in an immediate and sustainable way. Measurable data underscores that this ultimately increases productivity and the efficiency of the work done,” says Armin G. Schmidt, CEO of German Bionic, in a statement. “The market for smart human-machine systems is huge and we are now perfectly positioned to take a major share and substantially improve numerous working lives.”</p>
<p>The Series A is being co-led by Samsung Catalyst Fund, a strategic investment arm from the hardware giant, and German investor MIG AG, one of the original backers of BioNtech, the breakthrough company that&#8217;s developed the first Covid-19 vaccine to be rolled out globally.</p>
<p>Storm Ventures, Benhamou Global Ventures (founded and led by Eric Benhamou, who was the founding CEO of Palm and before that the CEO of 3com), and IT Farm all also participated. Previously, German Bionic had only raised $3.5 million in seed funding (with IT Farm, Atlantic Labs, and individual investors participating).</p>
<p>German Bionic&#8217;s rise comes at an interesting moment in terms of how automation and cloud technology are sweeping the world of work. When people talk about the next generation of industrial work, the focus is usually on more automation and the rise of robots to replace humans in different stages of production.</p>
<p>But at the same time, some robotics technologists have worked on another idea. Since we&#8217;re still probably still a long way away unable to make robots that are just like humans but better in terms of cognition and all movements, instead, create hardware that doesn&#8217;t replace, but augments, live laborers, to help make them stronger while still being able to retain the reliable and fine-tuned expertise of those humans.</p>
<p>The argument for more automation in industrial settings has taken on a more pointed urgency in recent times, with the rise of the Covid-19 global health pandemic: factories have been one of the focus points for outbreaks, and the tendency has been to reduce physical contact and proximity to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Exoskeletons don&#8217;t really address that aspect of Covid-19 &#8212; even if you might require less of them as a result of using exoskeletons, you still require humans to wear them, after all &#8212; but the general focus that automation has had has brought more attention to the opportunity of using them.</p>
<p>And in any case, even putting the pandemic to one side, we are still a long way away from cost-effective robots that completely replace humans in all situations. So, as we roll out vaccinations and develop a better understanding of how the virus operates, this still means a strong market for the exoskeleton concept, which analysts (quoted by German Bionic) predict could be worth as much as $20 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>In that context, it&#8217;s interesting to consider Samsung as an investor: the company itself, as one of the world&#8217;s leading consumer electronics and industrial electronics providers, is a manufacturing powerhouse in its own right. But it also makes equipment for others to use in their industrial work, both as a direct brand and through subsidiaries like <a href="http://harman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harman</a>. It&#8217;s not clear which of these use cases interests Samsung: whether to use the Cray X in its own manufacturing and logistics work, or whether to become a strategic partner in manufacturing these for others. It could easily be both.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to support German Bionic in its continued development of world-leading exoskeleton technology,” says Young Sohn, Corporate President and Chief Strategy Officer for Samsung Electronics and Chairman of the Board, Harman, in a statement. “Exoskeleton technologies have great promise in enhancing human’s health, wellbeing and productivity. We believe that it can be a transformative technology with mass market potential.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">German Bionic describes its Cray X as a &#8220;self-learning power suit&#8221; aimed primarily at reinforcing lifting movements and to safeguard the wearer from making bad calls that could cause injuries. That could apply both to those in factories, or those in warehouses, or even sole trader mechanics working in your local garage. The company is not disclosing a list of customers, except to note that it includes, in the words of a spokesperson, &#8220;a </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">big logistics player, industrial producers and infrastructure hubs.&#8221; One of these, the Stuttgart Airport, is highlighted on its site. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p>“Previously, efficiency gains and health promotion in manual labor were often at odds with one another. German Bionic Systems managed to not only break through this paradigm, but also to make manual labor a part of the digital transformation and elegantly integrate it into the smart factory,” says Michael Motschmann, managing partner with MIG in a statement. “We see immense potential with the company and are particularly happy to be working together with a first-class team of experienced entrepreneurs and engineers.”</p>
<p>Exoskeletons as a concept have been around for over a decade already &#8212; MIT developed its first exoskeleton, aimed to help soldiers carrying heavy loads &#8212; <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/exoskeleton-0919.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2007</a>, but advancements in cloud computing, smaller processors for the hardware itself, and artificial intelligence have really opened up the idea of where and how these might augment humans. In addition to industry, some of the other applications have included helping people with knee injuries (or looking to avoid knee injuries!) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/29/roam-debuts-a-robotic-exoskeleton-for-skiers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ski better</a>, and for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/suitx-is-bringing-down-the-price-of-robotic-exoskeletons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medical purposes</a>, although the recent pandemic <a href="https://www.roamrobotics.com/blog/elevate-covid-19-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has put a strain on some of these use cases</a>, leading to indefinite pauses in production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cledara.com/">Cledara</a>, the SaaS purchase and management platform that helps bring greater viability and control over a company&#8217;s sprawling software subscriptions, has raised $3.4 million in additional funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Nauta Capital, with participation from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cledara/">existing investor</a> Anthemis. It comes off the back of the startup growing revenues by 20x in 2020 &#8212; including 7x since August, although Cledara isn&#8217;t breaking out specific numbers.</p>
<p>Founded in July 2018 by Cristina Vila, after she experienced the SaaS management problem first-hand while working at London fintech Dopay, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cledara" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cledara">Cledara <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has developed software to let companies track and manage their SaaS usage and spending, including analytics to help understand if it is money well-spent. Vila has since been joined by co-founder and COO Brad van Leeuwen, who was previously an executive at banking platform Railsbank, which is also a Cledara customer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another Cledara feature is unlimited virtual debit cards to empower employees and outside teams to purchase appropriate SaaS offerings independently. This includes the option for management to approve every purchase before it happens and access real-time updates on what everyone is buying. Part of Cledara’s revenue comes from interchange fees via said card spend, along with employing a SaaS model itself with paid subscriptions.</p>

<p>Counting over 100 customers overall, other businesses using Cledara include Florence.co.uk, Unmind.com, and Butternut Box. To that end, Cledara claims its customers reduce software spend by up to 30%, while saving “hours” of manual admin work each month on things like chasing SaaS invoices, bookkeeping and “complying with GDPR and outsourcing regulations for regulated fintech”.</p>

<p>The product is available in over 20 countries across Europe, including U.K., France, Ireland, Germany and Spain. Meanwhile, Cledara says it will use the new investment to accelerate product growth and for further international expansion, including plans to enter the U.S.</p>
<p>“The continued acceleration of growth means we really need to grow the team: we&#8217;ve had to slow down customer on-boarding in the past month because of bottlenecks,” says van Leeuwen. “We will be growing the team 4x before mid next year across all parts of the business &#8212; support, success, product, engineering, compliance, marketing and sales. This round brings us the funding to do that, and more”.</p>
<p>More than half of those new hires are likely to be in Barcelona, after Cledara opened a Spain office 4 months ago to ensure it can continue to access talent outside of the U.K. post-Brexit.</p>

<p>The Finnish firm on Monday launched the Nokia PureBook X14 laptop in collaboration with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for the Indian market.</p>
<p>The Nokia PureBook X14, which is priced at Indian rupees 59,990 ($815), features a 14-inch full-HD display and is powered by Intel’s 10th generation quad-core i5 processor with up to 4.2GHz turbo speed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The laptop, which ships pre-installed with Windows 10 Home, sports a 512GB NVMe SSD and 8 GB DD4 RAM. This is the second time Nokia has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/25/nokia-thinking-about-dabbling-in-the-laptop-biz/">explored the laptop category</a>. More than 10 years ago, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/10/review-nokia-booklet-3g/">launched the Booklet 3G</a> &#8212; its first and last netbook.</p>
<p>Other specs of PureBook X14 include: 86% screen-to-body ratio and 178-degree viewing angles, matte black finish, Dolby Atmos-powered speakers, Face Unlock with Windows Hello, Intel UHD 620 Graphics that clocks up to 1.1GHz, Bluetooth 5.1, two USB 3.1 ports, one USB 2.0 port, and one USB Type C port as well as dedicated ports for HDMI and ethernet. The Nokie PureBook X14, which weighs about 1.1kg, will last up to 8 hours on a single charge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2086487" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086487" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2086487 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="786" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=680,522 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nokia-laptop-purebook-x14.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2086487" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Nokia / Flipkart</p></div></p>
<p>Flipkart, which has grown its private label and brand ecosystems in recent years, is the design and manufacturing partner for the new laptop. Like it does with Motorola, Flipkart has inked a licensing agreement with the Finnish firm, a representative of Flipkart told TechCrunch. (Think of it as Nokia&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/21/hmd-raises-100-million-to-bring-even-more-nokia-phones-to-market/">partnership with HMD Global</a> for smartphones.)</p>
<p>The laptop will be exclusively sold through Flipkart in India, which is also the only market for this particular device.</p>
<p>“Launching the Nokia brand into this new product category is testament to our successful collaboration with Flipkart. We are excited to offer consumers in India a Nokia branded laptop which brings innovation to address a gap in the market, as well as the style, performance and reliability that the Nokia brand is known for, said Vipul Mehrotra, VP for Brand Partnerships at Nokia, in a statement.</p>
<p>The Indian laptop market has attracted several new players in recent years, including smartphone giant Xiaomi, which has launched a range of affordable laptops in the country this year. About 3.4 million PCs shipped in India in the quarter that ended in September, delivering a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP46998720">9.2% year-over-year</a> growth, according to marketing research firm IDC. HP, Lenovo, and Dell commanded over 70% of the market in that quarter, IDC estimated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chinese government is moving to curb the power of some of China&#8217;s most influential internet companies. The country&#8217;s top market regulator <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201214_324336.html">announced</a> Monday that it is fining Alibaba and China Literature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/china-literature-makes-stellar-public-debut/">Tencent&#8217;s e-book spinoff</a>, for failing to report their past acquisition deals for clearance.</p>
<p>The cases involve Alibaba&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/alibaba-intime-2-6-billion/">equity investments in major Chinese mall operator Intown</a> and China Literature&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/tencent-spinoff-china-literature-to-buy-new-classics-media-for-2-2b-in-content-consolidation-play/">acquisition of film studio New Classics Media</a>. The firms are each subject to a fine of 500,000 yuan ($76,000), according to the notice. Though a paltry amount compared to the size of the companies&#8217; multi-billion-dollar deals, the penalty is expected to sound an alarm to other industry players, a spokesperson for the market regulator <a href="http://www.samr.gov.cn/xw/zj/202012/t20201214_324336.html">said</a> at a press conference.</p>

<p>Alibaba has in recent years been expanding into offline retail, in part through aggressive acquisitions. Tencent, which has built up a digital entertainment empire, has similarly invested in outside partners to help broaden its territory.</p>
<p>The companies failed to seek regulatory clearance though neither deal was deemed to be &#8220;excluding or restricting market competition.&#8221; As such, the market authority ordered a fine rather than a breakup in accordance with China&#8217;s anti-trust laws, it said.</p>
<p>China Literature says it is strictly following the regulatory order to work on compliance and clearance requirements. Alibaba cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The merger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/tencent-huya-douyu-merger/">between games streaming giants Huya and Douyu</a>, both Tencent-backed, is also under investigation by the anti-trust regulator.</p>
<p>The Alibaba and China Literature cases mark the first time that China has fined companies structured as &#8220;variable interest entities&#8221; over market concentration violations. The VIE corporate structure is popular among Chinese internet firms for it lets them operate as domestic firms controlled by foreign entities, but the setup is controversial for it has allowed companies to find regulatory loopholes.</p>
<p>The Chinese anti-trust law, which began seeking public comment in January, is currently under revision, the market regulator said at the press event. Last month, the government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">unveiled a set of draft rules</a> specifically targeting monopolistic behavior among internet firms, though regulations are expected to be complicated, as industry experts noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pioneered by WeChat</a> almost four years ago, mini-apps are now common in China and India, and gaining traction in other markets, too. Mini-apps, or lightweight apps designed for integration into host apps, allow smartphone users to access several services through one app, saving them data and storage space. They also give host apps more ways to make revenue. But most mini-app ecosystems are currently tied to a specific app or company. <a href="https://appboxo.com/">Appboxo</a>, a Singapore-based startup, wants to make mini-apps more accessible by allowing any developer to turn their app into a &#8220;super app.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/appboxo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="appboxo">Appboxo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced today it has closed $1.1 million in seed funding, led by FF APAC Scout, a Founders Fund vehicle; 500 Startups’ Southeast Asia-focused 500 Durians fund; Plug and Play Ventures; and Antler. The new funding will be used on product development and to add more mini-apps to Appboxo’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The startup currently works with about 10 host apps, including Booking.com, Klook and Zalora, and has about 80 mini-apps on its platform. Examples of how host apps have used mini-apps include travel apps that added hotel, restaurant and activities bookings; and mobile wallets that integrated insurance-buying and e-commerce services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Appboxo was founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Kaniyet Rayev and chief technology officer Nursultan Keneshbekov while they were participating in Antler’s Singapore incubator program. Rayev told TechCrunch that the two initially wanted to build an all-in-one travel app, with different travel-related services integrated into one platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we actually started developing it, we realized there is no easy way to plug in third-party services,&#8221; Rayev said. They began thinking of ways for developers to create and offer mini-apps as a plug-and-play solution.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s most popular services are becoming super apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/india-super-apps/embed/#?secret=CwcpX05o56" data-secret="CwcpX05o56" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The mini-app economy is currently siloed, with apps or companies like WeChat, ByteDance, Meituan, Paytm, PhonePe, Grab and Go-jek either developing mini-apps for their own use, or running mini-app marketplaces for their users. But last year, the W3C Chinese Web Interest Group started looking at ways to standardize mini-apps. The group, including people from Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, Intel, Xiaomi and China Mobile, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/">published the first working draft of its white paper</a> in September 2019 about how mini-apps can be created to work across platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really perfect time for us to read that paper, because it was around the time we started our platform,&#8221; said Rayev.</p>
<p>Adding mini-apps can increase engagement because users open apps more frequently if they can access different services through it. It also gives app developers more ways to generate revenue through affiliate partnerships, commissions or transactions fees.</p>
<p>But many native app developers simply don’t have the resources to develop their own mini-apps, too, so Appboxo simplifies the process with an SDK that allows them to integrate any of its platform&#8217;s mini-apps. Another barrier for many app developers is working out business and development partnership deals with mini-apps, so AppBoxo helps guide them through the process, too.</p>
<p>Since Appboxo is based in Singapore, a lot of its current users are in Southeast Asia, and it also plans to target India. While mini-apps are less common in Europe and the United States, where most smartphone owners still use apps with one core offering, Rayev said that is starting to change. For example, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/04/uber-eats-uber-eats/">announced</a> it was merging its ride-hailing and food delivery service, Uber Eats, into one app last year, while Snap introduced Minis a few months ago.</p>
<p>AppBoxo already has partners in Europe, and &#8220;the whole super app concept is coming to the Western world,&#8221; Rayev added. &#8220;Hopefully we can find some new partners in the rest of the world as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ola" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ola">Ola <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said on Monday that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Tamil Nadu in India to set up what it claims would be the &#8220;world’s largest scooter manufacturing facility&#8221; in the South Indian state as the Indian ride-hailing firm begins a new push with electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The SoftBank-backed Indian ride-hailing firm said it will invest about $327 million in setting up the factory, which it says would create almost 10,000 jobs and have an initial capacity to produce 2 million electric vehicles in a year.</p>
<p>The move comes as Ola plans to launch and expand its two-wheeler electric vehicles in several markets in the next two quarters, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ola Electric, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/ola-ev-business-ola-electric-mobility/">spun out of the startup last year</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/ola-electric-acquires-etergo-to-launch-own-line-of-electric-two-wheelers-this-year/">acquired Amsterdam-based Etergo earlier this year</a>. The Dutch has a fleet of scooters that uses swappable, high energy battery that delivers a range of up to 240 km (149 miles). The startup plans to replicate production of similar model of vehicles, the person said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ola launched its two-wheeler business, which like the cabs business sees someone drive a passenger around, in 2016 and has created livelihoods for over 300,000 people in India. One of India&#8217;s most valuable startups, Ola has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/ola-bike-150-cities-towns-india/">big bets on two-wheeler in recent years</a> to expand the reach of its services to smaller cities and towns across the country. (Compared to four-wheeler, two-wheeler and three-wheeler offer a much more affordable ride to customers and zip faster in busy traffic.)</p>
<p>In a statement, Ola said the new factory would improve India’s electric vehicle ecosystem and serve customers in Europe, Asia, and Latin American among other markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to announce our plans to set up the world’s largest scooter factory. This is a significant milestone for Ola and a proud moment for our country as we rapidly progress towards realising our vision of moving the world to sustainable mobility solutions across shared and owned mobility. This will be one of the most advanced manufacturing facilities in the world. This factory will showcase India’s skill and talent to produce world class products that will cater to global markets,” said Bhavish Aggarwal, Chairman and Group CEO of Ola, in a statement.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dubsmash/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>, the app has raised $20.2 million from investors including Lowercase Capital, Index Ventures, Eniac Ventures, Heartcore Capital and Sunstone Life.</p>
<p>Dubsmash is now one of TikTok’s biggest rivals, but struggled for several years after a brief stint of popularity in 2015 during its first incarnation as a lip-sync video app. In 2017 it began transforming itself into a social platform and moved its headquarters from Berlin to Brooklyn. By the beginning of this year, Dubsmash’s share of the United States’ short-form video market was second only to TikTok when counted by app installs, and it <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-snap-held-talks-to-buy-tiktok-rival-dubsmash">reportedly held acquisition talks with Facebook and Snap</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

While many of TikTok’s highest-profile stars are white, Dubsmash is known for its large communities of Black and Latinx content creators. The polarization between the two apps began to gain more attention earlier this year, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/style/the-original-renegade.html">the New York Times published a piece</a> about how dance moves by Black Dubsmash stars are frequently appropriated without credit by TikTok influencers, which means their creators miss out on opportunities like larger followings, brand deals and industry connections.</p>
<p>Reddit <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/06/reddit-racism-open-letter/612958/">has its own issues with racism</a>, and has been criticized for not doing enough to stop hate speech or giving moderators of subreddits targeted by racist trolls enough support.</p>
<p>Last year, founder and former chief executive officer Alexis Ohanian called for his position on Reddit’s board to be filled with a Black candidate when he stepped down, which current CEO Steve Huffman said the company would honor as part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/">a larger effort to address hate speech on the platform</a> announced during anti-racism demonstrations after the killing of George Floyd by a police officer. Ohanian’s position was filled by Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel.</p>

<p>In its announcement today, Reddit linked its acquisition of Dubsmash to its inclusion efforts. In it, Huffman said, &#8220;Dubsmash elevates under-represented creators, while Reddit fosters a sense of community and belonging across thousands of different topics and passions. It’s clear that our missions closely align and that our community-focused platforms can coexist and grow as we learn from each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement also said that Dubsmash&#8217;s &#8220;communities are driven by young, diverse creators—about 25 percent of all Black teens in the U.S. are on Dubsmash, and females represent 70 percent of users.&#8221; It added that the integration of Dubsmash&#8217;s video creation tools will enable Reddit’s users to &#8220;express themselves in original and authentic ways that are endemic to our communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/reddit-rolls-out-its-own-video-platform/">launching native videos in 2017</a>, Reddit said usage has increased sharply, growing 2X in 2020 alone. Much of Reddit’s content is still text-based, however, with video, gifs and images often shared from other sources, so Dubsmash’s integration can help Reddit build out its own video platform.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the year ahead, we'll likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations — as well as more lawsuits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When California voters passed Proposition 22 with 58.6% of the vote, they agreed with Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates that gig workers should not be employees who are entitled to myriad labor rights. The proposition they passed stated that gig workers should be independent contractors who receive the limited benefits proposed by those companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first feeling I had was shock, disbelief and hurt,&#8221; Vanessa Bain, a worker-organizer with Gig Workers Collective, told TechCrunch. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t feel good to think that my fellow Californians voted to strip people like myself and my co-workers of our labor rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Prop 22 does not mark the end of the battle of the status of gig workers. Gig workers, lawyers and activists affiliated with Gig Workers Rising, Gig Workers Collective, the National Employment Law Project and the Working Partnerships for Families are all gearing up to redouble their efforts in the New Year. But the same goes for gig companies. Uber and Lyft are ready to take legislation similar to Prop 22 into other parts of the country and the world.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			In the year ahead, we will likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations alike, as well as more lawsuits.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have time for more grieving because as soon as it passed, every company signaled they&#8217;re looking to expand this model to the national level, which means our organizing needs to adjust accordingly,&#8221; Bain said.</p>
<p>So, really, the fight has just begun. In the year ahead, we will likely see lobbying efforts from both gig companies and gig worker organizations alike, as well as more lawsuits.</p>
<hr />
<p>In 2019, the California state legislature passed Assembly Bill 5, which became law in January 2020.</p>
<p>AB 5 mandated that companies apply the ABC test to determine how to classify their workers. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove the worker:</p>
<ul>
<li>A — is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity.</li>
<li>B — performs work outside the scope of the entity’s business, and</li>
<li>C — is regularly engaged in an “independently established trade, occupation or business of the same nature as the work performed.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Many have argued that gig economy companies do not pass the ABC test, while the companies themselves have, of course, argued that they do. As AB 5 made its way through the state legislature, gig companies banded together with their competitors to fight a collective enemy: labor rights for their respective workforces.</p>
<p>In August 2019, Uber and Lyft kicked off that fight with an initial $60 million put toward the ballot measure now known as Prop 22. Between August 2019 and November 2020, that number skyrocketed to around $205 million and brought in contributions from other companies like Postmates (now owned by Uber), Instacart and DoorDash. All that funding makes Proposition 22 the most expensive ballot measure in California since 1999.</p>

<p>On the other side, major donors in opposition of Prop 22 included Service Employees International Union, United Food &amp; Commercial Workers and International Brotherhood of Teamsters. They collectively contributed $15.9 million.</p>
<p>The ballot measure, which goes into effect this month, implements a few key benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>An earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while picking up or dropping off passengers.</li>
<li>30 cents per engaged mile for expenses.</li>
<li>A healthcare stipend.</li>
<li>Occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries.</li>
<li>Automobile accident and liability insurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ahead of the Prop 22 vote, Cherri Murphy, a ride-share driver for Uber and Lyft and lead organizer at Gig Workers Rising, was heavily involved in Gig Workers Rising&#8217;s efforts to combat the millions of dollars tech companies put into ensuring gig workers would be classified as independent contractors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a hell of a fight,&#8221; Murphy told TechCrunch. &#8220;We were up against a $205 million campaign but I still had to believe that we could win.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Mank&#8221; is a change of pace for director David Fincher — instead of exploring the world of startup backstabbing (&#8220;The Social Network&#8221;), political backstabbing (&#8220;House of Cards&#8221;) or actual stabbings (&#8220;Seven,&#8221; &#8220;Zodiac,&#8221; &#8220;Gone Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Mindhunter&#8221; etc.), Fincher takes us back to &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s Hollywood.</p>
<p>Working from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/david-fincher-mank-netflix/">a script by Fincher&#8217;s late father Jack</a>, the movie is shot and edited to pay homage to the classic studio films of that era — especially &#8220;Citizen Kane,&#8221; whose co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (played by Gary Oldman) is the &#8220;Mank&#8221; of the film&#8217;s title.</p>
<p>The story jumps back-and-forth in time, showing how Mank became acquainted — and then disillusioned — with newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) and his mistress Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried), and how he drew on that knowledge while writing &#8220;Kane&#8221; for Orson Welles (Tom Burke).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That might not sound like a particularly dramatic setup for a film — as we acknowledge in the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;Mank&#8221;&#8216;s self-consciously old-fashioned filmmaking and its making-of-a-movie premise can make it feel a bit insider-y, like it&#8217;s footnote to another film.</p>
<p>But ultimately, the movie works whether or not you&#8217;ve seen &#8220;Citizen Kane.&#8221; Fincher captures both the glamor and the ugliness of the studio system, while Oldman delivers a mesmerizing performance as a talented writer who&#8217;s been content to joke and drink away his talent — until he finds himself driven to write one of the greatest movies of all time, which will turn many of his former friends and allies into enemies.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;Mank,&#8221; we also discuss the ambitious streaming plans that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney outlined at its investor day this week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue2LJZFHQMU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The place we’re in, the valley of the dolls between the vote and the Inauguration, is overshadowed by the battle to save our lives. The vaccines look promising, and so does the persistence of the Trumpster to play his games. Somehow we have to live with that, on both sides. In the business we’re in, the technology industry, broadband has penetrated to the point we can survive with a reasonable degree of fidelity to the world COVID erased.</p>
<p>This week’s move by WarnerMedia to release all 2021 pictures on HBO Max and in theaters is both a capitulation to reality and a political gambit to negotiate with theater owners. Disney, with their theme parks and investments in streaming crescendoing in layoffs and rebuilding, announced a mix of 80% streaming with only 20% theatrical. Trump’s TikTok deadline has already passed, and the administration is pretending to not pay attention in order to keep negotiations for a buyout alive. The incoming government talks of a working bromance between Biden and McConnell. It’s the opposite of reality TV, or TV reality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Newsletters straddle mainstream and social media, rolling up links that blur the credibility of publications with the Wild West of uncredentialed freelancers. Some of these voices are playing the newsletter sweepstakes, choosing to move from a salaried position to their own subscription model. For those publications funded in part by a paywall, the transition to a newsletter comes with opportunity and risk. Selling a subscription for a single voice competes with the bundled voices of a paywall publication eventually diluting potential readers’ available funds. We’re seeing this same subscription saturation dynamic in the rise of streaming networks.</p>
<p>Another trend, notification-based news, is making inroads with live streaming over social networks. The pandemic has forced many students into working from home over Zoom for interactive sessions mixed with traditional lecture-type webinars. Events normally covered by trade publications have yielded at least for now to influencer and analyst driven watch parties. Podcasts forego subscription and advertiser revenue for lead generation and industry traction. The 24/7 nature of work from anywhere fights for eyelid time with binge viewing, listening, and reading.</p>
<p>Beyond the virus’s impact on audiences, the productions themselves have new challenges. The FX series Fargo ceased production in March, as did ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy. When you see the completed shows, it’s fascinating to try and guess which scenes were shot under the much tighter strictures of the fall. Grey’s Anatomy used the pandemic as a plot point, but it took a few shows for the actors to settle into a more relaxed rhythm. Pre-pandemic footage from the abbreviated series’ previous season lived uncomfortably alongside the new material to cover the transitional story line.</p>
<p>Citizen Kane, considered broadly as the best film Hollywood ever made, spawned a Netflix production about the author of the screenplay, one Herman J. Mankiewicz. Presented in black and white with Kane-like musical scoring and the original film’s innovations in deep focus photography and low angle shots that include the ceilings of sets, the story uses flashbacks and time-jumping to great effect. It’s streaming meets MGM’s catch phrase from the time: All the stars in the heavens. Director David Fincher tells the New York Times how he overshoots by 20% the number of pixels so he can post process and polish the rough edges and camera jiggles into a precise reflection of the intricate vision of his cinema universe.</p>
<p>40 years ago this week John Lennon was murdered by a troubled fan. I was watching Monday Night football when Howard Cosell broke in with the news. What was left of my childhood vanished in that moment. I was newly divorced, struggling to keep my momentum going, no idea of what our world would become, and stupid with sadness over someone I’d never met. The Beatles was this magic machine, a coalition of the fleeting imperfection of the group and the unifying perfection of what they had accomplished.</p>
<p>The days tick by. The vaccine trucks roll. The Supreme Court denies another desperate move to overturn the will of the people. Nobody told me there’d be days like these. Strange days indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to Human Capital, where I break down the latest in diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor in tech. This week, Twitter dropped its latest diversity report and Tesla released its first one ever. Meanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai apologized for the way things went down with Dr. Timnit Gebru, a prominent researcher in artificial intelligence ethics.</p>
<p>Sign up here to get this as a weekly newsletter in your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m.</p>
<p><b>Google’s Sundar Pichai will investigate events that led up to Dr. Timnit Gebru’s exit</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of artificial intelligence researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru’s exit from Google last week, Google </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/google-ceo-says-company-will-review-events-leading-up-to-dr-timnit-gebrus-departure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Sundar Pichai sent a memo to staffers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/sundar-pichai-memo-timnit-gebru-exit-18b0efb0-5bc3-41e6-ac28-2956732ed78b.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained by Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying the company would investigate “the circumstances that led up to Dr. Gebru’s departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pichai’s memo, he said the company needs to “accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent Black, female leader with immense talent left Google unhappily.” He also noted how it’s had a “ripple effect” through underrepresented communities at Google.</span></p>
<p>In response, <a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1336777379730116615">on Twitte</a>r, Gebru said she didn&#8217;t see any plans for accountability. Instead, she said she saw &#8220;further gaslighting.&#8221; In an <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/10/timnit-gebru-googles-dehumanizing-memo-paints-me-as-an-angry-black-woman/">interview with Venture Beat, </a>Gebru said Pichai&#8217;s memo is &#8220;dehumanizing&#8221; and makes her &#8220;sound like an angry Black woman.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>They paint me as this angry Black woman because they put you in this terrible workplace, and if you speak up about it, then you become a problem, and then they start talking about de-escalation strategies.</p>
<p>You write emails, they get ignored. You write documents, and they get ignored. Then you discuss how it’s being done and then they talk about you as if you’re like some angry Black woman who needs to be contained.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>More Black women and Latinas are founding startups, according to Project Diane</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018, the number of Black women and Latina founders doubled from 334 startups to more than 650, </span><a href="https://www.projectdiane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Project Diane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These women have also raised more money than they did in 2018, but they’re still raising less than the national average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Black women and Latina founders raised $3.1 billion compared to just $1 billion in 2018. Still, the median seed round for Black women is $125,000 and $200,000 for Latina founders, while the national median seed is $2.5 million.</span></p>
<p><b>Tesla finally released a diversity report</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla released its first-ever diversity report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, showing the company is 34% white, 22% Hispanic, 10% Black, 21% Asian and 7% “additional groups” in the United States. Those breakdowns are not bad, but it’s worth noting Tesla employs many of those folks in its factories, which are </span><a href="https://qz.com/1756552/tesla-workers-report-a-racist-work-environment-at-new-york-factory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notoriously</span></a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">problematic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and have been the subject of allegations around racism and discrimination.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the leadership level, Tesla is 59% white, 25% Asian, 4% Black and 4% Hispanic. Just 1% of those in leadership roles are from “additional groups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Tesla’s gender diversity is objectively bad. Men account for 79% of Tesla’s overall workplace and 83% of its leaders in the United States.</span></p>
<p><b>Twitter shows slight improvement in latest diversity report</b></p>
<p><a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/tweep-life/diversity.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter released its latest quarterly diversity report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing an increase in the representation of women, Black, Latinx and multiracial employees across the whole company. Additionally, representation of women and Black people increased at the leadership level. Despite those gains, Twitter is still 56.7% male and 41% white. </span></p>
<p><b>Uber wants drivers and delivery workers to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccine</b></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/uber-wants-drivers-and-delivery-workers-to-get-priority-access-to-covid-19-vaccine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all 50 governors asking them to prioritize giving drivers and delivery workers the vaccine as essential workers. In the letter, Khosrowshahi argues that the work of drivers and delivery people has become essential. That&#8217;s why Uber wants them to get the vaccine &#8220;quickly, easily and for free,&#8221; he wrote in the letter. Additionally, Uber has offered to help share information about the vaccine and encouraging those who are eligible to get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><b>Apple was reportedly complicit in violating Chinese labor laws</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three former Apple Supplier Responsibility employees </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-turned-blind-eye-to-supplier-breaches-of-chinese-labor-laws?utm_content=article-5108&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently said the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did nothing when its suppliers violated the temporary worker labor law in China. That law required that no more than 10% of a factory’s workforce be temporary workers. According to The Information, Apple didn’t take action because it was worried about an increase in costs, a drain on resources and delays in product launches. </span></p>

<div class="newsletter__block__body">
<div class="newsletter__block__body-text">
<p>Welcome to the depths of December, a time in which the news cycle should be slowing down. Instead it’s accelerating, giving me the firm worry that our holiday cycle is going to be mostly work this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, we have no time for my usual bullshitting, so let’s get right to work.<b> First up: How to find your next venture capitalist.</b></p>
<p>There’s a VC firm called <a href="https://www.newstack.vc/">New Stack</a> that focuses on leading first institutional rounds into startups that are not based in San Francisco and New York. As you can imagine, part of its job is helping its portfolio companies — <a href="https://www.newstack.vc/#portfolio">here</a>, in case you wanted to peek — find their next investor.</p>
<p>So, New Stack’s Nate Pierotti tells The Exchange, his team crafts next-round plans with their portfolio companies so that the startups can avoid wasting time when they go out to raise a new round. Per Pierotti, these plans are popular with both founders and VCs alike.</p>
<p>A bit ago New Stack asked around 400 founders what their venture pain points are, an exercise that I presume many VCs execute to better understand their market. Something that came out of the study was that many founders wanted help finding their next investor.</p>
<p>In light of the results, New Stack decided to help, putting together a public version of their next-round tool. It’s called Venture Rank, and <a href="https://www.vc-rank.com/">you can check it out here</a>. If you tell it about your startup, it will suggest some funds to talk to, with over 1,700 in its database.</p>
<p>Why bring all this up? Aside from always looking for an excuse to cover Midwest startup activity, we spend a lot of time in this newsletter talking about companies busy leaving their venture capital days behind them. Here was a chance to talk about a resource that founders still in the venture mix can actually use.</p>

What follows presumes you are read-up.</p>
<p>To kick off Market Notes this weeks, some Market News: <a href="https://www.braze.com/">Braze</a> has grown 60% during the first three quarters of its fiscal year.</p>
<p>Sadly, while the New York-based customer engagement software startup joined the $100 million ARR club <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/13/the-newest-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">just under a year ago</a>, we can’t just say that it’s at $160 million ARR today. Why not? The company has moved to counting GAAP revenue instead of ARR, so its growth number doesn’t correspond to the old metric.</p>
<p>And the time period for the 60% figure ran from February 2020 through October (it’s common for SaaS companies to start their fiscal year after January so that their fourth quarters don’t wrap up right after Christmas). But I <i>would not</i> be surprised if <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/braze" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="braze">Braze <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was at an ARR mark of $160 million or more.</p>
<p>According to its CEO, Bill Magnuson, the company has not raised funds since its October 2018-era Series E worth $80 million. The startup has been growing quickly, without the need to take on more capital to fund its growth.</p>
<p>What impact has COVID-19 had on the company? Magnuson said that Braze was probably ahead of its pre-COVID plan, but that it has re-forecasted on a rolling basis this year as the economy has changed. On the customer front, the CEO said that growth may have been similar without COVID, but different. He used an analogy of a balloon, COVID squeezed some parts of the balloon — market sectors in our analogy — but also enlarged some other parts of the balloon at the same time. Same balloon volume post-COVID, but a different market shape.</p>
<p>Is the move to GAAP indicative of a move towards an IPO? Not really, Magnuson said. Braze likes to compare its results to those of other companies to see how it can improve and where, he added, so having standard metrics helps.</p>
<p>But let’s be clear: Braze is big enough to go public, doesn’t burn that much money, and is watching companies go out at nigh-comical multiples. Surely the temptation is there.</p>
<p>And speaking of IPOs, let’s talk about a few. I got on the horn with a different players from the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbnb">Airbnb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and DoorDash debuts this week, which I have condensed to their respective key points for today in the honor of space:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Why DoorDash’s CFO is bullish on post-pandemic consumer demand:</b> Talking to Prabir Adarkar was good fun as he is both voluble and limpid. That is an excellent combination in a person from which you hope to learn something. I wanted to know what DoorDash was thinking about post-pandemic demand for food delivery. I have a slightly pessimistic take. Adarkar, as you expected, is more bullish. After discussing how the company’s huge IPO will provide the company with a cushion as it looks to more deeply penetrate the food market, and expand into new verticals, we got around to the point. The CFO argued that once users have downloaded the DoorDash app and used it a few times, it’s very sticky. He expects that stickiness to persist even after COVID-19 is behind us. And, he added, more restaurants have joined in the last few months, so the service has itself improved. That could help keep users engaged when they are allowed outside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Why Airbnb’s chief strategy officer (CSO) is bullish on post-pandemic consumer demand:</b> Nathan Blecharczyk, one of Airbnb’s founders and CSO, talked The Exchange through his company’s post-pandemic demand thesis. First, travel will return as soon as people are allowed to go outside. That’s good for Airbnb. And, he said, Zoom is not going away — people may take a long weekend in an Airbnb and work the Friday and relax during the weekend, for example. With international travel coming back, and a cultural shift toward remote work, Airbnb could wind up with a larger marker in 2021 than it had in 2019. We’ll see.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sequoia partner Alfred Lin on this week’s IPO pricing and results:</b> Finally from our call log, an investor. Sequoia was in both DoorDash and Airbnb, with Lin on the board of each. We chatted a bit about the IPOs, a convo from which something stood out. Lin explained, in response to my questions about the extreme prices that some IPOs were commanding after their debuts, that Airbnb had been expensive during its private life, as well. You have to pay up sometimes for the standouts, the argument seemed to go. From a venture perspective, I vibe with the point. From a public investor perspective, I understand it less. But that’s why the stock market is fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we catch up on some small things, after I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/okr-focused-koan-raises-1m-adds-free-tier/">OKR-focused Koan raising another $1 million</a>, OKR-focused <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally.io</a> — <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">which I have written about before</a> — reached out with some data on its growth. A sucker for such information, here’s the gist: Ally grew its revenues 3.3x in 2020, adding 500 customers in the process and seeing 145 expansions from existing customers. Ally cited a need for more planning tools for a hybrid (office and remote) working world as a driver of demand. Koan declared a similar situation as its impetus for releasing a free tier of its software.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">OKR market was hot earlier this year</a>. I suppose it still is.</p>

<p>Alright. In no particular order, here are some very interesting things from this week that I could not write whole posts about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denver-based <a href="https://range.vc/">Range Ventures</a> has put together a $23 million fund. Why do we care? It’s focused on Denver. I did not know that the Denver scene was mature enough to warrant its own firm. I suppose I am behind on this one.</li>
<li>Brazilian software company <a href="https://www.intelipost.com.br/en/">Intelipost</a> raised $32 million this week, led by Riverwood Capital. E-commerce and logistics are hot in 2020, and Intelipost does both. This is one to keep an eye on.</li>
<li>Chicago’s <a href="https://cardr.com/">CarDr</a> raised $5 million in what it calls “launch and seed funding” from Red Fort Capital. The startup uses AI to help its team execute car diagnostics — hence, calling itself Car Doctor. According to the company, it sells to consumers, dealers, and banks alike. And the startup has earmarked about 75% of its new capital for engineering expenses, which implies that it has lots more to build in the future (a good thing, mind.) On the economics front, the company told The Exchange that it has good margins, but that they work out to be slightly lower than some SaaS companies due to the cost of AI computing time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/21/do-ai-startups-have-worse-economics-than-saas-shops/">We’ve written about that</a>!</li>
<li>API-security focused <a href="https://salt.security/">Salt Security</a> raised $30 million this week. I am a dork for all things API, so to see the API-security space raise this much in a single round caught my attention. Sequoia led the Series B. Salt raised a $20 million Series A in June. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">The trend of two rounds in 2020 continues</a>!)</li>
<li>A startup named <a href="https://www.beyondidentity.com/">Beyond Identity</a> raised $75 million this week. I am at a loss regarding what “passwordless” identity means, but I hope it works, as I constantly need to update my Okta password, which makes me sad.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adaventures.com/">Ada Ventures</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ada-ventures-closes-first-fund-at-50m-investing-in-diverse-founders-tacking-societys-problems/">closed a $50 million fund</a>. The European group intends “to invest in diverse founders tacking societal problems.” Hard to not be into that mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it’s time to put on some heavy metal, play Civ 6, and not think about news for a bit.</p>

<p>Maybe it is a stock market bubble, or a tech-stock bubble at least. And maybe DoorDash, Airbnb and C3.ai and their bankers should have priced higher regardless to take advantage of all of the enthusiasm. It&#8217;s hard to avoid reactions like that, after DoorDash, for example, doubled its final private share price to $102 for its public debut on Wednesday — only to see the price climb to $175 at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Or maybe none of this will matter, because the future is way bigger and the companies are going to get there regardless. That&#8217;s what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/early-doordash-investor-dismisses-froth-talk-says-company-could-grow-10x-from-here/">Saar Gur tells Connie Loizos</a> this week about DoorDash, which he had invested in many years ago:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>I actually started my career at Lehman Brothers on the investment banking team, and so having seen the IPO process, while I can appreciate [frustration that a] company left some money on the table based on the pricing, the tactical challenge [is that] it’s very hard to predict. You know what the market will bear once it moves to retail investors.</p>
<p>What’s exciting to me is [that] DoorDash is raising money because they are just getting started. I do think this could be a $500 billion-plus company. There’s so much to be excited about. As for the capital-raising event, I think it’s hard for the bankers to know where it will land with the broader market, so I’m not as negative as maybe some others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the blow-by-blow coverage of the craziest tech IPO week in the craziest (IPO) year in decades, resuming from where I left off last Friday:</p>

<h2>Meet Natasha Mascarenhas, your future Startups Weekly newsletter author</h2>
<p>The year is coming to a close for my time writing this newsletter, too. I&#8217;m going to be returning full-time to my regular job editing Extra Crunch and stuff in the back offices here at TechCrunch virtual HQ. My colleague <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/natasha-mascarenhas/">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> will be taking over starting next week.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in good hands. In fact you may have noticed many of her articles and her weekly contributions to Equity showing up here already. Since joining us from Crunchbase News earlier this year, she&#8217;s been covering early-stage startups and the San Francisco tech scene in general, with a big focus on edtech. We have a lot more planned across Equity, Extra Crunch and more, and she&#8217;ll be able to tie it all together around her daily coverage. Stay tuned for an action-packed 2021 (and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow her on Twitter in the meantime</a>).</p>

<h2>How to bootstrap to $200m+ in revenue</h2>
<p>Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/how-one-company-reached-revenues-of-200m-without-vc-money/">hears from one startup founder</a> who has taken a bit of an alternative approach to building a SaaS company. Here&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now north of $200 million in revenue, [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nextiva" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="nextiva">Nextiva</a>] is a quiet giant and, notably, has not taken venture capital funding along its path to scale. Chatting with CEO and co-founder Tomas Gorny, I got to dig a little under the skin of the company’s history. It goes a little something like this: After moving to California in 1996 at the age of 20, Gorny eventually founded a web hosting company in 2001 after working for tech companies during the dot-com boom. The web hosting company wound up selling to another company <a href="https://www.pehub.com/endurance-buys-ipower/">called Endurance International in 2007</a>, which sold as a combined entity for around a billion dollars in 2011, later going public before <a href="https://clearlake.com/endurance-international-group-announces-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-l-p-for-9-50-per-share/">being taken private</a> last month for $3 billion — you can read this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/weebly-web-host-endurance/">TechCrunch piece that mentions Endurance from 2010</a> for a bit of the historical record.</p>
<p>Gorny founded Nextiva in 2008, focused on what it describes today as “UcaaS,” or unified communications as a service. The startup grew to about $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), at which point it ran into issues with a third-party system that would integrate hardware, and support and services software, which sparked a shift in its thinking. The company set out to build a platform.</p>
<p>Nextiva expanded horizontally, adding CRM software, analytics and other functionality to its broader suite as it scaled. And it grew efficiently; starting with money from its founding team, Gorny told TechCrunch that even if he had used someone else’s money, he would have built the company in the same manner.</p></blockquote>

<h2>So why does TechCrunch cover so many early-stage funding rounds, anyway?</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/3-views-on-the-future-of-the-funding-round-story/">Natasha&#8217;s take</a>, from a little explainer we did this week following some Twitter conversations:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reason I love writing about tech and do the sometimes formulaic funding-round story is because I meet people who are crazy enough to bet their entire legacy on a napkin-stage idea. That’s the story, and the surprise and the tension. The dollar sign is just the first way in.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having raised fundings that got covered in TechCrunch, and having written many many funding round articles over the year, I agree. The funding round is often the only way to prove that you have traction, if you are trying to get more attention.</p>

<h2>The Klarna founding story</h2>
<p>Swedish fintech decacorn Klarna pioneered new ways for users to buy online without credit cards over the decade, and is now battling rivals large and small across the world. How did it all happen? Steve O&#8217;Hear sits down with founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Sebastian Siemiatkowski for an exclusive in-depth interview</a> that Extra Crunch subscribers have been eating up this week. Here&#8217;s his description:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a wide-ranging interview, Siemiatkowski confronts criticisms head on, including that Klarna makes it too easy to get into debt, and that buy now, pay later needs to be regulated. We also discuss Klarna’s business model and the balancing act required to win over consumers and keep merchants onside.</p>
<p>We also learn how, under his watch and as the company began to scale, Klarna missed the next big opportunity in fintech, instead being usurped by Adyen and Stripe. Siemiatkowski also shares what’s next for the company as it ventures further into the world of retail banking after gaining a bank license in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a painfully fascinating excerpt from Siemiatkowski:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the drawbacks that we had at the company was that none of the three co-founders had any engineering background; we couldn’t code. We were connected to five engineers that by themselves were amazing engineers, but we had a slight misunderstanding. Their idea was that they were going to come in, build a prototype, ship it, and then leave for 37% of the equity. Our understanding was that they were going to come in, ship it, and if it started scaling they would stay with us and work for a longer period of time. This is the classic mistake that you do as a startup.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Those Facebook antitrust lawsuits</h2>
<p>It seems that the US government has finally had enough of Facebook&#8217;s aggressive expansion and acquisition practices. After years of light regulation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">the Federal Trade Commission and</a>, separately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">49 state attorneys general</a> are suing to break up social networking company. You can find lots of commentary about the details on TechCrunch and elsewhere.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my take for you to remember, as you watch headlines about this continue into next year: Facebook was always ready. I covered the company closely during its early years, and even back then it was talking about being <em>the</em> operating system for the internet, like Microsoft Windows was for desktop. The implied and whispered goal was to get as big as possible before regulations inevitably hit, like what Microsoft did. Here we are, with Facebook in a leading market position, with a massive army of lawyers who have been preparing for years. Without getting further into the lawsuits or political landscape where it&#8217;s all happening&#8230; I don&#8217;t expect a breakup. But maybe new restrictions on acquisitions or something could limit growth potential? Its big wins this decade have been from acquisitions.</p>
<p>One boring scenario I don&#8217;t see discussed much is simply that its products remain the phone book of the era for much of the world. Somewhat regulated this way or that way in various jurisdictions and banned outright in some — and very big and successful still.</p>

<p><em>What a week, yeah? Instead of the news cycle slowing as the year races to a close, things are still as hot as ever. We have funding rounds big and small, IPOs, first-day extravaganza and more.</em></p>
<p><em>Luckily we had the whole crew around — <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">me</a>. Here’s the rundown:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Career Karma <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">raised $10 million</a>, and we have thoughts and concerns.</em></li>
<li><em>Skyflow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">raised $17.5 million</a> in an effort to try to get the Equity team to understand the nuances of different encryption types.</em></li>
<li><em>Calm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/">raised $75 million</a>, which felt pretty reasonable given reports and its fundraising history.</em></li>
<li><em>Squire <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/squire-series-c/">tripled its valuation</a> in a new round that included $45 million in equity capital along with some debt.</em></li>
<li><em>We also talked about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">DoorDash and C3.ai IPO pops</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/airbnb-said-to-price-ipo-between-67-and-68/">where Airbnb priced</a>, and who is coming next.</em></li>
<li><em>We rounded off with what’s up with TikTok stars investing in tech startups. Danny was not a fan.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>And that’s that! If you aren’t tired, have you even been paying attention?</em></p>
