										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.unit21.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities with its no-code software, announced today it has raised $34 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round values San Francisco-based Unit21 at $300 million and comes nine months after the startup raised a $13 million Series A that included investments from the founders of Plaid, Chime and Shape Security as well as former Venmo COO Michael Vaughan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICONIQ Capital and existing backers Gradient Ventures (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s AI venture fund)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, A.Capital and South Park Commons participated in the latest funding event. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ormer Affirm product manager Trisha Kothari and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">larence Chio founded Unit21 in 2018 with the goal of giving risk, compliance and fraud teams a way to fight financial crime via a “secure, integrated, no-code platform.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174139" style="width: 244px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174139" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2174139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="234" height="351" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg 3721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unit21</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say they started Unit21 based on the belief that the existing model of “black box” machine learning used for fraud prevention and detection was flawed. Their idea was to develop an alternative system to provide risk and compliance teams with more control over their operations. Unit21 describes its core technology as a “flag-and-review” toolset designed to give non-technical operators and <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/us-and-uk-regulators-take-lead-on-aml-fines-for-2019/">anti-money laundering (AML) teams</a> the ability to “easily” write complex statistical models and deploy customized workflows without having to involve their engineering teams. Unit21 says it provides this toolset to companies with the aim of helping them mitigate fraud and money laundering risks through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, transaction monitoring detection and suspicious activity report (SAR) case management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21 has built up an impressive customer base of over 50 enterprise clients, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chime, Intuit, Coinbase, Gusto, Flywire, Wyre and Twitter, among others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company says it has monitored more than $100 billion in activity via its API and dashboard since its 2018 inception. It also says that it has saved more than 20 million users over $100 million in fraud loss/suspicious activity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only revenue grew by “12x” in 2020 compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data is the most important weapon in the fight against fraud and money laundering,” Kothair said. “This funding will support our mission to democratize data and make it more accessible to  operations teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use its new capital in part toward expanding its engineering, research &amp; development and go-to-market  teams. As of late June, Unit21 had 53 employees, up from 12 at the same time last year. The startup also plans evolve its platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for generalized flag + review use cases beyond financial crimes and fraud. It’s also eyeing expansion in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) and Europe/Middle East (EMEA) markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Partner John Curtius said Unit21 is transforming organizations’ ability to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyze data to its advantage for risk management and compliance.”</span></p>
<p>The space is a hot one with a number of other fraud-prevention companies raising capital in recent months including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/fraud-prevention-platform-sift-raises-50m-at-over-1b-valuation-eyes-acquisitions/">Sift</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/fraud-prevention-platform-seon-raises-a-12m-series-a-round-led-by-creandum/">Seon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/feedzai-raises-200m-at-a-1b-valuation-for-ai-tools-to-fight-financial-fraud/">Feedzai</a>. According to<a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/surveys-and-benchmarking/report-fines-against-financial-institutions-hit-104b-in-2020/29869.article"> Compliance Week</a> (citing analysis by Fenergo), f<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">inancial institutions were hit with an estimated $10.4 billion in global fines and penalties related to anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), data privacy, and MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) regulations in 2020, bringing the total to $46.4 billion for those types of breaches since 2008.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.fenergo.com/press-releases/global-financial-institution-fines-for-aml-data-privacy-and-mifid-rise-26-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, spanning up to its release date of Dec. 9, said there has been 198 fines against financial institutions for AML, KYC, data privacy, and MiFID deficiencies, representing a 141% increase since 2019.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://opaque.co/">Opaque</a>, a new startup born out of Berkely&#8217;s <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISELabs</a>, announced a $9.5 million seed round today to build a solution to access and work with sensitive data in the cloud in a secure way, even with multiple organizations involved. Intel Capital led today&#8217;s investment with participation by Race Capital, The House Fund and FactoryHQ.</p>
<p>The company helps customers work with secure data in the cloud while making sure the data they are working on is not being exposed to cloud providers, other research participants or anyone else, says company president Raluca Ada Popa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is we use this very exciting hardware mechanism called Enclave, which [operates] deep down in the processor &#8212; it&#8217;s a physical black box &#8212; and only gets decrypted there. [&#8230;] So even if somebody has administrative privileges in the cloud, they can only see encrypted data,&#8221; she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder Ion Stoica, who was a co-founder at Databricks, says the startup&#8217;s solution helps resolve two conflicting trends. On one hand, businesses increasingly want to make use of data, but at the same time are seeing a growing trend toward privacy. Opaque is designed to resolve this by giving customers access to their data in a safe and fully encrypted way.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=H7qbQvLiw9" data-secret="H7qbQvLiw9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company describes the solution as &#8220;a novel combination of two key technologies layered on top of state-of-the-art cloud security—secure hardware enclaves and cryptographic fortification.&#8221; This enables customers to work with data &#8212; for example to build machine learning models &#8212; without exposing the data to others, yet while generating meaningful results.</p>
<p>Popa says this could be helpful for hospitals working together on cancer research, who want to find better treatment options without exposing a given hospital&#8217;s patient data to other hospitals, or banks looking for money laundering without exposing customer data to other banks, as a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Investors were likely attracted to the pedigree of Popa, a computer security and applied crypto professor at UC Berkeley and Stoica, who is also a Berkeley professor and co-founded Databricks. Both helped found RISELabs at Berkeley where they developed the solution and spun it out as a company.</p>
<p>Mark Rostick, vice president and senior managing director at lead investor Intel Capital says his firm has been working with the founders since the startup&#8217;s earliest days, recognizing the potential of this solution to help companies find complex solutions even when there are multiple organizations involved sharing sensitive data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises struggle to find value in data across silos due to confidentiality and other concerns. Confidential computing unlocks the full potential of data by allowing organizations to extract insights from sensitive data while also seamlessly moving data to the cloud without compromising security or privacy,” Rostick said in a statement</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Opaque bridges the gap between data security and cloud scale and economics, thus enabling inter-organizational and intra-organizational collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> aims to fix the problem with superficial dating apps, where users primarily make decisions based on how someone looks in their photos. Instead of swiping through profiles, SwoonMe&#8217;s idea is to use a combination of avatars and audio to encourage users to connect based on someone&#8217;s personality, not their appearance.</p>
<p>To use the app, you take a selfie which SwoonMe converts into an avatar. This is what others will see when they come to your profile. You then record a voice clip to tell others about yourself and what you&#8217;re looking for in a partner. You&#8217;ll also answer a few questions &#8212; like whether you&#8217;re looking for marriage or something more casual and what your <a href="https://www.5lovelanguages.com/">love language</a> is (e.g. physical touch, gifts, words of affirmation, etc.), among other things.</p>
<p>The result is that when people scroll through SwoonMe, they&#8217;re not making snap decisions based on what they&#8217;re seeing, but are rather making more thoughtful decisions based what they hear. When two people match, the app encourages them to continue to get to know each other using voice messages and soon, icebreaker games &#8212; not texting and photo-sharing. As they communicate, their avatar will slowly unveil their real photo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173606" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173606" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173606" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SwoonMe</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for SwoonMe comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvigupta773/">Tanvi Gupta</a>, a former Facebook product specialist who was involved with a number of high-profile products, including those that shipped in Messenger and in Instagram Direct, such as Messenger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/facebook-messenger-reactions/">reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/facebook-messenger-simple-redesign/">a Messenger redesign</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/chat-heads-comes-to-facebook-messenger-for-android-works-across-apps-even-without-facebook-home/">chat heads</a> on Android, and more. This experience taught her a lot about launching new products built from scratch, and helping them to find product market fit, she says.</p>
<p>But Gupta decided to build SwoonMe because of her own personal struggles with modern-day dating apps, where men who messaged her immediately wanted to share selfies and meet her without having read anything on her profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dating world always felt super-indexed on looks, given the proliferation of apps like Tinder and Bumble,&#8221; Gupta explains. &#8220;And what I felt was they were not solving my personal need for somebody who wants to connect for a long-term relationship,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Gupta began work on SwoonMe during the pandemic, when the market was hungry for new ways to connect people online &#8212; a trend that had led the to the launch of audio apps like Clubhouse, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">and</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">later</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">its</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">many</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">clones</a>. The founder says she was also inspired by Clubhouse, as it demonstrated the potential in audio-based social networking, including how it could be used for more personal connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms like Clubhouse have shown that taking video and looks out of the equation allow people to lean into actual topics,&#8221; Gupta says. &#8220;It creates new levels of intimacy and interaction, and we&#8217;re basically trying to capture this with SwoonMe, but in the dating world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though SwoonMe isn&#8217;t necessarily limited only to people looking for relationships, it may initially appeal to that demographic because it requires a bit more time and focus to listen to soundbites and engage in audio-based messaging. This experience would be more likely to attract someone who is taking dating more seriously, not someone in search of a quick hookup or causal connection.</p>

<p>SwoonMe is not the first social app to use avatars instead of photos, however. Avatar-based social discovery apps have been popular in other markets in Asia and in Brazil, but have yet to make their way to the U.S. That may soon change, though, as Tinder parent Match Group this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Seoul-based social app maker Hyperconnect</a> — its biggest acquisition ever at $1.73 billion. AR-powered avatars are a part of the app portfolio that came with the deal.</p>
<p>The startup is also not the first dating app to take the idea of the &#8220;face reveal&#8221; &#8212; a somewhat gimmicky <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-doing-a-face-reveal">concept</a> popularized by online creators &#8212; into the world of dating. There are a number of voice-based based apps on the app stores today, which have seen varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>In February, for example, an app called Jigsaw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">raised</a> $3.7 million for its own so-called &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating app that places puzzle pieces over users&#8217; faces which can only be removed after a pre-set amount of in-app engagement. But in Jigsaw&#8217;s case, the puzzle pieces were to be applied over full body photos, and it had banned selfies. That means the app was doing the opposite of what it proposes. Instead of encouraging daters to ignore images, some users were likely making decisions based on what someone&#8217;s <em>body</em> looked like in their photo with their face <em>removed</em>. That&#8217;s even worse. (After expressing my concerns to Jigsaw and declining to cover them, the startup told me it ended its selfie ban and now accepts a wide range of imagery.)</p>
<p>Gupta also feels strongly that women, in particular, deserve a different way to meet people that&#8217;s not about their looks alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a female, one of the main drivers behind founding company like SwoonMe, which is audio-first and not photos, is because I personally am tired, and have been tired, of being objectified by men&#8230;We&#8217;re living in 21st century and I am done with that. I want someone to like me because of my personality, because of my voice, because of what I bring into a relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Sure, physical attraction is important, but that is not the only thing,&#8221; Gupta adds.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there&#8217;s demand for a less superficial dating app from men, too. In fact, SwoonMe currently has more male users than female at present. (The app, to be clear, is open to all gender identities and sexual orientations as the issues it aims to solve can impact everyone. It also offers an inclusive sign-up flow.)</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s too soon to report user numbers and growth, Gupta says the app has &#8220;a good number&#8221; of early testers and they&#8217;ve been able to get solid user feedback so far.</p>
<p>The bigger question for SwoonMe is whether or not it can attract people looking for real relationships, as many of those people  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-date-without-dating-apps-2018-10">avoid dating apps</a> altogether. It&#8217;s also competing with a growing number of video-first dating apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">like Snack</a>, aimed at Gen Z users who are more comfortable filming themselves thanks to their use of social media platforms like TikTok.</p>
<p>At launch, <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> doesn&#8217;t generate revenue, but plans to add premium features if it reaches scale. Longer-term, the company would like to expand its platform beyond dating to help keep couples connected during their relationship, too.</p>
<p>SwoonMe soft-launched across both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swoonme-voice-first-dating/id1552773407">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dalybyteinc.swoonme">Play Store</a> for beta testing, but is today announcing its official launch. Currently, SwoonMe is targeting the dating markets of San Francisco and L.A., but is open to anyone who wants to try it.</p>
<p>The startup is a small team and currently working to raise $1 million in seed funding.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals.

<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tighten your bootstraps and get ready to wring every last ounce of education and opportunity out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>. Our two-day deep dive into the essential skills every early-stage founder needs to build a stronger startup begins tomorrow!</p>
<p>Hold the proverbial phone. You still have time (though not much) to avoid paying more at the “door.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> <strong>today, July 7, before 11:59 pm (PT)</strong> and you’ll save $100.</p>
<p>We have a program-packed day tomorrow, and here’s a preview of just some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">the experts</a> on hand and the topics they’ll cover. Check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a> to plan your day, and don’t fret about schedule conflicts. Your pass includes video-on-demand, so you won’t miss a moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Times listed in the agenda will automatically adjust to your geographic location.</p>
<p><strong>How to Line Up Your Growth with Your Goals:</strong> Unlike giant brands, startups need to use their marketing spend wisely and efficiently. Sound Ventures’ Susan Su is a growth marketing expert and will share how to define growth based on your startup’s goals, and how to take a framework-based approach to growth, rather than relying on old playbooks that aren’t relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Product Market Fit is All About Tempo:</strong> Sequoia’s Mike Vernal understands that the most successful companies are not necessarily the ones with a great idea, but the ability to learn from their customers and adapt quickly. Hear this seasoned venture partner explain how customer feedback loops, product iteration tempo and mindset not only affect fundraising, but the overall trajectory of the company.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get Ready to Fundraise: </strong>The process of fundraising doesn’t start with your first meeting. Setting a timeline, preparing your deck, warming up investors and understanding your strengths are key to a successful fundraise, and need to happen well before you start filling up your calendar. Cleo Capital founding partner Sarah Kunst will outline how to get ready to fundraise and answer your most burning questions.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about our other breakout sessions. You’ll hear from folks at SeedInvest, Dell for Entrepreneurs, UserTesting, Movile, Pilot and oVice. Plus, we built time for networking right into the schedule.</p>
<p>Are you ready to take what you know to the next level? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>, day one, starts tomorrow, and we can’t wait to see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subscriptions have become a popular way to pay for digital services, like Netflix or Spotify, but they haven&#8217;t yet taken off as a means of reordering your everyday items or other household essentials. Retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=15283820011">Amazon</a>, have tried shifting consumers to a subscription model for these sorts of purchases &#8212; even by offering discounts. Still, consumers have largely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-consumer-internet-subscriptions-focus/consumer-giants-spurn-risks-to-chase-online-subscribers-idUSKCN1PC00H">balked at the idea</a> of forced reordering on a fixed schedule. A startup called <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/">Repeat</a> believes it may have figured out a better solution. Instead of trying to lock consumers into subscriptions, Repeat analyzes consumer purchase behavior to nudge customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder. It then provides them with a personalized shopping cart to make the reordering experience fast and painless.</p>
<p>This service is now being used by 67 companies in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market, including brands like By Humankind (personal care), Jot (coffee), Vegamour (haircare), Youth to the People (skincare), Osea (skincare), hydrant (rapid hydration packets), Twice (toothpaste), lemon perfect (flavored water), and many others.</p>
<p>Today, Repeat is announcing its $6 million Series A, led by Battery Ventures. Seed investors Mucker Capital and Harlem Capital also invested in the round. With the round&#8217;s close, Battery&#8217;s general partner <a href="https://www.battery.com/people/neeraj-agrawal/">Neeraj Agrawal</a>, whose background is in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/">enterprise software-as-a-service</a> businesses, is joining Repeat&#8217;s board.</p>

<p>The idea to tackle e-commerce&#8217;s replenishment problem came about after Repeat&#8217;s co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimstiefel/">Kim Stiefel</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahwissel/">Sarah Wissel</a> tried launching their own direct-to-consumer apparel brand, UNDR, focused on refreshing the basics &#8212; like socks, tees, and underwear. Having spend their careers in the marketing and ad tech world, they believed they would be able to put their experience to work to grow their new business.</p>
<p>After launching a quarterly subscription for t-shirts, the founders soon discovered not only how hard it was to get a brand-new brand off the ground, but also how getting customers to commit to ongoing purchases was even harder. From their customer feedback, the founders learned that most consumers actually don&#8217;t like the experience of reordering household items. Customers told them it doesn&#8217;t always make sense to reorder products on a fixed schedule.</p>
<p>Unlike Netflix, where you&#8217;re paying for the rights to access a broad catalog on an ongoing basis, there are times when you&#8217;ll use your household products more quickly or more slowly. That means you&#8217;ll sometimes end up receiving items too soon when you&#8217;ve ordered them on subscription. That&#8217;s not ideal; nor is it very eco-friendly. Other times, you may run out before your scheduled delivery is due to arrive. That&#8217;s also a problem.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We should have known that,&#8221; admits Stiefel, now Repeat&#8217;s CEO, after hearing that customers didn&#8217;t like subscriptions. &#8220;We asked ourselves if we actually subscribe to any products, and it turns out, the answer was &#8216;no.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p>The founders decided to scrap their subscription in favor of a new idea. Instead of forcing consumers to subscribe on a schedule, they would &#8220;nudge&#8221; customers to reorder during what they determined would would be the perfect window, based on past order history.</p>

<p>After experimenting with personalized reminders for their own brand for a year, Stiefel and Wissel decided to pivot their startup so they could offer this service to any e-commerce CPG company.</p>
<p>Today, any brand that sells a replenishable or consumable product can use Repeat to turn their one-time buyer into a repeat customer. To do so, Repeat uses a combination of logic, where it analyzes all the company&#8217;s a la carte purchase behavior to make sense of the general replenishment intervals on a per-SKU basis. It then leverages that logic to nudge customers when it&#8217;s time to reorder by sending an <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/klaviyo-replenishment-flows">email</a> or <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/sms">text</a> with a link to what Repeat calls its &#8220;replenishment cart.&#8221; The customer can choose to snooze the reminder or they can click through to checkout.</p>
<p>This replenishment cart is a special shopping cart that&#8217;s personalized to the individual customer and pre-filled with the product or products they&#8217;re due to repurchase, as well as other suggestions. But unlike a typical checkout experience, the customer can adjust the merchandise the cart contains &#8212; for example, by opting for a different flavor or scent for their product, or opting for a larger size, among other things.</p>
<p>As the customer continues to interact with Repeat&#8217;s reminders and cart, the service gets smarter about understanding that customer&#8217;s unique reordering intervals, so its nudges also get smarter. In time, Repeat envisions offering a universal cart where customers can reorder from across their favorite CPG brands in one place.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174542" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174542" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2174542" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/repeat-example.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Repeat</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of logic that goes into making that cart experience work as well as it does,&#8221; notes Stiefel. &#8220;For example, the cart converts at around 25 percent on average. Some brands are seeing 40, or 45 percent conversion on that cart, and we see that people check out oftentimes in less than 15 seconds on that cart. And I think that&#8217;s really the underlying magic &#8212; that, in combination with the logic, is the underlying magic of Repeat,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>There is, of course, the challenge of getting its nudges exactly right. If Repeat hits up customers at the wrong time, it could be perceived as an annoyance and customers might opt out of the notifications.</p>
<p>Repeat currently generates revenue through a monthly SaaS (software-as-a-subscription) fee, and as a percentage of the revenue its cart drives. For brands that drive less than 2,000 a la carte, non-subscription orders per month, Repeat would charge $99 per month plus 5% of the revenue it drives. And for brands that are driving more than 10,000 a la carte, non-subscriptions orders per month, Repeat charges $499 per month, plus 5% of the revenue it drives. The company isn&#8217;t disclosing its own revenue figures, however.</p>
<p>L.A.-based Repeat says it plans to use the new funds to hire across all roles, including in engineering, product, sales, marketing and growth. The startup began the year with just 3 employees, but hopes to be at around 15 to 20 by the end of the year by expanding its team that&#8217;s distributed across the U.S.</p>
<p>The company will also use the capital to work on scaling the business. For example, it recently launched <a href="https://www.getrepeat.io/qr-codes">QR codes</a> that allow anyone to be redirected to a Repeat cart &#8212; even first-time shoppers who discover a brand through a friend, and scan the product to order one of their own.</p>
<p>Over time, Repeat believes it can change the way CPG subscriptions work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with subscription today is that it&#8217;s fixed, and time-based and rigid, and not rooted in any kind of real consumption cadence,&#8221; says Stiefel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Repeat focuses on that all a carte reordering experience, and because we&#8217;re looking at repeat behavior across individual product SKUs, we actually know a tremendous amount about consumption behavior across every category of CPG. I think what you&#8217;ll see from us in the future is being able to leverage that data to offer more flexible dynamic subscription experiences,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> decided that it was time to talk about drugs. No, not like <em>drugs for fun, </em>but instead drugs that you might have <em>considered</em> fun, but are now being redirected to help bolster your health.</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s our theme today. As it turns out, there are a number of startups and even nascently public companies that are pursing using drugs that we might consider recreational for serious health purposes. Which is neat, as our habit of decrying any drug that makes you feel better as immoral has likely held us back from learning quite a lot about them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Venture capital investment in psychedelic start-ups, per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a>, rose from sub-$100 million results in 2018 and 2019 to $346 million last year.</li>
<li>Vice clauses, however, can pause a legitimate issue for investors who might want to cut a check in the space.</li>
<li>From the startup angle, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/nue-life-health-raises-3-3m-for-its-psychedelics-meets-tech-mental-wellness-platform/">NUE Life Health recently raised $3.3 million</a>, and Osmind is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/osmind-pitches-clinical-management-and-data-analysis-for-mental-health-practices-using-psychedelics/">up to some neat stuff regarding mental health</a>.</li>
<li>From the public markets, Atai Life Sciences, Compass Pathways, and MindMed are the companies worth watching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly this was a fun one to record, even if the topic at hand is actually rather serious. Chat Friday morning!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloverly.com/">Cloverly</a>, an Atlanta-based early stage startup, has developed an API that helps companies measure and then offset their carbon emissions. Today the company announced a $2.1 million seed round.</p>
<p>TechSquare Ventures led the round with participation from SoftBank Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures along with Circadian Ventures, Knoll Ventures, and SaaS Ventures .</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company announced that founder Anthony Oni has stepped back from running the company day-to-day, but will remain on the board as advisor. The company has hired former eBay exec Jason Rubottom as CEO in his place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a Sustainability as a Service company that helps other companies measure and reduce their carbon footprint. Our API measures the carbon emissions from various activities or processes within a business and allows that business or its customers to offset those emissions. And then it provides comprehensive reporting on that,&#8221; Rubottom explained.</p>
<p>Rudy Krehbiel, who runs operations for the company says that the API is designed to be flexible to meet the needs of each company accessing the services, but once developers create an application, it works automatically to measure emissions and purchase the offsets. &#8220;The solution itself is automated. Most of the work happens up front, and once we get integrated it becomes a fully productized and operationalized ongoing measurement and offsetting solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate sustainability initiatives may open doors for carbon offset startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/corporate-sustainability-initiatives-may-open-doors-for-carbon-offset-startups/embed/#?secret=sD8xoS9PUL" data-secret="sD8xoS9PUL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As customers build solutions using the tool, they can then offset their carbon usage by buying carbon offsets from the public markets, and this can be automated based on the usage of a given company. Cloverly monitors the offset market to ensure that the sources are credible and are adding new ones as they develop.</p>
<p>The company is working with over 600 brands, which have offset over 55 million pounds of carbon to this point. The API was originally conceived by Oni when he was working at the <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a> and spun out as a startup on Earth Day in 2019.</p>
<p>Oni, who is Black, is moving away from day-to-day operations as he hands the baton to Rubottom, but he recognizes the significance of this funding from a diversity perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Black tech founder of a climate tech company, it&#8217;s incredibly validating to have TechSquare Ventures and Softbank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund as investors. It will take diverse people and teams to find solutions to create a more sustainable future,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Daniel Simon </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alliance-data-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bread-301162702.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold Bread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer purchase finance and payments startup he’d co-founded, to Alliance Data Systems for over $500 million late last year, he quickly set his sights on building another startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, Simon says he observed how much strain was placed on what he described as ‘real-world’ businesses and their employees &#8212; such as truck drivers, plumbers, HVAC installers and last-mile delivery people &#8212; “and how little the last decade of innovation in fintech has done to meet the needs of the vast and vital fleets segment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he teamed up with former Lyft exec Andrew Woolf to found </span><a href="https://coastpay.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that is aiming to meet those needs with the mission of becoming “the financial platform for the future of transportation.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the New York-based company is announcing it has raised $6 million in an “oversubscribed” seed round of funding led by Better Tomorrow Ventures. Avid Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, BoxGroup, Colle, Foundation Capital, Greycroft, and Max Levchin’s SciFi VC &#8212; as well as more than a dozen angels including founders of Plaid, Flexport, Marqeta, Bread, Albert, Addi, Lithic, and other fintech and logistics startups &#8212; also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174387" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174387" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2174387 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?w=486" alt="" width="413" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg 1771w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Coast.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174387" class="wp-caption-text">Coast co-founders Daniel Simon and Andrew Woolf</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that operate fleets need to enable their drivers to pay for vehicle-related expenses when they’re on the road, such as maintenance, roadside assistance and gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once a fleet reaches a size of more than just a few vehicles, traditional small business credit cards are no longer sufficient because they lack the line-item level security, visibility, and controls necessary with a mobile workforce, according to Simon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fleet owners need transactions to be authorized, for instance, for buying gas for the company van, not the personal car, and for filling up at the pump, not making other purchases in the gas station convenience store,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, fleets have turned to specialized fleet and fuel credit cards which provide controls like restricting purchases to only fuel products of a particular grade or tracking expenses on a per-vehicle basis. But Simon argues that the companies that sell such cards were founded decades ago with very little innovation since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s goal is to use technology to provide fleet business owners and their employees payments products that are intuitive and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need their employee and vehicle payments integrated into the rest of their operations, and they need fair and transparent financial products that are simple to understand,” Simon said. Bottom line, he wants to bring the “same sort of ease of use and transparency that Bread brought to e-commerce consumers and retailers to a category of business and employee that is often overlooked in tech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s first product, which is set to launch later this year, is a commercial fuel charge card. Drivers will be able use a physical Coast card they keep in their wallet or a shared Coast card in the vehicle, and when they swipe it at a pump at any merchant that takes Visa, Simon says Coast will conduct a “rapid review of a complex set of rules to enforce the fleet business’s policies and flag potentially fraudulent transactions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need for entering data prompted by the pump &#8211; the driver fills up and is on their way,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleet owners and managers can use Coast’s web portal to assign drivers and vehicles, set policies and rules about who can purchase what, how much, how often, and when. They can also get reporting and alerts on their expense policies and potential abuse. At the end of the month, they will be able pay their Coast balance in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, the company plans to add integrations into major accounting platforms as well as into telematics platforms that provide real-time data on vehicle status and location “so it can provide actionable spending insights back to fleet managers.” Over time, Coast also plans to expand into more categories of fleet businesses’ spending as it seeks to become more of a holistic platform for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheel Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures, who took a seat on Coast’s board as part of the financing, says his firm was impressed by both the size of the opportunity and the team at Coast that’s tackling it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is one of those massive unsexy categories with huge incumbents that most people have never heard of but customers &#8212; who are forced to use them &#8212; universally despise. It&#8217;s the perfect recipe for a startup to come in and disrupt it with a much better experience,” Mohnot told TechCrunch via e-mail. “Similar to what Ramp or Brex do for startups, Coast does for fleet operators &#8211; it helps them control their spending so they can focus on growing their business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to detecting events transpiring anywhere in the world, few companies hold a candle to <a href="https://www.dataminr.com">Dataminr</a>. Founded in 2009, the company has raised more than $1 billion over the past 12 years (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/">including $475 million at a $4.1 billion valuation just this past March</a>) to build out a data-gobbling platform that transforms raw inputs into actionable event intelligence.</p>
<p>Those events are sent to a variety of customers — corporate security professionals, supply chain risk analysts, even journalists — for whatever purpose they need in their work. CEO and co-founder Ted Bailey said that the company has made event detection its core skillset. It’s “all been geared to the detection of events,” he said. “What we have never built into our corporate product is an advanced geospatial platform,” that would allow users to visualize risks rather than just getting a push notification or an email.</p>
<p>That’s about to change, as the company announced today its first acquisition in its corporate history with the purchase of UK-based <a href="https://watchkeeper.com">WatchKeeper</a>. WatchKeeper’s platform was designed to help corporate physical security executives visualize how events could affect a company’s assets. For instance, a bank with branches in Florida needs to understand what happens if a hurricane is heading toward the peninsula.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although Bailey said that “it’s a mature product — this is by no means an acquihire.” WatchKeeper, which was founded in 2018, previously raised £1 million from venture capitalists, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/watchkeeper-international/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>“Different organizations have extremely different needs, and these events have extremely different impacts on these corporations given the geographical footprint of their physical assets and their moving assets,” Bailey said. “This is something that we have zeroed in on [at Dataminr] more and more over the past couple of years.”</p>
<p>The startup had been on Dataminr’s radar even prior to the company inception. Hugh Farquhar, the founder and CEO of WatchKeeper, formerly worked at Citibank where Bailey said he built out a platform for contextualizing Dataminr alerts for the bank’s executives. After he left, Farquhar decided to build a similar platform for all companies.</p>
<p>As word got out about WatchKeeper’s product, Bailey saw an opportunity to bring Dataminr closer to the nascent company. “We were aggressively exploring a partnership with them for the last 6-12 months where we were scoping and imagining the possibilities of working together,” he said. “We had already selected them as the key innovator in data visualization, the one that was most tuned to corporate needs,” and eventually the partnership discussion became an acquisition conversation.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper’s entire team will move to Dataminr, and they will remain in the UK. Dataminr opened its European headquarters in the UK a few years ago, and the company has ambitious plans to spend heavily from its last round of capital on international expansion in Europe and in APAC.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper will be integrated into Dataminr Pulse later this year, the company’s product focused on business risk clients. Bailey said that from a data perspective, the acquisition pushes Dataminr into a new direction. “We have never taken that step of using public data outside of just detecting events,” he said. “We have a bunch of ideas on how to go beyond detecting events early,” which has been Dataminr’s main objective, to “real-time contextual data.” In addition, WatchKeeper integrates corporate internal data in a way that Dataminr hasn’t previously explored.</p>
<p>This is Dataminr’s first M&amp;A transaction, and while future transactions could be in the offing, there isn’t a specific strategy to hit a growth target through acquisitions in the future. The company continues to be headed toward an intended IPO, given that it dubbed its March round a “pre-IPO round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ZeroFox, a cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on social media and digital channels, has announced it has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dark-web/">dark web</a> threat intelligence company Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vigilante — not to be confused with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/">controversial crime reporting app</a> — scours the dark web to source intelligence that helps to protect organizations from cyberattacks. The deal, terms of which were not announced, will see ZeroFox take on Vigilante’s global team of operatives and analysts to create “the industry’s most robust” dark web intelligence solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on Vigilante’s decades-old dark web monitoring tools, the joint solution will combine datasets from the two companies to deliver risk intelligence on compromised credentials and botnets, network intelligence on infected and vulnerable hosts, and intelligence on threat actors and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The product, which will have ZeroFox&#8217;s AI processing capabilities baked-in, will also provide botnet exposure monitoring, threat monitoring, and client-specific investigations and incident response on threat actor engagement and asset recovery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The combination of our otherwise inaccessible datasets, our team of researchers and operatives, along with ZeroFox’s scale and artificial intelligence, provides a compelling dark web intelligence service,” said Mike Kirschner, co-founder of Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition, which the firms claim will help better protect organizations at an even greater scale, comes amid a huge rise in criminal activity on the dark web, according to recent research. As a result of pandemic-fueled cybercrime, Risk Based Security said in <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/">its recent annual data breach report</a> that the number of comprised records surpassed 37 billion in 2020, a 141% increase over 2019, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> was up by 100%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The dark web and criminal underground are critical requirements of modern threat intelligence programs,&#8221; said James C. Foster, CEO of ZeroFox. &#8220;Our customers need a clear view of the underground economy, how bots may be attacking them or if their credentials, credit cards, personally identifiable information (PII) and other information could be traded there, as well as understanding emerging tactics, exploits and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Foster said the acquisition of Vigilante increases &#8220;the scale and comprehensiveness&#8221; of its dark web intelligence gathering capabilities, which helps to protect customers&#8217; information.</p>
<p>In February last year, ZeroFox announced it had raised $74 million in a Series D funding round led by Intel Capital, which it planned to use to accelerate its global expansion and product strategy. Prior to this, in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/zerofox-secures-40m-series-c-to-help-manage-social-media-risk/">the startup raised $40 million Series C led by Redline Capital Management and Silver Lake Waterman</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several widely used opioid treatment recovery apps are accessing and sharing sensitive user data with third parties, a new investigation has found.</p>
<p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce transmission in the U.S, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/telehealth/">telehealth services</a> and apps offering opioid addiction treatment have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/boulder-care-opioid-treatment-platform-picks-up-traction-during-coronavirus/">surged in popularity</a>. This rise of app-based services comes as addiction treatment facilities face budget cuts and closures, which has seen both investor and government interest turn to telehealth as a tool to combat the growing addiction crisis.</p>
<p>While people accessing these services may have a reasonable expectation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a> of their healthcare data, a <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/opioid-telehealth-research?=06072021">new report</a> from ExpressVPN’s Digital Security Lab, compiled in conjunction with the Opioid Policy Institute and the Defensive Lab Agency, found that some of these apps collect and share sensitive information with third parties, raising questions about their privacy and security practices.</p>
<p>The report studied 10 opioid treatment apps available on Android: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bicycle-health-the-virtual-opioid-use-disorder-therapy-service-will-soon-be-available-in-25-states/">Bicycle Health</a>, Boulder Care, Confidant Health. DynamiCare Health, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kaden-health">Kaden Health</a>, Loosid, Pear Reset-O, PursueCare, Sober Grid, and Workit Health. These apps have been installed at least 180,000 times, and have received more than $300 million in funding from investment groups and the federal government.</p>
<p>Despite the vast reach and sensitive nature of these services, the research found that the majority of the apps accessed unique identifiers about the user&#8217;s device and, in some cases, shared that data with third parties.</p>
<p>Of the 10 apps studied, seven access the Android Advertising ID (AAID), a user-generated identifier that can be linked to other information to provide insights into identifiable individuals. Five of the apps also access the devices’ phone number; three access the device&#8217;s unique IMEI and IMSI numbers, which can also be used to uniquely identify a person&#8217;s device; and two access a users&#8217; list of installed apps, which the researchers say can be used to build a &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; of a user to track their activities.</p>
<p>Many of the apps examined are also obtaining location information in some form, which when correlated with these unique identifiers, strengthens the capability for surveilling an individual person, as well as their daily habits, behaviors, and who they interact with. One of the methods the apps are doing this is through Bluetooth; seven of the apps request permission to make Bluetooth connections, which the researchers say is particularly worrying due to the fact this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/a-dozen-popular-iphone-apps-caught-quietly-sending-user-locations-to-monetization-firms/">can be used to track users</a> in real-world locations.</p>
<p>“Bluetooth can do what I call proximity tracking, so if you’re in the grocery store, it knows how long you’re in a certain aisle, or how close you are to someone else,” Sean O’Brien, principal researcher at ExpressVPN’s Digital Security Lab who led the investigation, told TechCrunch. “Bluetooth is an area that I’m pretty concerned about.”</p>
<p>Another major area of concern is the use of tracker SDKs in these apps, which O&#8217;Brien previously warned about in a recent investigation that revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/x-mode-location-google-apple-ban/">hundreds of Android apps were sending granular user location data to X-Mode</a>, a data broker known to sell location data to U.S. military contractors, and now banned from both Apple and Google&#8217;s app stores. SDKs, or software development kits, are <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/8/21311533/sdks-tracking-data-location">bundles of code</a> that are included with apps to make them work properly, such as collecting location data. Often, SDKs are provided for free in exchange for sending back the data that the apps collect.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Confidentiality continues to be one of the major concerns that people cite for not entering treatment&#8230; existing privacy laws are totally not up to speed.&#8221; <cite>Jacqueline Seitz, Legal Action Center</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>While the researchers keen to point out that it does not categorize all usage of trackers as malicious, particularly as many developers may not even be aware of their existence within their apps, they discovered a high prevalence of tracker SDKs in seven out of the 10 apps that revealed potential data-sharing activity. Some SDKs are designed specifically to collect and aggregate user data; this is true even where the SDK&#8217;s core functionality is concerned.</p>
<p>But the researchers explain that an app, which provides navigation to a recovery center, for example, may also be tracking a user’s movements throughout the day and sending that data back to the app’s developers and third parties.</p>
<p>In the case of Kaden Health, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/stripe/">Stripe</a> — which is used for payment services within the app — can read the list of installed apps on a user&#8217;s phone, their location, phone number, and carrier name, as well as their AAID, IP address, IMEI, IMSI, and SIM serial number.</p>
<p>“An entity as large as Stripe having an app share that information directly is pretty alarming. It’s worrisome to me because I know that information could be very useful for law enforcement,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien tells TechCrunch. “I also worry that people having information about who has been in treatment will eventually make its way into decisions about health insurance and people getting jobs.”</p>
<p>The data-sharing practices of these apps are likely a consequence of these services being developed in an environment of unclear U.S. federal guidance regarding the handling and disclosure of patient information, the researchers say, though O&#8217;Brien tells TechCrunch that the actions could be in breach of 42 CFR Part 2, a law that outlines strong controls over disclosure of patient information related to treatment for addiction.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Seitz, a senior staff attorney for health privacy at Legal Action Center, however, said this 40-year-old law hasn&#8217;t yet been updated to recognize apps.</p>
<p>“Confidentiality continues to be one of the major concerns that people cite for not entering treatment,&#8221; Seitz told TechCrunch. &#8220;While 42 CFR Part 2 recognizes the very sensitive nature of substance use disorder treatment, it doesn’t mention apps at all. Existing privacy laws are totally not up to speed.</p>
<p>“It would be great to see some leadership from the tech community to establish some basic standards and recognize that they’re collecting super-sensitive information so that patients aren’t left in the middle of a health crisis trying to navigate privacy policies,&#8221; said Seitz.</p>
<p>Another likely reason for these practices is a lack of security and data privacy staff, according to Jonathan Stoltman, director at Opioid Policy Institute, which contributed to the research. “If you look at a hospital&#8217;s website, you’ll see a chief information officer, a chief privacy officer, or a chief security officer that’s in charge of physical security and data security,” he tells TechCrunch. “None of these startups have that.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way you’re thinking about privacy if you’re collecting the AAID, and almost all of these apps are doing that from the get-go,&#8221; Stoltman added.</p>
<p>Google is aware of ExpressVPN’s findings but has yet to comment. However, the report has been released as the tech giant prepares to start limiting developer access to the Android Advertising ID, mirroring Apple&#8217;s recent efforts to enable users to opt out of ad tracking.</p>
<p>While ExpressVPN is keen to make patients aware that these apps may violate expectations of privacy, it also stresses the central role that addiction treatment and recovery apps may play in the lives of those with opioid addiction. It recommends that if you or a family member used one of these services and find the disclosure of this data to be problematic, contact the Office of Civil Rights through Health and Human Services to file a formal complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is this is a general problem with the app economy, and we’re watching telehealth become part of that, so we need to be very careful and cautious,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien. &#8220;There needs to be disclosure, users need to be aware, and they need to demand better.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar resigned from their roles on Wednesday, adding to the list of high-profile local politicians who have vacated their positions ahead of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffling his cabinet.</p>
<p>The resignations of Prasad &#8212; who also served as the minister of Law and Justice &#8212; and Javadekar &#8212; who also oversaw Environment, Forest, Climate Change, Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises &#8212; come at a time when they were at the centre of a tough discourse with American technology firms over South Asian’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>, which went into effect late May.</p>
<p>There’s no evidence that Prasad and Javadekar’s enforcement of the new IT rules and public exchanges with American technology giants are linked to their resignations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“All social media platforms are welcome to do business in India. They can criticize Ravi Shankar Prasad, my Prime Minister or anyone. The issue is of misuse of social media. Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable,” Prasad had said at a virtual conference last week.</p>
<p>The new IT rules &#8220;will impact the data privacy and security of Indian internet users, as well as the technology sector&#8217;s hitherto tremendous contribution to India&#8217;s economic growth by imposing onerous compliance frameworks on both local and international digital media companies, said Jeff Paine, MD of Asia Internet Coalition, an industry body that represents all major tech companies, in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it is important to uphold user internet and accountability of online platforms, we urge the government to work closely with industry to ensure that these rules are implemented in ways that mitigate the impact on online platforms&#8217; operations in India, and ultimately, on individuals, startups, and the country&#8217;s technology ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others ministers to resign today include Health minister Harsh Vardhan and his deputy Ashwani Chaube, both of whom were criticised for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The President, as advised by the Prime Minister, has accepted the resignation &#8230; with immediate effect,&#8221; said Ajay Kumar Singh, Press Secretary to the President, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based smartphone subscription startup <a href="https://www.raylo.com">Raylo</a> has tucked $11.5 million in Series A funding into its top pocket, led by Octopus Ventures.</p>
<p>The equity round follows a debt raise last year &#8212; and brings Raylo&#8217;s total raised since being founded back in 2019 to $40M (in equity and debt). Its roster of investors to date also includes the Macquarie Group, Guy Johnson of Carphone Warehouse and the co-founders of Funding Circle.<u></u></p>
<p>The new funding will be used to charge up a subscription smartphone play that nudges consumers never to own their own mobile device &#8212; but just pay a monthly fee to lease a new or refurbished SIM-free device instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raylo says it&#8217;s seen 10x YoY growth of customers and revenues, and plans to plough the Series A into accelerating its growth in the UK &#8212; including by doubling its headcount and further developing its tech. And while it suggests it&#8217;s entertaining the idea of a future global rollout it remains firmly UK focused for now.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0I6rBHbNaU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market raises $335M for its refurbished device marketplace, now valued at $3.2B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Back Market raises $335M for its refurbished device marketplace, now valued at $3.2B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/embed/#?secret=0I6rBHbNaU" data-secret="0I6rBHbNaU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Consumers opting to get the latest smartphone hardware through Raylo will pay a lower cost than the full RRP for a device since they won&#8217;t actually own the hardware at the end of the contract.</p>
<p>Environmental considerations aside, that may be an increasingly important consideration, given the inflating price of premium handsets like the top-of-the-range iPhone which has broken $1,000 for a few years now.</p>
<p>Plus the fact that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/the-vast-majority-of-us-consumers-arent-spending-1000-on-phones/">most consumers simply won&#8217;t shell out so much</a> for a handset. Leasing and returning offers an alternative way for people to get to use such expensive high-end devices.</p>
<p>With Raylo, the leased mobile is typically returned after the end of the 12 or 24-month contract &#8212; with the returned device refurbished for reuse via a second (or third) leased life with another user.</p>
<p>End of life devices are recycled (by partners), per Raylo. So it&#8217;s touting a circular model that promotes sustainability via device usage longevity vs the more typical upgrade scenario, via a carrier, where a consumer may just toss their old unused handset into a drawer, wasting its further potential utility.</p>
<p>Albeit, many people do pass on old devices to other family members or even sell or trade them in. But Raylo claims there are an estimated 125M smartphones in unused &#8216;hibernation&#8217; across the UK. So, the suggestion is, plenty of smartphone users don&#8217;t bother ensure their old handset gets a second life.</p>
<p><span class="il">Raylo</span> reckons each of its subscription leased device can be used by a total of three customers over 6-7 years – which, if achieved, would mean a lifespan that it says is almost 2x longer than the UK average (of 2.31 years).</p>
<p>To further the longevity goal, all the phones it supplies come with a free case and screen protector.<u></u></p>
<p>Users also need to weigh up whether they want to shell out for insurance too, though, since they need to make sure they don&#8217;t damage the leased handset or risk having to shell out for expensive repairs or a non-return fee. (Raylo sells its own flavor of device insurance to users as an optional extra which slightly bumps up the monthly cost.)</p>
<p>Raylo competes with carriers&#8217; own device subscription plans, of course. But again the claim is it&#8217;s cheaper to lease its way &#8212; although that&#8217;s as it should be since the consumer doesn&#8217;t own the hardware at the end of the contract (so won&#8217;t automatically have anything of value they could sell or trade in elsewhere).</p>
<p>If a user doesn&#8217;t want (or fails) to return a device at the end of the contract they have to pay a non-return fee &#8212; which varies depending on the handset hardware and how long they&#8217;ve been paying for it. But the fee can stretch to over £600 at the premium end &#8212; after 12 months of use of a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G with 512GB of storage or an iPhone 12 Pro Max, for example.</p>
<p>While consumers that want to continue using the same device rather than upgrading after their contract ends can opt to continue paying their usual monthly fees &#8212; with payments continuing up to a maximum of 36 months, after which the non-return fee drops to a token £1.</p>
<p>All Raylo&#8217;s leased devices come with a 24 month warranty, under which it says it will freely repair faults not related to user damage or accidents, or else supply a replacement device if the handset can&#8217;t be fixed.</p>
<p>Commenting on Raylo&#8217;s Series A in a statement, Tosin Agbabiaka, early-stage fintech investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “The subscription economy is rapidly transforming the way we access products and services &#8212; yet the smartphone, an individual&#8217;s most valuable device, is still locked behind a bundled, ownership-based model. This means most people are trapped in a buy-and-dispose cycle, with a steep financial and environmental costs.</p>
<p>“Raylo solves these problems by offering access to premium consumer devices at lower, subscription-based prices, helping to widen access to the latest technology. By repurposing its devices at the end of their cycle, Raylo is also the sustainable choice in this market and has built a product loved by its customers &#8212; the opportunity here is massive, and we believe that [co-founders] Karl [Gilbert], Richard [Fulton], and Jinden [Badesha] have the vision and depth of expertise to transform the way we all access our devices.”</p>
<p>A number of refurbished electronics businesses have been attracting investor attention in Europe in recent years where lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops/">considering right to repair legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Recent fundings in the space include a $335M round for French refurbished device marketplace startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market</a>; a $71m round for Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/grover-raises-71m-to-grow-its-consumer-electronics-subscription-business/">Grover</a>&#8216;s subscription electronics business; and a $40.6M round for Finland-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/swappie-bags-40-6m-to-sell-more-secondhand-iphones-across-europe/">Swappie</a>, which refurbishes and sells secondhand iPhones, to name a few.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been quite the year for crypto capital, what with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">Coinbase’s blockbuster debut earlier this year in a direct listing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">A16Z raising $2.2 billion</a> for its third crypto-focused fund. But as the numbers in this frenetic market continue to skyrocket to dizzying highs, there is an open question for a lot of crypto founders: who exactly can work with me at the earliest possible stage?</p>
<p>That’s the investment thesis of Ash Egan, the current solo GP of Brooklyn-based <a href="http://acrylic.co">Acrylic</a>, which today announced a $55 million debut fund that will be focused on what he dubs “inception capital.” Among the LPs who invested are fund-of-funds firm Cendana, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/cendana-has-raised-a-30-million-fund-of-funds-for-vcs-managing-15-million-or-less/">known for backing emerging VC managers</a>, Accolade Partners, which <a href="https://medium.com/accolade-partners/accolade-partners-launches-a-blockchain-fund-of-funds-359e751510ce">launched a blockchain-focused fund-of-funds in 2020</a>, VC firms Accomplice and DCG as well as individuals like Chris Dixon, Marc Andreessen, Jim Pallotta, and others.</p>
<p>Egan, who was formerly a partner at Accomplice and an investor at ConsenSys Ventures, and Converge, has been heavily focused on the crypto space since 2015, backing early winners like Chainalysis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/chainalysis-raises-100m-doubles-valuation-to-over-2b/">which was valued at $2 billion in March</a>, and BlockFi, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/">which is now worth a pretty healthy $3 billion for the four-year-old company</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He sees an opportunity to be the earliest capital for crypto founders — perhaps even before they have started a company. He wants to “be that first investor in a company or a protocol before they raise those large rounds, even being an outsourced team member,” he said. He says he is focused on “the founders who are taking massive risks, creating entirely new markets, evolving the status quo.”</p>
<p>The firm’s name has a few sources according to Egan. “As a painter, my medium is acrylic,” he said. “It’s a real cool media since it meshes with all other mediums really well.” He also noted that “acrylic is generally painted in layers … and crypto is layers of protocols.” Finally, he feels the name relates to his style of investing. You “can’t just plug in a formula and rely on one kind of strategy,” he said. “Crypto investing is not a science yet, it’s still very much an art.”</p>
<p>While there is some poetry there, the reality of the crypto markets is that they are incredibly subsumed by the huge financial vagaries of the markets on any given today (and let’s be frank, every given minute). Egan wants to focus on longitudinal investing without constantly looking at the daily minutia of ticker prices. “The hope is that at scale, you are in a position where you are in early enough and cycles don’t really matter,” he said. “You want to partner with founders who are not swayed by macro inertia [and who are] building something with a ton of value in both bull and bear markets.”</p>

<p>The firm will invest in both traditional equity as well as tokens, and he sees the firm’s Brooklyn headquarters as a unique asset. “Brooklyn is so well-positioned to be a focal point for this next chapter in crypto given that every company has people in New York or who spend some part of the year here,” he said. “Wall Street is here, media is here… being local is huge.”</p>
<p>So far, the firm has invested in a couple of startups and protocols, including low-cost North American Bitcoin miner <a href="https://www.usbtccorp.com">US BTC Corp</a>, governance token protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/AutomataFinance/status/1348997992339169280?s=20">Automata</a>, smart contract auditing company Arbitrary Execution, decentralized investing network <a href="https://www.syndicateprotocol.org">Syndicate Protocol</a>, and two other unannounced investments.</p>
<p>While Egan says he is quite open to projects across the vast universe of crypto, there is one area where he won’t invest today. “One area that I am less excited at this point is generalized Layer 1 smart contract platforms aka your Ethereum killers,” he said. “There are a slew of contenders here including Ethereum, and I think it is very difficult to gain market share if you aren’t already building or in market today as a generalized smart contract platform.”</p>
<p>Right now, Egan is investing solo, but is in the process of building a team, saying that he is interviewing candidates but hasn’t hired. He believes a total focus on crypto will ultimately pay dividends over time. “At scale, you have network effects within the portfolio,” he said. “The portfolio actually works with each other.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacuna Technologies, a startup that helps cities create and enforce transportation policies by building and managing open-source digital tools, has raised $16 million in a Series A round, bringing the company’s total investment to $33.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the startup was founded in 2018, Lacuna has invested in helping cities like Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami build digital twins, or software models of real world cities – including all forms of mobility from delivery to rideshare to drones to regular traffic. City planners and transportation agencies can use these models to monitor the current environment and implement new regulations, as well as run simulations to provide a clearer picture of how certain policies could address congestion, pollution, accessibility and safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the fresh cash, Lacuna CEO Hugh Martin says the company is focusing on expanding to new markets and building out the applications that can be placed on top of the digital twins, like adjusting freight or delivery curb parking rates to reflect demand or putting a cap on the number of drones allowed down a given street per day. That means first hiring new engineering teams to build digital twins and connect applications in order to help cities get revenue flowing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The federal government collects billions of dollars in gasoline taxes, which is largely used to fund departments of transportation at the federal, state and local levels, and that’s headed for zero,” Martin told TechCrunch. “What are we going to do? The gas tax has been a good proxy, but we need to find a new way to effectively monetize the public right of way, as well as get control of it. And I define the public right of way as not just 2D, but 3D. Where are the drones going to fly, where are the aerial taxis going to take off and land and how is the city going to communicate policy to those devices in real time?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cities focus on real world public right of way, including all the street connections, speed limits and parking rules, Martin says new mobility companies like Uber or FedEx are building up digital models of cities and operating their businesses on top, and the city has no way of accessing them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What would be super powerful is if instead of just having the physical world, the city has a digital copy of itself, with digital policies that could then be used by all operators,” said Martin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than using historical data to plan out cities, Martin says Lacuna’s services have a more operational focus. For example, Waze routes cars based on congestion using its own digital twin. This can cause hundreds of cars to go down a little side street when the highway is clogged up, which might annoy those who live there. If the city had a digital twin, it could assess the width of the street, whether it’s residential or commercial and the speed limit, and put a cap on the number of cars Waze can reroute down that street, thus preserving quality of life for those living on that street. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our objective is to give cities the tools they need so that they can use their authority to make sure that the users of the public right away are compliant with whatever their policy is,” said Martin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Los Angeles, for example, Lacuna built a system to help LA manage its scooter fleets back in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Venice Beach was a mess, there were scooters all over the boardwalk and the beach and being thrown in the water,” said Martin. “So we helped LA establish a geofence 200 feet off the boardwalk. LA gave scooter operators a two month grace period, but warned them if at the end of those two months, if riders cross that geofence, the city would start lowering the total number of units each operator could have on the streets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure observance, the city council rewrote the regulatory language for getting a scooter permit, requiring operators to be compliant with the city’s </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20872421/lacuna-startup-mds-scooter-tracking-ladot-data-collection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobility data specification program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning operators would have to transmit and receive information digitally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, it&#8217;s night and day,” he said. “The scooters are all lined up 200 feet away from the boardwalk. And what was amazing for the city is that it was just 15 lines of code. They didn&#8217;t have to put a bunch of officers out, put signs up, write tickets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round was led by Xplorer Capital Management, and includes Playground Global, the company’s founding investor. Along with the funding news Lacuna is announcing the addition of Keith Nilsson, MP and co-founder of Xplorer, to the company’s board. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a>, an adtech company that provides clickbait ads below news articles, has raised $200 million in funding — Outbrain didn&#8217;t disclose the valuation of the company for this deal. The Baupost Group is investing in the company — it’s a Boston-based hedge fund. Outbrain filed for an initial public offering <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/29/2255239/0/en/Outbrain-Announces-Filing-of-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering.html">just last week</a>. Today’s funding round should be the last traditional private investment round before going public.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Outbrain, you may have seen its content recommendation widgets on popular news websites, such as CNN, Le Monde and The Washington Post. They mostly feature sponsored links that lead to third-party websites.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce this investment from The Baupost Group, who share our vision and commitment for our business, our team and our future prospects” co-CEO David Kostman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Outbrain is often compared with its rival <a href="https://www.taboola.com">Taboola</a>. While both startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/taboola-outbrain/">planned to merge</a> at some point, they had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/">cancel</a> their merger. Taboola already went public after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/taboola-is-going-public-via-spac/">merging with a SPAC</a> — a special purpose acquisition company. Taboola shares started trading last week.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001454938">IPO filing</a>, Outbrain reported $767 million in revenue for 2020 and $228 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2021 alone. In 2020, Outbrain managed to generate $4.4 million in net income. During Q1 2021, the company reported $10.7 million in net income.</p>
<p>“We proudly lead the recommendation space we created. We have bold plans for the future to continue delivering critical innovation to our premium media partners worldwide and expanding our powerful open web global advertising platform” Outbrain co-CEO Yaron Galai said in a statement.</p>
<p>The advertising market has recovered from the global health pandemic and there has been plenty of initial public offerings during the first half of 2021. Everything seems to be lining up for Taboola and Outbrain, which means it’s time to reach the next level and become public companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintech and lending startup <a href="https://www.lidya.info/">Lidya</a> today announced that it has completed its $8.3 million pre-Series B funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.thealitheia.com/">Alitheia Capital</a> led the investment via its <a href="https://www.goodwell.nl/fund/umunthu/">uMunthu Fund</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors that participated include Bamboo Capital Partners, Accion Venture Lab and Flourish Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the $1.3 million seed round secured in 2017 and $6.9 million Series A a year later, Lidya has raised a total of $16.5 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment will see Lidya grow its lending operations for small and medium businesses across its markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Lidya came about in Nigeria when <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kehinde-048aa635">Tunde Kehinde</a> and <a href="https://pl.linkedin.com/in/ercineksin">Ercin Eksin</a> saw the need to offer lending services while at their previous company Africa Courier Express (ACE)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACE was a last-mile e-commerce delivery company that provided logistics services to businesses and consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders, who also held founding and executive roles at Jumia Nigeria, noticed that most of the businesses ACE worked with had credit and financing issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although options existed, the founders felt these platforms could not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cater to their ever-growing needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As co-CEOs, the pair launched Lidya as a digital SME lending platform in 2016. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, businesses can create accounts and apply for loans ranging from $500 to $50,000, with decisions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya claims to use 100 data points to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each applicant and build a credit score for them to assess credit risk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company announced its raise in 2018, it had disbursed 1,500 business loans and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enter new African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it chose Europe instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2019, Lidya <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tobyshapshak/2019/10/15/nigerian-sme-digital-lender-lidya-expands-to-europe/">announced that it had launched new lending operations</a> in Poland and the Czech Republic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it was not until March and April 2020 the company&#8217;s activities in Eastern Europe fully kickstarted. Since then, Lidya claims to have disbursed over $3 million to SMEs in the two countries. To date, the company has disbursed over 25,000 loans and claims to have more than a 90% customer repeat rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what was behind the decision to expand to Europe instead of other African markets? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to build a global business from day one given the size of the problem where there is a $3 trillion credit gap,&#8221; CEO Kehinde said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We challenged ourselves not to limit ourselves to one market and went through some data before expanding to Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this raise, Lidya wants to solidify its presence in the three markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment has also brought a change to the company&#8217;s leadership structure. Per a statement released by the company,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eksin has left Lidya to pursue other projects while Kehinde takes over as the sole CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, both European markets represent about 30% of Lidya disbursement volume while the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> default rate is less than 1%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. U</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike most lending companies that raise debt financing to fund loans, Lidya uses equity to fund its loan book</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite the unconventional method, but Kehinde points why the company thought that path was necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea was for us to show that our algorithms work and that we can disburse money into the market and get it back. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we can transition to using debt for our lending operations,&#8221; the CEO said as the company looks to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finalize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deals with banks, family offices, and hedge funds in the coming months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the $300,000 line of credit Lidya has secured from Bamboo Capital Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya began lending in Europe at the height of the pandemic. Kehinde recounts how tough it was for the team, especially in a period that was so unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is difficult enough to attempt to launch in two new countries but try doing that remotely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re so decentralized. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had operations in Nigeria, and we were launching in Eastern Europe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making sure the puzzle stays together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stepped up. Everyone doubled down on the mission and we came out of the year without having any deterioration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds, &#8220;Now the focus is to get back to gear. We want to be able to do 5x what we&#8217;ve done historically by this time next year. If we do that, we&#8217;ll be successful, and our customers will be successful as well.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya will grow out its teams in Lagos, Prague and Warsaw and use a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the funds to support lines of credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Alitheia Capital co-founder and managing director Tokunboh Ishmael said, “Lidya is tackling the fundamental challenge of providing access to credit for dynamic small and growing businesses that otherwise have limited options for financing working capital to scale their businesses in Africa and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alitheia Capital and Goodwell are  pleased to be backing a team whose mission aligns with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of driving growth  and social impact by enabling access and inclusion to finance and financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s quite rare to see expansion moves from Nigerian or African startups to Europe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exception to that might be South African startups who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open offices in the U.K. and the Netherlands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kehinde relishes the company&#8217;s achievement so far, having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gained some foothold in both the Czech Republic and Poland. He says there is more to expect from the five-year-old digital lender</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited about the fact that we started in Nigeria and now our product is live in two European countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people come into Nigeria from other parts of the world but we&#8217;ve gone from Nigeria to other parts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;re proud of the traction we&#8217;ve gotten in our push to build the biggest finance house for SMEs in our markets.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Planet, which operates a network of around 200 satellites that provides Earth imaging, as well as analytics of the data derived from that observation, is going public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group IV. The deal has a post-transaction equity value of $2.8 billion, and will provide Planet with $545 million in cash balance at close, including $345 million from dMY IV&#8217;s contribution, and a $200 million PIPE provided by BlackRock-managed funds, Koch Strategic Platforms, Marc Benioff&#8217;s TIME Ventures and Google.</p>
<p>After a bit of a lull, Planet is now the second significant private space company this week to take the SPAC route to public markets. Both are in the business of Earth observation, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic, which announced its own SPAC merger on Tuesday,</a> operates on a much smaller scale at the moment. Planet, founded in 2010, has raised around $374 million to date, and operates the largest Earth imaging satellite constellation in operation.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mission has been to transform the way Earth imaging data is collected and provided to commercial interests here on Earth. Planet&#8217;s network can provide a complete scan of all of the Earth&#8217;s landmass on a daily basis, and it offers that to customers &#8220;via a Bloomer-like terminal for Earth data,&#8221; as Planet founder and CEO Wiill Marshall puts it. Access is provided on a subscription basis, and Planet says it generated over $100 million in revenue during its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Planet intends to use the funds resulting from the merger in part to pay down its existing debt, and also to fund its existing operations and &#8220;support new and existing growth initiatives.&#8221; The aim to to complete the merger sometime later this year, at which point the combined entity will trade under the ticker &#8220;PL&#8221; on the NYSE.</p>
