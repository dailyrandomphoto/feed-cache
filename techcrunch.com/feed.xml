										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular, highly-scrutinized trading app Robinhood has raised $2.4 billion to its balance sheet from shareholders, as first reported by the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-raises-another-2-4-billion-from-shareholders-11612197680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/robinhood-raises-34-billion-to-fuel-record-customer-growth"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then confirmed by the company.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The private startup raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">$1 billion on Friday</a>, meaning that it has raised $3.4 billion in a handful of days as it seeks to support a flood of retail investors looking to invest in individual stocks on its app – spurred by Redditors investing in GameStop in a effort to frustrate short sellers, in part. </span></p>
<p>Per Robinhood, the new funds were &#8220;led by Ribbit Capital, with participation from existing investors including ICONIQ, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Index Ventures, and NEA with terms being finalized.&#8221; It&#8217;s somewhat unconventional to announce a raise that is still being sorted, but Robinhood wants to calm nerves, so shouting about the capital ahead of the paperwork being fully smoothed makes some sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital comes at a challenging time for the unicorn, which could </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/with-a-2021-ipo-in-the-cards-what-do-we-know-about-robinhoods-q3-performance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursue an IPO this year</span></a> – but also a time when it&#8217;s enjoying considerable public attention, likely introducing it to many potential new users<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Robinhood found itself overwhelmed by the demand of new investors looking to invest in meme-stocks such as GameStop and AMC. Robinhood had to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinho"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily ban trading on these stocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to stiff financial requirements. As of right now, Robinhood users are limited to buying just a few</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-limits-users-to-a-single-share-of-gamestop-and-other-stocks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares of GameStop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other stocks despite the company haven taken on more capital since the GameStop run began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch emailed Robinhood asking for details of the $2.4 billion infusion, curious if it was raised as primary capital, convertible debt that could convert at the time of a public offering, or other mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[A]mid this week’s extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today,” the company wrote in a post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words: Robinhood ran low on capital, which meant it had to limit the frenzy of activity on its app. While the reasons behind Robinhood’s limits were technical, investors largely saw the constriction as a slap in the face in favor of hedge funds. Late Friday, Robinhood released yet </span><a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing what happened during what some see as </span><a href="https://twitter.com/businessbarista/status/1354789569221300226"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a pivotal week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the company’s trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to enable purchasing for all securities on our platform. This is a dynamic, volatile market, and we have and may continue to take action to make sure we meet our requirements as a broker so we can continue to serve our customers for the long term,” the statement read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s new capital will likely help Robinhood add some much needed buffer room, to the delight of its customers and investors. </span></p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get right to it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Oh wait, one item first. Tesla earnings happened and as always a bunch of new promises and products <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-says-tesla-semi-is-ready-for-production-but-limited-by-battery-cell-output/">and timelines</a> were laid out, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/this-is-the-new-interior-of-teslas-model-s/">Knight Rider-inspired steering yoke</a> in the &#8220;plaid&#8221; Model X.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106342" style="width: 1004px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106342" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2106342 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg" alt="tesla steering yoke" width="994" height="824" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg 994w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=300,249 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=768,637 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=680,564 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-8.46.40-AM.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2106342" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>This stalkless yoke steering wheel is suboptimal. (yup I said it). And it&#8217;s already getting the attention of federal safety regulators.</p>
<p>Yes yes, you&#8217;ve seen these yokes in race cars. However, the steering ratio is vastly different between race cars and the vehicle sitting in your driveway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the only who sees this as an awkward and potentially dangerous design choice.</p>
<p>Tim Stevens at CNET&#8217;s Roadshow, who has a deep background in automotive, notes that a race car needs as little as 180 degrees of rotation to turn from the left-most steering extent to the right, while the average passenger car has 900 degrees of rotation from full left to right.</p>
<p>That matters because daily driving requires you to change the positioning of your hands on the steering wheel while making U-turns and the like. When the steering wheel is a circle, it&#8217;s an easy task. This shape can make it awkward and prone to flubbing the maneuver.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that we don&#8217;t yet know if Tesla adjusted the steering ratio. Still, a higher steering ratio introduces other potential issues. You can read his <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-steering-yoke/">complete thoughts here</a>.</p>
<p>Lucid Motors jumped in and threw a little shade Tesla&#8217;s way with a tweet that shows a picture of the new Lucid Air steering wheel and this: &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Take the wheel: The knurled metal turbines and capacitive touchbars provide intuitive control of </span><span class="r-18u37iz">#LucidAir</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> DreamDrive ADAS functions.

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>

<p>After a quiet few weeks, the micromobbin&#8217; news floodgates opened. Perhaps, it was due to the three-day Micromobility World event that was held this past week.</p>
<p>First up, is <strong>Spin</strong> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/spin-bets-its-scooter-future-on-3-wheels-and-remote-control-tech/">three-wheel scooter</a> it rolled out with partners Segway-Ninebot and software startup Tortoise. (the scooter is pictured below) The scooter has the noteworthy addition of a third wheel to make it more stable and easier to ride, important features for any micromobility company hoping to appeal to a wider demographic.</p>
<p>The Spin S-200 scooter, as it&#8217;s call, is also equipped with repositioning software that allows remote operators thousands of miles away to move vehicles off the sidewalk and into a proper parking spot. A fleet of about 300 Spin S-200 scooters will be tested in Boise, Idaho this spring. But the goal is much grander. Spin ultimately wants to roll out remotely operated scooters to cities in North America and Europe in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2101289" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2101289" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2101289 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png" alt="Spin S-200 Tortoise scooter" width="2880" height="1574" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=2048,1119 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Spin-S-200.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2101289" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spin</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Lime</strong> is adding a whole new mode to its portfolio: electric mopeds. Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a “third mode” of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The addition of the mode can be viewed in two ways, depending on how bullish you are about Lime. Is this a desperate attempt to appeal to its investors and find new revenue streams? Or is this a long-planned strategy aimed at owning the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles?</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, it seems this plan has been in the works for some time, but was delayed due to COVID.</p>
<p>Lime plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a “handful of cities” over the next several months.</p>

<p><strong>One more interesting item &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Voi Technology, the European micromobility company, is aiming to secure a license to operate in New York City. It&#8217;s big selling point? The company said it has developed an electric scooter that can measure air quality as it travels through urban areas.</p>
<p>The Voiager 4 (V4) has been designed to contribute to lowering traffic congestion and fuels, as well as helping cities to collect data on the improvements, the company said. The scooter, which is coming out in spring, will have other features like antimicrobial handlebars, audible alarms to alert pedestrians and <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Near Field Communication technology that lets users unlock it with the tap of a smartphone or smart watch.</span></p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Sila Nanotechnologies raised $590 million in capital the good old fashioned way: institutional investors and venture capital firms. (I couldn&#8217;t have a SPAC as &#8216;deal of the week,&#8217; yet again.)</p>
<p>Sila Nanotechnologies is a Silicon Valley battery materials company that has spent the better part of a decade developing technology designed to pack more energy into a cell at a lower cost.</p>
<p>With demand for batteries climbing, automakers are looking for the next-generation tech that will give them a competitive edge. Sila Nano might just be the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">product automakers are looking for. The company, co-founded by Tesla alum Gene Berdichevsky, has already locked in partnerships with Amperex Technology Limited as well as automakers BMW and Daimler. </span></p>
<p>Sila Nano, which has a post-money valuation of $3.3 billion, plans to use the funds to hire another 100 people this year and begin to buildout a factory in North America capable of producing 100 gigawatt-hours of silicon-based anode material, which is used in batteries for the smartphone and automotive industries. Sila Nano said it plans to start production at the factory in 2024. Materials produced at the plant will be in electric vehicles by 2025, according to the company, which has yet to reveal the location of the factory.</p>
<p>The Series F funding round was led by Coatue with significant participation by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Existing investors 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AUTO1</strong>, a used car trading platform based in German, set the share price for its initial per offering between 32 and 38 euros with an aim to raise at least 1.5 billion euros ($1.83 billion), <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-auto1-ipo/germanys-auto1-seeks-to-raise-at-least-1-5-billion-euros-in-ipo-idUSKBN29U0M6">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Faraday Future</strong>, the electric vehicle startup that has come close to imploding numerous times in its short history, has found money where everyone else has: public markets via a SPAC. The company said it has reached an agreement to merge with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp in a deal valuing the combined entity at $3.4 billion. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/ev-maker-faraday-agrees-to-merge-with-property-solutions-spac?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg&#8217;s article</a> included a quote from Jordan Vogel, chairman and c-CEO of Property Solutions, that answered one of my questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no skeletons in the closet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have spent an exorbitant amount of time examining the history.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Freewire Technologies</strong>, the electric vehicle charging and power solutions company, raised $50 million in a Series C funding round led by Riverstone Holdings with participation from current shareholders bp ventures, Energy Innovation Capital, TRIREC and Alumni Ventures Group. The company said the funds will be used to boost production of its Boost Charger product and speed up its expansion into international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Starship Technologies</strong>, the autonomous delivery robot startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">raised $17 million</a>. Despite some struggles, the company has expanded its fleet five-fold since COVID-19 swept through the European and North American markets that it operates in. Starship now has 1,000 autonomous delivery bots in its fleet.</p>
<p>One item that I didn&#8217;t uncover until after publication: the company&#8217;s CEO Lex Bayer, a former sales leader from Airbnb, who took over the top spot at Starship in 2018, has left the company. Ahti Heinla, Starship Technologies’ co-founder and CTO, is serving as interim CEO while the company &#8220;conducts a thorough search for the best person to lead the company into the future,&#8221; a spokesperson told me.</p>
<p><strong>Wheels Up</strong>, the jet charter company, is in talks to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspirational-con-m-a-wheels-up-exclus/exclusive-wheels-up-in-talks-with-spac-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN29V04B">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wingcopter</strong>, the German drone technology startup, raised $22 million in a Series A round led by Silicon Valley VC Xplorer Capital, as well as German growth fund Futury Regio Growth. As TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">Darrell Etherington notes</a>, the company has come a long way since its founding in 2017. In the past four year, Wingcopter has developed, built and flown its heavy-lift cargo delivery drone, which offers all the benefits of vertical take-off and landing with the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft for longer-distance horizontal flight.</p>
<p><strong>Zadar Labs</strong>, an early stage startup that is developing high-resolution, low-cost imaging radars for autonomous systems <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zadar-labs-developing-next-generation-imaging-radar-closes-5-6m-in-seed-funding-301214844.html">raised $5.6 million</a> in seed funding led by Tim Kentley Klay — yes the Tim Kentley Klay, who co-founded Zoox, was ousted as CEO by the board and has since gone on to found a new AV startup called HYPR. Other investors include Leslie Ventures, Jeff Rothschild, Plug and Play, and Mentors Fund.</p>
<h2>GM charts its EV future</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>GM is hardly the first company to pledge to become carbon neutral by [insert some distant date]. But GM&#8217;s announcement this past week is different than other sustainability promises and platitudes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually surprised it didn&#8217;t receive more attention. I guess Robinhood and Gamestop were too intriguing.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">In short: GM pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040, a goal it will achieve by removing emissions from all of its products and global operations as well as offsetting those emissions through carbon credits or carbon capture.</p>
<p>The company also committed to produce only electric vehicles by 2035 — just 14 years away. In automaker years, thats just two, maybe three design cycles. In other words: that&#8217;s short.</p>
<p>To be clear, when I spoke to GM, I heard words like &#8220;hope&#8221; and &#8220;aspire to.&#8221; But when pressed, the company said &#8216;yes, this a real goal.&#8217;</p>
<p>Moving its portfolio, which today is dominated by internal combustion engine vehicles, will be a transition, a GM spokesperson told TechCrunch, adding that the main priority is to bring employees along in that shift.</p>
<p>A &#8220;transition&#8221; doesn&#8217;t adequately articulate what will need to happen to pull off a goal of this size and scope. Yes, there are new EVs coming in the pipeline. And GM has committed to spend $27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase that exceeds the automaker’s investment in gas and diesel.</p>
<p>But a look across its current portfolio and there&#8217;s no denying that GM is a maker of gas and diesel vehicles.</p>
<p>Will these vehicle models cease to exist or will they be &#8220;electrified?&#8221; How quickly will GM be able to transition its numerous factories to reflect its &#8220;only electric&#8221; mission? How will its workforce respond?</p>
<p>My questions abound. I am confident to make this prediction: the next decade at GM is going to be a wild ride.</p>
<h2>AutoX&#8217;s next big move in China</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>I was just thinking to myself, &#8216;what is AutoX up to?&#8217; when I saw their latest announcement. The Chinese autonomous vehicle company, which has also been developing and testing its tech in the U.S., opened its robotaxi pilot program to the public in Shenzhen. These robotaxis can be hailed and do not have a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a milestone for the company and the country. AutoX said this is the first time that the general public will be able to book a completely autonomous robotaxi without accompanying safety drivers in China. Once a person registers, they can book rides through AutoNavi, the mapping and transportation-booking app owned by Alibaba, one of the startup’s investors.</p>
<p>You might recall that inAutoX opened in April 2020, an 80,000-square-foot Shanghai Robotaxi Operations Center, following a 2019 agreement with municipal authorities to deploy 100 autonomous vehicles in the Jiading District. The vehicles in the fleet were assembled at a factory about 93 miles outside of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai operations center marked an escalation of AutoX’s ambitions that have expanded over the past year.</p>
<p>AutoX has now set up a robotaxi operations center in Shenzhen to support this new driverless program. The company says this new facility is more advanced than the previous operations centers it built in Shanghai.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Millions of Ford and Lincoln-branded vehicles will be powered by Android operating system beginning in 2023 as part of a six-year partnership announced Monday that will bring embedded Google apps and services to drivers.</p>
<p>Ford and Google said as part of the partnership they will establish <span style="font-weight: 400;">a new collaborative group called Team Upshift that will be used to develop new consumer experiences and services powered by the Android Automotive operating system. The team might create services that will change how customers buy a vehicle, for instance. The companies are </span>also working together to create new business models with data. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian noted that could mean using data to send consumers real-time notices or handle maintenance requests.</p>
<p>The two companies also announced that Ford has chosen Google Cloud as its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-bets-on-google-cloud-for-its-digital-transformation/">preferred cloud provider</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership marks a reversal for Ford, which has for years attempted to avoid third-party companies like Google and Apple, and instead pushed its open source platform. In 2017, Ford and Toyota Motor even formed a consortium known as SmartDeviceLink Consortium — a reference to an open source software version of Ford&#8217;s AppLink. The aim, at the time, was to speed up the deployment of the open source software to give consumers more options in how they connect and control their smartphone apps.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn&#8217;t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system and relies on the user&#8217;s smartphone. Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open-source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so it could be used in cars.</p>
<p>David McClelland, For Vice President of Strategy and Partnerships, said the partnership with Google &#8220;turbocharges&#8221; its more recent efforts and investments to build out its data analytics team and develop software expertise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both believe that the relationship between Google and Ford will establish an innovation powerhouse,&#8221; McClelland said. &#8220;It will accelerate the modernization of our business at Ford, and most importantly, it will let us exceed our customers expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford isn&#8217;t the only company with plans to incorporate a version of its Android operating system into its vehicles, although McClelland emphasized that the services and offerings would be unique.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For instance, Volvo announced in 2017 that it would use the Android OS and a year later said it would embed voice-controlled Google Assistant, Google Play Store, Google Maps and other Google services into its next-generation Sensus infotainment system. lvo. Polestar, the electric vehicle brand under Volvo, also uses Android Automotive OS to power the infotainment system for its newest vehicle, the Polestar 2. </span>Google announced in 2019 that it was opening its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/google-opens-android-automotive-os-to-spotify-other-media-app-developers/">Android Automotive operating system</a> up to third-party developers to bring music and other entertainment apps into vehicle infotainment systems, starting with the Polestar 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google and Ford today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">announced</a> a new partnership around bringing Android Automotive to Ford&#8217;s Ford- and Lincoln-branded cars, starting in 2023. But at the same time, the two companies also announced that Ford has chosen Google Cloud as its preferred cloud provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Google Cloud, Ford will digitally transform from the front office to the car to the manufacturing plant floor,&#8221; Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press conference today. &#8220;And there are a number of different applications, including modernizing product development, improving manufacturing and supply chain management, using computer vision AI for employee training, inspection of equipment on the assembly line and other applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurian also noted that Google and Ford are working to find new ways to monetize Ford&#8217;s data through features like maintenance requests and trade-in alerts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford vehicles will be powered by Google&#8217;s Android operating system&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/embed/#?secret=j8lGNMYkdM" data-secret="j8lGNMYkdM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;At Ford, we&#8217;ve got world-class in-house data insights and analytics teams,&#8221;  David McClelland, Ford&#8217;s VP for strategy and partnerships, said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve recruited significant software expertise and we&#8217;re making great progress in this area. And we&#8217;re moving rapidly towards commercializing our new self-driving business. And with this news that Thomas [Kurian] and I are announcing today, we&#8217;re turbocharging all of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>McClelland stressed that Google &#8220;brought the entire company to the table for us across cloud, Android, Maps and much more.&#8221; It&#8217;s maybe also no surprise, given Google&#8217;s expertise in this area, that for is looking to leverage Google Cloud&#8217;s AI tools as well. This work will go beyond the actual driving experience, too, and include work on modernizing Ford&#8217;s product development, manufacturing and supply chain, as well as predictive maintenance in Ford&#8217;s plants.</p>
<p>Like other car manufacturers, Ford is also looking to find ways to use the data it collects to create a connection to its drivers that goes beyond the buying experience and (maybe) the occasional maintenance visit to a dealership. For this to work, it needs to be able to understand its customers and offer personalized experiences.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement marks a bit of a turnaround for Ford, which had previously <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/06/03/fords-tech-might-end-up-in-your-toyota/">banded together</a> with a group of other car manufacturers with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ford-and-toyota-team-up-to-launch-the-smartdevicelink-consortium/">explicit goal</a> of keeping Google&#8217;s role in the automotive industry to a minimum. Now, only a few years later, the two are coming together in one of the deeper partnerships in the industry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning, that not too long ago, Ford had a deep partnership with Microsoft, which provided the basis of Ford&#8217;s Sync technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the first moving assembly line to the latest driver-assist technology, Ford has set the pace of innovation for the automotive industry for nearly 120 years,&#8221; said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. &#8220;We’re proud to partner to apply the best of Google’s AI, data analytics, compute and cloud<br />
platforms to help transform Ford&#8217;s business and build automotive technologies that keep people safe and connected on the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wandb.ai/">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, a startup building tools for machine learning practitioners, is announcing that it&#8217;s raised $45 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Lukas Biewald, Chris Van Pelt and Shawn Lewis — Biewald and Van Pelt previously founded CrowdFlower/Figure Eight (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/10/appen-acquires-figure-eight/">acquired by Appen</a>). Weights &amp; Biases says it now has more than 70,000 users at more than 200 enterprises.</p>
<p>Biewald (who I&#8217;ve known since college) argued that while machine learning practitioners are often compared to software developers, &#8220;they&#8217;re more like scientists in some ways than engineers.&#8221; It&#8217;s a process that involves numerous experiments, and Weights &amp; Biases&#8217; core product allows practitioners to track those experiments, while the company also offers tools around dataset versioning, model evaluation and pipeline management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you have a model that’s controlling a self-driving car and the car crashes you really want to know what happened,&#8221; Biewald said. &#8220;If you built that model year ago and you&#8217;ve run all these experiments since then, it can be hard to systematically trace through what happened&#8221; unless you&#8217;re using experiment tracking.</p>
<p>He described the startup as &#8220;an early leader&#8221; in this market, and as competing tools emerge, eh said it&#8217;s also differentiated by &#8220;completely focused on the ML practitioner&#8221; rather than top-down enterprise sales. Similarly, he said that as machine learning has been adopted by more widely, Weights &amp; Biases is occasionally confronted by a &#8220;high-class problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106631" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?w=680" alt="Weights &amp; Biases screenshot" width="680" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg 2600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=768,465 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=680,412 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=1536,930 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=2048,1241 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-5.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Weights &amp; Biases</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not interested in selling to companies that are doing machine learning for machine learning&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Biewald said. &#8220;With some companies, there&#8217;s a mandate from the CEO to sprinkle some machine learning in the company. That’s just really depressing to me, to not have any impact. But I would actually say the vast majority of companies that we talk to really do something useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, he said agriculture giant John Deere is using the startup&#8217;s platform to continually improve<a href="https://medium.com/pytorch/ai-for-ag-production-machine-learning-for-agriculture-e8cfdb9849a1"> the way it uses robotics to spray fertilizer</a>, rather than pesticide, to kill weeds and pests. And there are pharmaceutical companies using the platform as how they model how different molecules will behave.</p>
<p>Weights &amp; Biases previously raised $20 million in funding. The new round was led by Insight Partners, with participation from Coatue, Trinity Ventures and Bloomberg Beta. Insight&#8217;s George Mathew is joining the board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve never seen a MLOps category leader with such a high NPS and deep customer focus as Weights and Biases,” Mathew said George Mathew said in a statement.“It’s an honor to make my first investment at Insight to serve an ML practitioner user-base that grew 60x these last two years.”</p>
<p>The startup says it will use the funding to continue hiring in engineering, growth, sales and customer success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many founders only know their own experience fundraising, and don&#8217;t hear much about what other founders went through. On <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Extra Crunch Live</a> on Wednesday, we&#8217;re going to remedy that.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/grafana/">Grafana Labs</a> has raised upwards of $75 million since it launched in 2014. Lightspeed Venture Partners, and partner Gaurav Gupta to be specific, led both the startup&#8217;s Series A and Series B rounds. As far as commitments go, that&#8217;s a pretty significant one.</p>
<p>The new and improved Extra Crunch Live pairs founders and the investors who led their earlier rounds to talk about how the deal went down, from the moment they met to the conversations they had (including some disagreements) to the relationship as it exists today. Hell, we may even take a peek at the original pitch deck that made it all happen.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll turn our eyes back to you, the audience. That same founder/investor duo (in this case, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radutt">Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt</a> and <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/gaurav-gupta/">LVP&#8217;s Gaurav Gupta</a>) will take a look at your pitch decks and give their own feedback. (If you haven&#8217;t yet submitted a pitch deck to be torn down on Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">you can do so here</a>.)</p>
<p>The hour-long episode is sandwiched in between two 30-minute rounds of networking. From start to finish, it goes from 11:30am PT/2:30pm ET to 1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET. And Extra Crunch Live will come to you at the same time, every week, with a new pair of speakers.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s learn a little bit more about Gupta and Dutt.</p>
<p>Before becoming an investor, Gupta enjoyed a rich career in the product development sphere, holding positions at Elastic (where he led product management), Splunk (VP of Products), as well as Google, Gateway and the McKenna Group. He joined Lightspeed in 2019 as a partner, focusing primarily on enterprise software. He&#8217;s led investments in Impira, Blameless, Hasura and Panther, and of course, Grafana. He sits on the board of the last three companies in that list.</p>
<p>Dutt is the cofounder and CEO at Grafana Labs, but the fast-growing company isn&#8217;t his first go at entrepreneurialism. Dutt also founded and led Voxel, a cloud-hosting startup that was acquired by Internap for $30 million in 2012.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have Gupta and Dutt join us on our first episode of Extra Crunch Live in 2021. As a reminder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=lightspeedgrafana">Extra Crunch Live is for Extra Crunch members only</a>. We&#8217;re coming to you with a new pair of speakers every week, and you can catch everything you missed on demand if you can&#8217;t join us live. It&#8217;s worth the cost of the subscription on its own, but EC members also get access to our premium content, including market maps and investor surveys. Long story short? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=lightspeedgrafana">Subscribe, smarty.</a> You won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">here&#8217;s a look at other speakers you can expect to see on Extra Crunch Live</a>:</p>
<p>Aydin Senkut (Felicis) + Kevin Busque (Guideline) &#8211; February 10<br />
Steve Loughlin (Accel) + Jason Boehmig (Ironclad) &#8211; February 17<br />
Matt Harris (Bain Capital Ventures) + Isaac Oats (Justworks) &#8211; February 24</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the February slate!</p>
<p>All the details to register for this upcoming episode (and more) are available below. Can&#8217;t wait to see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">Deeply-funded</a> fintech company Robinhood has been the world&#8217;s most-discussed startup over the last week. After the discount trading pioneer found itself in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">the midst of a battle</a> between hedge funds on one side and a slurry of retail and institutional capital on the other, Robinhood&#8217;s trading volume spiked last week.</p>
<p>But after the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">raised its deposit requirements</a> before the market open on Friday, Robinhood was forced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-raises-1b-after-trading-halts-to-keep-its-platform-running/">restrict trading</a> in a number of popular stocks. The company also drew down its credit lines and raised new capital from prior investors to stay open during a trading avalanche.</p>

<hr />
<p>According <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">to a Clubhouse chat</a> between Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Elon Musk last night, the NSCC initially asked Robinhood to post $3 billion in reserve capital. That figure was reduced to $1.4 billion and later to $700 million after Robinhood agreed to limit certain trades. Robinhood transmitted the funds and opened Friday.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all recent news. Let&#8217;s look back further.</p>

The key revenue source for Robinhood is trackable, as the company has to file its incomes from it. This provides a good view into the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re parsing its Q4 2020 data, which shows a return to sequential-quarterly growth at the trading upstart.</p>
<p>Of course, we won&#8217;t have Q1 2021 data for another three months, but we do have &#8212; at last &#8212; a good look at how Robinhood wrapped 2020 and some insight into why its investors were willing to put in another $1 billion just last week.</p>
<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s Q4 2020</h2>
<p>Regular readers of The Exchange will recall that after a stonking Q2 2020, Robinhood&#8217;s Q3 2020 PFOF incomes were large, but not sequentially-impressive; while Robinhood likely saw sharp revenue gains from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020, when we stacked last year&#8217;s third-quarter against its second, the company&#8217;s growth had slowed enough that we were curious what would happen in Q4.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has introduced an<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-passwords/pejdijmoenmkgeppbflobdenhhabjlaj"> iCloud Passwords Chrome extension</a> that will make life easier for those who use both Windows computers and other Apple devices, like a Macbook or an iPhone. The new browser extension lets you access the passwords you saved in Safari on your other Apple devices, then use them within Chrome when you&#8217;re on a Windows PC.</p>
<p>You can also save any new passwords you create in Chrome to your iCloud keychain, so it&#8217;s synced across your Apple devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106596" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106596" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106596" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106596" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t formally announce the new feature, but reports of an iCloud Passwords extension had already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/icloud-windows-chrome-extension-icloud-passwords/">been referenced in the release notes</a> of the new iCloud for Windows 10 (ver 12), which arrived at the end of January. After the update, a &#8220;Passwords&#8221; section appeared in the app designated by the iCloud Keychain logo. This directed users to download the new extension, but the link was broken, as the extension was not yet live.</p>
<p>That changed on Sunday, according a <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/31/apple-icloud-passwords-chrome-windows/">report from 9to5Google</a>, which found the new Chrome add-on had been published to the Chrome Web Store late on Sunday evening. Now, when Windows users access the new Passwords section, the dialog box that prompts the download will properly function.</p>
<p>Once installed, Chrome users on Windows will be able to access any passwords they saved or allowed iCloud Keychain to securely generate for them within Safari for macOS or iOS. Meanwhile, as Windows users create new credentials, these, too, will be synced to their iCloud Keychain so they can later be pulled up on Mac, iPhone, and iPad devices, when needed.</p>
<p>This is the first Chrome extension to support iCloud Keychain on Windows, as before Apple had only offered an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icloud-bookmarks/fkepacicchenbjecpbpbclokcabebhah?hl=en">iCloud Bookmarks</a> tool for older Windows 7 and 8 PCs, which reached over 7 million users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106594" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106594" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106594" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-1.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106594" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Some users who have tried the extension are reporting problems, but it seems that&#8217;s related to their PCs not having been first updated to iCloud for Windows 12.0, which is a prerequisite for the new extension to work.</p>
<p>Though Apple typically locks users into its own platforms, it has slowly expanded some of its services to Windows and even Android, where it makes sense. Today, Apple offers its entertainment apps like Apple Music and Apple TV on other platforms, including Android, and has launched Apple TV on its media player rival, Amazon Fire TV, among others.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New transparency figures released by Amazon show the company responded to a record number of government data demands in the last six months of 2020.</p>
<p>The new figures land in <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20467513-amazon-transparency-report-2h-2020">the company&#8217;s bi-annual transparency report</a> published to Amazon&#8217;s website over the weekend.</p>
<p>Amazon said it processed 27,664 government demands for user data in the last six months of 2020, up from 3,222 data demands in the first six months of the year, an increase of close to 800%. That user data includes shopping searches and data from its Echo, Fire, and Ring devices.</p>
<p>The new report presents the data differently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/amazon-government-demands-data/">from previous transparency disclosures</a>. Amazon now breaks down the top requesting countries. U.S. authorities historically made up the bulk of the overall data demands Amazon receives, but this latest report shows Germany with 42% of all requests, followed by Spain with 18%, and Italy and the U.S. with 11% share each.</p>
<p>But the report also removes the breakdown by legal process, and now only differentiates between the requests it gets for user&#8217;s content and for non-content. Amazon said it handed over user content data in 52 cases.</p>
<p>For its Amazon Web Services cloud business, which it reports separately, Amazon said it processed 523 data demands, with 75% of all requests made by U.S. authorities, and Amazon turned over user&#8217;s content in 15 cases.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson would not say what led to the sharp rise in data demands. (Amazon seldom comments on its transparency reports.)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s transparency report is one of the lightest reads of all the tech giants at just three pages in length, and spends most of the report explaining how it responds to each legal demand than on the data itself. The company, known for its notorious secrecy, became the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/after-years-of-silence-amazon-finally-discloses-govt-data-demands/">last of the major tech giants</a> to push out a transparency report in 2015. Where most tech companies added data to their transparency reports, like takedown notices and account removals, Amazon bucked the trend by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/amazon-government-data-demands/">removing data</a> from its reports, despite the company&#8217;s growing reach into millions of homes.</p>
<p>The Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61968b3b-c093-4c4a-a7b7-29b565bc0bc0">reported</a> this weekend that Ring, the video doorbell and home security startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/amazon-is-buying-smart-doorbell-maker-ring/">acquired by Amazon for $1 billion</a>, now has 2,000 law enforcement partners across the United States, allowing police departments to access homeowners&#8217; doorbell camera footage.</p>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and make sure to check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/calendly-3-billion/">last week’s main episode</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-gamestop-this-is-2021/">companion chat about Robinhood</a>.</p>
<p>This morning we ran into quite a lot of the same material, with Robinhood back in the news and the stock market looming large. Here&#8217;s what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>American stocks are set to rise, bitcoin is flat, and meme-stocks are mixed.</li>
<li>In India, news is out that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">new law could ban bitcoin</a> (whatever that means), and this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/twitter-restricts-over-a-dozen-high-profile-accounts-in-india-following-legal-demand/">morning India forced Twitter to take down some accounts</a> that had been critical of government policy. That&#8217;s a pretty bad look. And it comes as we see a coup in Myanmar <a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6">leading to a decline in internet connectivity</a>; there is a clear link between authoritarianism and a desire for Internet control.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">Robinhood&#8217;s CEO went on Clubhouse</a>, where he was interviewed by Elon Musk about last week&#8217;s mess; it turns out the National Securities Clearing Corporation, or NSCC, had asked Robinhood for $3 billion in deposit requirements. That number was reduced to $700 million, with Robinhood limiting some consumer behavior, allowing the company to open Friday morning.</li>
<li>This morning the key news stories include <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374?mod=djemalertNEWS">the mess that is Facebook Groups</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/eu-calls-15-8-billion-apple-tax-ruling-contradictory-in-appeal?sref=gni836kR">the EU is appealing a tax decision</a> that could impact tech company structure for years to come.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thanksben.com/">Ben</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/ben/">raised $2.5 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.phocassoftware.com/">Phocas Software</a> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/28/cloud-data-analytics-service-phocas-raises-34-million-to-grow-ai-global-footprint/">raised $34 million</a></li>

<li>And, finally, we are heading into earnings season, so strap in and get ready for a deluge of results.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-introduces-the-amazon-one-a-way-to-pay-with-your-palm-when-entering-stores/">Amazon introduced</a> a new biometric device, <a href="https://one.amazon.com/">Amazon One</a>, that allowed customers to pay at Amazon Go stores using their palm. Today, the company says the device is being rolled out to additional Amazon stores in Seattle &#8212; an expansion that will make the system available across eight total Amazon physical retail stores, including Amazon Go convenience stores, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, and Amazon 4-star stores.</p>
<p>Starting today, the Amazon One system is being added as an entry option at the Amazon Go location at Madison &amp; Minor in Seattle. In the next few weeks, it will also roll out to two more Amazon Go stores, at 5th &amp; Marion and Terry &amp; Stewart, the company says. That brings the system to eight Seattle locations, and sets the stage for a broader U.S. expansion in the months ahead.</p>
<p>As described, the Amazon One system uses computer vision technology to create a unique palm print for each customer, which Amazon then associates with the credit card the customer inserts upon initial setup. While the customer doesn&#8217;t have to have an Amazon account to use the service, if they do associate their account information, they&#8217;ll be able to see their shopping history on the Amazon website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Amazon says images of the palm print are encrypted and secured in the cloud, where customers&#8217; palm signatures are created. At the time of its initial launch, Amazon argued that palm prints were a more private form of biometric authentication than some other methods, because you can&#8217;t determine a customer&#8217;s identity based only on the image of their palm.</p>
<p>But Amazon isn&#8217;t just storing palm images, of course. It&#8217;s matching them to customer accounts and credit cards, effectively building a database of customer biometrics. It can also then use the data collected, like shopping history, to introduce personalized offers and recommendations over time.</p>
<p>The system raises questions about Amazon&#8217;s larger plans, as the company&#8217;s historical use of biometrics has been fairly controversial. Amazon <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S. Its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. Its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a><a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/are-amazons-flying-security-drones-a-threat-to-homeowner-privacy/"> </a>In terms of user data privacy, Amazon hasn’t been careful either — for example, by continuing to store Alexa voice data <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681423/amazon-alexa-echo-chris-coons-data-transcripts-recording-privacy">even when users deleted audio files. </a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s more is the company doesn&#8217;t just envision Amazon One as a means of entry into its own stores &#8212; they&#8217;re just a test market. In time, Amazon wants to make the technology available to third-parties, as well, including stadiums, office buildings and other non-Amazon retailers.</p>
<p>The timing of the Amazon One launch in the middle of a pandemic has helped spur customer adoption, as it allows for a contactless way to associate your credit card with your future purchases. Upon subsequent re-entry, you just hold your hand above the reader to be scanned again and let into the store.</p>
<p>These systems, however, can disadvantage a lower-socioeconomic group of customers, who prefer to pay using cash. They have to wait for special assistance in these otherwise cashless, checkout-free stores.</p>
<p>Amazon says the system will continue to roll out to more locations in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The GameStop debacle has been hailed by many as a first of its kind form of digital activism, with the &#8216;crowd&#8217; coming together to stick it to Wall Street, and specifically hedge funds that are in the business of short selling.</p>
<p>However, what if you&#8217;re a startup or scale-up caught in the middle of such an unprecedented and unstoppable set of events, requiring you to make rapid business and product decisions almost seemingly on the fly. Especially if there is significant reputational damage at stake when things don&#8217;t go to plan.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the position that trading platform Robinhood found itself in last week. Despite promising to make finance accessible for all, the company temporarily limited trading on GameStop, AMC, and other memestocks, leaving users upset that the fintech darling wasn&#8217;t living up to its name. The specific reasons may have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-limits-users-to-a-single-share-of-gamestop-and-other-stocks/">short-term and technical</a>, but the choice was viewed with suspicion by much of Robinhood&#8217;s users, not least because Robinhood has a large hedge fund as a customer. This saw the Robinhood app receive hundreds of thousands of 1-star ratings on the app stores, which Apple and Google helped remove.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what role did UX play in all of this and how could better UX choices have mitigated the Robinhood backlash? That’s the question we asked together with <a href="https://builtformars.co.uk/">Built for Mars</a> founder and UX expert Peter Ramsey, who tracked Robinhood’s product changes throughout the GameStop crisis.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>If you want more UX content, Peter and Steve write a regular UX column over at Extra Crunch, so do also check out other recent UX teardowns:</strong></p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>Specifically, we highlight 5 UX fails and suggest ways to fix them. As you’ll see, the fast moving events meant it was a continuously moving target and would have been very challenging for any product team. With that said, there are many learnings that can be applied to other existing digital products or ones you are currently building, regardless of whether or not you’re hit by the next GameStop-styled crisis.</p>
<h2>Removing Gamestop from search results</h2>
<p>Robinhood wanted to stop people buying GME shares, so they just removed Gamestop from the search results.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106552" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106552" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106552" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hidingfromsearch.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106552" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: Robinhood didn’t want people to find the page to purchase Gamestop shares, so they just removed Gamestop from the search results.</p>
<p>The fix: Robinhood absolutely should have left Gamestop in the search results. By removing it entirely the company did three things: created ambiguity, provided no explanation, and looked suspicious.</p>
<p>The rule: Great UX is about being definitive and clear, and the absence of information is the opposite of this.</p>
<h2>Blocking people from buying Gamestop shares</h2>
<p>People could still get on to the GME stock page, so Robinhood simply disabled the buy button and showed this generic message:</p>

<p>The fail: Robinhood stopped people buying shares—essentially closing the free market—and disabled the buy button with a generic message.</p>
<p>The fix: This is an unprecedented move from a brokerage, and most Robinhood users will never have considered this to be a possibility. They should have included a link to more information about why they had to take this decision. In this instance, with insufficient info, users flocked to Twitter but found no explanation on the Robinhood Twitter account either.</p>
<p>The rule: When delivering bad news which will directly affect customers, you need to have spent the time to properly explain why this has happened, how it affects them, and what happens next.</p>
<h2>Fractional shares are unavailable</h2>
<p>Robinhood is known for fractional shares, but it temporarily blocked people buying fractional shares of Gamestop. This was after Robinhood re-allowed people to buy shares, but with limits:</p>
<p>No fractional shares<br />
Limited number of shares</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106554" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106554" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106554" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FractionalShares.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: When people tried to buy fractional shares, they would put in their order, and see this error message. It explains what you can’t do, but doesn’t provide any context as to why.</p>
<p>The fix: Simple: add context explaining why they’ve had to make this decision. The company removed one of the key USPs of Robinhood, and it didn’t even mention if it’s temporary.</p>
<p>The rule: You shouldn’t just add an explanation in one place and expect all your users to see it. You should proactively place links to your detailed response in all of the places and features that are affected by your restrictions.</p>
<h2>Creating sell orders on your behalf</h2>
<p>People were claiming on Twitter that Robinhood were automatically creating sell orders, and not allowing people to cancel them. (As it turns out, the T&amp;Cs state that Robinhood has the legal right to do this.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106555" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106555" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106555" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Soldforyou.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106555" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fail: If this is true, it means that Robinhood was taking drastic action to mitigate their liquidity issues. This action directly affects the finances of their users, and still, there’s no explanation why.</p>
<p>The fix: Whilst good UX can’t make this okay, a decent explanation in context of why they’re having to do this at least provides a good rationale. Also, it’s not an ‘error’, so labelling it an error feels disingenuous.</p>
<p>The rule: Stopping your user from doing an action is one thing, but taking control and doing something that may be against their will is another. This should only be done with sufficient context, explanation and empathy.</p>
<h2>Failing to get statements</h2>
<p>People wanted to leave Robinhood, and were claiming that other brokerages needed a ‘statement of portfolio’ to initiate a switch.</p>
<p>Twitter blew up as the ‘download statement’ function was broken for people all weekend. We never saw Robinhood address it, and naturally people assumed it was a dirty tactic to keep customers from leaving.</p>
<p>The fail: When trying to download a statement users saw this error message. This didn’t just happen once, but users were claiming that it was broken and they were unable to download their statements.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106557" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106557" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2106557" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="306" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Servererror.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106557" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built For Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The fix: Unlike the other examples, this doesn’t require more context, but does need an alternative method of reaching the same result. Some features are vital and urgent, some aren’t.</p>
<p>The rule: Some actions are important enough that it’s not good enough to just fail. In these instances, you need to provide an alternative way to reach the same goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boston-based security operations company <a href="http://rapid7.com">Rapid7</a> has been making moves into the cloud recently, and this morning it announced that it has acquired Kubernetes security startup <a href="https://www.alcide.io/">Alcide</a> for $50 million.</p>
<p>As the world shifts to cloud native using Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads, it&#8217;s tricky ensuring that the containers are configured correctly to keep them safe. What&#8217;s more, Kubernetes is designed to automate the management of containers, taking humans out of the loop and making it even more imperative that the security protocols are applied in an automated fashion as well.</p>
<p>Brian Johnson, SVP of Cloud Security at Rapid7 says that this requires a specialized kind of security product and that&#8217;s why his company is buying Alcide. &#8220;Companies operating in the cloud need to be able to identify and respond to risk in real time, and looking at cloud infrastructure or containers independently simply doesn’t provide enough context to truly understand where you are vulnerable,&#8221; he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;With the addition of Alcide, we can help organizations obtain comprehensive, unified visibility across their entire cloud infrastructure and cloud-native applications so that they can continue to rapidly innovate while still remaining secure,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s purchase builds on the company&#8217;s acquisition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/rapid7-is-acquiring-divvycloud-for-145m-to-beef-up-cloud-security/">of DivvyCloud last April for $145 million</a>. That&#8217;s almost $200 million for the two companies that allow Rapid7 to help protect cloud workloads in a fairly broad way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also part of an industry trend with a number of Kubernetes security startups coming off the board in the last year as bigger companies look to enhance their container security chops by buying talent and technology. This includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/vmware-to-acquire-kubernetes-security-startup-octarine-and-fold-it-into-carbon-black/">VMware nabbing Octarine</a> last May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/">Cisco getting PortShift</a> in October and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/"> Red Hat buying StackRox</a> last month.</p>
<p>Alcide was founded in 2016 in Tel Aviv, part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/">active Israeli security </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/">startup</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/israels-maturing-cybersecurity-startup-ecosystem/"> scene</a>. It raised about $12 million along the way, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.designcrowd.com/">DesignCrowd</a> announced today it has raised $10 million AUD (about $7.6 billion USD) in pre-IPO funding. The capital will be used on hiring and product development, with the goal of accelerating the growth of <a href="https://www.brandcrowd.com/">BrandCrowd</a>, its DIY platform.</p>
<p>The new funding comes as DesignCrowd gets ready for a potential initial public offering on the Australian Securities Exchange. The round&#8217;s investors include Perennial Value Management, Alium Capital, Ellerston Capital, Regal Funds Management and CVC, along with returning backers Starfish Ventures and AirTree Ventures. DesignCrowd has now raised more than $22 million AUD in total.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007 and based in Sydney, Australia, DesignCrowd built its reputation as a design crowdsourcing platform, allowing users to get proposals from designers around the world. BrandCrowd was launched to complement DesignCrowd’s crowdsourcing/marketplace model, expanding its potential user base and differentiating it from other sites people use to find designers, like 99designs and Fiverr.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are other DIY logo makers aimed at entrepreneurs and small brands, including tools from Design Hill, Canva and Tailor Brands, BrandCrowd had an advantage from the start because it already has access to more than 800,000 designers through DesignCrowd, allowing the company to find the best logo designers from around the world for its library, said co-founder and chief executive officer Alec Lynch. BrandCrowd prefers to buy designs upfront before publishing them, since all logos are exclusive to the platform (users can pay an extra fee to remove logos from its library).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2IDUalpt7n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/designcrowd-series-b/">DesignCrowd Raises $6M To Grow Its Creative Marketplace In The West</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DesignCrowd Raises $6M To Grow Its Creative Marketplace In The West&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/04/designcrowd-series-b/embed/#?secret=2IDUalpt7n" data-secret="2IDUalpt7n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>BrandCrowd customers pay a one-off fee to download a logo and can sign up for monthly or annual subscriptions. Many use both platforms, Lynch said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, if a small business wants to start by getting a custom logo design from a designer on DesignCrowd, we then allow them to use that logo in our DIY design tools on BrandCrowd to make everything else they might need, from business card designs to Instagram posts and email signature,&#8221; said Lynch. &#8220;They can even make modifications to their logo on BrandCrowd using our logo editor tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>DesignCrowd’s net revenues in 2020 grew 54% year-over-year, due primarily to BrandCrowd. The company says BrandCrowd saw over five million sign-ups over the past 12 months, with more than half of its revenue from the United States.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company experienced some headwinds in March and April 2020, Lynch said, but then global demand for online design rebounded and began increasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hypothesis is that the pandemic led to more people starting new businesses in the second half of 2020 and more people needing design for those businesses, which was helpful for us,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In addition to this small &#8216;boom&#8217; in small businesses starting, we think the pandemic has probably accelerated an existing trend of businesses sourcing design online rather than offline.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, </span><a href="https://getcarbon.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Nigerian fintech startup, made its financials public for the first time. Although typical for foreign private startups, it&#8217;s almost an anomaly in Africa. There have been rare cases in the past, for instance, when Rocket Internet had to include Jumia&#8217;s financials in its yearly reports after going public. At the time, the German investment outfit was a founding shareholder in the African-based unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carbon has been hailed for transparency and openness, it remains to be seen if it&#8217;s a trend other African startups are willing to follow. Posting audited financials can prove detrimental for a private African company for several reasons, ranging from bad marketing and PR if huge losses are incurred to regulatory clampdown if the company performs well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $15.8 million VC-backed company, Carbon was founded by </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chijiokedozie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chijioke Dozie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngozidozie"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ngozi Dozie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012. The brothers started the company in a niche digital lending market, but now, the company offers a plethora of services from savings to payments and investments.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Chijioke Dozie, the CEO, spoke to TechCrunch in 2019, he cited recruitment purposes and clientele trust as reasons why the company made its financials public &#8212; an exercise it has done every second quarter for two years. It&#8217;s a tradition Dozie hopes the company will keep this year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our annual report will be released in the second quarter after our financial audit has been concluded. If you recall, we released a year in review in January 2020 before we released the fiscal year of 2019 report,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s annual reports reveal numbers on gross earnings, profit/loss before and after-tax, net impairment loss, total assets, liabilities and equity, among others. The company&#8217;s year on review, on the other hand, highlights payments processed, customer base, loans disbursed and investments made on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we wait for its annual report for 2020, its year in review offers a sneak peek into how Carbon grew the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the fiscal year 2020, the company, which has about 659,000 customers, said it processed ₦96.54 billion (~$241.35 million), up 89% compared to the same period a year ago. For its lending arm, disbursement volume was ₦25.21 billion (~$63 million), up 9.1% from FY2019. Also, ₦13.02 billion (~$32.55 million) worth of investments was made on the platform, representing a 365% increase from the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, factors that influenced these numbers last year included launching an iOS app that drove customer acquisition, introducing its </span><a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/what-ussd-why-does-it-matter-mobile-financial-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USSD banking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature for lower-income customers and a social chat feature to enable faster transactions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in its quest to become a digital bank, Carbon acquired a microfinance bank license. According to Dozie, the license means that Carbon&#8217;s customers are afforded additional protection through depositors&#8217; insurance via the NDIC. The Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal insurance agency, protects depositors and guarantees the settlement of insured funds when a financial institution can no longer repay their deposits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in place, Dozie says the typical Carbon wallet is now a full-fledged bank account, and customers can perform transactions on the platform as they would with any bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Carbon, other startups on the continent have followed suit by releasing year-on-year metrics. In recent memory, most of these startups play in the fintech and crypto-exchange space. But Carbon remains unique amongst this crop of companies as it releases both transaction stats and real insights into its financial performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas transaction stats tend to highlight a seemingly explosive year-on-year growth of a company, a comprehensive view of financials will likely show a mixed performance. For instance, Carbon generated $17.5 million in revenue for FY2019, up 68% from 2018. For that same period, it recorded a 23% decrease in its profit after tax numbers, a 222% rise in total liabilities and 107% increase in assets finishing the year off with a 6% increase in total equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what these numbers look like for 2020. But that&#8217;s not the only event to keep an eye on. In addition to its $10 million Series A from SA-based Net1 UEPS Technologies and a $5million debt financing in 2019 from Lendable, Dozie says the digital bank, which also has a presence in Kenya, is ramping efforts to raise a Series B round soon to consolidate its position on the continent.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New space startup <a href="https://www.blushiftaerospace.com">bluShift</a> wants to bring a new kind of propellant to the small satellite launching market, with rockets powered by bio-derived rocket fuels. These differ from traditional fuels in that they offer safety advantages during handling, and ecological advantages during production and use. The startup has been working on its solid rocket biofuel since its founding in 2014, and has received grants from the Maine Technology Institute and NASA&#8217;s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to refine its fuel formula and rocket engine design to help it get to this point.</p>
<p>The company achieved a milestone on Sunday with its first rocket launch &#8212; a low-altitude flight of a small sounding rocket, called Stardust 1.0. It&#8217;s a single-stage prototype, which can only carry 18 lbs of payload and is designed to achieve suborbital space. That may not seem like much, but it is enough to put small research equipment up into suborbital space, at costs that put launches within range for small companies and academic institutions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2106488" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2106488" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2106488" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bluShift_013021-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2106488" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knack Factory/Courtesy Aerospace</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stardust 1.0 is designed to be reusable, though it&#8217;s still a prototype, and the company is also working on Stardust 2.0, which is a second prototype that&#8217;s expected to increase the payload capacity and act as the primary building block for its subsequent production commercial rockets, including Starless Rogue, a two-stage launcher for suborbital missions, and Red Dwarf, a three-stage, 66-lb capacity launch vehicle that can reach low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s launch looked like it might not have been on track to go well at first, with an initial attempt seeing the rocket&#8217;s ignition light &#8212; but without a takeoff. After resetting for a second try, there wasn&#8217;t any ignition. Finally the rocket did take off late in the day, with a flight that the company said &#8220;went perfectly&#8221; on a follow-up call with media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter blocked access to dozens of accounts in India on Monday, including some that belonged to high-profile individuals, to comply with a “legal demand,” prompting confusion and anger among users who are seeking an explanation for this action.</p>
<p>Among those whose accounts have been withheld in India include Caravan (a news outlet that conducts investigative journalism), political commentator Sanjukta Basu, activist Hansraj Meena, actor Sushant Singh, and Shashi Shekhar Vempati, chief executive of state-run broadcasting agency Prasar Bharti. Accounts of at least two politicians with Aam Aadmi Party &#8212; Preeti Sharma Menon and Jarnail Singh &#8212; that governs the National Capital Territory of Delhi have also been withheld.</p>
<p>At least two popular accounts linked with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests/india-cuts-internet-near-delhi-as-hundreds-of-farmers-begin-hunger-strike-idUSKBN29Z08R">ongoing protests by farmers</a> &#8212; Kisan Ekta Morcha and Tractor2Twitr &#8212; in India have also been restricted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At this point, it remains unconfirmed who all have pursued the legal action that prompted Twitter to restrict these accounts in India. The accounts remain accessible to users outside of the country. At least in the case of political commentator Basu, Twitter told him that Indian authorities had issued the legal demand against some accounts that included his and that it was talking with the authorities.</p>
<p>Citing a government source, AFP journalist Bhuvan Bagga <a href="https://twitter.com/Bhuvanbagga/status/1356197006440603649">reported</a> earlier today that India&#8217;s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology directed Twitter to block around 250 tweets and accounts that were using a hashtag to make what it alleged were false, intimidatory and provocative tweets over the weekend. He adds: &#8220;Incitement to genocide is a grave threat to public order and therefore the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) ordered for blocking of these Twitter accounts and Tweets under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.&#8221; A person familiar with the matter corroborated this claim to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson said, “many countries have laws that may apply to Tweets and/or Twitter account content. In our continuing effort to make our services available to people everywhere, if we receive a properly scoped request from an authorized entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time. Transparency is vital to protecting freedom of expression, so we have a notice policy for withheld content.”</p>
<p>Vinod Jose, executive editor of Caravan, said Twitter didn&#8217;t inform the publication that it was withholding its Twitter account.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Section 69A and the IT Blocking Rules prevent intermediaries like Twitter from disclosing any information about blocking of an account or tweet. The confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the IT Blocking Rules creates a bizarre situation where citizens have the right to challenge blocking of online content but they are unable to do so because they don&#8217;t have access to these legal orders,&#8221; said New Delhi-based advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation, explaining the limitations of this law that citizens face in the country.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s move comes at a time when several Indian journalists are facing charges of sedition over their reporting and social media posts about a protest by farmers last week. Among those journalists who are facing these cases are Rajdeep Sardesai, a high-profile news anchor, and Vinod Jose, executive editor of Caravan.</p>
<p>Twitter, which has amassed about 75 million users in India, has long faced criticism about the way it handles its operations in the country.</p>
<p>Unlike in the United States, Twitter has historically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/twitter-flags-indian-politicians-years-old-tweet-for-violating-its-policy/">miserably failed to perform the tiniest level of content moderation</a> in India. Most trending topics in India appear either manipulated, paid for, vile, abusive, useless, out-dated or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/india-protests-viral-tweets-police-brutality">dangerous</a> &#8212; and sometimes, all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a handful of benefits for the startup ecosystem and to accelerate the growth of digital services in the annual budget Monday as the South Asian nation looks to revive the economy that was severely-hit amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Sitharaman said the nation has earmarked 1,500 crore Indian rupees ($205.3 million) to incentivize the adoption of digital payments. Market leaders Paytm, Google Pay, and PhonePe are locked in an intense battle to drive people in India to pay digitally, but the firms have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">struggled to find a viable business model</a> for their core payments service.</p>
<p>Many firms have urged the government to scrap merchant discount rate (MDR), which prevents firms from charging merchants for processing transactions. (Firms in India have agreed that they won&#8217;t charge individuals for processing their payments, but have suggested that they should be able to charge merchants.) No announcement on this front was made today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The budget also proposed extending social security benefits to gig workers and other platform workers and launch a website to help these workers find employment, said Sitharaman. These workers will be protected by minimum wages, she said in the proposal. Additionally, she said women would be allowed to work in all categories and also during night-shifts with adequate protection. &#8220;At the same time, compliance burden on employers will be reduced with single registration and licensing, and online returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the budget, Sitharaman also proposed some tax relief for startup employees when they sell their stakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;During their formative years, startups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) to attract and retain highly talented employees. ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees. Currently, ESOPs are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. This leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term. In order to give a boost to the start-up ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation also proposed broadening the definition of small businesses, increasing the threshold for capitalization to 2 crore Indian rupees (about $275,000), up from existing limit of 50 lakh Indian rupees ($68,750). This will allow many more businesses to come under the small business umbrella and avail relevant benefits such as some tax concessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, considering the fact that in the initial years, a startup may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The budget also proposed incentives for incorporation of one-person companies, a move that Sitharaman said will help companies &#8220;grow without restriction on paid up capital and turnover, allowing conversion into any other type of company at any time, reducing the residency limit for an Indian citizen to set up a one-person company from 182 days to 120 days, and allow also non-resident Indians to incorporate one-person companies in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry executives in recent weeks said they were also hoping that India will  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/us-says-india-italy-and-turkey-digital-taxes-are-discriminatory-but-wont-take-any-actions-for-now/">address the digital services tax</a> the country began imposing on foreign firms last year. This was not addressed in the new budget.</p>
<p>Sitharaman also said New Delhi will put together a plan aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the electronics value chain. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here, I propose a scheme focussed on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones, electronic equipment and semi-conductor packaging.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and many other companies, has mastered the art of using Twitter to harness fans and promote himself and his interests across as wide an audience as possible. Using some of that momentum, last night he made a vocal debut on a newer platform &#8212; Silicon Valley’s hottest startup right now, Clubhouse, which lets people join rooms to listen in on conversations between hosts and guests.</p>
<p>Musk, fielding a series of mostly softball questions, used the session to &#8220;talk to his base&#8221; on topics ranging from space travel, colonies on Mars, crypto, AI and Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>He managed to bust a few myths about his &#8220;alternative&#8221; positions on several subjects, and at times managed to sound far more nuanced than his meme-propelled, trolling Twitter feed. For example, i<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n contrast to previous expositions on the viability of living on Mars, Musk didn’t paint a rose-colored vision in his conversation. Instead, he said that while Mars exploration is a worthwhile effort to keep humankind alive, life would be hard.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The last quarter of the interview then veered off radically when Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, was brought in (apparently by Musk, but there was a hint of co-ordination behind the scenes).</p>
<p>Suddenly, Musk turned interviewer and had Tenev unpack what had happened in the last week with the Wall Street Bets debacle.</p>
<p>Some saw the Clubhouse room as a massive PR stunt by the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz &#8212; which, in addition to being a big investor in Robinhood and Clubhouse, backs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/astranis-raises-90-million-for-its-next-gen-satellite-broadband-internet-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startups</a> that work with Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>
<p>With more than 5,000 people in the room (breaking Clubhouse&#8217;s previously maintained limits), hundreds of journalists and live streams on YouTube, we did get a little taste of how A16Z&#8217;s new media efforts &#8212; which effectively seek to disintermediate journalists in the public discourse about technology &#8212; might work.</p>
<p>And from the looks of events like last night&#8217;s, like it or leave it, for now at least, it&#8217;s a part of the mix.</p>
<p><strong>Below is our semi-live blog of the session: </strong></p>
<p>As I type this Elon Musk has joined <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">Clubhouse</a> for his first-ever in-person live session and the boundaries of the app have already been tested, with the usual limit of 5,000 people for a room getting passed, and amplified further with Musk fans creating secondary listening rooms on Clubhouse, Youtube and more: <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355983231988862978?s=21">live-streamed here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cba53J1jyPM">here</a> for example.</p>
<p>I am dusting off my creaky live-blogging skillz to cover the interview&#8230; and will update this post as we go (apologies for the appalling typos in the interim).</p>
<p>Musk initially talked about going to Mars and said it was likely to be “hard” for the early pioneers, but that the endeavor ultimately would be a matter of keeping the “candle of civilization alive in the dark”.</p>
<p>Asked if he believed in aliens, he said there wasn’t a single piece of conclusive evidence for the existence of aliens, although it’s “quite possible” there is such a thing as Alien technology, at least at a “7/11” level, and a joked that the evidence so far suggests they might be at the “500 Megapixel camera” or “at least iPhone 6 level”.</p>
<p>He said his kids were not quite into the idea of going to Mars.</p>
<p>Asked about memes online he quipped: “He who controls the memes controls the universe” and it’s about what “influences the zeitgeist”. Memes are a complex form of communication, he said: unlike pictures, memes are “10,000 words not 1,000 words”. They are aspirational and funny. “I love memes, they can be very insightful,” he added.</p>
<p>Does he try to sound crazy on Twitter? “I started crazy on Twitter,” he joked.</p>
<p>He said he doesn’t follow memes himself. Instead, he has “meme dealers,&#8221; friends who pick out and send him memes they think he would like.</p>
<p>He talked about his company <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> and also added that Tesla had one of the strongest AI teams in the world.</p>
<p>With AI, it’s about “how do we stay relevant” and at least “stay ‘along for the ride’ in the good scenario” and couple our minds with AI to harness its power.</p>
<p>“People are already a cyborg,&#8221; he said, referring to a tertiary layer in the form of smartphones. The bit-rate of us typing into a phone is 100 bits. So it’s like trying to talk to a tree, for our smartphones. So with a direct neural interface, we increase it by a huge magnitude, and also spend longer time with a higher magnitude of processing because of this.</p>
<p>You can decide if you want to be a robot or a person. But when you wake in the morning you wouldn’t have to be the same ‘mind’ as you were yesterday. It’s analogous to a video game, not unlike the “Altered Carbon” Netflix series.</p>
<p>There are primitive versions of this in the Neuralink idea, with tiny wires going into your brain.</p>
<p>He claimed Neuralink will be releasing new videos in a month or so, such as of a monkey playing videos with their mind. He didn’t appear to comment on the ethics behind this (one of the many times Musk was not challenged in what he said). The value of the early implant will be enormous and outweigh the risks, is his take.</p>
<p>The moderators asked him about educating 5-year-olds: what should they learn these days?</p>
<p>Musk talked about how video games engage children, but explaining “the why” was important.</p>
<p>“We are programmed to forget the low &#8216;probability of things&#8217; if they aren’t relevant,&#8221; he said. For example, taking apart an engine and putting it together. We need tools, so we understand the relevance. It’s better than taking a “course on wrenches”.</p>
<p>He was asked “why are there not more Elon Musks”? His hard-knocks response: “If you need encouraging words, don’t do a startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also gave his two bitcoins on crypto.</p>
<p>A friend sent him a slice of cake using bitcoin in 2013. “I should have bought it 8 years ago.” he said. “At this point Bitcoin is a good thing. I am a supporter. I am late to the party, but I am a supporter.”</p>
<p>He said it was clear Bitcoin was getting broader acceptance by the financial world. “I don’t have a strong opinion on other currencies.” Dogecoin, he said, was made as joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies, but “fate loves irony.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it also seems to love chaos, in Musk&#8217;s vioew. “The most entertaining outcome is the most likely,&#8221; he said. The most ironic outcome would be Dogecoin becoming the currency of the future.</p>
<p>But maybe not if some social platforms have anything to do with it. He said he made a joke about Bitcoin and his Twitter account got locked.</p>
<p>Attention then turned to his electric car company Tesla. The target is to make 20 million cars and trucks per year. This is a wild &#8212; and again, very unchallenged &#8212; statement: recall that in 2020 it made less than 500,000 cars, and even less trucks. That a long road to travel, in other words.</p>
<p>He also had some thoughts on self-driving. Autonomous vehicles could reach the point where you would rely on them for a significant amount of time in the a week. Autonomous cars would take over for roughly a third of the hours in a weeks, so 60 hours instead of 12, eventually, in his projection. (Again, very blue sky statements here, as there are no fully autonomous cars in free use on roads at this point.)</p>
<p>He also had some thoughts on work in the pandemic and post-pandemic world. Working remotely on Zoom has been tricky for him, he said. “Fear is not the mind-killer, context switching the mind-killer,” he said, of having to switch between disparate subjects on calls.</p>
<p>Would he start another company to address Covid-19 in some way? He joked that he pretty much has his hands full with Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company and others to date.</p>
<p>He talked about the huge advances in vaccine technology, such as the MRNA tech which made the Covid-19 vaccine possible. He seemed very bullish about the vaccine.</p>
<p>While the news today is about the the dearth of supply in vaccines, it seems like he thinks the space for Covid-19 medicines, and specifically inoculations against it, is a crowded market longer term. “There is going to be an avalanche of vaccine,” coming he said. “I guarantee you &#8216;it&#8217; will be thrown away this year.”</p>
<p>There could be an opportunity for producing these in his current enterprises, he hinted. “The Tesla machine can make a bazillion doses super fast,&#8221; he claimed. (Again, no challenge or follow up on that one, either.)</p>
<p>All in all, he made his poison clear on vaccines: “I am not an anti-vaxxer, I am a pro-vaxxer.”</p>
<p>Then a turn to his first years in technology. In Silicon Valley in the early days, he said, he had to ask himself: “Do I watch the internet being built in front of me or do I get involved?”</p>
<p>Still, he recalled being “too shy” to speak to anyone in the lobby of Netscape.</p>
<p>Then he tried to code. He wrote the first maps and directions on the internet. By hand. The Web site only worked during the night as he was using the server on the computer during the day to code.</p>
<p>Marc Andreessen, who was also on the clubhouse session, then quipped that he would get a job the next time he hangs out in the lobby of one of his companies.</p>
<p>Musk gave a hat-tip to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_King">The Last King</a>’ and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81002370">Cobra Kai</a> for his streaming enjoyment. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The Expanse’s</a> plot lines sometimes seem too fantastical to him, he said. He was recommended Devs, Mythic Quest and Ravens Banquet by moderators. Tenet was “pretty good” too, he said. Did he understand it? “If you think too hard about it, it’s not going to make complete sense, but it’s a good movie.”</p>
<p>His knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</a>, remains impressively intact.</p>
<p>Then, a big switching of the gears, as “Vlad The Stock Impaler” was brought into the Clubhouse room to talk about the Game Stop phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Vlad” &#8212; more specifically Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood &#8212; began with an, at times, stumbling attempt to explain what happened last week but was eventually interrogated more thoroughly by Musk.</p>
<p>Musk at this point turned interviewer, and we&#8217;re here doing a bit more comprehensive transcribing because it&#8217;s worth keeping Tenev&#8217;s words in full.</p>
<p>“All right, tell us what really happened. Give us the inside scoop,” Musk said</p>
<p>“This has been a very surreal weekend and week for me,” said Vlad.</p>
<p>Vlad said “one of the really great things is all the people “coming out of the woodwork” to offer support for the company to offer advice. He said this was his first time using Clubhouse. He then made a jokey remark about being an adherent of the “simulation hypothesis”.</p>
<p>Musk brought him back: “The people demand an answer and they want to know the truth.”</p>
<p>Vlad said: “So there&#8217;s an introducing broker-dealer called Robinhood Financial, and that basically is the app that you know and love, it processes trades. You&#8217;re a customer of Robinhood Financial. Then there&#8217;s a clearing broker-dealer, Robinhood Securities, that clears and settles the trades. And then we have Robinhood Crypto, which is our Crypto business… All of these are different entities that are differently operated. So, basically Wednesday of last week. We just had, you know, unprecedented volume, unprecedented load on the system. A lot of these, you know, so-called meme stocks were, you know, going viral on social media, and people were people are joining Robinhood and there was a lot of net buy activity on them.”</p>
<p>He said Robinhood became number one on the iOS App Store and pretty close if not number one on Google Play store.</p>
<p>“Thursday morning I’m sleeping. At 3:30am Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So, basically as a broker as a clearing broker. And this is where RobinHood Securities comes in. We have to put up money to the NSCC based on some factors including things like the volatility of the trading activity into certain securities. And this is is the equities business so it&#8217;s based on, stock trading and not options trading or anything else.</p>
<p>So, they give us a file with the deposit and the request was around $3 billion, which is, you know, about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.”</p>
<p>Musk: This is not an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula that they use to calculate that”</p>
<p>Vlad: Just to give context, Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it&#8217;s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right. So, basically, the details are, we don&#8217;t have the full details, it&#8217;s a little bit of an opaque formula, but there&#8217;s a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And that&#8217;s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things although it&#8217;s not fully transparent. So, there are ways to reverse engineer it, but it&#8217;s not kind of publicly shared.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s a special component, which is discretionary. So that kind of acts as a multiplier, and basically</p>
<p>Musk: Discretionary meaning like it&#8217;s just their opinion”</p>
<p>Vlad: There&#8217;s definitely more, more than just their opinion.</p>
<p>Musk: Everyone wants to know, did something shady go down here? It seems weird that you get a sudden $3 billion demand, you know, at 3.30am in the morning. Just suddenly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Vlad: I wouldn&#8217;t impute shadiness to it or anything like that and actually you know the NSCC was reasonable.</p>
<p>They worked with us to actually lower it. So, it wasn’t unprecedented activity. I don&#8217;t have the full context about, you know, what was going on in the NSCC make these calculations.</p>
<p>Musk: Is anyone holding you hostage right now?</p>
<p>Vlad: Thanks for asking. But anyways, so this was obviously nerve-racking, and I actually was asleep at this point, you know, the operations team was fielding this at three o&#8217;clock. And then, you know, we got back, we put our heads together. Our Chief Operating Officer basically said, look, let&#8217;s call up the higher-ups at the NSCC and kind of figure out what&#8217;s going on. Maybe there&#8217;s some way we can work with them. And basically, there was another call. And they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion…. But still a high number.</p>
<p>Vlad said the team then proposed how to manage the risk through the day “marking these volatiles stocks that were driving the activity, positioning closing only. And then, at about an hour before the market closed market opened. So, at 5.30, or five in the morning, they [the NSCC] came back and they said okay, the deposit [should be] 700 million, which we then deposited and paid promptly. And then, everything was fine.</p>
<p>So, that that essentially explains why we had to mark the symbols ‘position closing only’, and also why, you know, we knew this was a bad outcome for customers… Part of what&#8217;s been really difficult is Robinhood stands for, you know, democratizing access to stocks and, yes, we want, we want to give people access so we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements. And so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.</p>
<p>Musk: Who controls the clearinghouse?</p>
<p>Vlad: It&#8217;s a consortium. It&#8217;s not quite a government agency. You know, I, I don&#8217;t really know the details all that. But, you know, and to be fair… there was legitimate turmoil in the markets. These are unprecedented events with these meme stocks, there was a lot of activity. So, there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants, higher requirements, so it&#8217;s not entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>But we did operational processes to make sure that customers that had positions could sell their open positions because obviously restricting someone…We got a lot of questions about ‘you had to restrict buying, why didn&#8217;t you also restrict selling?’ And the fact of the matter is, people get really pissed-off if they&#8217;re holding stock and they want to sell it and they can’t. So that’s categorically worse. Lots of other brokers, I think, we&#8217;re in the same situation. Robinhood who was in the news, but you just sort of heard this industry-wide, other brokers, were basically restricted in the same exact activity.</p>
<p>Musk: So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head. Either you put up this money or else. Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river? Or did you have no choice? And if you had no choice that&#8217;s understandable. But then, you know, we’ve got to find out why you have no choice. And who are the people that are saying you have no choice?</p>
<p>Vlad: I think that&#8217;s fair. We have to comply with these requirements, financial institutions have requirements. The formula, behind these requirements… it would obviously be ideal if there was a little bit more transparency so we could plan better around that, but to be fair, we were able to open and serve our customers and 24 hours later, our team raised over a billion dollars in capital so that when we do open tomorrow morning we&#8217;ll be able to, kind of, relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.</p>
<p>Musk: Will there be any limits?</p>
<p>Vlad: Well I think there&#8217;s always going to be some theoretical limit, we don&#8217;t have infinite capital, right? And on Friday, there were limits. So, there&#8217;s always going to have to be some limit, I think the question is, will the limits be high enough to the point where they won&#8217;t impact 99.9-plus percent of customers. So if someone were to deposit $100 billion and decide to trade in one stock that wouldn&#8217;t be possible.</p>
<p>Musk: If you had no choice then you had no choice. It’s a ‘gun to the head situation’. That’s understandable.</p>
<p>Vlad: Yeah, these are unprecedented times, and to be fair to those guys they&#8217;ve been reasonable. So, I think the one thing that is maybe not clear to people is Robinhood is a participant in the financial system. So we have to work with all of these counter-parties, so we do get a lot of questions about, you know, ‘why do you work with market makers?’, why you work with clearinghouses. Vertically integrating… I mean it&#8217;s hard enough to build an introducing… clearing broker-dealer… not too many people have done that. But the financial system that allows customers to trade shares is sort of a complex web of multiple parties… Everyone says it could be better. It could be improved. It&#8217;s just the necessity of trading equities in the US, that you have to do all these things.</p>
<p>Musk: To what degree are you beholden to Citadel?</p>
<p>Vlad: There was a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this and that&#8217;s just false. Market makers execute our trades, they execute trades of every broker-dealer. This was a clearinghouse decision, and it was just based on the capital requirements. So, from our perspective, you know, Citadel and other market makers weren&#8217;t involved in that.</p>
<p>Musk: But wouldn’t they have a strong say on who got put in charge of that organization, since it&#8217;s an industry consortium, not a government regulatory agency?</p>
<p>Vlad: I don&#8217;t have any reason to believe that. I think that&#8217;s just like, you know, then you&#8217;re getting into kind of the conspiracy theories a little bit. So, I just have no reason to believe that that&#8217;s the case, you know.</p>
<p>Musk: Okay. Well, I guess we’ll see what happens with directions. Hopefully, that was insightful or at least a little bit entertaining. “Are you not entertaining?” he said. [Apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA">a reference to the movie &#8216;Gladiator&#8217;</a>]</p>
<p>The moderators then thank Musk and Vlad for coming on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Fun claim: Musk said he didn’t know Clubhouse existed up until a week ago.</p>
<p>The moderators wrapped up the session and closed out by playing “Starman” by David Bowie…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speaking is one of the hardest parts of learning a new language, especially if you don’t have someone to practice with regularly. <a href="https://elsaspeak.com/en/">ELSA</a> is an app that helps by using speech recognition technology to correct pronunciation. Based in San Francisco and Ho Chi Minh City, ELSA announced today it has raised a $15 million Series B, led by VI (Vietnam Investments) Group and SIG. Other participants included returning investors Google’s AI-focused fund Gradient Ventures, SOSV and Monk’s Hill Ventures, along with Endeavor Catalyst and Globant Ventures.</p>
<p>The capital will be used to expand ELSA’s operations in Latin America and build a scalable B2B platform, allowing companies and educational organizations to offers the app’s coaching services to employees or students. Founded in 2015, ELSA, which stands for English Language Speech Assistant, now claims more than 13 million users. Its last round of funding was a $7 million Series A announced in 2019.</p>

<p>In addition to Latin America, ELSA will also focus on expanding in Vietnam, India and Japan, where it saw high demand last year. The company recently formed a partnership with IDP and British Council, which owns the widely-used IELTS English language test and now recommends ELSA to for test preparation. ELSA is also working with language schools in Vietnam like IMAP and Speak Up, online learning platform YOLA and corporate clients including Kimberly Clark, Intel and ATAD.</p>
<p>ELSA co-founder and chief executive officer Vu Van told TechCrunch that many users want to improve their English speaking proficiency for job opportunities and to increase their earning potential. In Vietnam, India and Brazil, people with higher English speaking proficiency can earn about two to three times more than their colleagues, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This motivation drives a lot of demand for our English learner community in Vietnam, India and Brazil, especially during COVID-19 when we’ve seen enormous interest from the LatAm region as well,&#8221; Van added.</p>

<p>In Vietnam, where Van is from, English learners spend a lot of their disposable income on online or offline English training. &#8220;However, the majority of English learners still struggle to improve their speaking skill because other people don’t understand them or they’re afraid to speak it,&#8221; she said. ELSA was designed to give them an accessible resource to help improve their pronunciation and confidence when speaking English.</p>
<p>Other apps focused on English pronunciation include FluentU and Say It. Van said one of ELSA’s main advantages is its proprietary voice recognition AI tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s unique about our AI is that we’ve collected the largest amount of accented English voice data from millions of users that we have used to train our AI model over the last few years, which gives us a higher accuracy in recognizing and understanding non-native English speakers around the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The other existing voice recognition technologies available, by comparison, might understand native speakers well but have a hard time understanding non-native accented English learner communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of providing feedback about individual words, ELSA’s app also corrects individual sounds and gives users detailed information on how to improve their pronunciation, including &#8220;very advanced prosodic speaking features like intonation, rhythm and fluency to help them speak English more naturally, something that our competitors don’t offer,&#8221; Van added.</p>
