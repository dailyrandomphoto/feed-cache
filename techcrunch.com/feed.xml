										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder confirmed it&#8217;s exploring the development of a new feature called Swipe Party which offers a way to make sorting through possible matches a more social experience. According to details spotted in the Tinder mobile app&#8217;s code, Swipe Party requires access to the phone&#8217;s camera and microphone so your friends can &#8220;see and hear you while vetting prospects.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;Tinder with Friends&#8221;-style experience builds on what&#8217;s already a popular offline activity. Today, friends often swipe through the app together making joint decisions on which profiles the Tinder account holder should try to match with. In the case of Swipe Party, however, it seems as if Tinder is looking to make this a virtual experience where a user could invite a &#8220;guest&#8221; to join their swiping session in order to give their feedback remotely.</p>
<p>This follows on the broader trend of co-browsing apps, as with Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/shareplay-powers-new-ways-to-stay-connected-and-share-experiences-in-facetime/">SharePlay</a>, or co-watching videos with friends as enabled by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/disney-rolls-out-support-for-apples-shareplay-co-viewing-experience-over-facetime/">Disney+&#8217;s</a> co-viewing features, for example. The trend was already growing in popularity but was then further amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic and its social distancing requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254642" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Swipe Party feature was first spotted in the Tinder Android app&#8217;s code by the Dutch website <a href="https://www.gratisdatingtips.nl/tinder-swipe-party/">GratisDatingTips</a>, then reblogged as a rumor by outlets like <a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/apps/news/tinder/159597-tinder-swipe-party-mode-rumoured">Pocket-lint</a> and <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/tinder-dating-app-may-get-Swipe-Party-feature_id137605">PhoneArena</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch subsequently confirmed there are also references to Swipe Party in the Tinder app for iOS, according to an analysis by tech analyst Steve Moser. (See images below).</p>

<p>According to the code snippets, Swipe Party would see Tinder users inviting friends to join a swiping session. These friends would create guest accounts on Tinder by offering their phone number, validating it with a code, then entering their name and date of birth before joining the &#8220;party.&#8221;</p>
<p>While tech companies regularly build, test and experiment with new features &#8212; many of which are never released to the wider public &#8212; what makes the existence of Swipe Party more interesting is how it ties into Tinder parent company Match&#8217;s larger plans to bring more audio and video experiences to its line of dating apps.</p>
<p>The company last August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/match-group-to-add-live-audio-and-video-to-its-dating-app-portfolio-starting-in-2021/">said it planned to introduce audio and video chat</a> features, including group live video, to its dating app portfolio over the next 12 to 24 months. That means we would see some of these additions begin to show up later this year. Match said these new features would be powered by innovations from Hyperconnect, the Korean social networking company and app maker that became Match&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date at<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/"> $1.73 billion.</a> It&#8217;s not clear that Swipe Party is related to that specific roadmap, which also includes plans for some kind of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/match-group-details-plans-for-a-dating-metaverse-tinders-virtual-goods-based-economy/">dating &#8220;metaverse&#8221; </a>with a virtual goods-based economy.</p>
<p>But the feature does fit in with Tinder&#8217;s recent efforts to become a more interactive and social app instead of just a place to swipe profiles.</p>
<p>Last year, Tinder took its first major steps on that front with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/tinder-adds-a-new-home-for-interactive-social-features-with-launch-of-tinder-explore/">a new section in its app called &#8220;Explore,</a>&#8221; where it now highlights the app&#8217;s interactive elements. This includes the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">interactive video series Swipe Night,</a> interest-based matching, lightweight chat, and more.</p>
<p>Tinder confirmed Swipe Party&#8217;s development, but declined to share further details about the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are always exploring features to help our members connect in new, fun ways,&#8221; a company spokesperson told TechCrunch, when asked about Swipe Party and its functionality.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Match Group&#8217;s portfolio, the company has also experimented with having friends play matchmaker. Its dating app Ship lets friends engage in group chats about dating prospects, but this was text-based chat not video or audio.</p>
<p>This would also not be the first time Tinder experimented with some sort of social video in its app, either.</p>
<p>The company had previously tested, then discarded, a feature called &#8220;Tinder Mixer,&#8221; which offered users a way to play games and video chat with others nearby. Tinder in more recent years also embraced video in other ways, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/tinder-begins-testing-its-first-video-feature-tinder-loops/">video profiles</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/face-to-face-tinders-opt-in-video-chat-feature-is-now-rolling-out-globally/">one-to-one video calls.</a> But to date, Tinder&#8217;s growth has been limited by its nature as a dating app &#8212; that means (generally speaking) only some subset of single people will install the app and create profiles. Swipe Party could allow those who aren&#8217;t Tinder users to try the app, as well. And they wouldn&#8217;t have to be single to do so.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What happens to both NFT activity and NFT prices when their backing asset, if we can call ether that, rapidly loses value?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Major cryptocurrencies are currently enduring price declines from already depressed levels. It&#8217;s a selloff, though likely not one large enough to shake the confidence of the crypto faithful. Still, the impact of falling crypto prices on assets priced in crypto should prove interesting.</p>
<p>The NFT market, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchains-vie-for-nft-market-but-ethereum-still-dominates-report">largely built on the Ethereum blockchain</a>, has seen a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/making-sense-of-opensea-at-a-13b-valuation/">rapid ascent in value and trading volumes</a> as the value of ether, the native token of its chain, appreciated massively. What will happen to NFTs in a market in which ether is falling? Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>How much of a selloff?</h2>
<p>In the last week, bitcoin has fallen by 8.6%, ether by 7.8% and Solana&#8217;s token by just around 12%, <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per CoinMarketCap data</a>. Those are sharp declines, even for the more volatile crypto market. From recent highs, the declines are even steeper. From all-time highs set during Q4 2021, bitcoin is off by around 35%, ether 28%, and Solana&#8217;s token about 40%.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-ether-prices-fall-along-with-tech-stocks-11641471483?reflink=e2twmkts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal has a pretty succinct explanation</a> today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies led by bitcoin and ether slumped as part of the broader tech selloff, cementing their status among investors as risky assets quickly dumped in moments of market stress.</p>
<p>The falls were triggered by Federal Reserve minutes that showed officials are eyeing a faster timetable for raising interest rates this year. As rates rise, holding volatile investments that produce little income becomes less attractive compared with government bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply: As rates rise, less risky assets are more attractive in yield terms; this makes riskier assets less attractive and therefore worth less. Declines <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/software-stocks-get-punched-in-the-face-again/">in the value of high-growth software stocks</a> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are likely driven by similar dynamics in the crypto market. Bitcoin is not an uncorrelated asset, it seems clear at this point.</span></p>
<p>But what does all of that mean for NFTs? A few things.</p>
<h2>Prices, trading and correlations</h2>
<p>The boom in NFT value and trading activity does not have a single driving factor. Instead, myriad inputs have been at play, from celebrity involvement to improving technology, better public awareness and more.</p>
<p>Also involved, I would argue, has been the sharp appreciation of ether in the last year or so. In mid-2020, Ethereum&#8217;s token could be purchased for less than $250 each. The value of ether tripled by the end of the year and reached the $4,700 mark last year. That enormous appreciation led to the creation of a simply massive amount of paper &#8212; token? &#8212; wealth. In short, folks holding ether enjoyed huge returns, very quickly.</p>
<p>More than anything else, the wealth created from the appreciation of ether led to the NFT boom, from my perspective. After all, I don&#8217;t think that folks have been transferring millions of dollars <em>into</em> ether to buy digital signatures on the blockchain that relate to particular images; instead, I think we&#8217;re seeing ether-rich folks gamble with what must feel like house money on non-traditional assets. Not that that is a bad thing; it&#8217;s neutral, I reckon. But it does raise the question of what happens to both NFT activity and NFT prices when their backing asset, if we can call ether that, rapidly loses value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all of the excitement pulsing through the so-called web3 space in the past year, most of the heartiest sums of investor dollars have seemed to find their way towards products touching users in the United States, but an increasing number of startups are looking to tap opportunities in developing nations where existing centralized financial systems have struggled to meet the needs of their users.</p>
<p><a href="https://goldfinch.finance/">Goldfinch</a> is a crypto startup building a decentralized lending protocol that allows organizations to receive crypto loans without owning massive amounts of crypto already. Today, most lending platforms rely on an end user&#8217;s existing crypto collateralization to deem whether they&#8217;re a safe bet for a loan. Being required to stake valuable crypto assets that exceed the value of the loan makes for safer lending, but also alienates plenty of potential loan recipients who don&#8217;t have sizable crypto holdings.</p>
<p>The Bay Area startup wants to take a more blended solution to crypto lending with its protocol, building up capital pools and allowing fintech organizations outside the US to make their case to lenders operating on the protocol and get access to funds while showing non-crypto collateral.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254533" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DO0jcPyuCZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/">African crypto usage spurs Luno as customers reach 7M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;African crypto usage spurs Luno as customers reach 7M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/african-crypto-usage-spurs-luno-as-customers-reach-7m/embed/#?secret=DO0jcPyuCZ" data-secret="DO0jcPyuCZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has closed $25 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto arm. Other backers include<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Coinbase Ventures, SV Angel, Blocktower, Bill Ackman and Heli-cap. Founders Mike Sall and Blake West previously worked together at Coinbase before starting Goldfinch in July of 2020. The firm raised an $11 million funding round last June.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We just see enormous potential to expand access to capital and build this bridge to borrowers in the real world,&#8221; Sall tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Pooled investing like this outside of securities guidelines isn&#8217;t kosher stateside, so Goldfinch is ignoring the US market for now and tapping networks of investors elsewhere who are largely focusing investment on developing nations where scoring a loan has historically been a challenging prospect. Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and and the Philippines are the countries with the highest volume of loans through the protocol.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One firm that backers on the protocol have financed is Tugende, an East Africa-based startup that loans motorcycle taxis to borrowers who set up payment plans to buy the bikes over time. Backers have also financed India-based Greenway which builds and loans our clean cook stoves to low-income households.</p>
<p>The team has put plenty of effort into the right incentive balance into their platform, allowing backers to take varying levels of risk and direct participation in the platform. An overall pool of capital split into &#8220;junior&#8221; and &#8220;senior&#8221; divisions allow lenders to balance their risk. While junior investors can make direct bets on which organizations they choose to back, the senior pool automatically diversifies across the portfolio bets of junior pool investors. The senior pool is a less active, more conservative bet because they&#8217;re paid out first, but lenders in that pool forego a sizable percentage of interest for riskier junior pool backers who take more risk with more potential upside.</p>
<p>The company says they have $39 million in active loans that have been deployed to a handful of fintech firms which have reached more than 230,00 end borrowers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For four weeks during 2021, this TechCrunch reporter took the plunge and tested a &#8220;metabolic fitness&#8221; service from Bangalore-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Ultrahuman</a>. The tracker program, branded Cyborg, uses arm-mounted medical grade hardware to get a real-time read-out of your blood glucose &#8212; using that dynamic data-point to power a quantified health service that scores what you eat and how you move, nudging you to make healthier lifestyle choices throughout the day.</p>
<p>Research has linked chronic metabolic inflammation, from factors such as poor diet and physical inactivity, to the risk of developing a number of diseases &#8212; from diabetes to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and even cancer. So the theory behind the product is that lots of incremental lifestyle choices can stack up to a healthier long term outlook &#8212; if you&#8217;re able to &#8216;optimize&#8217; these decisions to avoid triggers for inflammation and oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Here follows my long read on the curious experience of living with a skin-perforating wearable and a dynamically updating digital window onto your biological process, as well as wider discussion of the value of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for a general health/fitness purpose, and &#8212; finally &#8212; some notes on the competitive landscape springing up around productizing this type of sensing hardware.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As this is loosely a review of Ultrahuman&#8217;s (still private beta) product/service, I&#8217;ve also included a &#8216;Verdict &amp; Price&#8217; section too. Skip ahead if you want to dive into the operational details. But first some context&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Preamble &amp; Caveats</h3>
<p>Becoming a cyborg is no longer as sci-fi as that sounds. For years the &#8216;quantified self&#8217; trend has spawned all sorts of sensors and services for measuring bodily activity and nudging you to track and &#8216;optimize&#8217; your outputs &#8212; from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/20/fitbit-finally-gets-design-with-the-alta-sports-tracker/"> step counters</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/apples-watch-3-rolls-out-heart-health-and-smart-fitness-features/">heart rate</a> monitors, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/fitbit-adds-ecg-and-stress-level-scanning-to-its-charger-fitness-tracker/">stress</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-nest-hub-2-review-the-solid-smart-screen-adds-sleep-tracking/">sleep</a> sensors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/respira-lung-wearable/">lung capacity</a> scorers, and, more recently, freakier stuff: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">Blood glucose</a> monitors and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/femtech-startup-inne-takes-the-wraps-off-a-hormone-tracker-and-8-8m-in-funding/">saliva</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/tim-draper-leads-6m-series-a-in-pee-testing-wellness-tracker-vivoo/">pee</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">/poop </a>analyzers &#8212; the latter for delving into hormonal and/or microbiome/metabolic health if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>
<p>Serving the worried well with wrist-mounted, strapped on or otherwise self-administered sensing technology plus a subscription service to play pocket oracle &#8212; via an app-delivered interpretation of what all this personal data means (and ofc how to improve your metrics) &#8212; is booming business. Close your (exercise) rings. Breathe more deeply. Try to get to bed earlier, and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some of this quantified health tech can come across as a bit superficial or frivolous; an attempt to &#8216;gizmoify&#8217; daily life and push a gadget when you could just go for a walk or get to bed earlier. The more basic products work by selling the motivation-challenged a call to get off the sofa or a replacement for lost childhood structure. Or, well, data-fication as proof of existence.</p>
<p>But it can be horses for courses, too; if you have a sleep disorder or suffer from stress and anxiety then tracking your sleep &#8212; and getting little nudges and tips on how get more shut-eye &#8212; might be just what you need to lock in quality Zzzs.</p>
<p>Available tech has been getting more sophisticated, too. Although, when commercial trackers put a suggestive focus on organ-function (heart; lung etc), the quantification may sound impressive but can suffer from questionable accuracy &#8212; given a lot of this stuff is consumer-grade, rather than (regulated) medical devices.</p>
<p>Even step tracker data can be plenty inexact.</p>
<p>But in a more recent development, a growing number of startups are making use of medical grade sensing hardware to offer self-administered metabolic analysis via tracking (near) real-time changes in blood glucose through the use of a sensor that you &#8216;wear&#8217; on (and, well, <em>in</em>) the skin.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating and growing but still novel area of focus for quantified health startups. One that looks promising, in terms of being able to serve individually useful health insights and which &#8212; given enough data &#8212; may be able to scale in utility and help empower many others to make healthier individual lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>But the really big caveat is that scientific understanding of metabolic fitness isn&#8217;t yet as complete and holistic as we might hope.</p>

Abbott&#8217;s CMG sensor, alcohol wipes, tape patches to wear over the sensor (Image credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Much is not understood &#8212; such as why there can be so much variation between individuals&#8217; metabolic responses (different people eating the exact same diet can have very different responses, for example); or the exact role of inflammation in the risk of developing diseases like diabetes or cancer.</p>
<p>So the ability of startups to play oracle here is bounded by the need for more research. (Albeit, grabbing data to advance research and understanding is a key part of the opportunity entrepreneurs are spying.)</p>
<p>Nor is the sensing hardware in question regulated for the &#8216;general wellness&#8217; use-case most of these startups are pursuing.</p>
<p>Which means these services remain novel &#8212; aka, experimental &#8212; even if the hardware they&#8217;re repurposing is legit, in the sense of being manufactured by established medical devices firms, and regulated for narrower use (i.e. diabetes management).</p>
<p>Typically these sensors have regulatory clearance for people with diabetes to track their blood glucose &#8212; instead of having to do constant finger prick tests. That may lend credibility to startups hooking into the same device makers&#8217; APIs to grab the same data stream. But the interpretative spin such services put on the data is just that: A spin.</p>
<p>Any wider analysis &#8212; including lifestyle recommendations &#8212; are definitely not FDA approved.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The debates that have continued to rage back and forth for years around nutrition &#8212; all the fad diets, bestselling books and rehashed discussions of what&#8217;s good or bad for us to eat, or even what&#8217;s effective exercise &#8212; is a long-running symptom of a still flawed understanding of the interplay between our biology and what we routinely expose it to.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that measuring complex systems without a full understanding of how all the constituent parts can interact and interplay means you&#8217;re not going to get the full picture. At best it&#8217;s a snapshot &#8212; maybe one that supports improved understanding. But it&#8217;s never going to have all the answers. So, another word of caution, the risk of misinterpretation is real.</p>
<p>There is also the question of how exactly do you go about measuring &#8216;metabolic fitness&#8217;? As a label it&#8217;s a bit of a fuzzy umbrella &#8212; arching over complex biological interactions linked to chemical reactions which generate energy in our bodies that may (or may not) mean we&#8217;re easily able to maintain a healthy weight; or which can otherwise support or work against us achieving a high level of physical fitness.</p>
<p>What you eat; how; when; and how active and well rested (vs stressed) you were at the time are just a few of the dynamically varying factors that can affect metabolic function. (One illustrative example: What you ate <em>the day</em> <em>before</em> may affect how your body metabolizes a particular foodstuff <em>today</em>.) While the biomarker (or biomarkers) a product chooses to zero in on and track will also, obviously, influence what that &#8220;metabolic fitness&#8221; service can see &#8212; and is able to deduce.</p>
<p>Startups targeting metabolic health are exploring a range of options &#8212; from tracking blood glucose, to analyzing the gut microbiome or other bodily excretions (like urine), or looking at a combination of outputs/signals (maybe also factoring in heart rate). Over time more bodily signals are likely to be added to the mix to try to flesh out a fuller understanding &#8212; but a lot of the current gen metabolic tracking is best thought of as a piece of the puzzle; a sketch or a rough guess, with more blanks than shading lines.</p>
<p>How to understand &#8212; or, well, best interpret &#8212; data from a combination of metabolic signals presents no shortage of questions and challenges for those trying to productize the cutting edge of figuring out all this bodily chemistry. As Ultrahuman&#8217;s founder acknowledges &#8212; telling TechCrunch: &#8220;Solving for accuracy of insights that we generate from glucose biomarkers is at the very core of our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s website also contains a text disclaimer that the Cyborg service provides &#8220;general information for athletes to understand their glucose levels and athletic performance&#8221;; and does not substitute for a professional medical opinion or consist of healthcare/treatment for specific conditions or medical concerns.</p>
<p>While an entrepreneurial mission to demystify the metabolism &#8212; and commercialize the concept of metabolic fitness &#8212; remains very much ongoing, a couple of things are clear: 1) Demand to better understand biological function exists (plenty of people, not just elite athletes, are interested in what&#8217;s going on with their bodies generally and their metabolism specifically) &#8212; and: 2) big but as yet unverifiable claims are being made for what this type of &#8216;health&#8217; tracking tech could provide an individual user as a long term benefit.</p>
<p>So &#8212; another caveat! &#8212; anyone keen to get involved with metabolic biohacking needs to be clear about the limitations.</p>
<p>Getting a bit of data is not the same as getting a diagnosis &#8212; or even a proper understanding. More data in this context can mean more noise and confusion, not necessarily a clear signal. It may also make you worried about things you shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Another observation: The consumer boom in digital health/wellness tracking over the past decade has been understandably slower on the update when it comes to invasive/semi-invasive wearables. Aka, sensing devices that work by being installed (at least a little bit) inside the body.</p>
<p>Even partially &#8212; dipping under the skin so it can stick a sensing filament into the interstitial fluid in the case of <strong>Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg</strong> &#8212; the &#8216;wearable&#8217; metabolic tracking service that&#8217;s the main focus of this review. This semi-invasive-sensor-plus-app combo monitors (near) real-time glucose levels as a proxy for understanding and scoring metabolic health &#8212; providing the patch-wearer with blood sugar-triggered nudges and alerts to encourage beneficial lifestyle tweaks.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The goal is to support the sensor-wearer to stabilize their glucose levels as they go about their day &#8212; avoiding extreme highs or lows &#8212; with the overarching mission of reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which is linked to negative health outcomes.</span></p>
<p>The suggestion is that, by paying attention to &#8220;metabolic fitness&#8221; &#8212; Ultrahuman&#8217;s phrase of choice to describe its mission &#8212; and taking little actions related to what you eat and when, and how and when you exercise and sleep &#8212; you can avoid or even reverse chronic inflammation that might, over time, lead to developing a metabolic disorder like diabetes, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>While the notion of dieting isn&#8217;t always overtly promoted by startups productizing CGM technology, blood sugar spikes are also of course associated with the consumption of sugary foods (and with a higher volume of consumption) &#8212; both of which can lead to weight gain. So supporting metabolic fitness implies help to obtain and stay a healthy weight too.</p>
<p>With such headline-grabbing potential gains &#8212; from reducing the risk of chronic diseases to support for weight management and a smart digital sidekick to boost athletic performance &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to see why there&#8217;s been a major startup scramble to demystify (and monetize) the metabolism.</p>
<p>And when it comes to startup opportunity, a literally &#8216;wired in&#8217; consumer health tracker is definitely a lot less mainstream than wrist-mounted tracking gear like the Apple Watch &#8212; which instantly shrinks competition from consumer tech giants, providing bold entrepreneurs with a chance to shine.</p>
<p>Safe to say, if Apple&#8217;s wearable came with a retractable metallic fang embedded in the backplate, the tech giant wouldn&#8217;t have shipped anywhere near as many watches, no matter how fancy-looking its glucose-sensing filament. (Apple will surely want to incorporate a needle-free version of glucose monitoring into its Watch, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/apple-might-have-a-secret-team-working-on-glucose-sensor-technology-for-diabetes/">rumors have suggested</a>, and if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/graphwear-closes-20-5m-series-b-for-a-needle-free-nanotech-powered-glucose-monitor/">the tech works out</a>.)</p>
<p>Piercing the skin just sounds messy (even if it isn&#8217;t really). And ofc lots of people hate the idea of needles. That means there is simply more space and opportunity &#8212; here at biohacking&#8217;s cutting edge (ha!) &#8212; for quantified health startups to blaze a trail that <em>seems</em> to go deeper than mainstream consumer tech companies. Quantified self tech that&#8217;s not afraid to cross the needle-phobia line certainly <em>feels</em> more serious because it is literally closer to the biological process that&#8217;s being tracked.</p>
<p>That said, whether placing a tracker into the skin makes a meaningful difference vs a less intimate sensor placement &#8212; in terms of the quality of the data being captured; the analysis of that data; and any resulting recommendations provided to the user &#8212; is a tricky-to-answer question. (Indeed, it&#8217;s a whole series of questions, depending on context and the execution of the service/s.)</p>
<p>In the case of Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg, the startup is careful not to overpromise; its marketing puts the responsibility on users to &#8220;work on improving your health with real-time visibility of how food and exercise impact your body, and a score that motivates you to improve every day&#8221;, as the minimalist instructions which arrived in the box with the beta product put it.</p>
<p>The metabolic &#8220;score&#8221; Cyborg gives is personalized, yes, But it&#8217;s an abstraction and interpretation of biological processes that still hold plenty of questions for science. So, again, this is really more about <em>being</em> <em>part of a search for answers</em> vs getting a single &#8216;biological truth&#8217; handed to you on a plate. (In short, there is no plate; there&#8217;s just a lot of suggestive data to feast your curiosity on.)</p>
<p>While a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing &#8212; maybe even more so when the data in question is attached to your own biology &#8212; a glimpse of one&#8217;s inner workings is undoubtedly catnip for the curious. And in our digital age, with so much health research information available online at the stroke of a key, who isn&#8217;t a little curious on matters of personal biology?</p>
<p>The danger, perhaps, is that a more invasive/intimate sensor placement may lead people to automatically assume this type of tracker is giving higher quality intel (and more personally relevant insights) than the calibre of the data processing &#8212; and our wider scientific understanding of metabolic processes &#8212; is able to deliver.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman isn&#8217;t afraid to push that sci-fi notion as a selling point, though. Hence its overt choice of &#8216;Cyborg&#8217; branding &#8212; which deliberately emphasizes the intradermal sensor placement &#8212; the direct interface between the tech and your body &#8212; implying that&#8217;s the special sauce powering a quantified health service which promises to &#8220;nudge you towards better health, one small step at a time&#8221;, and without the need for &#8220;drastic diet changes&#8221; or the tedium/frustration of &#8220;generic exercise plans&#8221;.</p>
<p>Given how many other startups are also leveraging the same (or similar) CGM hardware, the automagic of obtaining the data is already at risk of being commoditized; it&#8217;s how this information gets visualized, analyzed and contextualized <em>for each user</em> that really counts.</p>
<p>Again, though, given all the aforementioned uncertainty around the science, that looks inherently hard to quantify.</p>
<p>Of course cynics might say that makes for a perfect startup opportunity&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Ultrahuman Cyborg: How it works</h3>
<p>Tracking dynamic changes in blood glucose is Ultrahuman&#8217;s proxy of choice for assessing metabolic health.</p>
<p>Why glucose? Ultrahuman&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, Mohit Kumar, says it was the best fit for what they wanted the product to achieve &#8212; being &#8220;a real-time biomarker that is sensitive to food, stress, sleep and activity&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were looking for biomarkers and methods to personalize the fitness journey for people when we started as well but it took us a year long of experimentation to figure out which biomarker really works for the kind of impact we were looking at. We looked at various biomarkers like HRV [heart rate variability], sleep and respiratory rate but glucose seemed really interesting out of the entire lot because of the feedback it provides on our food aspect of the lifestyle,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means that we would be able to get instant feedback for these lifestyle factors and what we&#8217;ve seen is that instant feedback leads to better actionability. For e.g. a nudge that pushes you to walk after a meal that gives you a spike will lead to better actionability vs a report that gets sent after a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, there are so many fitness wearables and markers that help you improve your activity performance but there&#8217;s nothing that helps you optimize what you eat. Nutrition is generally a blackbox and is way more confusing (given hundreds of diet types and personal preference) but it is probably the most important lifestyle factor given how broken our food ecosystem is.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why we felt going in with glucose makes a ton of sense from a ROI perspective even though it is a semi-invasive biomarker. The private beta is helping us understand what nudges and information helps people make lifestyle changes easily. We&#8217;ve seen massive engagement on the platform with app opens / user being around 21 per day and most people seeing real-improvements in their health around the 45th day of usage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tracking blood sugar swings almost as they&#8217;re happening &#8212; thanks to CGM technology &#8212; is immediately a major step up on the patience-challenging business of (traditional) dieting trial and error over a multi-week/month period: Aka, change what you eat/how you exercise and wait and see if it actually moves the scales, weeks or even months later.</p>
<p>Continuous blood glucose tracking (vs repeated finger pricks) has been enabled by the development of CGM hardware in recent years &#8212; initially for people with a formal diagnosis of diabetes. But now a growing number of startups are productizing this technology for a more general health-concerned or fitness-focused consumer.</p>
<p>The tech itself has led to some interesting science. See for example this 2018 <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180724174233.htm">research paper</a> which showed that glucose dysregulation (i.e. highs or lows outside what&#8217;s considered the normal range) were actually pretty common in &#8216;healthy&#8217; people; i.e. those without a diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes &#8212; which wasn&#8217;t what the researchers had been expecting to find.</p>
<p>At a basic level, Ultrahuman&#8217;s service consists of arm-mounted sensing hardware (a disc-shaped sensor) &#8212; which must be replaced every two weeks &#8212; plus an app to visualize your blood glucose data and deliver alerts and nudges. You pair each new sensor with the app to continue the tracking.</p>

<p>The sensor hardware is made by another company: US medical devices firm, Abbott. The specific sensor that shipped with the Ultrahuman product at the time of writing was Abbott&#8217;s FreeStyle Libre 2 flash glucose monitoring system.</p>
<p>Self administering the CGM sensor is a little nerve wracking but mainly because you only get one shot at (correct) placement. And with only two sensors in the beta box delivered to TechCrunch I didn&#8217;t want to waste any hardware.</p>
<p>At the time of application, Ultrahuman had produced a couple of (amusingly robot-voiced) videos to instruct on sensor placement and set up. These were helpful &#8212; and only slightly disturbing (owing to the reference not to press too hard to avoid &#8220;few drops of blood splatter&#8221;).</p>
<p>Abbott&#8217;s hardware comes with its own set of instructions and a spring-loaded applicator which you prime manually before positioning the plastic cup on your raised upper arm and, trepidatiously, pressing down to fire the filament into your flesh. The action is rapid enough to make you flinch. It may not help to recall another phrase in Ultrahuman&#8217;s instruction video (&#8220;hollow needle&#8221;). But the needle is just the delivery mechanism for the filament; you&#8217;re not going to be left with that bit of visible metal in your arm.</p>
<p>Was there any blood splatter? Not that I noticed. However the second sensor I installed/put on seemed to have fired into a nerve or something as it was pretty painful for several days. After which it sort of settled down/bedded in. Or, well, I got used to it.</p>
<p>The first sensor was not painful, <em>per se,</em> to wear but it definitely takes a bit of getting used to to sleep with a piece of plastic attached to your arm. I found certain yoga poses required extra contortions to avoid uncomfortably pressing down on the sensor, for example. And I swear I could hear a very high pitched whine in my head at night while wearing the CGM &#8212; but maybe I was just dreaming of electric sheep.</p>
<p>Yes you can shower/bathe with the sensor in place. Ultrahuman&#8217;s box contained a few disc-shaped fabric tape patches to help protect the hardware (and add its branding to your arm). These can start peeling off after a few days depending on your lifestyle but the sensor itself remained firmly lodged for both my two-week stints. (You can remove a dogeared patch and replace it with a fresh one (if you have enough spare). Although that was also nerve wracking as you don&#8217;t want early patch removal to prematurely rip out the sensor. So basically it&#8217;s about as much fun as applying a whole Macbook decal.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the sensing filament itself it feels like a piece of <em>not</em> <em>that</em> <em>fine</em> wire. You get to see it for the first time on extraction from your arm. At which point I saw it looked as if it was coated in some kind of black paint. Which was &#8212; I was not too pleased to observe &#8212; flaking slightly&#8230; But by that time you&#8217;ve been living with it in your skin for two weeks so Cyborg acceptance has already taken place. Smart.</p>

<p>Was there a mark left? Yeah, a small red bump where the filament had perforated the skin. It faded after a while. The tape itself &#8212; including the sensor&#8217;s built in fixing (which stayed a lot more firmly attached) &#8212; never bothered me.</p>
<p>The sensor pairs with Ultrahuman&#8217;s app via Bluetooth. This means it can lose connection if your phone is out of a few meters&#8217; proximity with your arm/person &#8212; at which point the data flow (and real-time alerts) will stop. So now you have the perfect excuse for your phone never to leave your side!</p>
<p>If that does happen, the app will notify you and request you to tap the phone back on the sensor when you can to upload any missing readings. (NB: On set up, the sensor also needs a little time to &#8220;warm up&#8221; &#8212; before data starts flowing. So you may find yourself pacing the room as you wait for it to be ready to log your first workout/meal etc.)</p>
<p>The app itself was a work in progress during TechCrunch&#8217;s period of testing which was split over more than a month (as I took a break between applying sensor 1 and sensor 2) &#8212; and the software went through a number of changes, including one major visual tweak.</p>
<p>This changed the glucose plot line&#8217;s gradient from a too simplistic view (where low-to-high glucose was always displayed as green-to-red) to having a central &#8220;target zone&#8221; where the plot displays in frosty &#8216;good to go&#8217; green but as/if rates drop too low or too high they will bleed in a gradient from yellow to orange to red &#8212; meaning you can have red highs <em>and</em> lows if you&#8217;re out of the optimal glucose range (which is between 70mg/dL and 110mg/dL).</p>
<p>This update was a vast improvement as the earlier version had been visually suggesting that a lower glucose was <em>always</em> better &#8212; even if the level was already below target (aka, hypoglycemia) &#8212; which it just a small illustration of some of the design/UX pitfalls for this type of quantified health product.</p>
<p>As well as plotting the ups and downs of your blood glucose throughout the day (or at least the approximation which Abbott&#8217;s hardware pulls from your interstitial fluid; as any <a href="https://freestylediabetes.co.uk/health-care-professionals/freestyle-libre/flash-glucose-monitoring">diabetic could tell you</a>, these levels don&#8217;t always exactly match blood glucose readings; and if your glucose is rising or falling there can be a short time lag before that shows up in a flash glucose monitor), the app displays what Ultrahuman refers to as a &#8220;metabolic score&#8221; &#8212; which is a number from &#8216;0&#8217; to &#8216;100&#8217;.</p>
<p>This is the main &#8216;metric&#8217; mechanic the app uses to try to nudge and gamify healthy lifestyle tweaks.</p>
<p>Ultrahuman describes this score as an indicator of your &#8220;overall metabolic health&#8221; and says it&#8217;s calculated based on glucose variability, average glucose and time in target metrics. The number resets to 100 every day at midnight and decreases or increases &#8220;based on your daily lifestyle activities and body&#8217;s response&#8221;.</p>
<p>The gamification mission sounds very simple: &#8220;Your goal is to maximize this score on a daily basis,&#8221; as the app puts it.</p>
<p>In practice, getting a &#8216;good&#8217; (i.e. high) score will depend on your individual biology and lifestyle. And, depressingly, you can wake up with a score that&#8217;s already down in the 80s (or, I guess, worse) &#8212; depending on what you did/ate earlier.</p>
<p>NB: Stress can also impact blood sugar so events outside your control can impinge on your metrics.</p>
<p>Logging of food &#8212; and/or activity or the other types of events which were gradually added to the app during the testing period &#8212; is done manually.</p>
<p>Initially this was by custom typing your meal descriptions (or activity). A later update added a food and activity index that lets you search and pick from a structured list and their quantities or times rather than manually typing everything.</p>
<p>In the end, I much preferred custom typing to log food as the list was far too specific and tedious to feel useful. (Type: &#8220;Cheese&#8221; and it&#8217;ll suggest a lot of different types of cheeses &#8212; but not necessarily the exact one you&#8217;re eating, nor the amount you actually have on your plate, which you may not know in any case; and that&#8217;s just one meal ingredient to log; repeating that for a full plate quickly gets old fast&#8230; Plus the list also seemed pretty US-centric, which wasn&#8217;t very useful for logging a European diet.)</p>
<p>Whereas type in your own favorite cheese &#8212; or indeed a custom description of the entire meal &#8212; and you can quickly log it next time you eat it as the app will remember your custom label.</p>
<p>Doubtless Ultrahuman is keen to get the best quality structured data that it can &#8212; to build the wider utility sought for from predictive AI models. But, if logging feels too much like work, few users will perform the task perfectly for free. So it may have its work cut out to get accurate and structured (vs custom but cryptic) food-to-glucose-response data from its beta user-base.</p>
<p>(Indeed, it may need to rely on asking users to snap an image of their meal and applying computer vision technology to make informed deductions, say, although that may also introduce plenty of errors. Longer term &#8212; if the tech goes really mainstream &#8212; you could imagine restaurants printing a QR code per meal on their menus which can be scanned so all the correct nutrient data is instantly logged to reduce input friction.)</p>
<p>Activity logging was a lot more straightforward than meals. Not least because, unless you&#8217;re an Olympic athlete, you&#8217;re going to need to log a lot less of it than food.</p>
<p>After community feedback from beta users, Ultrahuman also added &#8220;stress&#8221; events as a logging option, as well as fasting &#8212; which can of course play havoc with blood glucose but &#8212; per some research &#8212; may have its own set of health benefits. So giving users more granular options to help better structure the CGM data is sensible.</p>
<p>In the future, automated logging via integration with other types of consumer wearables seems likely. For example, it&#8217;s easy to imagine that your fitness band or smart watch detects a specific activity and passes that data to the Ultrahuman app &#8212; which could just prompt the user to confirm the details of the detected workout.</p>
<p>For now, though, beta users remain in control of inputting and structuring the data so data quality is likely to be a real smorgasbord.</p>

<h3>What I learnt</h3>
<p>Ultrahuman&#8217;s tips caution that during early use of the product you probably won&#8217;t be rewarded with stable, high scores.</p>
<p>This is because learning what you need to do to stabilize your blood glucose typically takes a bit of time &#8212; since you have to try different stuff (food pairings, exercise timings etc) to see what works for you. Although this is still a much accelerated process vs the tedious business of old school dieting and fitness regime assessment. (Ofc if you&#8217;re blessed with a naturally more stable (i.e. low variation) <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180724174233.htm">glucotype</a> you may find you need to do a lot less manual &#8216;steering&#8217;, as it were.)</p>
<p>I will still unprepared for the early horror, though. And spent pretty much the whole first week &#8212; jaw on the floor &#8212; watching the app lowball score the stuff I usually eat.</p>
<p>Humus salad pita bread sandwich lunch followed by a few walnuts, half an apple and coffee (white, no sugar)? Doesn&#8217;t that sound reasonably healthy? Um, apparently not, in my case. It remains one of the all time &#8220;bottom zone&#8221; lunches during my four weeks as a Cyborg (scoring a big fat &#8216;0&#8217;). <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The all time worst lunch food during the test period (purely in terms of how high my glucose peaked after eating) was at least not a dish I had prepared myself but a fast food meal &#8212; albeit, from a brand that markets its fare as a &#8220;natural&#8221; and more healthy choice than traditional McBurgers n chips.</p>
<p>The meal in question &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/leonrestaurants/status/1041628142031593472?lang=en-GB">Leon&#8217;s lentil masala</a> with brown rice followed by a &#8220;regular&#8221; coconut milk latte (brand of plant milk: Rude Health); another &#8216;0&#8217; scorer &#8212; produced such an epically large spike that I decided I needed to do an emergency HIIT session just to bring my elevated levels back down again.</p>
<p>The exercise did do the trick. However, if I&#8217;d known <em>before</em> <em>lunch</em> that I would need to do do a bunch of burpees and squats right <em>after lunch</em> to metabolise the food spike I might well have revised my food choices.</p>
<p>How continuous glucose monitoring, and mass access to real-time metabolic data, will affect the fast food industry is certainly an interesting question to ponder&#8230;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253110" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253110" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2253110" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png?w=382" alt="Screengrab from Ultrahuman's Cyborg app showing a glucose spike that's been managed down via exercise" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png?resize=382,680 382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5367.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253110" class="wp-caption-text">A whopping fast food spike &#8212; vanquished by doing some intense exercise (Image credits: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t checked the ingredients small print prior to eating the Leon meal &#8212; but eyeing the label suspiciously afterwards, in the red glow of the app&#8217;s condemnation, I was unimpressed to find &#8220;caster sugar&#8221; in a long list of additions.</p>
<p>Although, knowing what I know now, it was probably the coconut milk (an ingredient in both the stew and the coffee) that was especially triggering for me.</p>
<p>Sadly, the post-meal coffee probably didn&#8217;t help either.</p>
<p>My least favorite Cyborg learning was that coffee seems to raise my blood sugar. Green tea? Totally fine. Black coffee, decaf, white? All cause me some uplift. And since I like to drink coffee in the afternoon, <em>after</em> eating lunch, that means a raise atop a (food) raise &#8212; which might be just enough to tip me into the red.</p>
<p>I still refuse to be a morning coffee person, though.</p>
<p>Rice can also be a spiker for many people &#8212; certainly white rice which is more quickly metabolized by the body vs the more fiber-rich wholegrain. Although I&#8217;m now more wary of the crash that can come <em>after</em> eating a mainly white rice-based evening meal as it seems to work against keeping blood sugar stable and sustained in the target zone overnight.</p>
<p>Blood sugar lows are just as important to avoid as highs, as it turns out. At least, that&#8217;s my sense after four weeks hooked to a CGM. Although my early usage of the app was entirely preoccupied with trying to avoid the big red spikes, they did get easier to manage over time &#8212; with some creative biohacks and a few strategic dietary edits.</p>
<p>For example, I have all but removed plant-based milks from my diet (save for a dash of oat milk in coffee; no I have not &#8212; will not! &#8212; give up coffee entirely. But I do tend to nurse a cup for longer now). The spikes these alt milks served up were just too consistently red flag-ish to ignore and I came to think of them as akin to fruit juice and best avoided. Which &#8212; again &#8212; is pretty interesting considering how often the marketing of these highly processed beverages makes loud noises about how they offer a &#8216;healthy choice&#8217;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other Cyborg users seem to have reported a similar issue &#8212; per one of the company&#8217;s email newsletter round-ups of shared learnings, where it wrote that: &#8220;<span class="il">Almond</span> <span class="il">milk</span> and breakfast cereal could actually cause a bigger spike than a hotel breakfast buffet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe this is a similar mechanism as can cause a glass of orange juice to spike whereas eating a whole orange (typically) won&#8217;t. Or maybe it&#8217;s down to something more specific in how these drinks are manufactured &#8212; the type of processing they undergo and specific additions. Many have added sugar for instance (although the ones I was pouring on my cereal definitely didn&#8217;t &#8212; yet they still spiked me). Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have a chance to make a homemade version of oat milk to do a direct comparison with commercial brands to see if it was any less spikey.</p>
<p>For breakfast I do still usually eat a bowl of oats &#8212; which certainly also has spike potential (being carbs, albeit fiber-rich carbs) &#8212; but I make sure they are jumbo oats (not oatmeal). Most importantly, I liberally dust the bowl with cinnamon (which I discovered helps reduce glucose spikes). And I eat them with water (not any kind of milk), plus a blob of natural yogurt (for flavor and some essential vitamins), plus the usual mix of berries and seeds.</p>
<p>This is not a massive change on my pre-CGM breakfast of choice (oats, berries, seeds etc but washed down with, er, oat milk). But t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he difference in metabolic score terms? Huge! It switches from a meal that typically scores a &#8216;2&#8217; to a &#8216;9&#8217;. Crazy but true (or, well, true per Ultrahuman&#8217;s reading of my fluctuating interstitial fluids). </span></p>
<p>I also found creative ways to adapt how I consume bread to limit how much of a spike it generates.</p>
<p>Eating less or even no bread is one way to shrink glycemic load and manage down any associated blood sugar rise. However like oats, wholegrain bread is a complex carb that has dietary benefits so I didn&#8217;t want to remove it (or, indeed, quit carbs entirely) from my diet. So, with the benefit of the app&#8217;s real-time glucose view, I experimented with eating a slice of wholemeal bread towards the end of lunch, after other fiber, protein and fat rich foodstuffs &#8212; which take the body longer to break down &#8212; and that seemed helpful.</p>
<p>I then found another specific biohack &#8212; involving apple cider vinegar &#8212; that worked a treat.</p>
<p>As with cinnamon, I learned this type of fermented vinegar has properties that help to reduce glucose spikes. So I experimented with pouring the vinegar (stay with me) on a slice of sourdough bread before eating it &#8212; yes this sounds odd but actually tastes amazing! Using this method, plus eating the bread later on in the meal (after the salad, nuts etc), I could turn a lunch that spiked into one that remained in the healthy zone. There&#8217;s simply no way I&#8217;d have figured out something as specific as that without being able to see real-time shifts in my blood sugar.</p>
<p>The problem is the lunches that spiked didn&#8217;t make me <em>feel</em> any different/less healthy vs the lunches that didn&#8217;t. Not without seeing the metabolic response in the app. So it just wouldn&#8217;t have been possible to distinguish between them without the sensor data.</p>
<p>Plus, of course, another person, with different metabolic responses, may be able to eat five slices of bread without any spikes at all. So there really is no clever way to generalize &#8212; beyond setting basic strictures such as control your carb intake and carefully build the balance of foodstuffs on your plate. And generic, broad-brush strategies that can be very demotivating in the absence of immediate feedback &#8212; which is exactly what makes the CGM so potentially, individually transformative as a lifestyle tool. Suddenly you can try stuff and see if it actually works for you or not.</p>
<p>That said, whether managing relatively small blood sugar spikes is as important for a person&#8217;s long term health as metabolic tracker startups like to suggest is a wider question.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sunderland.ac.uk/about/staff/health-paramedic-clinical-sciences/matthewcampbell/">Dr Matthew Campbell</a>, a scientist who does research into biological systems that impact the human metabolism at the University of Sunderland in the UK, was sceptical about the benefits of otherwise &#8216;healthy&#8217; people putting so much effort into managing their blood glucose when we asked for his views on this general use of CGM technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glucose usually fluctuates throughout the day anyway — it’s not a kind of static variable, it is very dynamic. But it should, on average, stay within a normal range. There are cut off points for people who would be characterised as high risk. For example, if your glucose doesn’t come down below a certain level after a meal or in the morning time if it’s chronically elevated. And that’s where the kind of cut points are for diagnosing diabetes or even pre-diabetes, the people who are at risk of developing diabetes,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue that we have [with &#8216;healthy&#8217; people tracking their glucose] is just these arbitrary values &#8212; if it’s going down that’s okay, if it’s going up that’s not so good &#8212; [but] if you sit within the normal range I don’t know what the clinical utility and the usefulness or the health advantage is of, for example, reducing your glucose by 1mmol if it’s already in the healthy range.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I guess if you already sit &#8212; 95% of the time &#8212; within a healthy range trying to flatten that line or aggressively manage it even lower, I don’t think that confers any additional health benefit because you are already in a healthy range.&#8221;</p>
<p>Campbell also pointed to the challenge of correctly linking the blood glucose data that comes from the CGM to everything going on in the user&#8217;s body which might be influencing glucose levels, noting too that as well as a time lag the exact position of the sensor on the user&#8217;s arm can affect the readings, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;So certain situations, is it your weight, your sex, your ethnicity, individual genetic makeup &#8212; all of those different factors influence glucose levels — sleep impacts it, nutrition impacts it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And I think if this tech just [tracks] the glucose trace and it doesn’t tie in those other factors then it’s quite difficult to make an informed decision on what is influencing your glucose levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was more positive about the potential of CGM for athletes, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what it can be useful for — you mentioned elite athletes — if you’re exercising at particularly high levels or for a long duration of time — even if you don’t have diabetes, can be at risk of having low blood sugar levels and a lot of this tech tends to come with alerts,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Campbell also raised an interesting comparison &#8212; suggesting out of range glucose may not always be a problem if the individual&#8217;s metabolism is able to aggressively manage it back down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way to think of it is a little bit like heart rate during exercise,&#8221; he says. &#8220;If you’re exercising somebody might have a much higher heart rate at the same exercise intensity as somebody else and you might think they’re exercising a lot harder therefore they might be less fit.</p>
<p>&#8220;But actually if the variability within the heart rate is a lot greater then that’s more indicative of more cardiovascular flexibility. Which is pretty much associated with very good exercise tolerance and very good levels of fitness &#8212; and I don’t really see how it’s any different with glucose response.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it’s not necessarily the fact that the glucose level goes outside of range because that happens for a large proportion of people and they can be metabolically healthy &#8212; I think what is important is looking at the overall picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that, Campbell suggested the true utility of these services will be in augmenting the CGM data with algorithms and machine learning &#8212; that can &#8220;look for patterns in the data&#8221; and &#8220;piece things together rather than just cherry picking ‘well your glucose level went high after you did this’; well it doesn’t really matter if it came down fairly aggressively, maybe that’s actually a good thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Returning to blood sugar lows, I had an interesting personal experience in that I was able to figure out &#8212; through usage of the app (including by chatting to Ultrahuman&#8217;s in-app coaches to get their manual analysis of my CGM data) &#8212; that a series of glucose lows I had experienced overnight correlated with waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat or even with cramps.</p>
<p>I also noticed that such overnight lows often followed a meal that had involved drinking alcohol (which, turns out, plays its own devilish game of interference with normal metabolic processes). So keeping a careful eye on the ratio of food to alcohol &#8212; and perhaps eating a protein-rich snack before bed after an evening meal when I had drunk wine with a less nutrient dense dinner (white rice, say) &#8212; was another little hack I was able to work in to shrink the risk of going hypo/crampy in the night without having to forgo wine with a meal.</p>
<p>In that case the personal benefit looks tangible: Not having my sleep unpleasantly disturbed.</p>
<p>I was also able to extrapolate this finding to suggest a similar night time snack hack for an elderly relative &#8212; who had been suffering chronic night cramps for months. After she&#8217;d adapted her regime to include a strategic bedtime snack she soon reported being almost entirely cramp free overnight.</p>
<p>These are of course just a couple of anecdotal examples &#8212; but they are illustrative of the potential for individuals to experiment, make connections and join the dots between the unique quirks of their lifestyle and the CGM data.</p>
<p>Dr Michael Snyder, a Stanford professor and co-author of the aforementioned pioneering <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180724174233.htm">research paper</a> &#8212; who is also a co-founder of a (rival) US startup, called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/eat-this-not-that-exercise-now-new-personalized-software-predicts-and-helps-prevents-blood-sugar-spikes/">January AI</a>, which sells its own metabolic health tracking service that&#8217;s productizing CGM &#8212; is, as you&#8217;d expect, evangelic about the benefits of the technology to deliver valuable revelations to individual users.</p>
<p>He actually has Type 2 diabetes &#8212; and has worn a CGM to help manage the condition for around a decade at this point &#8212; so is well placed to comment on the tech&#8217;s utility.</p>
<p>Albeit his personal use, for a specific medical condition, is very different to the general fitness/health use Ultrahuman, January AI and other startups in this space are targeting. But he suggests that broader use of CGM technology could help manage or even reverse the risk of people becoming pre-diabetic or diabetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away you learn what foods spike you and what doesn’t &#8212; and that just differs from one person to the next,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;You can actually see people who have glucose dysregulation who might not otherwise know it and this is a big deal because 90% of pre-diabetics don’t know it and 70% of those will go on to become diabetic so one could argue it’s really really valuable to get their glucose under control so at least they can push off becoming diabetic hopefully for a number of years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s these kind of hidden secrets in your food &#8212; at least they’re secrets to you, they’re probably obvious to somebody,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;But even people who think they knew everything learn stuff, from what I can tell, that they didn&#8217;t realize. And, yeah, there’s just sugar everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It probably lines up to the concept that I think now &#8212; compared to right after World War 2 &#8212; people eat something like 40,000x more sugar than they used to. It’s just everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2253113,2253127,2253114,2253112,2253115"]</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally think &#8212; from my standpoint &#8212; the whole world should be getting measured on this at least on some treatments,&#8221; he also tells us. &#8220;If your glucose is under control maybe you get measured a little bit less, get measured periodically. But if you’re pre-diabetic or diabetic I think this information should be life-saving on some level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snyder also predicts the tech will get a lot more powerful &#8212; thanks to the addition of AI and predictive modelling around food responses based on all the empirical data that&#8217;s now being ingested after being fed in by early adopters.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why you need AI,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;First of all you’ve got to know which foods spike you &#8212; which ones don’t. It’s very empirical unless you just do it you don’t know going in &#8212; so we’re finding some people spike to grapes, other people to pasta. Everybody spikes to white rice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But different people do spike to different things and at some point we’ll get predictive about what’s doing that but right now it’s just empirical. And so that’s what these devices do — they teach you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For January AI we have food recommender system because we can say well here’s what you’re eating that spikes you and we know the composition of these other foods and with reasonable predictive accuracy we can say well this food didn’t spike you, eat that one, don’t eat that one,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds crazy &#8212; but it is a big data problem. You need to have a lot of data and a lot of understanding to be able to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>January AI similarly factors in the user&#8217;s activity level &#8212; given it also impacts glucose level. And Snyder argues that even just tracking those two elements is enough for such a service to be useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that’s essentially at least two of the ingredients &#8212; but you’re right there are a lot of factors and that’s why it’s a data problem,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Bring in enough data around you personally and we’ve got the data to decide what formulas are working for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally, I can say one thing for sure: I have never known a gadget to be so engaging. Just on the pure information level.</p>
<p>The Ultrahuman app&#8217;s fairly formulaic alerts &#8212; which might pop up to warn you that your glucose is rising and suggest you &#8220;get movin'&#8221; to bring the level down; or nudge you to eat earlier in the evening for &#8220;better sleep quality and metabolic response&#8221;; or offer some motivation by trumpeting an &#8220;epic/insane start to the day&#8221; based on minimal spikes/crashes &#8212; were probably the least personally useful element of the product for me. Because, well, if you&#8217;re paying attention to the data you&#8217;ll soon realize that sort of stuff yourself.</p>
<p>I was very quickly way down the rabbit hole of testing diet/exercise tweaks to see whether I could identify hacks and strategies to keep things frosty green.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely fascinating/terrifying to watch how your body deals with the stuff you throw at it. But, be warned: Your S.O. will hate you as you inexorably whip out your phone at lunch/dinner to first log your meal and then vicariously observe as the app scores your body&#8217;s response to whatever you&#8217;re eating. It&#8217;s a double whammy for screen time. And the stickiest app I&#8217;ve used since forever. (Sometimes literally given you&#8217;re logging what you&#8217;re eating.)</p>
<p>But of course it&#8217;s not perfect.</p>
<p>One notable functionality issue I found is that the app wasn&#8217;t always able to distinguish between an exercise-related spike (yes intense exercise can raise blood sugar out of the target range!) and a food related spike (even if you&#8217;re doing careful logging) &#8212; so it could end up scoring your day badly when it shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Exercise spikes are &#8220;nothing to worry about&#8221;, per Ultrahuman&#8217;s coaches &#8212; who I quizzed about this via the app&#8217;s chat function. &#8220;The reason for spikes during strength and HIIT workouts is due to an increase in adrenaline and cortisol which stimulates the liver to break down glycogen into glucose,&#8221; was the explanation I got from one of the coaches, along with the reassurance that this is: &#8220;Nothing to be worried about. It&#8217;s natural phenomenon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now a person with diabetes may need to worry about going out of target even if exercise is the cause &#8212; as their body could have trouble bringing the elevated blood glucose back down again. But a person without that diagnosis &#8212; the more general consumer that Ultrahuman is targeting for Cyborg &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t, in theory, be worried.</p>
<p>However the app, in its current form, ended up causing me some concern when I did some intense exercise and then right afterwards ate a meal. High glucose rates caused by the HIIT &#8212; which the app will normally notify as &#8220;a good spike&#8221; &#8212; seemed to get co-mingled with the food-related increase and that combination conspired to dent my metabolic score.</p>
<p>Accurately distinguishing a &#8220;good spike&#8221; from a bad one is evidently a work in progress.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Kumar told TechCrunch when we asked about this: &#8220;Solving for accuracy of insights that we generate from glucose biomarkers is at the very core of our mission. If we look at clinical grade parameters that determine how one&#8217;s body responds to something like food, we get to know that it is a combination of: &#8216;X ( macro+micro constituent of food ) + Y ( the state of recovery i.e stress, sleep deficit, microbiome diversity etc ).&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The platform currently looks at X closely and hence you would see that there are many exceptions to how glucose responds to food. With our custom hardware that&#8217;s going live in early 2022, we are changing the way we look at this by capturing the rest of the Y factors i.e HRV, sleep etc. We feel this will completely change how we look at the food and activity response and the resulting accuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;For e.g.: The platform will be able to clearly figure the attribution of activity and food within a spike. This is because we could figure out your approximate glycogen release thresholds based on a combination of glucose with other factors that we will capture via our custom hardware wearable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kumar also said the startup is starting clinical trials for a study that relates glucose, insulin and other bodily parameters (&#8220;Triglycerides and hormone balance&#8221;) to establish what he described as &#8220;a proper correlation between glucose monitoring predictions (&#8216;metabolic score&#8217;) and the actual state of metabolic health&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has also been attempted in the past with lesser tools and non-continuous glucose at disposal but the v2 here will have way more validation,&#8221; he predicts.</p>
<p>So, once again, more research is needed to try to improve the resolution of the &#8216;personalized&#8217; snapshot of data the CGM is pulling out of your arm. Which also means that these cutting edge quantified health services may still be making a relatively crude assessment of what&#8217;s going on in your body at any given moment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a similar complication with food too of course, unless you&#8217;re someone who eats a single foodstuff per meal.</p>
<p>Since most of us eat foods in combination (bundling different ingredients), it&#8217;s the combo you&#8217;re eating that counts &#8212; and, indeed, the order in which you eat different ingredients on your plate can affect how you metabolise them. So the same meal eaten in a different way (or at a different time of day) might go down (or up) differently.</p>
<p>Starting with fiber rich foods (salad, vegetables etc), moving through proteins and fats and ending with (any) carbs &#8212; a deconstructed humus salad pita lunch, say &#8212; would probably have been less of a low scoring lunch for me than wrapping the same food in bread and eating it the quick and convenient way.</p>
<p>Another clear takeaway from my four weeks as a Cyborg is that fast, &#8216;convenient&#8217; food &#8212; scoffed at a pace &#8212; will, inexorably, cause big, unhealthy-looking glucose spikes.</p>
<p>I also found that more processed the food (i.e. prepared meals with added sugars, preservatives, oils etc), were more likely to spike vs eating whole foods, freshly prepared.</p>
<p>This was not surprising to me &#8212; I&#8217;ve long sought to avoid eating heavily processed foods in favor of stuff I prepare myself using fresh/minimally processed ingredients &#8212; but it did underscore how much of a problematic food culture the Western world has developed, with its time-is-money emphasis on speed which encourages liberal use of artificial sweeteners and other additives in order to turn an edible convenience food into a profitable product with a long shelf life.</p>
<p>My experience of using a CGM suggests that eating in a way that is healthier for you &#8212; because it generates less inflammation and oxidative stress &#8212; requires both more time to prepare food and more time to consume food.</p>
<p>Healthier ingredients may also be more expensive to buy and assemble yourself vs buying a product that comes prepackaged and &#8216;ready to eat&#8217;. So health can literally cost more, in time and money. So there are huge socioeconomic considerations when you start to dig into metabolic health.</p>
<p>Cracking open this Pandora&#8217;s (lunch)box has implications that scale beyond our broken food system too &#8212; touching on wider structural inequalities baked into our societies.</p>
<p>Poor health and poverty are often intertwined. And it remains to be seen whether big data and AI will be able to break that link by democratizing access to valuable health insights &#8212; scaling broad utility off of enough individual-level learnings &#8212; or whether tech&#8217;s wealth divide will just serve to further accelerate inequalities as health tech gets smarter too.</p>
<p>The concept of a cyborg instantly implies a new elite tier of humanity. But what about all those who can&#8217;t afford to be wired in?</p>

<h3>Verdict &amp; Price</h3>
<p>While I remain (healthily) sceptical of the scale of the potential gains being claimed for metabolic tracking, four weeks as an Ultrahuman Cyborg was long enough to convince me this is the start of <em>something</em> big. And I didn&#8217;t have an obvious need going into testing the product &#8212; such as wanting to lose weight or needing to get fit. I&#8217;m just interested in staying healthy.</p>
<p>Nor am I a big fan of fitness wearables, generally. But this felt like a different level of self quantification.</p>
<p>The future of healthcare will certainly be about shifting towards preventative interventions by leveraging data accessibility to inform and augment our ideas about what&#8217;s good and healthy for us &#8212; even if, where metabolic health is concerned, there&#8217;s no shortage of learning and research still to do.</p>
<p>The data from individual sensors (Ultrahuman&#8217;s service alone has some 400x cyborgs at the time of writing) will also feed research that will continue to deepen our understanding of complex metabolic processes. Although there is a degree of risk that commercial interests will look for results which support and underscore their point of view, the potential scale of use &#8212; as more of these services launch &#8212; should help drive transparency and keep the science clean.</p>
<p>At the same time there is plenty to be cautious about.</p>
<p>The most engaged and scientifically literate users are likely to get the most out of this sort of tracking as they can bring wider knowledge/resources to bear to help them interpret their data &#8212; while a less informed user might take an overly simplistic read of what the information means.</p>
<p>There is also the risk that linking big bold stress triggers to food and other lifestyle events could lead to (or exacerbate) problems like eating disorders. The service wrapper and support are therefore a really key piece of making the most of what CGM tech can offer.</p>
<p>In short, poor UX decisions could have serious ramifications. And a lot of care and due diligence is needed over service design and delivery.</p>
<p>Longer term, having a snapshot view of blood glucose may &#8212; on its own &#8212; turn out to be far too limiting.</p>
<p>A more fully integrated tracking platform is likely to be needed to deliver the best understanding of an individual&#8217;s metabolism, drawing in a variety of signals and biomarkers. Although, right now, tracking glucose feels like a start; one which offers the chance to experiment with lifestyle tweaks that could accrue significant benefits over time &#8212; in a way that&#8217;s far more motivating than trying to figure out healthy individual dietary choices without any kind of real-time feedback.</p>
<p>Even just four weeks using the product yielded so many interesting tidbits and so much food for thought &#8212; avocado and egg is a super solid breakfast choice!; beer is a terrible spiker but natural cider looks (er) practically medicinal!; olives and nuts are truly the food of the Gods! &#8212; and the experience has led me to make some small but sustained lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on whether those tweaks are genuinely worthwhile from a long-term health point of view. But given the changes weren&#8217;t especially radical, even if there&#8217;s only a tiny chance they have a benefit then, really, where&#8217;s the harm in that?</p>
<p>That said, another qualification: I do wonder whether (further) reducing the amount of carbs I eat &#8212; as a result of seeing how much they can spike me &#8212; might not have capped how much energy I have available for training purposes.</p>
<p>I already had a fairly low intake of carbs and it&#8217;s important to remember that food is also fuel &#8212; and energy needs vary. So a &#8216;spikes are bad, stability is best&#8217; view on blood glucose may be too simplistic for an above average sporty lifestyle.</p>
<p>There is a real need to plug this data into relevant specialisms. A personal trainer would likely be able to make far more intelligent use of my results for me &#8212; based on knowing my individual fuel for training needs. Such a person may even be able to advise on dietary tweaks that could let me have my bread and eat it, so to speak.</p>
<p>But of course a personal trainer &#8212; or nutritionist &#8212; isn&#8217;t something everyone can afford or otherwise justify based on their (non-Olympic athlete) lifestyle. So on that front the product looks good value. (Even if you&#8217;re mostly getting raw data and need to do much of the wider interpretation yourself.)</p>
<p>How much does Ultrahuman&#8217;s Cyborg cost? The <a href="https://ultrahuman.com/pricing/">beta program</a> is priced at ~$80 for two weeks (or $470 for 12 weeks). If you were paying a human personal trainer to be on your case and analyzing your data 24/7 it would be a <em>lot</em> more expensive than that &#8212; so it looks like pretty good value. (A decent personal trainer might cost $80 <em>an hour.</em>)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to emphasize that the app isn&#8217;t actively trying to be a full-time personal trainer. But it can do some basic things like offer exercise nudges if your blood glucose gets too high and &#8212; retrospectively &#8212; identify your &#8220;best workout zones&#8221;, aka optimal time windows to take exercise over the course a week based on how your body was fuelled. (&#8220;Do you see a trend? Use these times to your advantage to crush your next workout&#8221; was one suggestion it emailed me, although this nudge seemed more random than useful tbh.)</p>
<p>There are also a few (human) coaches on hand in the app to take questions and help you analyze your data. Plus you can always ask for help from other users via the invite-only Cyborg Slack channels. (Albeit, that&#8217;s crowdsourced wisdom, not dedicated professional support.) So the &#8216;relative value&#8217; price-tag comes with the caveat that most of the time you&#8217;re on your own when it comes to drilling in and distilling more nuanced insights.</p>
<p>One more thought to ponder: As with every data-driven and ambitiously predictive AI product the Cyborg isn&#8217;t just training you; your data is training the Cyborg&#8230; So how much do you think 24/7 access to your biology is worth?</p>
<p>The value being derived from your highly intimate personal data flows two ways &#8212; and that upside isn&#8217;t necessarily being distributed equally. If you feel you&#8217;re getting enough value from the service that may not bother you. But privacy considerations are impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re comfortable sharing such intimate data with a commercial company in order to be able to access the service, Ultrahuman&#8217;s <a href="https://ultrahuman.com/privacyPolicyBiosensor/">privacy policy</a> for Cyborg notes some circumstances where your information may end up elsewhere &#8212; such as if it receives a subpoena it&#8217;s legally bound to respond to.</p>
<p>The policy also specifies that: &#8220;Anonymized, aggregated data may be shared with advertisers, research firms and other partners.&#8221; And robustly anonymizing health data has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3">shown to be notoriously difficult</a> to do, even as the adtech industry has shown a rapacious appetite for triangulating and &#8220;sharing&#8221; data to better profile individuals for targeting &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">up to and including applying labels like &#8220;diabetes&#8221;</a>. So your highly personal data leeching from a CGM into the modern web&#8217;s manipulative microtargeting ad matrix is not, unfortunately, impossible to imagine.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s end on a personal note: What has Kumar himself learned from using CGM to track his glucose?</p>
<p>&#8220;For me the biggest learning has been around expanding my food spectrum and incorporating more of the foods that I like. Prior to this I pretty much followed a disciplined diet but couldn&#8217;t sustain it for long given it would affect social eating etc. With Cyborg, I&#8217;m able to understand how I can balance food with my activity. On the days I lift weights or am generally more active, I know that I have a little bit of extra flexibility around eating what I want to,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other big learning &#8212; which is a work in progress &#8212; is around maintaining stable energy levels throughout the day. For me, stable glucose levels are broadly correlated to stable energy levels and this is what I&#8217;ve been trying to maintain during a particular week where I have a lot of reading work to do.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Cutting edge competition</h3>
<p>Here, past the quantified self trend&#8217;s needle-phobia line, is truly a wild(er) west &#8212; a lesser trodden arena of experimental startup opportunity. Naturally, it&#8217;s a lot more interesting than boring old step/sleep tracking, exactly because it&#8217;s so much less familiar.</p>
<p>There is a genuine sense of discovery as you fire the spring-loaded CGM sensor into your arm; feeling like a bit of a pioneer, involved in a kind of citizen science collective &#8212; with the fascinating opportunity to design and run experiments that interrogate the health of your own lifestyle.</p>
<p>On top of that, is the overarching possibility that what you learn personally might be useful to others &#8212; encouraged by Ultrahuman&#8217;s community-building efforts around Cyborg (such as its Slack channels, where early adopters are encouraged to share their learnings; as well as virtual and in person meet ups) &#8212; so there&#8217;s a &#8216;philanthropic mission&#8217; feel as well.</p>
<p>Startups that are bold enough to get entangled in skin-puncturing machine-human interactions do have a chance to stand out. After all, mainstream tech giants simply can&#8217;t be that freaky. And it sets them apart from the wider wellness quantification crowd that&#8217;s plumped for a more quotidian biomarker to track.</p>
<p>That in turn means these startups have a chance to grab some very intimate biological data to feed their product dev, data science, AI models and algorithmic predictions; and &#8212; potentially &#8212; jockey themselves into position to race ahead as consumer appetite for personalized health services steps up.</p>
<p>On the blood glucose tracking front &#8212; an activity that has traditionally been associated with people who have conditions like diabetes (or pre-diabetes) &#8212; a large number of startups are now taking the plunge into willing recipients&#8217; interstitial fluids.</p>
<p>As well as (India&#8217;s) <a href="https://ultrahuman.com/">Ultrahuman</a>, with its still beta Cyborg service, there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/eat-this-not-that-exercise-now-new-personalized-software-predicts-and-helps-prevents-blood-sugar-spikes/">January AI</a>, which does glucose tracking combined with heart rate monitor data to offer personalized food predictions and exercise &#8216;recipes&#8217; to help you burn off any indulgent excess; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/levels-raises-12m-from-a16z-and-others-to-bring-its-biowearable-to-market/">Levels Heath</a>, which has bagged backing from a16z; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/signos-series-a/">Signos</a>, which is using CGMs to offer real-time weight loss advice; the athletic-performance focused <a href="https://www.supersapiens.com/en-GB/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_adgroup=Brand&amp;utm_campaign=SN_Brand_UK&amp;d=c&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA8ICOBhDmARIsAEGI6o3ILFQI4OTXC0WmLCVm6m3OYTpMMtClLGWghibjy2DICv78YNpdpZwaAk30EALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supersapiens</a>; and <a href="https://www.nutrisense.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NutriSense</a>, which offers big picture soundbites around &#8220;optimizing&#8221; your &#8220;daily health performance&#8221;, to name a few of Ultrahuman&#8217;s US CGM-leveraging rivals.</p>
<p>There are more competitors in Europe &#8212; including (UK-based) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">Zoe</a>, which is using data from large-scale microbiome studies to generate AI models to predict individual food responses. So as well as getting users to wear a blood glucose monitor, it also asks them to send in stool samples for lab analysis.</p>
<p>Also targeting glucose monitoring in the region is Germany&#8217;s <a href="https://perfood.de/weight-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfood</a> (&#8220;personalized diet&#8221; for weight management); and Holland&#8217;s <a href="https://www.clear.bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clear Nutrition</a> (&#8220;learn your unique responses to food&#8221; and &#8220;build your own nutrition plan&#8221;). At the time of writing, another European company in this nascent space, Finland&#8217;s <a href="https://www.veri.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veristable</a> &#8212; or Veri for short &#8212; was spotted advertising its 24/7 glucose monitor service on photo-sharing social network Instagram.</p>
<p>The ad pictured a very hipster look model sporting the same disc-shaped wearable which Ultrahuman&#8217;s service uses (and indeed many others do), taped over with a stylish grey patch vs the former&#8217;s black and white disk emblazoned with its tipped &#8216;K&#8217; symbol. &#8220;End the Guessing Game of &#8220;What Should I Eat?&#8221; Veristable&#8217;s ad proclaimed, pointing Europeans toward a €159pm service.</p>
<p>Both Veri, which raised a seed round in June (per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/veri-d746/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>), and Ultrahuman &#8212; and a number of others &#8212; are using a CGM made by Abbott (the aforementioned FreeStyle Libre). This disc-shaped data-collecting device comes with a spring-loaded applicator that&#8217;s armed with a hollow needle. Once positioned in place you press down (firmly but not <em>too</em> firmly) and it fires the filament directly into your flesh.</p>
<p>The novelty here isn&#8217;t the tech itself &#8212; CGMs have been around for some years (Abbott&#8217;s FreeStyle Libre was introduced in 2016 for example, while Dexcom, another maker, got FDA approval for a fully interoperable CGM that could be used with other electronic diabetes management devices back in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-fully-interoperable-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-streamlines-review">2018</a>) &#8212; it&#8217;s what they&#8217;re doing with it that&#8217;s experimental.</p>
<p>So while CGM tech has already been a transformative technology for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes, it&#8217;s only relatively recently there have been moves to commercialize it for a more general user who just wants to get to know their own body better.</p>
<p>Last <a href="https://investors.dexcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fda-clears-dexcom-real-time-apis-third-party-apps-and-devices">summer</a>, Dexcon gained FDA clearance for its real-time APIs for third party developers and devices. Fitness hardware maker Garmin was among the first wave of companies signed up to work with it to expand users&#8217; access to their glucose data, albeit still with a focus on boosting utility for people with diabetes.</p>
<p>But investors have been quick to spot broader consumer potential &#8212; and are increasingly injecting funds to accelerate developments and get CGMs into many more arms.</p>
<p>Early last year, for example, January AI topped up with a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210225005349/en/January-AI-Raises-21-Million-to-Fuel-Growth-of-Its-Breakthrough-Diabetes-Management-Technology">further $8.8M</a>; while Zoe bagged a $53M Series B in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/personalized-nutrition-startup-zoe-closes-out-series-b-at-53m/">May 2021</a> (<a href="https://www.balderton.com/news/zoe-secures-additional-series-b-funding-in-preparation-for-uk-launch/">recently expanded</a> when they added Balderton as an investor). <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Ultrahuman also announced a $17.5M in Series B (in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/ultrahuman-raises-17-5m-touting-a-wearable-blood-glucose-tracker/">August 2021</a>); while Signos raised a $13M Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/signos-series-a/">November</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As more data flows, it&#8217;s a safe bet that much more VC cash will follow. </span></p>
<p>Ultrahuman&#8217;s PR points to the scale of the addressable potential market &#8212; talking about an emerging &#8220;metabolic health crisis&#8221;, and claiming that some 88%+ of Americans (and almost 80% of the global population) are &#8220;dealing with a metabolic disorder&#8221;; and thus could potentially benefit from joining its &#8220;Cyborg army&#8221;, as it brands early adopters.</p>
<p>So the potential addressable market is huge. Although any such wider onboarding looks like it will entail a steep learning curve &#8212; as startups seek to push beyond the low friction pond of early adopters and performance enthusiasts and step outside the quantified self and biohacking communities where this tech will naturally thrive.</p>
<p>A big part of Ultrahuman&#8217;s community-building efforts focus on encouraging users to share individual experiences and tips via invite-only Cyborg Slack channels and Townhalls, as well as signing up sporty influencers to evangelise the benefits of &#8220;performance fuelling&#8221; and other biohacking techniques that feed the purpose of sporting a CGM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world currently has over 500M+ people who are diabetic but if you look at the problem holistically, you&#8217;d notice that there are almost 600M+ pre-diabetic people,&#8221; its PR goes on to claim, before suggesting the cure: CGM technology combined with &#8220;health score algorithms&#8221; and &#8220;instant health nudges&#8221; &#8212; which it argues &#8220;could help millions improve and help control / reverse this crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whether millions of people can be sold on wearing a sensor <em>in</em> their skin remains to be seen.</p>
<p>But the technology may well evolve so it can be less invasive &#8212; and more mainstream-friendly &#8212; without losing too much accuracy. At which point there&#8217;s no reason to think it wouldn&#8217;t become a standard bit of fitness kit.</p>
<p>Whether a metabolic tracker subscription service is something millions of people will shell out for every month is another question. But once you&#8217;ve had a taster of this kind of data access it can be addictive. Even if you may also feel a bit &#8216;watched&#8217; and judged as the sensor feeds back data on your lifestyle choices and the software scores how healthily you live.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny to imagine that the world&#8217;s unhealthy pursuit of something sweet to eat may, over time, get commercially rerouted into tracking and biohacking the rollercoaster ride of blood sugar &#8212; which should at least be a healthier fixation than blindly chasing the next sugar high.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/bitcoin-is-religion-web3-is-greed/">the debates on Twitter rage on</a>, most tech founders and VCs have by now chosen a side: Web 2.0 or web3.</p>
<p>Proponents of web3 believe it is the future of the internet, and that blockchain-based products will completely supplant Web 2.0 within the next few years.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 stalwarts say it’s all just a bunch of hype being spewed by crypto bros looking to turn a profit, and that blockchain technologies are fundamentally limited in scope.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a founder who has been building Web 2.0 apps for over a decade, and investing in crypto for nearly as long, I believe the most exciting opportunity lies at the intersection of these two worlds.</p>
<p>The true mass-market potential of blockchain will be unlocked with the merger of Web 2.0 and web3.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to look at the energy, talent and resources being poured into web3 and harken back to the early days of the internet. For those of us who have been around Silicon Valley long enough to remember, the similarities are undeniable.</p>
<p>Except this time, the rate of growth seems exponentially higher. Web3 pundits point to these facts to support the argument that web3 is the future of the internet, and that Web 2.0 will soon be dead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there is one important distinction between the early days of the internet and today: Before Web 1.0, there was no internet. We all lived analog lives. When the internet came along, it was competing against a relatively boring existence. Free porn, chat rooms, gaming, music, email, videos, the world’s information at your fingertips versus … a sleepy Saturday trip to Blockbuster. It was never a fair fight.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I spent $2,000 on a pair of sneakers I know I will never wear, because they exist only as an NFT. Is it any less crazy than the money I previously spent on toe-crushing stilettos?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Web3 is entering a different arena. People today are addicted to digital products with a very strong pull. You’re not going to get the average consumer to stop scrolling TikTok because they want to help usher in an era of decentralization, support the creator economy or battle inflation. They don’t care. And they can’t afford a <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAYC</a> or a <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptopunk</a>.</p>
<p>What the average internet user does care about is how they appear and present themselves on social media. That’s the bridge. The key to this bridge will be NFTs.</p>
<p>Here are 5 NFT trends that will bring social media audiences into web3 en masse:</p>
<h2>NFT verification</h2>
<p>Skeptics are quick to point out that NFTs are dumb because you can simply right-click and save the underlying files. This is a temporary problem. In the near future, all major social platforms will implement NFT verification, allowing you to connect your wallets and display your verified NFTs on your profile. In parallel, fingerprinting technology will allow platforms to easily detect stolen files and take them down.</p>
<p>Once TikTok users can display and use their unique, verified NFTs in their posts, the game completely changes, because the social value of purchasing and broadcasting NFTs increases exponentially.</p>
<h2>Sidechains</h2>
<p>As sidechains like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> become increasingly prevalent, NFT prices will come down. Near-zero gas fees will also enable developers to build more interactivity and composability into NFTs, making them inherently more social.</p>
<p>Imagine Pokémon Go on the blockchain, where each Pokémon is an NFT that can be traded or sold. Every Pokémon you acquire has unique traits, and you uniquely impact how it evolves with the location-based achievements you unlock. As a Pokémon levels up, its powers get updated on-chain. As you progress in the game, you earn crypto tokens, which have value outside of the game. Fun!</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>The NFT mania of 2021 was largely focused on visual art, but the next frontier, and one that I believe will ultimately be much bigger, is music. Whether it’s collecting physical art or NFTs, the impulses driving a collector’s behavior are the same: the desire to express one’s artistic tastes to peers; the desire to express one’s identity, either individual or group; and, in some cases, the desire to turn a profit.</p>
<p>Although there has been plenty of speculative frenzy behind the initial NFT craze, I think the impulses around self-expression and identity are the more fundamental drivers of art collection. And one of the most prevalent ways in which people express their tastes and identity is through music.</p>
<p>TikTok started as a music video app, and music tracks remain a core component of videos shared on the platform today. But the music available today is common. Everyone has access to the same songs.</p>
<p>Imagine your favorite artist releases a unique 60-second music track with a limited number available as NFTs. You purchase one and make a cool TikTok out of it. It goes viral. Millions of people suddenly want that song to make their own TikTok. But there are only 100 copies available anywhere. You get daily offers from people who want to buy the song from you, and you can decide if you want to flip it or keep it for yourself. Fun!</p>
<h2>Wearables</h2>
<p>At the dawn of the Web 2.0 era, when I was in my 20s, I would spend nearly all my disposable monthly income on fashion. Fancy jeans, stilettos, sunglasses and handbags &#8212; my appetite for nice things to wear was insatiable.</p>
<p>But as the majority of my social interactions shifted online over the past decade, my spending on clothing has dwindled. All I really want these days, other than exercise gear, is a handful of colorful tops for Zooms. Buying fancy clothes has lost its fun.</p>
<p>But the other day, I did something surprising. I spent $2,000 on a pair of sneakers I know I will never wear. I can’t wear them, because they exist only as an NFT. It’s difficult for me to explain to someone who hasn’t fallen down the crypto rabbit hole why I made this purchase, and I realize it probably seems crazy. But is it any less crazy than the money I previously spent on toe-crushing stilettos?</p>
<p>Wearables are about to usher in an era of massive spending on digital goods that social media audiences will use to primp and preen their digital selves. Although most existing wearables activity in the NFT space is tied to gaming and avatars, the killer use case that will help transition large audiences into the metaverse will be AR filters.</p>
<p>Imagine that Kim Kardashian launches custom AR filters — facelifts, lip fillers, makeup, hair, dresses, jewelry — and each one is unique. If you buy one, you can exclusively don that look in your TikTok videos for as long as you want, and then you can sell it when you get bored. Add me to your whitelist, Kim!</p>
<h2>Dynamic avatars</h2>
<p>OK, I get it. You cannot, for the life of you, imagine why anyone would change their profile pic to a hideous ape. I have to admit, I own a Bored Ape. But I can’t bring myself to make it my profile pic either. I chose a <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/world-of-women-nft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World of Women</a> instead. Why did I swap a professional headshot of myself for an algorithmically generated cartoon image that only vaguely resembles me? It was fun. It allowed me to express a side of my personality I would have trouble capturing in a photograph.</p>
<p>But my profile pic is already starting to feel a little stale. I wish it weren’t so … static.</p>
<p>Dynamism, personalization and movement are coming to NFT avatars. Imagine you take a selfie, and an AI generates a unique, custom 3D avatar that looks like your ideal version of you. Like Bitmoji, but better. You can update the character’s expressions and poses, clothing and accessories; you can make it dance; you can make it say things in your own voice, just by typing. Think of how much easier it would be to create engaging TikTok posts where you feel good about how you come across. You could spend less time perfecting your acting and filming skills, and more time on the message you’re trying to convey.</p>
<p>Dynamic avatars will be an opportunity to democratize self-expression on social media and will give voice to a much larger audience of creators.</p>
<p>When Facebook first started, it was kind of dumb, but it was fun. When you logged on every few days, you would be reminded of your real friend’s birthdays, see their latest cheesy profile pics and poke them. Then came the feed, mobile phones and algorithms, Instagram models, lattes and perfectly filtered lives, and somewhere along the way, the fun was subsumed by a kind of social slavery. We keep scrolling through posts of people we barely know that make us feel bad, and we keep posting obnoxious things in return. Surely this is not how it all ends?</p>
<p>When Zuckerberg unveiled his vision for Meta, you could feel the collective eye roll. You’ve already ruined our lives with social media, we wanted to scream, and now you’re going to kill our last remnants of physical connection and turn us into vegetables living in the Matrix.</p>
<p>But the thing is, whatever the pros and cons, we are already on an inexorable march toward the metaverse. We are increasingly living virtual lives. What web3 enables is a richer experience in that virtual existence. One that will hopefully feel a little less hollow, a little more human.</p>
<p>I look forward to a future where NFTs, along with all the other promises of web3, help us create a virtual reality where human interaction is, once again, fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Will the world ever go back to big in-person events? Of course. Eventually. CES already moved in that direction this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/reflections-on-another-strange-pandemic-era-ces/">for better or worse</a>.</p>
<p>But everyone&#8217;s already gotten a taste of virtual events, and their many ups and downs. Ups? Huge potential audiences! No flights! No mile-long lines to enter the horror show bathrooms! Downs? The tech side of things can get remarkably complicated, and it&#8217;s hard to make a virtual show more compelling/interactive/engaging than a YouTube video would be.</p>
<p>Virtual events (or, in many cases, hybrid virtual/physical events) are here to stay. <a href="https://www.zuddl.com">Zuddl</a>, a virtual events platform, has raised a $13.35 million Series A to make them easier to host, simpler to customize, and, hopefully, more engaging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254641" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Co-founder Bharath Varma tells me that Zuddl&#8217;s focus isn&#8217;t solely on the big, public-facing trade shows we all hear about every year. Instead, they&#8217;ve found momentum in helping large companies (their landing page names Microsoft, Kellogg&#8217;s, and HSBC) host their internal events — think job fairs, training programs, and cross-department networking gatherings.</p>
<p>&#8220;These Fortune 1000 companies spend as much on internal events as they do on external events, purely because of the scale of these global teams,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>But every company, and every team, might want to do things a little differently&#8230; so Zuddl was built with flexibility/customizability in mind. Want one stage? Sure. Five? Why not! Tweak the color scheme, brand it how you like, and turn on only the features you actually want.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254646" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254646" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg 1149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zuddle-2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zuddl</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of this is allowing companies to build the virtual venue as they see fit, with customizable backgrounds/clickable hot zones to give the interface some semblance of a physical place. They provide a bunch of templates, but companies are free to make it look like a conference center, or a concert hall, or their actual office — just upload your images accordingly. The image-centric approach throws me back to 90&#8217;s point-and-click games<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(click door, enter room!) a bit, but hey, it works.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, they&#8217;re also doing quite a lot to simplify the complexities of hosting live stages. Each stage&#8217;s host invites their guests to go  &#8220;backstage&#8221;, where they&#8217;re able to chat privately, do A/V tests, etc — all right through the browser. They can then quickly shift guests to the audience-facing stage, or pull a guest back off stage if their internet tanks or their mic starts cutting out. There&#8217;s a dedicated chat area just for backstage hosts to communicate with onstage speakers (for things like &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re on mute.&#8221;), so you don&#8217;t have to try to cram a Slack window onto your screen between everything else. Zuddl can also handle things like recording sessions, stage timers, and ticketing system integration.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also put a lot of thought into the experience as an attendee. You can join smaller/private round table sessions while still keeping a live view of the main stage. There&#8217;s a rich Q&amp;A/polling system, even allowing audience members to be invited onto the stage (after being vetted backstage first, of course, to check their video/audio and avoid any&#8230; erm, surprises) to ask their question. There&#8217;s a speed networking feature built in, where attendees can opt in to be rapid-fire matched with others for quick video conversations (with a preset length, so neither person HAS to be the one to end it), and an optional gamification system to encourage attendees to explore the event.</p>
<p>As simple as virtual events (hopefully) might look, there&#8217;s often a <i>lot</i> of complex machinery behind the curtain (read: a zillion bits of software taped together) making it all work. I&#8217;ve been to (and helped to host!) a lot of these things. At a cursory glance, Zuddl seems to do a good job of boiling many of the pain points away.</p>
<p>This round was led by Alpha Wave and Qualcomm Ventures, and backed by GrowX Ventures, Waveform Ventures, and a number of angels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> It was also part of Y Combinator&#8217;s S20 class. </span>Varma tells me that Zuddl is currently made up of around 70 people. Prior to this, it had raised a $2 million seed round in October of 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em><strong>Warning:</strong> Contains spoilers for Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;Don&#8217;t Look Up.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of theories making the rounds about Mark Rylance&#8217;s character Peter Isherwell in<em> Don&#8217;t Look Up</em>, an eccentric tech mogul whose uber-capitalism masks itself as altruistic enlightenment (even to himself). But whether Isherwell owes more to Musk, to Zuckerberg or to Page I think misses the point: The tech industry target the movie truly eviscerates is the vaunted Tech Demo.</p>
<p>You can argue about its actual origins, but most will agree that the concept of turning a new product or tech innovation into a stage show for public consumption gained traction thanks primarily to Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jobs was a natural showman from the very beginning, and if you have a bunch of time to kill it&#8217;s worth taking a look back through his <a href="https://allaboutstevejobs.com/videos/keynotes">recorded presentations, which date back all the way to 1983</a>. Especially beginning with the debut of the iPhone in 2007, this kind of treatment became something competitors obviously felt they couldn&#8217;t help but also use to introduce new products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Tech demos obviously existed prior to, and continue to exist independent of, their incarnation for general public consumption. Demos were also famously the way that teams internally sought the attention and approval of Jobs throughout the development of Apple&#8217;s various products, and a good demo might mean earning approval and resources, whereas a bad one could see an entire team&#8217;s efforts cut short.</p>
<p>But internal demos, at least when used properly, tend to be &#8216;warts and all&#8217; affairs that provide key opportunities for leaders to tangibly see what their various teams are working on, and offer guidance about direction and solutions. The public tech demo is something else entirely, and at this point it&#8217;s become what it&#8217;s presented as in <em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em>: An act of artifice that exists independent of (and hardly shares any common ground with) the real world.</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em> has two big &#8216;tech demo&#8217; moments that point out exactly what&#8217;s wrong with the kind we&#8217;re used to now — and a third, related depiction that&#8217;s sort of analogous to the &#8216;hands-on&#8217; experience typically offered to the press after the official demos and introductory presentations. The first is the introduction of Bash&#8217;s new smartphone software, which literally reads a user&#8217;s emotions and serves them pacifying content when needed (a cute cat video in the stage show.) While introducing the software, Rylance (as Isherwell) is inexplicably flanked by children who are also holding Bash-powered phones.</p>
<p>Isherwell ignores a request from one of the kids on stage to say something, which is just the appetizer for his complete ignorance of them once the presentation is over, when he focuses instead on ironing out a minor detail of the demo itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The next demo is for a much smaller audience, the President (portrayed by Meryl Streep) and her retinue. In this one, Isherwell is demonstrating how his proposed system for intervening in the arrival of the world-killing planet that Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence&#8217;s characters identified. The demo is technically very impressive, presented via a slick hologram in which everything works exactly as intended. Isherwell also backs up the technical bona fides by name-dropping some accomplished academics, but the name-checks are crucially shallow.</p>
<p>Finally, the &#8216;hands-on&#8217; happens when Isherwell shows off the asteroid-mining robots he&#8217;s created to the President prior the mission. It&#8217;s a brief, surface-level look at the tech outside of its target use case that can&#8217;t help but be impressive, but that isn&#8217;t at all backed up by later real-world performance.</p>
<p>In every instance where Isherwell is demonstrating what his technology will do, the scenario is fabricated and the demo is rigged. Each is a reflection of an ideal state, and each (either maliciously or otherwise) hides the actual purpose or performance of the tech in question once loosed on the real world. The smartphone OS, installed on actual phones, later ends up just auto-buying music for one of DiCaprio&#8217;s on-screen sons without his permission or even involvement.</p>
<p>The asteroid dismantling robots first collide into one another, then just fail to break up the comet as intended. Isherwell doesn&#8217;t stay to deal with the consequences: He excuses himself and moves on to his next big idea — a colony ship to escape to the stars (also, it turns out, doomed).</p>
<p>In the movie, the main criticism levied against Isherwell&#8217;s plan by the actual scientists in the film is that it isn&#8217;t &#8216;peer-reviewed.&#8217; This may seem a weak counter, but it&#8217;s actually a profound one when you consider what it means about the tech industry in general.</p>
<p>Bash&#8217;s big plan to turn an existential threat (the asteroid) into commercial gain (through resource mining) is just a much more concrete example of the earlier operating system launch. Both are nascent technologies with the potential for profound impact on human society loosed into the world with, at best, only passing consideration given to knock-on effects, or to what happens if the impact is still profound but not the one imagined, or modelled in a vacuum.</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t Look Up</em> is parody in that it exaggerates story elements to the level of farce in order to point out their absurdity, and most of us would still acknowledge that in cases where physical or planetary health are involved, it would be bizarre to expect something with that level of consequence to be put into action without any level of serious scrutiny or review by actual experts in the field. But we never think the same about the introduction of new technologies whose effects are perhaps more subtle but no less profound, like the smartphone, or new social networks, or new means of organizing, presenting and accessing information.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one takeaway for tech industry observers and participants from this movie, it&#8217;s this: Never trust the demo. We shouldn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/teslas-original-self-driving-video-was-a-sham-employees-say">need the reminder</a>, but the stakes aren&#8217;t always obvious until well after the fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CES has always been a weird show for robotics. That’s not an indictment of the show itself, so much as a comment on the state of robotics generally. It’s true the organization behind the show dropped the name “Consumer Electronics Show” some number of years ago (a fact it continues to be very insistent about in its press materials), but at its heart the show is still very much about consumer technologies.</p>
<p>For robotics, consumer has been an exceedingly difficult nut to crack, for reasons of pricing, scalability and the general unpredictability of operating in uncontrolled environments. In much the same way that the robotic vacuum has long been the main exception to that rule, robotic vacuums have been the one consistent feature at the show over the past decade-plus.</p>
<p>Back in 2020 (the last time TechCrunch attended the show in person), I wrote a piece titled, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/companies-take-baby-steps-toward-home-robots-at-ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Companies take baby steps toward home robots at CES.”</a> Fittingly (for reasons that will be made clear below), the first person I quoted in the piece was Labrador Systems co-founder/CEO Mike Dooley, who told me, “I think there are fewer fake robots this year.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254135" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Fake” is, obviously, a loaded word in this &#8212; and just about any &#8212; context. But it’s also not wrong. CES has been &#8212; and will continue to be for the foreseeable future &#8212; a platform for fake robotics. There are a number of reasons for this, but the main one is simple: robots are an easy way of visualizing sci-fi stuff. Robots, flying cars, space and now the metaverse. If you want a shorthand way of telling the world that your company has its head in the clouds in the most pragmatic way, you wheel out (or walk out) a robot.</p>
<p>They’ve been a common fixture over the years at press conferences from companies with an arguably limited investment in real robotics R&amp;D. And there’s a big, gaping hole between science fiction and that year’s umpteenth robot vacuum. What we’ve started to see is companies begin to fill in that gap. Startups have played an important role in this. But just as important is the role played by automotive companies.</p>
<p>In the lead up to CES, I wrote a 10-year piece reflecting on the biggest trends of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CES 2012</a>. One of the things that struck me is the shift the show has made away from things like handsets (Mobile World Congress has taken a lot of wind out of those sails) and toward other industries &#8212; mobility in particular. Carmakers have a big role to play in all of this, both in terms of how they use robotics in the manufacturing process and also the role these technologies play in the future of the companies &#8212; starting with autonomous driving and moving well beyond.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252987" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252987" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252987" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/03_CES-2022_metaverse_169_youtube_220103_Final.2022-01-04-09_07_18.gif" alt="" width="800" height="330" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252987" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those reasons, I’m likely not surprising anyone by saying that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/hyundai-plans-to-incorporate-robots-into-the-metaverse-to-help-users-reach-out-and-touch-someone/">combined Hyundai/Boston Dynamics press conference</a> grabbed the biggest headlines from the robotics world. Tuesday night’s show rode the line in an interesting way. As a company, Boston Dynamics has always taken a pragmatic approach to robotics. Sure, they look like the stuff of science fiction to many, but the products the company showcases are very real.</p>
<p>It was a contrast from the sorts of fantastical concepts Hyundai put center stage. Watching a video of Spot hanging out on Mars to serve as a real-world avatar for a family cruising through the metaverse was, in a word, strange. Boston Dynamics has suggested many potential jobs for its quadrupedal robot over the years, but somehow, to the best of my knowledge, Martian avatar hadn’t come up. I had the opportunity to ask founder Marc Raibert a couple of questions, and opened with that, asking how the Hyundai acquisition will impact what has been an aggressive &#8212; but practical &#8212; approach to making robots.</p>
<p><strong>Last night&#8217;s presentation was a bit on the fantastical side.There was a sci-fi projection out into the future. How profound an impact will the Hyundai acquisition have on Boston Dynamics&#8217; roadmap going forward?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s early days, six months. I would say that, on the one hand, there seems to be a commitment at Hyundai for us to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing. I think you&#8217;re going see all the things we&#8217;re doing, really in an enhanced state, continue to go on. We’re going to do [Atlas, Stretch and Spot]. There’s more investment going into there. Productization and research, in the case of Atlas. We’ll add additional robots onto what I’ll call the Boston Dynamics side. While that’s going on, we’re also building connections with Hyundai, and starting some projects […]</p>
<p>Hyundai is a big company. There are a lot of different sub-companies, but we’re talking to all of them. We’re not exactly sure who all of the interaction partners will be, but we’re planning to have a robust set of interactions. I don’t have any sense that Hyundai is going to come in and say, ‘Stop being who you are. Be something different.’ To the contrary, if anything, they’ve been very enthusiastic about us continuing. Although we’ve been making products, we’ve also been an R&amp;D company for a long time. I think they see value in that and they will continue investing in that, so we can continue the legacy, as well as the commercial side of things.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the event, he was clearly enjoying himself. It is, in a lot of ways, an ideal position for a lifelong roboticist: suddenly seeing a whole influx of resources from new corporate owners looking to deliver the moon and stars &#8212; or, at the very least, Mars. I do appreciate Raibert’s off-handed mention that Mars is still a ways off for Spot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253447" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253447" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2253447" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PnD_Personal.2022-01-04-17_42_48.gif" alt="Hyundai CES 2022 plug n drive" width="800" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253447" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>I had a follow-up question with Hyundai’s VP and head of Robotics Lab, Dong Jin Hyun, who said, similarly, that the Personal Mobility PnD plug and drive plaftform is also very much a “proposal/concept,” adding that the company would “show the real applications of PnD soon.” For now, at least, we’re stuck with some far out videos.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2254672" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="504" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg 1191w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg?resize=680,335 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/img01_02.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Before we move on from Boston Dynamics completely for the week, a fun aside from Raibert. In the company’s past flirations with the home/consumer market, “we even worked for years with Sony Aibo, making ones you’ve never seen, but were more capable.” The latest Aibo was a very cool piece of machinery, but you’ve got to wonder how a pet Boston Dynamics dog would have looked. Less cute and more technologically impressive, if I had to guess. Hopefully it never got as far as figuring out how to open doors.</p>
<p>As I mentioned last week, the big thing trendwise on the robotics front at CES are UV-C disinfecting robots. This makes a lot of sense on the face of it. It’s a way to leverage existing indoor mapping/navigation technologies with a major hot button topic during the pandemic. The list includes:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254141" style="width: 844px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254141" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2254141" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg" alt="" width="834" height="535" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg 834w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/adibot-a-classroom-2.jpeg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254141" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> UBTech</p></div></p>
<ul>
<li>ADIBOT, which comes in S (stationary) and A (autonomous) models. Of the latter, the company says, “ADIBOT-A is the fully-loaded autonomous disinfection solution that can be programmed and mapped to independently navigate one or multiple floor plans. ADIBOT-S provides 360-degree radiant light coverage, powerful UV-C disinfection, autonomous movement using U-SLAM mapping, secured app, dedicated server and cloud-based connectivity, automatic recharging, and intelligent safety features including the use of &#8216;risk mitigation&#8217; cameras, PIR sensors.”</li>
<li>LG technically announced the excitingly named <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2020/12/lg-announces-autonomous-robot-with-disinfecting-uv-light-for-various-b2b-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autonomous Robot With Disinfecting Light</a> late last year. “This autonomous UV robot comes at a time when hygiene is of the highest priority for hotel guests, students and restaurant customers,” Robotics VP Roh Kyu-chan said in a statement. “Consumers can have the peace of mind that the LG UV robot will help reduce their exposure to potentially harmful germs.”</li>

<p>John Deere also made headlines this week with the long-awaited arrival of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/john-deeres-self-driving-tractor-arrives-later-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully autonomous 8R tractor</a>. The system, which features six pairs of stereo cameras, a pair of Nvidia Jetson modules and a GPS guidance for fully automated operation, will be available in select parts of the U.S. starting this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;This precise location-sensing technology (already) enables farmers to place seeds, spread nutrients and harvest their crops without having to touch the steering wheel,” CTO Jahmy Hindman said in a release. &#8220;Without this self-driving technology, farming is incredibly exhausting mentally and physically. GPS technology allows farmers to spend their time in the cab of a tractor looking at the real-time data they are collecting during the job they are doing and making adjustments.&#8221;</p>

It’s one of the more compelling home robots I’ve seen in some time &#8212; namely because it deals with the very real issue of helping older and mobility impaired people live on their own. At its heart, it’s a robotic shelf, but one that can potentially offer a lot of assistance to people who want to keep living independently.</p>
<p>Labrador also used the opportunity to announce a $3.1 million seed, co-led by Amazon’s Alexa Fund and iRobot Ventures.</p>
<p>I’m still crawling through the virtual halls for more interesting robotics co’s this week, and expect a few more to trickle into next week’s newsletter. In the meantime, a lightning round/stray thoughts.</p>

<ol>
<li>After being a mainstay for the last several CESes, there are no robots at the Samsung press conference; the company appears to have pivoted entirely to talking about sustainability. I’m all for sustainability talk, obviously, but I do wonder what this means for the company’s robotics ambitions. Frankly, I’ve never been entirely sure how far the extends/extended beyond showing off some cool demos.</li>
<li>French (where else) robotics firm <a href="https://www.naio-technologies.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naïo showed off</a> its vineyard robot, TED, which its aiming to deploy in California fields. &#8220;Labor issues and the need to reduce the use of pesticides are global challenges,&#8221; COO Ingrid Sarlandie said. &#8220;With its autonomous agricultural robots Oz, Dino and Ted, Naïo addresses these issues to ensure a sustainable agricultural production in phase with people and the environment.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.doosanrobotics.com/en/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doosan</a> announced that it has sold 1,000 cobots and raised $33.7 million, as it showed off its new robotic camera system. “We’re looking forward to expediting the growth of our business with the recent funds raised,” said CEO Junghoon Ryu, CEO at Doosan Robotics. “We will further enhance the competitiveness of new products and software that are mounted with our proprietary technology and strive to attain the position as number one market share holder in the global cobot market.”</li>
<li>And, of course, I would be remise if I didn’t mention <a href="https://www.ux-xu.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amagami Ham Ham</a>, the latest robot from Qoobo maker, Yukai Engineering. I will let this quote about the finger-nibbling cat robot speak for itself. The robot uses a special algorithm, “HAMgorithm,” to randomly select from two dozen “nibbling patterns” to keep users interested. The company is launching a crowdfunding campaign for the robot this spring.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When GM releases its new Ultra Cruise hands-free driver assistance system in 2023 — starting with Cadillac — it will be powered by the latest Snapdragon system-on-chip from Qualcomm. The announcement, made at 2022 CES, illustrates Qualcomm&#8217;s success in capturing more market share in the automotive sector, specifically in ADAS.</p>
<p>The system-on-chip, called Snapdragon Ride Platform, was developed for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving. It&#8217;s one of a suite of cloud-connected platforms introduced by Qualcomm that automakers can adopt in full or à la carte.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Ultra Cruise system is supposed to be a more capable iteration of its Super Cruise ADAS that was first introduced in 2017.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254488" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The automaker says Ultra Cruise will be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios and eventually be used on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada. That&#8217;s a tall order; and to achieve it, GM is using a trio of sensors — cameras, radar and lidar, which will debut on the luxury electric Cadillac Celestiq— combined with its own software and Qualcomm&#8217;s processor.</p>
<p>To dig into the weeds a bit, the Ultra Cruise compute, which is about the size of two laptops stacked together, is made up of two Snapdragon SA8540P SoCs and one SA9000P AI accelerator to deliver low-latency control functions on 16-core CPUs and AI compute of more than 300 Tera operations per second for camera, radar and lidar processing.</p>
<p>The Snapdragon SoCs are designed with 5nm process technology. The compute unit also includes an Infineon Aurix TC397 processor for system safety integrity. The Aurix TC397 is categorized ASIL-D, which is considered the highest level of automotive safety integrity.</p>
<p>All of this translates to a compute system that will have the processing capability of several hundred personal computers, according to Ken Morris, GM vice president of electric, autonomous and fuel cell vehicle programs, who said it will take the company&#8217;s advanced driver assist system launched in 2017 &#8220;to the next level with door-to-door hands-free driving.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and GM of automotive at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. senior vice president and GM, Automotive said the Ultra Cruise system powered by Snapdragon Ride on Cadillac vehicles &#8220;will be an experiential and technological leap forward for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Super Cruise vs Ultra Cruise</h2>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Ultra Cruise might be more robust and will be available on more roads, however it will still require the driver to pay attention at all times. This means it is not a &#8220;fully autonomous&#8221; Level 4 system, a level of functionality that means the vehicle can handle all driving without the need of a human, in certain conditions. Level 4 systems are what companies like GM subsidiary Cruise is working to commercialize through a robotaxi application.</p>
<p>Ultra Cruise was designed to build on the capabilities of its Super Cruise system. Ultra Cruise also works through a combination of cameras, radars and lidar (not just lidar map data), developing accurate, 360-degree, three-dimensional statistical representations of the environment surrounding vehicles with redundancies in critical areas. The company is relying more on its sensors than mapping however.</p>
<p>Together, this means the system will be able to react to traffic lights, follow navigation routes, maintain and follow speed limits, support automatic and on-demand lane changes, make left- and right-hand turns, avoid objects and park in residential driveways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the weeks leading up to CES, we made a difficult decision. With omicron cases skyrocketing around the country in the lead up to the holiday travel season, we canceled our flights and re-strategized. It made for a chaotic last few weeks of the year, but as long as the show continues to be held the first week of each year, those of us who write about hardware for a living won’t be able to take much time off during the holidays, regardless.</p>
<p>We certainly weren’t the only outlet to arrive at the decision after looking at the numbers. Engadget, The Verge, PCMag and CNET were among the long list of organizations that determined the risk simply wasn’t worth the reward this year. It wasn’t an easy choice, by any stretch. We complain a lot about CES &#8212; it’s hard, stressful and sometimes bordering on miserable &#8212; but it’s long been a valuable opportunity to see, firsthand, what trends the year will hold.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating mix of near-term consumer technology and speculative sci-fi, an opportunity to meet with industry leaders and mingle with startups in the scrum of Eureka Park. Chances are good you’ll bring back a head cold or flu, along with a suitcase full of dirty laundry and industry swag (what my friends in the comics industry have lovingly deemed “the con crud”), but that’s just a consequence of being jammed in a convention center full of people in the dead of winter.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, the cost-benefit analysis changes considerably during a pandemic. To date, there have been 57 million reported cases and 831,000 deaths from the virus in the U.S. alone. And, of course, only looking at the latter figure doesn’t take into account things like the lasting impact of long-COVID on the human body. Nor have we likely seen the full impact of holiday travel on the total number of cases. Ultimately for us, only one decision made sense &#8212; we’d covered CES remotely and would do it again.</p>
<p>I don’t begrudge those who chose to attend (certainly I was considering how fascinating it we be to document a relatively sparsely attended show). Entering year three of the pandemic, we have a much better picture of what this virus is and how it spreads than the last time CES was held in-person, back in January 2020. We have vaccines and boosters now. The show’s governing body, the CTA, instituted mandates and mask rules, among other things. But we were far from alone in our decision.</p>
<p>In addition to the media outlets opting out, a number of major companies joined suit. The incomplete list includes GM, Google, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, Microsoft, Peloton, TikTok, Mercedes, BMW, Velodyne, IBM, Proctor &amp; Gamble, OnePlus and Pinterest. For a few weeks, high-profile dropouts were the major news coming out of CES &#8212; almost certainly not the kind of coverage the CTA was hoping/expecting in the lead up to what was supposed to be the triumphant return of the tech conference.</p>
<p>The organization’s president, Gary Shapiro, penned a<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> fiery op-ed that ran in the Las Vegas Review-Journal</a> on Christmas Day, under the headline, “CES will and must go on in Las Vegas.” By “go on,” Shapiro means in-person, of course. The exec was drawing a line in the sand: Innovation is necessary for our future and an in-person CES is necessary for fostering that innovation. Shapiro waved away media coverage of the show dropouts as “the drumbeat of press and other critics who tell the story only through their lens of drama and big name companies” and after expressing sympathy for those who opted not to attend in-person, equated the suggestion of canceling an in-person event to “living in fear.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A pragmatic argument could have been made that organizations like the CTA are important for consumer tech and a show like CES is necessary for its survival. Instead, the op-ed set the bar impossibly high for an event like CES. People were already, no doubt, wondering about the import of the show in an age of virtual conferences, and failing to offer the sort of life-altering expectations outlined in such a piece only furthers those question.</p>
<p>The truth is that technology is mostly iterative. That’s doubly the case with an event like CES, where the focus is &#8212; at least in theory &#8212; on products that are designed to come to market. That means most of what you see each year are a slightly faster processor or a screen with a bit better resolution. I’ve been covering this industry for a long time now, and I can tell you that if you’re banking on revolution every year, you’re setting yourself up for a life of disappointment.</p>
<p>This is something we’re all inherently aware of that gets obscured with a lot buzzwords (take a shot every time you see the word “metaverse” and see if you make it out of hall 1) and fantastical sci-fi presentations like the one we saw from Hyundai. As we head into the final day of the show, I spent part of the morning thinking about the last time I saw something debut at the show that I would genuinely classify as “life changing.” I will come up with something, I’m sure of it, but right now, I’m coming up short.</p>
<p>Ultimately, concerns that stories about companies not attending the show would eclipse the actual news from CES were put to rest as soon as the show started &#8212; the reason most of the press coverage highlighted dropouts in the lead up to the show is because the show hadn’t actually started yet. The outlets that cover CES covered CES &#8212; albeit remotely, in many cases. It was a strange experience as someone who has attended many in-person CESes, but it was something we were prepped for with last year’s all-virtual show.</p>
<p>It was, again, a mixed bag. Thankfully, the online version of the show was less of a mess than last year. Press conferences were much easier to watch on the platform. Though actual discovery is still an issue &#8212; that’s the thing that’s ultimately lacking when the show moves online. Suddenly the opportunity to stumble on an interesting startup in Eureka Park transforms into another email pitch hurdled into my bottomless void of an inbox.</p>
<p>That’s a point of agreement I have with the CTA &#8212; those startups without a platform ultimately have the most to lose if we move away from in-person events altogether. For that reason, I can certainly sympathize with those who felt the need to go forward, in-person. That and the fact that deposits, hotel fees and plane rides have a bigger impact to the bottom line of some brand new startup than, say, GM or Google.</p>
<p>In the intervening weeks, I received a number of emails from startups telling me that they were also opting not to attend &#8212; and among those that still were, messages that they were pushing back their news. If a product is announced and no one is there to cover it, is it really news? Many have questioned the value in announcing a product during the busiest week of the year, and that question becomes even more pronounced when no one is present to cover it. I suspect that an immediate result from much of this is that the traditionally dead weeks following CES will not be so dead this year.</p>
<p>The truth about CES is that it’s constantly evolving. It’s not easy to see up close, but take a step back and those macro trends fall into stark relief. Reflecting on the biggest news of CES 2012 was an interesting exercise in tracking those trends. Chief among them was the event’s move away from being a mobile show and welcoming in things like automotive, which now comprises a sizable portion of the show.</p>
<p>In its fine print, the CTA notes, “The official name of the global technology event is ‘CES.’ Please do not use ‘Consumer Electronics Show’ or ‘International CES’ to refer to the event.” Heck, even the change from the Consumer Electronics Association to the Consumer Technology Association was a clear indication that the show was trying to grow beyond its earlier parameters. And honestly, it had been a successful one.</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago (I mentioned I’ve been doing this a long time, right), <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/archive/ces-2009-suffers-22-percent-attendance-drop-235943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote a story titled</a>, “CES 2009 suffers 22 percent attendance drop.” As I noted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">in that 2012 retrospective,</a> that year’s show was its best attended &#8212; a growth that would continue for the next several years and peak in 2019.</p>
<p>People have declared CES dead before. In fact, they’ve done it a lot. But continuing to grow the show means continuing to evolve &#8212; and meeting changing expectations around how a show looks. I missed seeing friends and colleagues this year. I missed walking the halls of Eureka Park and eating at that dark little Italian restaurant across from the Convention Center where Pia Zadora does shows on Friday and Saturday (Vegas is a profoundly strange place).</p>
<p>But I also didn’t hate being at home in bed by 10PM ET practically every night this week. Nor am I sure I can say our and other sites’ coverage necessarily suffered from not being at the show in-person this year. As I’ve said, I don’t do CES the way other attendees do. If this pandemic ever ends, I’d like to go back some day. But if I don’t find myself looking at iPhone cases in the Mirage on a cold winter day in early January, I can’t say I’ll be that upset about that, either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumers worldwide have downloaded <a href="https://www.oculus.com/setup/">Meta&#8217;s Oculus app</a>, the mobile companion for Oculus VR devices including the Quest 2, roughly 2 million times globally since Christmas Day, according to new data from third-party app intelligence firms, Apptopia and Sensor Tower. Already, had been some indication that the Quest 2 was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/metas-oculus-virtual-reality-headsets-were-a-popular-holiday-gift.html">popular holiday gift</a> after the Oculus app <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/12/27/win-meta-oculus-app-tops-app-store-rankings-christmas/">shot to the top of the Apple App Store</a> for the first time ever on Christmas Day and became the most popular free app on Google Play in the U.S., as well.</p>
<p>During the week of Christmas in the U.S. (Dec. 23-Dec. 29), adoption of the Oculus app jumped up by 517% week-over-week to reach 1.5 million installs, <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower&#8217;s</a> data indicates.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, the firm saw those installs drop 77% to 345,000 from Dec. 30 through Jan. 5, but this figure is still higher than the week before Christmas 2021 by 42%. And it&#8217;s likely that these more recent downloads still include those who recently received a new Oculus device for the holidays, but hadn&#8217;t gotten around to setting it up yet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the U.S. accounted for the majority of the post-Christmas installs, app intelligence firms estimate that, in total, the app has seen around 2 million global installs from Christmas Day through the present across the App Store and Google Play combined.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower&#8217;s estimate is a bit more conservative on this front, as the firm said the app saw around 1.8 million installs globally from Dec. 31, 2021 through Jan. 5, 2022. Meanwhile, <a href="https://apptopia.com/">Apptopia</a> reports the Oculus app was downloaded 2.189 million times worldwide from Christmas through the present day. Of those 2 million-plus installs, around 79% (or 1.727 million) were attributed to U.S. consumers, it noted.</p>

<p>To put these numbers in a broader perspective, the app&#8217;s 2021 holiday install figures are closer to the <em>total</em> number of <em>yearly</em> downloads the app had seen in its earlier days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Launched in April 2018, the Oculus app saw 1.2 million downloads in its first year on the market, then 2.4 million downloads in 2019. Things picked up in 2020, when 4.4 million global consumers installed the app, according to Apptopia&#8217;s data. In 2021, the Oculus app benefitted from the Quest 2&#8217;s fall 2020 launch and jumped to 10.62 million installs. The U.S. accounted for 7.218 million of those installs, or 68%.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower&#8217;s data is still a bit more conservative here, finding the app had been downloaded a little over 8 million times worldwide in 2021 across the App Store and Google Play, not 10.6 million.</p>
<p>But regardless of which numbers are closer to accuracy, both firms agree that in just a handful of days since Christmas, the Oculus app has gained somewhere in the ballpark of 2 million more downloads.</p>
<p>Meta did not yet reply to a request for comment on the third-party estimates, but the most recent Quest 2 adoption figures are from Qualcomm, whose chipset powers the new VR devices. The company said in Nov. 2021 that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785469/meta-oculus-quest-2-10-million-units-sold-qualcomm-xr2">Meta had shipped 10 million Quest 2 units</a> to date.</p>
<p>The Oculus app works with the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect">legacy products</a> (Rift and Rift S), but these new downloads aren&#8217;t likely for discontinued products, but rather the Quest 2. Meta first began <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-quest-2-the-next-generation-of-all-in-one-vr-gaming/">shipping</a> the Quest 2 in October 2020, which means it has over a full year under its belt as the company&#8217;s flagship device &#8212; one meant to make VR adoption more affordable at its $299 entry-level price point. And after Facebook announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">its big rebrand to Meta last year</a> and detailed its plans for the &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a>,&#8221; more consumers may have found themselves interested in exploring VR for the first time, contributing to the recent install growth.</p>
<p>Although app downloads aren&#8217;t generally a proxy for real-world adoption, in Oculus&#8217; case they can help paint a picture as to how many consumers may have recently bought &#8212; or were gifted &#8212; a new Oculus VR device. The app allows consumers to download new VR apps and games and find friends to connect with in VR, so it&#8217;s something most Quest 2 owners will choose to install.</p>
<p>As of Jan. 5, the Oculus app has dropped in the U.S. App Store rankings, which take into account both installs and velocity, among other factors. It&#8217;s now No. 111 Overall but a respectable No. 10 in the Entertainment category where it&#8217;s listed.</p>
<p>In addition, Apptopia reports the app is seeing decent engagement from its new users. The firm estimates the Oculus app has 2.41 million daily active users &#8212; above previous levels. This figure indicates that users didn&#8217;t just set up the app once then abandon it, but are still actively exploring the VR world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York Times Company agreed to purchase sports media outlet The Athletic in a deal valued at $550 million, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nyt-to-buy-the-athletic-for-550-million">reports</a>.</p>
<p>This deal comes after months of speculation &#8212; at one point, The Athletic CEO Alex Mather approached Axios about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-startups-axios-and-the-athletic-discuss-merger-eyeing-spac-deal-11616756401">a merger</a>, which did not come to fruition. With this deal, the company seeks to bolster its subscription business &#8212; The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/business/media/nyt-new-york-times-earnings-q2-2021.html">surpassed</a> 8 million subscriptions last year and is on track to surpass its goal to <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/at-the-new-york-times-10-million-paid-digital-subscribers-is-no-longer-an-ambitious-enough-goal/">grow to 10 million</a> subscribers by 2025.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, The Athletic had 1.2 million subscribers as of November, who pay about $72 per year. But on its own, The Athletic isn&#8217;t yet profitable, and didn&#8217;t plan to be until 2023 &#8212; it employs 600 staff and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-athletic-burned-through-95-million-between-2019-and-2020">spent almost $100 million</a> between 2019 and 2020, though it only brought in around $73 million in the same time period.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254498" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With $550M the NYT could have just subsribed to The Athletic for 46 million years.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The New York Times&#8217; acquisition of The Athletic is consistent with recent trends in media, where many outlets are consolidation. Recently, BuzzFeed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">acquired</a> Complex and HuffPost before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/">going public</a>, for example. But media workers are skeptical of these changing tides &#8212; after BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost, for example, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/09/media/huffpost-layoffs/index.html">laid off</a> 47 of 190 HuffPost employees and closed the entire HuffPost Canada arm, impacting 23 more employees. At the onset of the pandemic, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/504227-new-york-times-lays-off-68-staffers-primarily-from-ad-division">both The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-layoffs-pay-cuts-fa15a80d-47b7-46a5-a08f-3e7eba558f30.html">The Athletic laid off</a> employees as well, as did many media companies.</p>
<p>More media workers are seeking out union agreements to protect them from sudden layoffs and paycuts, which were a constant threat in the industry even before the onset of the pandemic. Some journalists have taken an even more radical approach &#8212; in late 2019, Deadspin&#8217;s <a href="https://defector.com/how-we-got-here/">entire staff</a> quit the site due to frustrations with management and started Defector, a worker-owned media company. In its <a href="https://defector.com/defector-annual-report-year-one/">first year</a>, Defector earned $3.2 million in revenue, which accounted for its $3 million in operating expenses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a much smaller deal than its acquisition of The Athletic, The New York Times purchased Wirecutter, a product reviews site, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/business/media/new-york-times-company-buys-the-wirecutter.html">$30 million in 2016</a>. But there has been significant tension between Wirecutter and its parent company in recent months &#8212; after two years of slow-paced union contract negotiations, Wirecutter staff <a href="https://defector.com/today-is-a-good-day-to-not-read-wirecutter/">went on strike</a> for five consecutive days, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday, after management failed to reach an agreement with them before Thanksgiving. Then, the Wirecutter Union filed an unfair labor practices <a href="https://defector.com/wirecutter-union-files-labor-grievance-after-vindictive-new-york-times-withheld-holiday-pay/">complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board after The New York Times withheld their pay while on strike. By December 14, the union, represented by <a href="https://twitter.com/nyguild">The NewsGuild of New York</a>, reached a deal with the New York Times, ensuring increased pay and improved working conditions. But the New York Times is still facing scrutiny for <a href="https://twitter.com/NYTGuildTech/status/1478789680518807556">anti-union behavior</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Hey </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-kpws4y r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/TheAthletic">@TheAthletic</a></span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">, we’d love you to meet our friend </span><span class="r-18u37iz"><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-kpws4y r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0" dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://twitter.com/nyguild">@nyguild</a>,&#8221; the Wirecutter Union tweeted after the news broke.</span></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on how subscriptions to The Athletic will change, or how staff at the publication will be impacted by the acquisition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2019, Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/amazon-sidewalk-is-a-new-long-range-wireless-network-for-your-stuff/">announced</a> its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Sidewalk/b/?node=21328123011">Sidewalk network</a>, a new low-bandwidth, long-distance wireless protocol and network for connecting smart devices &#8212; and keeping them online when your own WiFi network, for example, goes down, by piggybacking on your neighbor&#8217;s network. Since last year, Amazon has been turning its Echo devices into Sidewalk bridges and select Ring and Tile devices can now access the network. Now, Amazon is launching its first professional-grade Sidewalk device meant to cover large areas like a university campus or park.</p>
<p>The full name for the new device is a mouthful: the Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro by Ring. It could be installed inside but is mostly meant to be set up outside &#8212; and ideally on a high spot &#8212; and can cover hundreds of devices up to five miles away (depending on the local circumstances, of course).</p>
<p>To test the devices, Amazon partnered with Arizona State University, which will install these new Sidewalk bridges on light poles on its Tempe campus. The University Technology Office plans to use it as a proof-of-concept with plans to connect sunlight and temperature sensors, CO2 detectors and particle counters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Amazon is also partnering with <a href="https://thingy.us/">Thingy</a>, an IoT company that specializes in environmental monitoring, to install its air quality monitoring tools to alert first responders of potential wildfires.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon Sidewalk Bridge Pro brings us the power of [Long Range] in a massive number of needed locations, easy integration with our existing applications in AWS, and trusted security for the devices and applications. We are very excited to work with Amazon Sidewalk to measure air quality and wildfires with our sensors and help solve the connectivity challenges for these critical applications,&#8221; said Scott Waller, CEO and co-founder of Thingy.</p>
<p>But beyond the device itself, it&#8217;s the fact that Amazon continues to invest in the Sidewalk ecosystem that&#8217;s most important here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a network, we&#8217;re enabling actors to help the IoT industry,&#8221; Stefano Landi, the director of <span class="il">Amazon</span> <span class="il">Sidewalk, told me. &#8220;</span>At the end of the day, if we want to drive the proliferation of smart and connected devices everywhere, you need to have the right network. If you talk to IoT developers today, yes, there are many options, but either it&#8217;s very expensive, from a connectivity perspective vs. cellular, or the range is limited, or it&#8217;s draining the battery, or it&#8217;s just that the overall development cycle is too complex. So we felt that we should invest and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done and we continue to invest in enabling these networks so that the IoT community can build any type of application: consumer, enterprise, public sector. &#8221;</p>
<p>Landi noted that only a few months after launching the network, the company now has very strong residential coverage in more than 100 major U.S. metro areas. In part, of course, that&#8217;s because there are a lot of Echo devices in America&#8217;s homes and unless users opt out, most modern Echo smart speakers now have Sidewalk enabled by default. Not everybody is comfortable with that, though Amazon would argue that it designed its network to be privacy-first and that it won&#8217;t use a lot of bandwidth (it&#8217;s mostly for passing alerts, not your Ring camera&#8217;s video feed, after all). But it&#8217;s a fair guess that most users aren&#8217;t even aware of Sidewalk to begin with.</p>
<p>Covering a residential area is one thing, though. With the Sidewalk Bridge Pro, businesses can now also cover entire swaths of land to connect their sensors. There seems to be some demand for this, because Landi noted that &#8220;more than a few thousand companies&#8221; have already reached out to Amazon to ask about commercial use cases &#8212; mostly in connection with AWS IoT, the company&#8217;s cloud-based managed IoT service. A lot of this interest, Landis said, is coming from companies that want to build public sector solutions, mostly around smart city services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sidewalk Bridge Pro is a professional-grade bridge that is exactly tailored to be deployed outside of those [residential areas],&#8221; explained Landis. &#8220;So that now you have coverage pretty much everywhere. Think about commercial centers, parks, city parks, state parks, municipal parks, wildness areas, commercial area, and so on. Now you really bring that ubiquitous connectivity, so when you&#8217;re there, building a solution, you know that coverage is going to be pretty much anywhere that you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landis noted that while he expects most users to install the bridge outdoors, it can also used indoors to cover a warehouse or a large store. And even though it&#8217;s explicitly called the &#8216;Pro,&#8221; we shouldn&#8217;t expect the company to launch a consumer-style &#8220;non-pro&#8221; version anytime soon. That&#8217;s what the Echo and Ring devices are for, after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Working from home has been my normal for more than a decade, but it&#8217;s getting a bit stale. Time to spice it up — with some of CES 2022&#8217;s hottest items, all of which definitely kind of exist.</p>
<p>First off let&#8217;s upgrade these dinky twin 27-inch Dells I&#8217;ve been attempting to work on for the last couple years. They&#8217;re flat — lifeless! And the bezels between them? So disorientating! What I need is something I can just stick my head right in and be <em>immersed</em> in the TechCrunch experience.</p>
<p>Samsung knows what&#8217;s up: one giant 55-inch monitor curved like a snow shovel. <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-together-for-tomorrow-vision-at-ces-2022">The Odyssey Ark</a> is an experiment in next-gen media, meant for you to be streaming, gaming, and video chatting all at the same time on the same screen. Check out how it dominates YouTuber Tim Schofield:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Now if I&#8217;m going to have to tip backwards about 40 degrees to read the top of the PDF I display at 750% on there (ever print a document that big? That text is <em>crisp</em>), I better have a decent chair. Fortunately Razer&#8217;s got my back — literally.</p>
<p><a href="https://press.razer.com/product-news/ces-2022-project-sophia-enkiprohs/">The Enki Pro HyperSense</a> isn&#8217;t just a comfy chair I can easily dominate <em>Halo: Infinite</em> deathmatches from. It&#8217;s basically a giant Rumble Pak.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254201" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254201" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254201" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg" alt="Rendering of the mechanical interior of the Razer Enki hypersense chair." width="1024" height="732" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg 1354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/enki-chair.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254201" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Razer</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With 65,000 haptic variations it has the tactile feedback of +/- 1 G-Force and can create 1.5 inches of vertical and backward tilt in your seat,&#8221; Razer explains. So when your Warthog gets naded, you don&#8217;t just feel it in your pride, you actually fall over as your chair bounces you up and out. Well, maybe you won&#8217;t fall, but if you&#8217;re streaming it&#8217;ll get a laugh., so lean into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to work while I play, though, so I need a keyboard that matches the quality of my writing. Writing really starts from the <em>keys</em>, as I&#8217;ve always said. Why do you think all the old-style authors had those great chunky typewriters? Can&#8217;t write cool characters if you don&#8217;t look cool doing it. I&#8217;m not sure how Neal Stephenson gets around that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254214" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254214" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254214" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg" alt="A Keychron keyboard seen from above." width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg 1720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=1536,685 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/q1-keychron.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254214" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keychron</p></div></p>
<p>But every writing style is different, and you should build your keyboard from the ground up and with a good foundation. That&#8217;s Keychron&#8217;s Q1 for you: solid as hell, and you can assemble it yourself with a bunch of different styles of keycaps and switches on tap. Why not have WASD in gaming linear but the rest in clicky tactile? Well, probably because it&#8217;ll feel weird, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>(Joking aside, I actually have one of these to test and it&#8217;s pretty nice. A good mechanical keyboard is a perfectly practical way to upgrade your own WFH setup.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that keyboard plugged into? Glad you asked. See, I&#8217;ve come to understand that heat management is at the core of PC performance, but at the same time good insulation is at the core of a quiet rig. How can I have both, though? And don&#8217;t say liquid cooling! That&#8217;s just crazy. No, I&#8217;m going with the most elaborate solution possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cyberpowerpc.com/page/ces-2022/">The Kinetic series from CyberPowerPC</a> uses a complex set of folding triangles to produce variable airflow across the face of the case, opening and closing as heat requirements change. Why triangles? Why this origami style and not just some valves? Why such a complex arrangement doomed to get clogged with dust? Hello, because it looks awesome.</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. How will people see all my important swag when I&#8217;m on a video call? First of all, thanks for your concern, I appreciate it. You&#8217;re a kind person. But I thought of that too. Check out my new Zoom setup:</p>

<p>Right?!</p>
<p>Not only will they see my whole tasteful computing nook, but also how I&#8217;m&#8230; definitely fully dressed in a professional clothes during the workday. Okay, maybe I can angle it so&#8230; well, I&#8217;ll figure it out. Anyway, this huge telepresence rig <a href="https://lavitre.fr/en-us">comes from French company la Vitre</a>, which advertises it as &#8220;an 86-inch experience.&#8221; It&#8217;s actually got a bunch of other cool stuff built in too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I need to make sure I&#8217;ve got the freshest ping in the lobby or people will think when I dodge their shots it&#8217;s all down to packet loss. TP-Link has the final word with its <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-axe200-omni/">Archer AXE200 Omni robotic router</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254232" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/roborouter.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254232" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2254232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/roborouter.gif" alt="Animation of a router automatically moving its antennas." width="640" height="527" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2254232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TP-Link</p></div></p>
<p>No more getting up and going to the router to tweak your antenna configuration. Wait&#8230; you don&#8217;t do that? No wonder you aren&#8217;t climbing the leaderboard, my friend. Signal goblins. Just wait for this thing to come out and it&#8217;ll take care of everything for you. After the robocalypse, every one of the hunter-killers will cold sport one of these bad boys.</p>
<p>Right, there&#8217;s my big upgrade. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have all the pieces here in person some time in the next decade or so.</p>

		Alvaro Gutierrez is co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.barkibu.com/">Barkibu</a>, which uses data to make pet care better, more affordable and personalized. Alvaro began his career providing acquisition financing for M&amp;A at JP Morgan before co-founding Spanish pet retail giant Kiwoko, which in turn acquired 12 other companies and was eventually sold 5x.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">When startup founders think of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), we tend to think of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;-esque processes, involving dramatic office reshuffling and expensive rebranding. The reality though, is that M&amp;A isn&#8217;t limited to flashy corporate businesses nor does it have to bulldoze through company culture.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of 2021, of 530 startup acquisitions, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/acquisitions-data-dive/ec8fb95f-f099-4c43-b856-81ddc3e84feb/acquisitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> were startups buying other startups. More early-stage businesses are climbing aboard the M&amp;A train to take advantage of fellow startups&#8217; tech, talent and to absorb competitors. They&#8217;ve also realized that deals don&#8217;t have to have heavy price tags and red tape that larger companies navigate.</p>
<p>I know this firsthand from 15 years buying and selling companies. I previously worked at JP Morgan, facilitating M&amp;A for corporate banks, and I&#8217;ve taken what I&#8217;ve learned to the startup space. I conducted 12 acquisitions at my retail platform Kiwoko, which helped it grow to over €150 million in revenue, and it was eventually sold five times.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is particularly beneficial for startups that struggle to scale operationally because they essentially buy cash flow, revenue and other companies&#8217; traffic, meaning startups grab a bigger share of their markets. They&#8217;re also a good way for startups to find, consolidate and experiment with their value proposition. The problem though, is that most founders don&#8217;t know how to get started with M&amp;A and resign themselves to the shadows of bigger players. But mergers are accessible and advantageous to businesses of all sizes.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The human side of M&amp;A is always the hardest to get right.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These are my three insider tips for startup M&amp;A:</p>
<h2>Let your in-house team get the ball rolling</h2>
<p>M&amp;A naturally comes with some friction and cost, but unlike corporates, startups don&#8217;t need to outsource people to smooth out the steps. You don&#8217;t need investment banks, advisers, legal teams and consulting firms to ensure all goes well.</p>
<p>Founders can run business and financial checks with the support of in-house resources like the accounting department and lawyers, as well as leverage their network and do due diligence through trusted connections. Granted, you have to spend a lot of time and focus in this vetting stage, but it is possible and effective without bringing new players in.</p>
<p>Beyond the logistics, founders need to actively analyze the value of the targeted company. For example, every one of the acquisitions I have made — even with significantly smaller companies — had better purchasing terms with at least one supplier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2251537&amp;preview=true">ridiculing one mosquito-fighting product</a>, I figured it&#8217;d be only right to highlight another piece of buzz-reducing tech that was showing off its products at CES this year. <a href="https://www.mosqitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mosqitter</a> is an industrial-scale mosquito murdering machine that attracts female mosquitos before they get a chance to lay eggs. From there, it&#8217;s a short zap away from dispatching them with great aplomb.</p>
<p>The company explains that there are four natural components that mosquitoes are lured to before they launch into their vampiric, blood-sucking ways: The CO<sub>2</sub> from breathing, the heat signatures from our bodies, UV light at a specific wave-length that mammals emit and scent. Mosqitter&#8217;s product uses all four to attract the creatures, in various cycles to maximize its allure. The company explains its product is designed to work in all weather conditions. It can be operated remotely through an app, and can run 24/7 by adding an optional set of solar panels.</p>
<p>Once the mosquitos have been courted into the machine, they are killed without the use of poisons.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251945" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mosqitter imitates a living being, which attracts female mosquitoes, and pulls them into the device. The results can be seen from day one. Two-three weeks later, the mosquitoes&#8217; breeding cycle will be disrupted and the territory will be free of mosquitoes,&#8221; the company&#8217;s COO, Olga Diachuk explains, before clarifying that the machine doesn&#8217;t kill the mosquitos directly &#8211; it has a net that keeps them trapped, where they starve to death and/or dry out.</p>
<p>The company originally started sales in 2020, and claims it has sold more than 250 units. It is hoping to start scaling up manufacturing in the local areas where the machines will be most needed, including Italy, India and Zimbabwe. Perhaps most impressively, the company has accomplished all of this on a shoestring budget. Since being founded in 2019, the company has been operating from $85,000 worth of grants from the <a href="https://usf.com.ua/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ukrainian Startup Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.crdfglobal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRDF Global</a>, and a $100,000 angel check, in addition to its revenue generated from product sales.</p>
<p>Mosquitter currently has three different versions of its product on the market &#8211; the smallest, for home use, costs $950. A business-focused version costs $1,150, and there&#8217;s a large-scale version available for $2,100, which is focused on parks, local municipalities, and larger areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a journalist and investor, I&#8217;m always a little suspicious of single-product, super-niche companies; there are just so many things that can go wrong, and one of the ways that direct-to-consumer brands do well is having the ability to cross-sell to its customers. <a href="https://us.morphee.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morphée</a> was one of those brands, starting with its frankly ludicrously over-designed (but stunningly beautiful) <a href="https://us.morphee.co/products/morphee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$99 non-digital sleep and meditation product</a>. It added <a href="https://us.morphee.co/products/my-little-morphee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a product for kids</a>, and at CES, it launched the Morphée Zen, a smaller, travel-focused relaxation pebble.</p>
<p>The Zen is an ultra-portable &#8220;pebble&#8221; that offers mental wellness training and sleep-focused relaxation sessions, including soothing sounds, music and voice therapies. It has 72 audio sessions based on six themes, including dynamic relaxation, deep relaxation, and breathing techniques. There&#8217;s a bunch of nature sounds, relaxing music and quick two-minute &#8220;instant relief&#8221; sessions to get your heart rate down to a more manageable rate.</p>
<p>Of course, the real question here is whether Morphée is trying to stretch its brand just a little bit too far. Taking the smartphone devices away from kids with the My Little Morphée might make sense and the original Morphée is a piece of art as much as a meditation device.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Zen makes a lot less sense to me, in a world where $69.99 a year buys you a <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> subscription, and there&#8217;s an almost infinite supply of meditations, sleep sounds and focus music available from Spotify, YouTube and, well, pretty much everywhere else you can imagine. Do we really need another product that will &#8212; sooner or later &#8212; end up in a landfill somewhere, when a purely software solution would accomplish essentially the same thing?</p>
<p>The product will be available in Q3 2022, priced at $79.99</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flittleotterhealth.com&amp;esheet=52557905&amp;newsitemid=20220106005043&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Little+Otter&amp;index=1&amp;md5=bd8bb23f7b6ba756f95c4e37aa5a0d10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Otter</a>, a digital mental health company that aims to provide tools and treatment for both children and their families, has raised $22 million in Series A funding. The round was oversubscribed and led by CRV, with participation from Torch Capital, Vast Ventures, Hinsdale, Boxgroup, Able, Carrie Penner Walton, G9, Springbank Collective and angel investors. This latest investment brings Little Otter&#8217;s total funding to $26.75 million.</p>
<p>The company was founded in May 2020 by mother-daughter duo Rebecca Egger and Dr. Helen Egger based on the idea that the children&#8217;s mental health crisis can only be addressed by treating the whole family through accessible and scalable precision technology. Since its launch, the company has seen 45% month-over-month growth.</p>
<p>Once a family signs up on the platform, they&#8217;re given a quick questionnaire that aims to understand their needs. From there, the family receives a personalized report and gets matched with a personal care lead who will review the assessment answers together to discuss the family&#8217;s unique needs. The care lead will then define the next steps and create a care plan for the family. Every family then starts their mental health journey by setting goals and milestones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254495" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In terms of the new funding, Little Otter says the investment will fuel growth and allow it to offer its platform in more states. Little Otter is currently available in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, with plans for the platform to be available nationally by 2023.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be investing heavily in building our state-of-the-art tech and data platform,&#8221; Little Otter CEO Rebecca Egger told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;We are bringing on Jim Inoue as our chief technology officer to oversee Little Otter’s technical growth and scale. He will play a pivotal role as we build a new way of identifying and treating early childhood mental health, incorporating data, proprietary assessment methods, and data visualization in the platform. Additionally, we’re working to become an in-network benefit covered by insurance plans and employers and will be in all 50 states by 2023.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Otter’s platform is based on co-founder Dr. Helen Egger’s clinical expertise and provides virtual, on-demand and integrated care with parenting specialists, early childhood-trained therapists, couples therapists and pediatric psychiatrists. The company says it aims to break down existing barriers to services and bring expert mental healthcare to all. Little Otter says 85% of families using its care plans have reached clinical improvements within just six sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future of the platform, Rebecca Egger says the company wants Little Otter to be the personalized mental health companion for every family.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a massive amount of need for mental health resources in this country but a one-size-fits-all solution will not work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are building Little Otter to be the go-to resource for all families and the long-term partner that helps families meet their mental health goals and thrive.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV charging companies have been showing their wares at CES for years now. But this year, the stakes — and opportunities — are a bit higher.</p>
<p>With dozens of electric passenger cars and commercial fleets expected to hit the market in just a few years, EVs are pushing into the mainstream. That larger market comes with a price: Mainstream consumers expect charge times that are akin to gas refueling times, are accustomed to good user experience design and probably haven&#8217;t ever had to think about peak and off-peak energy grid hours.</p>
<p>Charging companies and smaller startups that showed up at CES this year seemed cognizant of that shift and pitched products that were faster, more connected, easier to use, easy to install and built to work with the electrical grid. The takeaway: EV charging companies, keen to reach this bigger customer base, revealed products designed to hit just about every use case, from commercial fleet charging to at-home charging, from vehicle-to-grid tech to monetizing advertising space on chargers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">global EV charger market expected to grow from $3.23 billion in 2020 to nearly $11 billion in 2025</a>, the industry still has space for new entrants before it consolidates around a few giants, many of whom did not grace CES with demos or news. The smaller companies that showed off tech at CES are standing out with unique solutions, lots of connectivity and upgraded charge speeds.</p>
<h2>Blink Charging</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blink came to play, with four new charging products this year, including one DC-fast wall-mounted charger and three Level 2 chargers &#8212; one designed for fleet and multiunit applications, another for home applications and the last for integrating advertising displays. All of the chargers come with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as smart capabilities that allow for things like fleet management integration, load sharing technology and energy use management. </span></p>
<h3>Blink MQ 200 for fleet EV charging stations</h3>
<p>Specifically designed for fleets, workplace and multifamily locations, this 50 amp charger comes with Plug &amp; Charge functionality, which can automatically identify vehicles through the unique and encrypted flow of information from the vehicle to the charging station. As its name suggests, this means drivers will simply have to plug in to begin a charging session.</p>
<p>The MQ 200, which will be available by the end of Q1 this year, comes with Smart Grid functionality for direct utility communications and local load management across two or more chargers, which allows for the installation of two to 20 chargers on a single circuit, ideal for overnight fleet charging. It also communicates with the Blink Network, software that connects Blink chargers to the cloud, as well as the Blink Fleet <span style="font-weight: 400;">Management </span>Portal, which was also launched at CES. The portal gives fleet managers a dashboard to track charging and load management, chargers, vehicles and drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Blink HQ 200, next-gen home charging</h3>
<p>The HQ 200 is Blink&#8217;s updated residential charger, a Level 2 charger with 50 amps, up from last generation&#8217;s 30 amps. The extra power at home, as we&#8217;ll see with other EV charging companies, is a trend this year as companies race to find ways to decrease charge time.</p>
<p>While customers can choose to go for a basic charger with no bells and whistles, the smart, Wi-Fi-enabled version is really the one that intrigues us. The HQ 200 is one of Blink&#8217;s first chargers to come with vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G), which allows EVs to charge during off-peak hours and give back to the grid from energy stored in the EV battery during peak hours when there&#8217;s high demand.</p>
<p>The HQ 200 also connects to the Blink Mobile App to instantly start a charge, schedule charging times and set reminders. It will be available by the end of Q1 this year.</p>
<p><strong>DC Fast wall-mounted for two cars at once</strong></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall 50 kW can be wall-mounted or set up on a pedestal, and it can charge two cars at once, which makes it ideal for fleet, retail and streetside charging and high-traffic locations. It has up to 150 amps of output and V2G tech, a 10-inch touchscreen display and the ability to bill for charges based on time, kWh or per session. It also allows for remote management and energy usage reports via the Blink Network, and an RFID reader allows for users with a member card, RFID credit card or mobile app to start a charge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price point will also make it attractive for locations that otherwise may not feel they can afford DC fast,&#8221; a Blink spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;The DC Wall 50 kW costs less than $20,000, while existing equipment today typically starts at $35,000.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Vision IQ 200 for advertising</h3>
<p>This Level 2 charger comes with one or two 30-inch LCD screens for dynamic digital media displays, allowing for full-service advertising capabilities &#8212;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ideal for retail, hospitality, municipal and high-traffic locations. Property hosts will be offered revenue share opportunities for both charging and advertising income, the latter of which will be managed through a third-party vendor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vision IQ 200 is equipped with one or two 80-amp IQ 200 chargers, and it features easy payment via RFID, Apple Pay, Google Wallet and all major credit cards, as well as other smart functionalities like remote management and real-time energy usage reports. </span></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall will be available later this year, said Blink.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">E-Lift</span></h2>
<p>E-Lift came to CES to introduce its new customizable GS Pop-Up charging station, which the Dutch company hopes to launch in North America soon. The little station comes with up to four plugs for simultaneous charging, and it can be equipped with sensors that link to E-Lift&#8217;s Sustainable and Smart Energy Management System (SENSE).</p>
<p>The SENSE platform is a management system for users&#8217; mobility and energy needs. Customers can log in remotely to monitor and manage their mobility and energy-consumption data, &#8220;resulting in a cost-effective energy transformation that is beneficial for governments and companies looking to reshape their future with the use of renewable energy resources,&#8221;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/e-lift-to-announce-new-smart-and-sustainable-pop-up-charging-station-at-ces-2022-301451922.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the company said in a statement</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">JuiceBar</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JuiceBar, a Connecticut-based EV charging company that’s really playing the Made in America card, unveiled its first residential charger at CES &#8212; the Cheetah, aptly named for being quick, so the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which says it will credit $1,000 for every old charger that is exchanged for one of its new chargers, will be selling its Cheetahs sometime in 2022. JuiceBar has hundreds of commercial chargers, both public and private, across the U.S. and Canada, the same markets that will see the new at-home charger. </span></p>
<p>The Cheetah will be available in 16, 32, 40 and 48-amp configurations <span style="font-weight: 400;">and 120, 208 and 240 input voltages</span>, which after seeing what Blink is putting out, doesn&#8217;t make JuiceBar the fastest Level 2 on the market, but it&#8217;s close. The Cheetah also has Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and cloud connectivity, which helps for Smart Grid charging. It has a 25-foot cord with an optional tangle-free cord retractor.</p>
<p>For peace of mind when charging at home, the Cheetah also is built with dual safety relays, which allows the second relay to open and break the circuit in the event that the first closes and fuses shut. The charger&#8217;s power is backed by 100% certified carbon reduction projects that offset the carbon footprint of the charger, according to JuiceBar. The company is buying carbon offsets for the first year. After that, buyers can continue to purchase carbon offsets on a subscription basis of less than $1 per week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cheetah will be available for consumers in late Q2 or early Q3, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. They&#8217;ll initially be sold through third parties such as auto dealers, house builders and utility companies in the U.S. and Canada. </span></p>
<h2>Wallbox</h2>
<p>Wallbox introduced its Quasar 2 at CES this year, the latest generation of its bidirectional home charger. This one not only allows EV owners to charge and discharge their EV to power their home or the grid, but it also allows owners to isolate their home from the grid and use their EV for backup power during a blackout, even if it&#8217;s caused by a natural disaster. Wallbox says its Quasar 2 can power a home for more than three days during a blackout.</p>
<p>The vehicle-to-home (V2H) functionality should help EV owners save money on home energy costs, says the company, particularly in states where power rates are related to demand. Users can schedule charging sessions to happen when rates are low, and those who have solar power installations can store excess energy in their EV during low usage periods.</p>
<p>The Quasar 2 provides 48 amps of power, comes with CCS compatibility for rapid-charging vehicles like the Jaguar I-Pace or BMW i3 and connects to the myWallbox app through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet or 4G.</p>
<p>Wallbox didn&#8217;t share how much the Quasar 2 would cost, but said it would be comparable to Quasar 1, which costs about $4,000. It plans to launch by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Meredot</h2>
<p>Electric cars aren&#8217;t the only vehicles hitting the market. Micromobility vehicles need some love, too. That&#8217;s why Meredot unveiled its first commercial Wireless Charger designed for e-scooters, e-mopeds and other vehicles like food delivery robots and wheelchairs. The charger takes the shape of a physical pad that can either be placed above or below ground, and it charges vehicles that have been equipped with a receiver when they are parked on top of it.</p>
<p>Meredot is targeting micromobility OEMs and fleet operators for its Wireless Charger. It&#8217;s ready to go to market and license its tech to companies that want to offer a novel and potentially hassle-free way of giving vehicles a charge. For micromobility fleets in particular, charging scooters and bikes, even when they have swappable batteries, is one of the major cost-suckers, so this kind of tech could potentially be a game changer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Meredot Wireless Charger delivers a new, distributed architecture that helps achieve greater site capital efficiency and scalability, saving energy and costs,&#8221; said Roman Bysko, CEO and co-founder of Meredot, in a statement. &#8220;The Meredot Wireless Charger can become an infrastructural foundation to a new micromobility charging experience benefitting both operators and riders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims its tech can charge 50% more e-scooters on the same surface compared to traditional cable charging systems, which can lead to serious savings for charging sites. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mosquitos <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/world-deadliest-animal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill more people</a> than any other creature in the world, and there&#8217;s no shortage of potential tech solutions. One such solution comes from <a href="https://bzigo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bzigo</a>, which markets a device that finds mosquitos in your home, points at them with a laser and can notify you on your phone when a mozzy is buzzing about.</p>
<p>Walking the halls at CES, I often find the odd company where I have to push my cynicism down deep. It turns out that &#8220;walking&#8221; those halls virtually &#8212; after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/google-cancels-ces-show-presence-amid-omicron-concerns/">TechCrunch announced</a> that we are not attending in person &#8212; doesn&#8217;t shield your friendly correspondent from the odd moment of &#8220;wait, what?&#8221; in the context of a trade show. In this case, the magic of pointing at a mosquito with a laser pointer is a super neat tech challenge, and I can absolutely see how this could be the first step along a path toward productizing an autonomous mosquito eliminator.</p>
<p>The device itself consists of a light source (infrared LED), a hi-res wide camera and enough electronic brains crammed into the little package to do the rest. The AI built into the device can, according to the company, tell the difference between man&#8217;s worst friend and a speck of dust, by analyzing the movement patterns of the would-be pest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251537" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I could let all of this excitement slide in the (virtual) hustle-bustle of a CES show floor, but there are two issues.</p>
<p>The first issue is that &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/mosqitter">unlike other products we saw at CES</a> &#8212;  the device doesn&#8217;t actually do anything to eliminate the insects, it merely sends a notification to your phone that it&#8217;s time to dust off your nerf gun (or whatever your favorite mosquito-dispensing method might be), and points at the little flying good-for-nothing with a little red laser pointer. The company assured me that it&#8217;s a Class 1 &#8220;absolutely safe&#8221; laser. I can see why the company chose to do that &#8212; I can&#8217;t imagine the legal and health risks involved with a laser that&#8217;s powerful enough to actually zap the skeeters to whence they came. But that also introduces a fundamental question about this product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locating the mosquito is the real challenge; killing the mosquito is the easy part,&#8221; says Benjamin Resnick, product manager at Bzigo, as he refers to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHOECBFpy04" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoHOECBFpy04&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640705788215000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0W4VjsAkCjUrSEU9eiRbLL">demonstration video</a>. &#8220;Once Bzigo uses its laser pointer to show you where it lands, you can easily kill the mosquito yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit, as someone who grew up in a country where the mosquitos are the size of small propeller planes, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve ever had that particular challenge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second &#8212; and much more troubling &#8212; issue with the product is that the company is planning to ship what they have so far as a consumer-facing product. Bzigo claims that thousands of customers have reserved orders for the $199 device, with a product launch and delivery to pre-order customers coming up &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>My most heart-felt kudos to any marketing team at any company that can sell thousands of $199 mosquito-marking laser pointers, but in the grand scheme of things, it is essentially a useless product. Mosquitos are crepuscular (i.e. they feed at dawn and dusk) &#8212; when people are least likely to be awake to hunt for mosquitos. And there&#8217;s already a spectacularly efficient solution out there: Long-lasting, insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are a simple, cost-effective solution to protect families from malaria while they sleep. <a href="https://nothingbutnets.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They cost $10, fully delivered</a>, and create a physical barrier against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and the insecticide woven into the nets kills the mosquitoes before they can transmit the disease from one person to the next.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m as big a nerd as the next guy, and I love a good science experiment or creative prototype. My question: Does the economic and environmental impact of shipping thousands of fancy laser pointers around the world &#8212; which will invariably all find their way to landfills in the next 10 years, without having killed a single mosquito or saved a single life &#8212; really outweigh the benefits?</p>
<p>I look forward to a version of this product that has some sort of mosquito-murdering tech on it. Until that happens, I hope that the founders re-think their plan of shipping this prototype as a consumer product. There are so many real problems out there worth solving; putting on a late-night silent rave laser light show for a couple of mosquitos ain&#8217;t it.</p>
