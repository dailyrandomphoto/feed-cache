										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants the Quest 2 be known as more than a game console for your face.</p>
<p>At the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect developer conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the company&#8217;s efforts to make the Quest a fitness platform for third-party apps like Supernatural and FitXR. He compared it directly to the Peloton as a connected fitness device.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of you are already using Quest to stay fit, it lets you work out in some completely new ways,&#8221; Zuckerberg said in the keynote. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like a Peloton, but instead of your bike you just have your VR headset and with it, you can do anything from boxing lessons to sword-fighting to even dancing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is leaning further into this classification with its hardware detailing that next year they will release an &#8220;Active Pack&#8221; that allows users to customize their Quest 2 headset to make it better featured for working out. The pack will add grips to the controllers and a facial pad that addresses the issue of sweaty headsets.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company began pushing fitness harder in-headset, showcasing a product called Oculus Move which measures activity and calorie-burning tracking into the Quest 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are lot of startups now working on modular home design. Among the most interesting is <a href="https://buildcover.com/">Cover</a>, a seven-year-old, L.A.-based company that says it manufactures fully complete wall, floor, and roof panels in its factory, then transports them on a standard truck and assembles them on site &#8212; without a crane.</p>
<p>The materials it is using are lightweight steel for the building frame and aluminum for the ceilings. The panels are made of a rubber composite because, as founder and CEO Alexis Xavier Rivas explains, &#8220;drywall is not designed for manufacturing or transport &#8212; it&#8217;s too brittle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of thought has been invested in how these buildings are designed. For example, the company installs all plumbing and electrical wiring in the ceiling, so that if an owner wants to run a new wire or pipe, she or he need only pop off ceiling to do it. It sounds strange, but it&#8217;s a lot less strange than sawing a series of holes in a wall, then patching it up and repainting it to achieve the same end. (It also requires less help from the kind of craftspeople like plumbers and electricians that is in short supply right now.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Others of the materials used include real wood and wood composites for the floors and exterior, and solid surface countertops and bathroom floors that are nonporous, meaning they&#8217;re more hygienic as these things go, which matters increasingly to homeowners as the world emerges from a pandemic.</p>
<p>How the materials come together is naturally even more crucial, given that with Clover, much of the focus &#8212; and the promise &#8212; is on both quick assembly and customization.</p>
<p>According to Rivas, the process works as follows: a customer works with the company to create a design. Right now, based partly on the size of its 25,000-square-foot, L.A.-based factory, that design is limited to single-story units that are 800-square-feet or smaller but which take into account factors such as where windows should be placed to minimize energy waste. (Rivas also notes here that the glass, made by Cover, is LEED-certified, and that its homes are airtight, vastly improving their energy efficiency.)</p>
<p>Cover then takes the agreed-upon design, at a price that&#8217;s established up front and includes permitting fees, city fees, foundation fees and the home itself &#8212; think $200,000 for 400-square foot studio; $250,000 for a one-bedroom, 600-square-foot unit; and $400,000 for a two-bedroom dwelling &#8212; and it gets to work engineering the pieces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Somewhat amazingly, it says that after the foundation is complete, it can have the building built and installed within 30 days, down from the 120-window that it used to promise customers previously.</p>
<p>It also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if it can&#8217;t obtain the <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/building-standards/manufactured-modular-factory-built/factory-built-housing.shtml">necessary permits</a>, along with a lifetime structural warrantee and a three-year warrantee for everything else.</p>
<p>These buildings are &#8220;not going to rot,&#8221; says Rivas. &#8220;They aren&#8217;t going to be eaten by termites.&#8221; If a customer needs new air filters, on the other hand, &#8220;we&#8217;ll change them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivas, who grew up in Toronto, studied architecture in college and bounced briefly around a number of architectural firms before founding Cover, takes pride in being able to attract engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to the mission and at various points during a conversation earlier this week, likened Cover&#8217;s processes to that of the automaker.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s seemingly not the only one who sees similarities.The company is today announcing that it has raised $60 million in Series B funding led by Gigafund, an investment firm that was founded by two former Founders Fund investors who have bet heavily on SpaceX.</p>
<p>Joining the round are Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund &#8212; both of which are also early investors in SpaceX and Tesla &#8212; and a whole bunch of other notable backers, including General Catalyst, Lennar, Fifty Years, AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca, Marathon Asset Management CEO Bruce Richards, and Dropbox cofounder Arash Ferdowsi, among others.</p>
<p>Certainly, there&#8217;s no dearth of demand for what Cover is building, given the national housing &#8212; and construction &#8212; shortage. In fact, asked about Cover&#8217;s sales team, Rivas says that there is so much inbound interest that just &#8220;one third of one person&#8217;s time is in sales&#8221; right now.</p>
<p>As for what people are ordering, Rivas says that most of the company&#8217;s customers have ordered its dwellings to accommodate either family moving in (a mother, a kid coming back from college); to create a home office apart from their house; or to establish a way to drum up rental income.</p>
<p>Still, beyond the roughly 20 backyard homes it has already built, the company &#8212; which has now raised $75 million altogether &#8211;very much intends to begin building bigger, multilevel homes, as well as multifamily units.</p>
<p>It mostly boils down to using more panels, Rivas says, which the company will be able to produce from a 100,000-square-foot factory into which it&#8217;s moving (helped along by that $60 million in fresh funding).</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, if all goes as planned, sometime soon, even existing customers will be able to easily enlarge the homes they&#8217;ve already bought using the Cover app. It&#8217;ll be a snap, by his telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go on the app, you&#8217;ll click on room to which you want to add, then schedule it, pay online, and get your renovation done in two to three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of curtain raiser for which Elon Musk is known. Now to see if Cover can pull it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">announced</a> last month it would soon introduce an option that allows hosts to record their live audio sessions in Twitter Spaces to make them available for replay. While the company at the time said the feature would launch in a &#8220;few months,&#8221; it&#8217;s not surprising that, given Twitter&#8217;s accelerated pace of development, the company is rolling out its first iteration of the feature starting today.</p>
<p>Initially, the Spaces Recording option will be will made available to a limited number of Twitter Spaces hosts on iOS and all listeners on iOS and Android worldwide. Twitter says the first users to receive access will be those who were in the original Spaces Beta. It will then roll out the feature to the rest of the Twitter audience in a few more weeks, the company says.</p>
<p>To use the feature, Spaces host will create their live audio room by giving their Space a title and selecting up to three tags to describe what the room&#8217;s about, as usual. Then can then toggle on the new setting, &#8220;Record Space,&#8221; before tapping on the &#8220;Start a Space&#8221; button to begin their live audio session.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225636" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If in a Twitter Space that&#8217;s being recorded, participants will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it at the top of the Space as an indication that the recording is underway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225666" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225666" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2225666" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225666" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>When the host is ready to end the Space, they&#8217;ll tap on the &#8220;End&#8221; button at the top-right as they would otherwise, and will then be presented with a pop-up box that asks them to confirm they want to end both the Space and stop the recording.</p>
<p>Once wrapped, the recording of the Space can be shared across Twitter&#8217;s platform, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves. Twitter does not yet have an audio export option available, we&#8217;re told. Instead, users would have to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterMedia/status/1405262233299345413">request a download of their data</a> to access the recordings directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live audio grew in popularity as the Covid-19 pandemic surged, as it gave something for locked-down users to do while stuck at home. But the appeal has <a href="https://variety.com/vip/clubhouse-has-cooled-off-in-the-u-s-heres-why-it-shouldnt-panic-1235050042/">somewhat</a> dwindled as Covid restrictions lifted and people began to venture back out. Popular live audio app Clubhouse, for example, saw app <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/22/clubhouse-app-over/">installs decline</a> earlier this year, but <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/clubhouse-downloads-pace-jump-179-230212153.html">jump again</a> with an Android release. However, the app also faced lagging engagement in some emerging markets, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/has-clubhouse-plateaued-before-it-hit-the-peak-11631816511362.html">like India</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program">struggled</a> with its creator program.</p>

<p>Recently, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its feature set to offer options that would allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays, and audio exports &#8212; tools that are pushing the app closer to being a podcast creation platform, rather than just a live audio network. (It&#8217;s actually a wonder Apple hasn&#8217;t snatched it up to become an in-house rival to Spotify&#8217;s Anchor.)</p>
<p>Other Twitter Spaces&#8217; competitors, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1322627964798415/?helpref=related">Facebook&#8217;s Live Audio Rooms</a> and newer startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/mark-cuban-backed-live-entertainment-app-fireside-launches-to-creators/">Fireside</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a>, also support audio recordings.</p>
<p>With so much of the live audio landscape now embracing recordings, Twitter had to catch up.</p>
<p>The release follows shortly after a few other updates to Twitter Spaces, including <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453449025877942288">yesterday&#8217;s launch</a> of a Spaces test that brings the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated Spaces Tab</a> to Android users and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447639305397194755">an update bringing easier DM invites</a>. Twitter will also now <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453446589817704451">feature popular Spaces</a> in the Explore / Trending tab on iOS to increase their visibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vsc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSC</a>, a public relations firm that has helped the likes of startups such as ClearCo, Poshmark and Tile craft their stories, has raised millions to invest in the companies they work with. While <a href="http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2767/186454721000002/filing-main.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its bigger fund is estimated to close at $20 million</a>, VSC confirmed that it has raised a $7 million tranche for climate tech startups to start.</p>
<p>VSC Ventures will back early-stage companies with checks between $250,000 to $500,000, and also provide media relations and multimedia content development as a service. The venture arm will be run by VSC CEO Vijay Chattha and General Partner Jay Kapoor, who was recently hired by VSC off of his six-years investing experience.</p>
<p>For VSC, which has helped more than 500 venture-backed startups through 50 exits, 20 unicorns and four IPOs, the argument for its venture arm is that cutting through the noise can help folks get coveted cap table spots.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>VSC Ventures’ debut focus, climate, is related to its competitive advantage of knowing a thing or two about telling stories.<a href="https://vsc.co/climb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Climb</a>, also announced today, is VSC’s practice dedicated to building awareness and action around sustainability-focused startups. The duo thinks that, as every major VC fund begins to invest in the thorny and complicated world of climate, startups will need help explaining why their solutions make sense.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just about hyping up on Twitter &#8212; that is something everybody can do,&#8221; Kapoor said. “It&#8217;s about actually having experience working with the founders to help them with their messaging, to help them with their positioning, and actually have done that consistently over time. Maybe some platform services have a person here and there that can help companies, but that isn’t their core competency and it’s not what they&#8217;re designed for.”</p>
<p>The investors’ own personal track records don&#8217;t hurt either. Before the fund, both Chattha and Kapoor made a slew of climate-focused investments on their own, including Revel, Modumate, Zume, Poshmark, Molekule and Rocean. The firm will eventually back startups in future of work and wellness, as well.</p>
<p>As every venture firm appears to be going the full-stack approach, offering a suite of services beyond simply capital, VSC’s move feels warranted. These days, founders want valuable services from their investors, such as hiring help, or simply, hype. Those within the media have found themselves in a fortuitous, and potentially lucrative spot, as the storytelling skill set skyrockets in demand from aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Harry Stebbings, the well-known podcaster behind “20 minute VC,” recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/harry-stebbings-turns-up-the-volume-on-20vc-with-new-140m-fund/">$140 million for his venture capital fund</a> launched off of his show’s success. Morning Brew CEO Austin Rief <a href="https://angel.co/austin-riefs-rolling-fund/syndicate?utm_campaign=syndicate_direct_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fund</a> of his own. It’s happening in reverse too. Andreessen Horowitz, a more traditional fund, has put significant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/">investment into Future</a>, a media property in which it will publish stories about topics related to areas in which the firm invests.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The only take about the future of media is that media is the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/embed/#?secret=IEMZDHV4fd" data-secret="IEMZDHV4fd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite the blending of media and VC, few public relations firms have raised a fund, it appears.</p>
<p>“Many firms have experimented with equity for services since the late 1990s but abandon it quickly when the startup markets slow down,” Chattha said. “We are using LP capital to back companies and therefore are committed to this approach.”</p>
<p>Fear of a bubble burst aside, another reason that PR firms may not have gone into the investment game is the sheer complexity of managing clients and portfolio companies at the same time. Will there be a tension between VSC clients and VSC portfolio companies that are competing for the same partners’ time?</p>
<p>“We get asked this a lot,” Chattha said. “While the climate tech practice comes with money, in general, a lot of our companies are beyond where we can invest in them.” Since the majority of VSC’s current clients are Series B and beyond, the new fund will only be able to put money into a fraction of clients &#8212; which helps the investors draw a line on who they will and won’t back. This could change if VSC continues to raise more funds in the future.</p>
<p>Public relations firms also sometimes work as crisis communications, helping startups better message their mistakes to investors, employees, customers and, of course, the press. One could argue that founders may feel less incentivized to be vulnerable with a PR firm about struggles if they are also their investors, the same people they are incentivized to impress.</p>
<p>“Because we&#8217;re not the lead investor, we don&#8217;t ever put that kind of peer pressure on them,” Chattha said. “We have enough skin in the game to be honest and vulnerable with them, but not so much that we&#8217;re going to guide them into the wrong for their business.”</p>
<p>The venture arm, still in its early days, wants to be clear that it’s prepared for the startup boom to quiet down &#8212; whenever that happens.</p>
<p>“We’re in an up and to the right era, but it won’t be like this forever,” Chattha said. “Every vertical has its own ups and downs&#8230; and by not being the biggest check in or the lead check in, you know, we take that pressure off.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its big VR and AR-focused event Thursday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a major new title headed to its VR platform that should turn a few heads.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is on the way to the Oculus Quest 2. San Andreas is Rockstar&#8217;s well-loved 2004 entry into the hit GTA franchise, which invites players to wreak havoc in an urban open world fashioned after cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new version of what I think is one of the greatest games ever made will offer players an entirely new way to experience this iconic world in virtual reality,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bringing such an iconic game into the fold is certainly one way to lure more users into the company&#8217;s emerging virtual world — one that even folks squeamish about Facebook&#8217;s VR account login requirements might find enticing.</p>
<p>While Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t offer many details about what to expect or when, Facebook has apparently been working on bringing the GTA classic to its VR headset for years.</p>

<p>As Instagram has pushed video harder through its Reels platform, the uptake for AR filters has gotten more sustained among users, providing an opportunity for Facebook to push them on creators.</p>
<p>The app seems to be pretty early in production, Facebook says it will be going into closed beta later this year as they handpick certain creators to onboard. Eventually, the company will be rolling this out widely as a free app that helps anyone create their own AR filters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now, pay later is here to stay.</p>
<p>A year ago, the biggest players in the space were companies founded solely to offer consumers the ability to pay in installments at the point of sale. Sweden’s Klarna, Australia’s Afterpay and U.S.-based Affirm were the top names associated with BNPL.</p>
<p>But the landscape looks very different now that more companies recognize the opportunity and fight for a piece of the pie. PayPal last month spent $2.7 billion for Japan’s Paidy in an effort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">to crack the market in Asia</a>. In early August, Square announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">plans to acquire Afterpay</a> in a $29 billion deal. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/what-impact-will-apples-buy-now-pay-later-push-have-on-startups/">Apple is said to be getting into the BNPL game</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s BNPL space is seeing a slow emergence of a symbiotic relationship between traditional financial institutions, payments upstarts and leading companies. As credit card and payments firms eye BNPL as a new growth opportunity, incumbents like Klarna and Affirm are seeking ways to make their installment loans available to more consumers.</p>
<h2>The bigwigs enter the fray</h2>
<p>Now that consumers are growing comfortable with BNPL services, the big credit card providers are taking steps to ensure they aren&#8217;t left behind. Visa said on Wednesday that a &#8220;growing list&#8221; of issuers, acquirers and fintechs are using its technology to offer BNPL options to their customers.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mary Kay Bowman, Visa’s SVP and global head of payment and platform products, said the company has been &#8220;enthusiastically embracing BNPL&#8221; for years &#8220;because it expands choice and convenience for buyers and sellers alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If shoppers prefer a BNPL fintech solution, we are here and enabling it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If they want an option from their banks, we’re helping offer those too.&#8221; Interestingly, Visa said today it has inked a &#8220;global brand deal&#8221; with BNPL giant Klarna to accelerate its expansion and scale in several markets.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today at the company&#8217;s Connect conference, they announced that Quest users will be able to make and take audio calls via Messenger. The functionality will be available later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>The Quest has generally struggled with its social interfaces over the years, a surprising shortcoming for a device made by a social networking company. Its new mandate last year for users to sign into the platform with their Facebook IDs created some PR issues for the company but has enabled them eliminate some redundancies in their social workflows.</p>
<p>Users will be able to make calls, send messages or request users join their &#8220;party&#8221; directly from the native Messenger integration inside the Quest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225721" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook announced support for Messenger chat inside the Oculus ecosystem, but audio calls will likely help users organize VR meetups more efficiently and help them stay away from typing in VR which is still a pretty rough experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soon you&#8217;ll be able to read incessant Slack messages without ever having to take your VR headset off.</p>
<p>At Facebook&#8217;s Connect conference, the company showcased a new framework for bringing 2D apps into the Oculus Store so that users will have to duck out of VR less to check notifications on their phone. While a number of Facebook apps are available today, the company also shared that Slack will soon be coming to the Oculus store.</p>
<p>The Quest has previously had very light support for 2D experiences, with most confined to the Oculus web browser. Facebook also previously rolled out native support for Messenger on the Oculus Quest 2 and announced today that they&#8217;ll bringing support for audio calls to the platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In August, Facebook showed off its Horizon Workrooms meeting simulator which integrated with Zoom and promised to bring users a more productive VR experience. The lack of app-support was a major roadblock on the way to this goal.</p>
<p>Typing in VR isn&#8217;t exactly a solved problem, so it&#8217;s likely that this will be an experience most suited for users that have paired their keyboard to the headset or are more comfortable just checking up on notifications rather than firing off a ton of lengthy messages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants to make its Quest 2 headset a productivity device for a new generation of remote workers, but in order to pull that off, it needs apps.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook announced that they&#8217;re bringing 2D apps into the Oculus Store for the first time. The new apps which are based on the Progressive Web App (PWA) industry standard will allow users to check apps that they would have previously needed to take off their headset and see on their phone.</p>
<p>A handful of 2D apps are available in the Oculus Store as of today, including Facebook, Instagram, Smartsheet and Spike. Other apps on the way include Dropbox, Monday.com, MURAL, My5 (UK), Pluto TV and Slack, the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225814" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>While the Oculus Store has seen native VR support from a handful of app-makers, maintaining a dedicated virtual reality app is complicated on multiple fronts and has led to apps from companies like Netflix and Hulu seeing very rare updates. Relying on PWAs will make the developer lift significantly lighter and will hopefully lead to broader adoption than Oculus has generally seen from app-makers.</p>
<p>The inclusion of 2D apps is part of a broader effort to bring the Quest into the workplace. In August, the company announced an app called Horizon Workrooms which allowed workers to bring their desktop into VR and communicated in a shared social VR space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand transport space in Africa has evolved since San Francisco-based ride-hailing firm </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/uber-tests-shared-rides-in-africa-as-uberpool-stays-shut-in-us-canada/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first set up operations in South Africa in 2013, setting the stage for its foray across the continent while radically transforming the entire taxi industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost a decade later, Africa’s taxi industry is now dominated by tens of local and international tech-led ride-on-demand platforms, with the latest additions being global giants Didi Chuxing from China and Russia’s inDriver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to edge out its competitors, Chinese behemoth Didi is currently expanding across the continent, stepping up competition for market leaders Uber and Estonia-based Bolt. Evidence shows it is preparing to enter Nigeria, having begun operations in South Africa in March and Egypt just last month when the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted a job opening for a driver center manager in Lagos – the same role it first advertised for when entering South Africa and Egypt.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key indicator of the company’s imminent expansion into Nigeria was hidden within the lines of the driver center manager&#8217;s responsibilities – &#8220;to collaborate with operations and Didi&#8217;s team to support the successful launch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi did not respond to multiple TechCrunch requests for comment about its expansion plans in Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225766" style="width: 357px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225766" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2225766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?w=347" alt="Didi" width="347" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=153,300 153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=768,1507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=347,680 347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=783,1536 783w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=1044,2048 1044w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225766" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Didi’s app in Nigeria</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi is one of the biggest ride-hailing services in the world. However, unlike global competitors Uber and Bolt, which years ago saw Africa as a key market in their quest for global dominance, the Chinese firm held off the continent until now.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Didi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/how-do-ride-hailing-giants-didi-uber-compare-2021-06-30/#:~:text=%2D%20Didi%20has%2015%20million%20annual,twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2C%202021.&amp;text=%2D%20Uber%20in%20February%202020%20said,some%205%20million%20drivers%20worldwide.&amp;text=%2D%20Didi%20was%20loss%2Dmaking%20from,the%20first%20quarter%20this%20year.">has around 600 million users</a> across 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia. The company also has over 15 million annual active drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to launching other mobility platforms, Didi now owns minority stakes in other global platforms &#8212; the United States&#8217; Lyft and Uber, Indonesia&#8217;s Grab, Egypt&#8217;s Careem and India&#8217;s Ola. It also fully acquired Brazil&#8217;s 99.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Didi starts its incursion into Africa, Russia’s inDriver is firming up its presence across the same markets, where it recently started taking commissions from drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other taxi-hailing apps that have a unilateral billing structure, inDriver allows riders to negotiate trip charges with drivers, making it popular among taxi users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taxi drivers in Kenya’s capital Nairobi using inDriver, which rolled out its services in Africa in 2018, have over the last few days received notifications from the company confirming the introduction of a 9.52% commission for every trip made. The commission is lower than Didi’s 13%, although both are much lower than Uber’s 25% and Bolt’s 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">InDriver inferred that it was introducing the charges due to the increased demand of the service, but it was keen to keep the commission lower than those of its competitors. The app was launched about three years ago across multiple markets in Africa including South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, Morocco and Botswana with the promise of a commission-free first year. The company is just now introducing commissions in some of these markets, although the deductions are already in effect in Nigeria and South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a notification sent to drivers in Kenya, inDriver said that it “became a noticeable event in the passenger rides market in Nairobi. Many people use it daily and their number is increasing. This extensive work requires significant costs. To cover these costs, we introduce payments for each order in the amount of 9.52%. To keep inDriver still profitable for both passengers and drivers, the amount of payments is lower than in other services, where payments can range from 15% to 30% of each order.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new update comes as the company plans to grow in different markets, having already diversified into the courier business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company launched its delivery business in April last year, at the height of the pandemic, to tap the demand for parcel delivery services. Courier services enlisted on the app include auto, foot and moto, and are available in over 16 countries. The company is now introducing freight services in different markets around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsentomsky/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Arsen Tomsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inDriver is currently available in 34 countries and recently crossed the 100-million download mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it joins Didi to step up competition in Africa, market pioneers Uber and Bolt are expanding their service range in cities across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Uber is rolling out Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders headed in the same direction share the cost of the journey, in Kenya, with plans to offer the low-cost service in Ghana and Nigeria. The company says that the rollout of budget services is part of its plan to attract price-sensitive users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the continent, Uber has over the last few months expanded into new regions and introduced new products as part of its strategy to retain existing customers and attract new ones amid growing competition.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the firm entered two additional cities in Nigeria &#8212; Ibadan and Port Harcourt &#8212; bringing into the regions a service that is already available in three other cities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is now available in 40 cities, serving 80% of the urban population, with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> premium services Uber Comfort, UberX and UberBlack and budget service UberGo. It recently expanded into 21 new cities and added a feature last August that allows the booking of trips a month in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to continue investments into African cities through collaborations with national and local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we face significant competition across local transportation modes in Africa. These are vibrant and competitive with many viable alternatives, including ridesharing, personal cars and public transportation—which consumers can and do choose between,” Frans Hiemstra, the general manager for Uber Sub-Saharan Africa, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe competition makes us better, which improves the service for our riders and earners alike,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is still king in terms of combined market share in Africa; it claims to have about 150,000 drivers in its eight markets across the continent, while Bolt comes in second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt has been aggressively</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bolt-to-expand-ev-option-in-south-africa/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding its services in Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm is planning to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roll out electric taxi options in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in Johannesburg and Cape Town.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt also launched its food delivery service in Nigeria last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Uber, Bolt sees myriad opportunities in the continent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see that there is room for several players across the continent. The infrastructure and experience we have built up with our ride-hailing business give us a good platform to expand and diversify our services,” said Bolt’s regional director for Africa and Middle East, Paddy Partridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new players like Didi, it will be an entry to a market that dealt with drivers and partners demanding better working terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria and Kenya, both Uber and Bolt faced a series of protests earlier this year as their drivers expressed displeasure with the ride-hailing companies&#8217; decision to increase their commissions, despite burdening users with price surges. However, no notable changes have been made from either of the two companies in line with the demands of drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi’s operations elsewhere have not been without drama. Before it went public on the NYSE this year – nine years after operating as a privately held startup and raising $25 billion from investors – the Alibaba, SoftBank and Apple-backed company faced scrutiny from the Chinese government and regulators. It was accused of employing anti-competitive practices and pricing and misusing users&#8217; personal information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi&#8217;s fallout with China is just one of the many struggles it dealt with this year. Trying to compensate for the troubles at home, the firm looked to enter the U.K. market, but the move was met with concerns from the British Parliament that China could harvest data from Brits using Didi&#8217;s service. However, it seems its entry into African markets has been smooth &#8212; and could explain why it wants to keep its operations quiet: to avoid scrutiny.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Berners-Lee created the standards for the world wide web three decades ago, setting the pathway for countless of companies to flourish at unimaginable scale. His new venture, called Inrupt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/tim-berners-lees-startup-inrupt-releases-solid-privacy-platform-for-enterprises/">wants to fix some of the mess</a> many of those companies have made &#8212; and it&#8217;s in the market to raise money.</p>
<p><a href="https://inrupt.com">Inrupt</a> is in talks with a handful of investors to raise between $30 million to $50 million at a pre-money valuation of $140 million, according to two people familiar with the matter and an investor pitch deck obtained by me. The round &#8212; Series A &#8212; hasn&#8217;t closed, so the terms may change, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>An Inrupt spokesperson declined to comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup, which counts Akamai Technologies and Glasswing Ventures among its investors, says it is attempting to “reshape the internet” by building a platform that gives users control of their data. Inrupt has built a platform where users can store their personal data in something called a POD (Personal Online Datastores). Its customers include governments and enterprises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governments and enterprises want to help manage their users&#8217; data, but unfortunately, they do not have a platform to do so. Corporations want access to that consumer data without necessarily storing it, but again, there is no global open protocol for them to do so,&#8221; the investor deck reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now creating a new platform and infrastructure that gives the global population control over their data, governments the ability to put data programs in place to securely store that data and enterprises the ease of use to access that data without fear of insecurity or abuse,&#8221; the pitch reads, pointing to the startup&#8217;s product called Solid.</p>
<p>Inrupt believes, it said in the investor pitch, that its addressable market is the “entire data market,&#8221; as it attempts emulate the core infrastructure companies such as Visa for credit card processing and Verisign, which commercialized the DNS standard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has signed contracts with governments of Sweden, Argentina, and Basque. These partnerships have not been previously reported. It generated $225,000 in revenue last year, and $200,000 in revenue last month, according to the investor pitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inrupt&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors are committed to a governance system that ensures that the company operates with utmost integrity, transparency and with the highest ethical and privacy standards,&#8221; the investor pitch reads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you make some software and sell it online, you can make lots of money. Thanks to low-cost distribution, it&#8217;s possible to write one bit of code and sell it many times, generating fat margins in the process. Throw in a larger industry trend toward recurring pricing as opposed to single-shot sales, and you have the foundation for rich software company valuations in hand.</p>

<p>Writing was supposed to be the same, but it mostly didn&#8217;t work out. The internet allows you to write once and distribute those words to anyone at incredibly low costs, but the economics wound up being pretty tough. The real way to make money writing online, it turned out, was to treat words as code to a degree and release them under a subscription aegis, allowing media companies to look quite a lot more like modern software companies than we expected in the earlier days of the internet.</p>
<p>The New York Times &#8212; 68% subscription revenues <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2021/08/Press-Release-6.27.2021-PM-7Xc0A2HHkQj.pdf">in Q2 2021</a> &#8212; is a good example of how this can work. TechCrunch+ is another example of the model, though we&#8217;re about a zillion times smaller.</p>
<p>The model of writing and distributing it for <em>free</em> online was predicated on advertising rates translating from older businesses like television and print to the web. They mostly didn&#8217;t, even if certain publication niches can command reasonable ad rates at the moment.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s NerdWallet, a business that has proven that you can not only make a lot of money with writing on the internet while not charging for it, but also that if you manage the feat, you can generate huge amounts of value at the same time. We love a counterexample here at TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001625278/000162828021020521/nerdwallets-1a2.htm">dropped pricing details this week</a>, giving us a window into its expected public-market valuation, and the good news for fans of making words appear for others to consume is that NerdWallet is set to command a unicorn price when it does begin to trade.</p>
<p>Who would have thought!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s NerdWallet worth?</h2>
<p>Naturally, what NerdWallet does is different from pure journalism. But the firm does make noise &#8212; as we noted in both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">an earlier piece on the company</a> and on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/nerdwallet-gen-z-and-the-value-of-the-written-word/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">writing-focused episode of Equity</a> &#8212; about its writing team being editorially independent.</p>
<p>In theory, then, the company&#8217;s writing teams are working for the reader and not for the near-term goals of the company&#8217;s revenue and marketing functions.</p>
<p>NerdWallet even noted in its IPO filing that it will avoid sugar-high, near-term revenue hits to preserve long-term credibility, i.e., it doesn&#8217;t intend to take extra checks from folks to recommend lesser products. NerdWallet&#8217;s business model is built around trust &#8212; that it will recommend the best products regardless of how much they pay in commission for sending users their direction.</p>
<p>As something of a personal finance Wirecutter, trust and the work the company does to preserve it are key foundations of NerdWallet&#8217;s relationship with end users.</p>
<p>Back to valuations: When we consider that NerdWallet expects to sell stock in its IPO at $17 to $19 per share, against a non-diluted share count of 64,747,341, or 65,834,841 inclusive of shares reserved for its underwriting banks, we can put a value on its business of as much as $1.25 billion. That must be more than $1 per word that NerdWallet has published, implying a pretty good return on scribbling.</p>
<p>My favorite group of IPO heads, Renaissance Capital, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/87760/Personal-finance-platform-NerdWallet-sets-terms-for-$131-million-IPO">peg the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation</a> at the midpoint of its IPO price range as $1.3 billion. At $19 per share, that figure rises to $1.37 billion. Again, not bad for a company predicated on being able to extract dollars from words.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies gather ever-growing sets of data, finding issues with that data that could impact the viability of a machine learning model becomes increasingly important. <a href="http://anomalo.com">Anomalo</a> is putting machine learning to work to help solve the data viability issue automatically.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $33 million Series A investment led by Norwest Venture Partners with participation from Two Sigma Ventures, Foundation Capital, First Round Capital and Village Global.</p>
<p>The company was founded by two Instacart veterans who worked at solving similar problems at their previous company. Elliot Shmukler, co-founder and CEO at Anomalo, said that if you&#8217;re counting on data to run your business, any issues in that data can be problematic for the organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225719" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What Anomalo does is it connects to these enterprise data warehouses like Snowflake, where they&#8217;re stockpiling all of this data that companies collect, and it monitors all those data sets for unusual issues and unwelcome changes in that data, which can cause lots of issues if you&#8217;re actually trying to rely on that data to run your business,&#8221; Shmukler explained.</p>
<p>It sounds simple enough, but what Anomalo is doing behind the scenes is connecting to these data warehouses and training a machine learning model on what is normal for this particular set of data and reporting when it finds issues. Shmukler says that this approach is in contrast to other solutions, which force data teams to explicitly define what good data looks like, a method he says becomes increasingly unmanageable as the number and size of the data sets grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at other solutions &#8230; they require folks on the data team to go in and essentially define the expectations for them, to say, this is what good data looks like, [and] that&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work. As your data changes and you launch new products and new geographies, you have to keep updating those definitions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It was a problem the founders saw when they were on the data team at Instacart, where they had to constantly update these definitions. When they launched Anomolo, one of their goals was to automate that process for data teams so they didn&#8217;t have to deal with that manual work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy problem to solve. The two founders &#8212; Shmukler and CTO Jeremy Stanley &#8212; left Instacart in 2018 to launch the company and it took a couple of years to get that machine learning model to work the way they wanted it to, without too many false positives or requiring too much history as a basis for learning.</p>
<p>While the founders didn&#8217;t want to reveal the exact number of current employees, the plan is to hire another 40 or 50 in the next year. Shmukler says that when he and Stanley decided to start a company, they set core values that included diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually wrote down a set of values for the organization to abide by, and one of them was being diverse. That was something very important to us at Instacart and something that we just wanted to continue working on [at this company]. And so we&#8217;re very mindful of making sure that when we&#8217;re recruiting for a role that we bring in a diverse set of candidates for that role &#8230; and the good news is that it&#8217;s working, at least today, where 25% of our engineering team are women, which is probably unusual for an early-stage company. And we hope to keep that going and continue to improve that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While the company is formally launching today, it has paying customers and reports that it has at least $1 million in revenue already. It charges by the data set it&#8217;s monitoring rather than by the user or data coming through its pipeline. Customers out of the gate include BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services and Substack.</p>

		Neil Bradley is the executive vice president, chief policy officer and head of strategic advocacy for the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a>, the world’s largest business organization representing companies of all sizes across every sector of the economy.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The United States is the land of opportunity, where anyone with an idea can bring it to market. This philosophy has fueled America’s growth and prosperity and made the U.S. the global leader of innovation.</p>
<p>However, the very recipe that created America’s economic success is being threatened by proposals in Congress that will make creating a new business less attractive. Proposed changes to the existing framework of merger and acquisition law would handcuff successful businesses in every industry, have a chilling effect on investment in the next great American idea and close the door on the greatest engine of job creation our country has seen.</p>
<p>The startup ecosystem is unique. At the beginning, young businesses use capital from friends, family or even outside investors to help them get started. Not all are successful, and that’s OK. Those that do succeed graduate to other levels of financing, including angel or venture capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225250" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While some companies will eventually grow big enough to become public through the IPO process, most don’t. The regulatory impediments have made this more difficult, and, as a result, there is less than <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/investor-advisory-committee-2012/jeffrey-solomon-presentation.pdf">half the number</a> of public companies than a generation ago. That’s why most entrepreneurs seek and <a href="https://www.svb.com/globalassets/library/uploadedfiles/content/trends_and_insights/reports/startup_outlook_report/suo_global_report_2020-final.pdf">welcome being acquired</a>.</p>
<p>Acquisition is an attractive and common exit opportunity that contributes to the health of our economy. Last year, 886 venture-backed companies <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf">were acquired</a>, while just 103 went public.</p>
<p>Acquisitions allow venture capital partners to make new investments in the next generation of entrepreneurs. This continued investment is a key driver of economic growth and has helped startups create jobs more than <a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/new-wave-innovation-job-creation/">five times faster</a> than more established companies. In fact, startups are responsible for almost all of the <a href="https://www.kauffman.org/entrepreneurship/reports/firm-formation-and-growth-series/the-importance-of-startups-in-job-creation-and-job-destruction/">net new jobs</a> created in the U.S. over the past 45 years. Nonetheless, international competition for capital is the fiercest it has ever been.</p>
<p>By fundamentally altering antitrust laws, Congress will punish American businesses by taking away incentives for entrepreneurs and investors. Congress would make it less attractive to start a new business or invest in any new company.</p>
<p>Those great ideas and investment dollars, along with the jobs they create, will go elsewhere, including to our foreign competitors, where the proposed antitrust laws will not apply. With the U.S. share of global venture capital investment <a href="https://nvca.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NVCA-2021-Yearbook.pdf">falling</a> more than 30 percentage points in the past 15 years, enacting these policies will only exacerbate the problem and push investment outside the United States.</p>
<p>It will also have devastating effects and unintended consequences on U.S. competitiveness and national security while benefiting countries looking to undermine American influence and values. A dozen former top U.S. national security officials made this very point in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21062393-national-security-letter-on-antitrust?responsive=1&amp;title=1">a letter to Congress</a> urging lawmakers to more closely examine the global impact of antitrust legislation.</p>
<p>Instead of harmful legislation that will stifle economic growth and benefit our competitors, Congress should provide robust resources to government agencies to challenge any merger or acquisition that is likely to lessen competition and harm consumers. We must improve our current system not tear it down.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the government has challenged <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/calera_u.s._chamber_analysis_-_mergers_-_final.pdf">approximately 780 mergers</a>, with the merging parties winning in court only 11 times. With a success rate of 98.5%, government agencies have the ability to protect competition. But, some in Congress want to dramatically overhaul the system and shift the burden, making companies “guilty until proven innocent.” This approach is antithetical to current bipartisan antitrust policy.</p>
<p>A strong startup economy is key to America’s future, especially in communities outside of traditional hubs where entrepreneurism is currently <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571681753c44d835a440c8b5/t/60819983b7f8be1a2a99972d/1619106194054/The+State+of+the+Startup+Ecosystem.pdf">thriving</a>.</p>
<p>But young companies need the right tools to succeed. Without attractive investment opportunities, jobs will be lost or go overseas. By making it harder for companies to be acquired, our economy will be weakened and our foreign adversaries strengthened amid an increasingly competitive race for leadership in the next generation of global brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s nothing like an increasing level of regulations to create spaces for new startups to appear, especially in SaaS. Asset managers, banks, and other financial institutions need to calculate their financed CO2 emissions footprint in a manner that is auditable and compliant with both the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodologies. Thus, we’ve seen the rise of the likes of like Plan A, South Pole, and Watershed. And of course, Salesforce’s sustainability cloud is a huge player.</p>
<p><a href="https://persefoni.com/">Persefoni</a>, a Climate Management &amp; Accounting Platform (CMAP) for enterprises and financial institutions, is the latest to benefit from this rising tide, with the news today that it has raised $101 million in its Series B financing round. Persefoni&#8217;s pitch is that it is an “ERP for Carbon Data&#8221; which replaces the traditional manual and consulting-based approach, and avoids proprietary approaches which could create problems when it comes to auditing.</p>
<p>Leading the round were Prelude Ventures and TPG Rise Climate. Also participating for the first time are Clearvision Ventures, Parkway Ventures, Bain &amp; Co., EDF (Électricité de France), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), The Ferrante Group, Alumni Ventures Group, and New Valley Ventures. Existing investors including NGP Energy Technology Partners, Sallyport Investments, and strategic angels also returned to participate. Persefoni is claiming this to be the largest round for a SaaS ClimateTech company, although TechCrunch could not confirm that at publication. Certainly, it’s significant. The Series B investment brings Persefoni&#8217;s total capital raised to $114.2 million.<br />
 <br />
Persefoni helps asset managers, banks, and other financial institutions calculate their financed emissions footprint in the compliance methods mentioned above. It now claims to have four of the 10 largest global Private Equity firms and four of the world’s 20 largest banks using it, along with several global insurance companies and pensions/endowments. It also works with corporates across manufacturing, agriculture, energy, apparel, retail, software, and business services.<br />
 <br />
Kentaro Kawamori, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Persefoni said: “Carbon and climate disclosures will be the biggest compliance market since the advent of Sarbanes Oxley and GDPR, but with even greater complexity. The market is rife with data and software solutions that create new proprietary methodologies every day, and our customers are beyond tired of that approach. We work daily with the world’s pre-eminent industry standards setters and regulators to enable transparency and trust at the highest levels.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Persefoni has recently struck strategic corporate partnerships with Bain &amp; Co. , EDF (EURONEXT: EDF), and SMBC (TYO: 8316), expanded into the Japanese market and released a free tier of its base carbon accounting platform for SMBs. It also launched a Temperature Scoring Model to enable users to instantly create 1.5C or 2C implied temperature rise models for their organizations.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Kawamori said: “We cracked the code on taking the best from the financial ledger technology, where the accounting process is completely automated, so we don&#8217;t do any services. We’ve got a pretty significant channel strategy mirroring very similar to what you might have seen from UiPath in the early days where the primary route to market was through, big four and significant consulting partners.”</p>
<p>He added that while Persefoni partners with the Patch offsetting platform, it doesn’t take a revenue stream from that, since to recommend offsetting platforms would be a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We partnered with Patch and we’re doing that in a completely commission-free, pass-through way, because we actually think it&#8217;s a massive conflict to be doing both the accounting and selling people offsets for profit, which is what some of our competitors do. We think that&#8217;s terrible, doesn&#8217;t scale and doesn&#8217;t pass audit at scale.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle startup scheduled to make its debut on Nasdaq next week, is turning to a team of Pixar veterans to help make the computer simulation tool used to test and train its self-driving system more like the real world.</p>
<p>The three-person computer graphic imagery startup <a href="http://colrspace.com/">Colrspace</a>, which has been operating in stealth, is joining Aurora&#8217;s perception team. Aurora will also own Colrspace&#8217;s IP, specifically technology that combines CGI and machine learning. The trio, which includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fu-11966982/">Michael Fu</a>, Allen Hemberger and Alex Harvill, has developed a technique that can reconstruct 3D objects and materials from a photo or image. Essentially, it makes the simulation more &#8220;realistic,&#8221; which Aurora and other autonomous vehicle developers contend helps make testing more effective. (Below is a sample of Colrspace&#8217;s work; TechCrunch turned the mp4 into a gif)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225803" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CS_swatchtest_720p.2021-10-28-10_56_55.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225803" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225803 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CS_swatchtest_720p.2021-10-28-10_56_55.gif" alt="Auroa acquires Colrspace Pixar veterans" width="640" height="360" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2225803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aurora</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225543" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fu, Hemberger and Harvill will join Aurora&#8217;s perception team, which already includes people from 7D, a simulation startup founded by former Pixar software engineer Magnus Wrenninge. TechCrunch learned in 2019 that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">had acquired 7D</a>.</p>
<p>While Aurora and competitors like Argo AI, Cruise and Waymo regularly conduct real-world tests on closed courses and public roads, computer simulations are seen as an essential tool to test, train and validate their autonomous vehicle technology. Simulation can be used to help the self-driving system test various scenarios or play back what happened in the real world. The end game is to train and evaluate the software stack so it&#8217;s safe in the real world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for the biggest AV companies to run through thousands, even millions, of simulations daily. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Aurora, for instance, estimates its simulator is the equivalent of running more than 50,000 trucks driving continuously.</span> Aurora&#8217;s computer simulator, called the Virtual Testing Suite, runs through a diverse range of driving conditions as well as common and unusual (edge case) scenarios to catch errors early and before it is deployed in vehicles operating on public roads. Data captured while driving on public roads is also fed back into the simulator.</p>
<p>This year, Aurora has put more effort and resources to scale up its simulation program. Aurora said this month that it expects to have driven the equivalent of over 9 billion simulated miles by the end of the year, with 6 billion of these miles clocked so far in 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Going to the Moon is a laudable ambition, but what are you going to do when you get there? NASA and the private space industry aim to make the most of the lunar surface, and to do so they need to study the environment in the next frontier — as leaders from ispace, Lockheed Martin, and Masten Space will explain at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Session: Space</a> on December 14-15.</p>
<p>The challenge of safely landing on the lunar surface, once the domain of global superpowers, has become accessible to deep-pocketed private space companies, and it seems certain that the next decade will see landers of numerous &#8220;brands&#8221; touching down on regolith.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s ispace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/">recently unveiled the Hakuto-R lander</a>, which is scheduled to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 in 2022 and deliver a set of Canadian, Japanese, and UAE payloads to the surface. Then the company will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">sending its own rover</a> to the Moon in 2023 — assuming the timelines don&#8217;t shift at all, which they generally do. Director &amp; COO Takahiro Nakamura will join us to speak to the challenge of going to the moon as a startup — and one outside the popular U.S. ecosystem as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Masten Space will soon have a prominent presence both on and off the moon&#8217;s surface: it&#8217;s being tapped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/nasa-selects-masten-space-systems-to-deliver-cargo-to-the-moon-in-2022/">bring a set of eight payloads there in late 2022</a>, and we&#8217;ll check in with CEO Sean Mahoney on how that mission is shaping up. Beyond that the company plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/masten-space-systems-to-develop-a-gps-like-network-for-the-moon/">create a GPS-like system</a> for surface operations on the moon, which future colonists will be sure to thank them for.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin will be participating in the Artemis program in a number of ways, some underway, others in the future, and the VP &amp; GM of Commercial Civil Space, Lisa Callahan, will be returning to tell us how things have progressed since last year. The news of a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/general-motors-lockheed-martin-to-develop-new-lunar-rover-for-nasa-artemis-missions-to-the-moon/">lunar vehicle</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/spacex-blue-origin-awarded-nasa-contracts-to-develop-moon-lander-concepts-for-future-artemis-missions/">lander concept</a>, and potentially a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nanoracks-lockheed-martin-and-voyager-space-plan-to-launch-crewed-commercial-space-station-by-2027/"> commercial space station</a> should provide more than enough fodder for a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>That’s just one example of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5"> stellar speakers</a> we have on tap at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. We’re talking folks like Natalya Bailey, Accion Systems co-founder and CTO, who will talk about advancements in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/"> in-space satellite propulsion systems</a>. Plus, Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars), Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lisa Rich (Xplore) will have a lot to share about investing in space startups from the earliest stages and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true"> Buy your pass</a> now and learn from leading experts how lunar samples may hold the key to living beyond the stars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has now <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox">launched</a> a beta version of its &#8220;App Privacy Report,&#8221; a new feature that aims to provide iOS users with details about how often their everyday apps are requesting access to sensitive information, and where that information is being shared. The feature was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">introduced</a> at Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, amid other privacy-focused improvements, including tools to <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-mail-privacy-protection-iphf084865c7/ios">block tracking pixels</a> in emails, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">a private VPN</a>, and more. Apple explained at the time the new report would include details about an app&#8217;s access to user data and sensors, including the user&#8217;s location, photos, contacts, and more, as well as a list of domains that the app contacts.</p>
<p>Though announced as a part of the iOS 15 update, the App Privacy Report was not available when the new version of iOS rolled out earlier this fall. It&#8217;s still not accessible to the general public but has entered into a wider beta test with the release of the iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2 betas.</p>
<p>The new report goes beyond the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">potentially fallible</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">App Privacy labels</a>, which detail what sort of sensitive data an app collects and how it&#8217;s used. Developers may not always fill out their labels accurately &#8212; either by mistake or with a desire to mislead end users &#8212; and Apple&#8217;s App Review team may not always catch those ommissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, the new App Privacy Report works to collect information about how apps are behaving more directly.</p>
<p>When enabled by users in their device&#8217;s Privacy Settings, the App Privacy Report will create a list of their apps&#8217; activity over the past seven days. You can then tap on any app to see further details about when the app last accessed sensitive data or one of the device&#8217;s sensors &#8212; like the microphone or location, for example. This information is available in a list where each access is logged with a timestamp.</p>
<p>In another section, &#8220;App Network Activity,&#8221; users will be able to see a list of domains apps have communicated with over the past seven days. This list could include domains used by the app itself to provide its functionality, but will also reveal those from third-party trackers and analytics providers the app works with for analytics and advertising purposes, for example.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Website Network Activity&#8221; offers a similar list, but focuses on websites that contacted domains, some of which may have been provided by an app. You can also view the most contacted domains and drill down into individual domains to see which trackers and analytics they may be using as well as which apps have been contacting them, and when.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ahead of the beta launch, Apple made a feature called &#8220;Record App Activity&#8221; available, which allowed developers to preview what users would see when the App Privacy Report became available. This option produced a JSON file where they could confirm their app was behaving as expected. Already, this feature produced some interesting findings. For instance, Chinese super app <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3151762/tencents-wechat-stop-routine-scans-photos-after-tech-influencer">WeChat was found to be scanning users&#8217; phones</a> for new photos every few hours.</p>
<p>While the App Privacy Report will put into users&#8217; hands a treasure trove of data, it could present complications for developers who may have to now explain to users that some of these data requests are not truly privacy violations &#8212; they&#8217;re about providing the promised app functionality. A weather app, for example, may need to pull a users&#8217; location on a regular basis if the user has requested push notifications about changing weather patterns, like storm updates, to help them prepare for travel.</p>
<p>When presenting the app to developers, Apple said the report would give them an opportunity to &#8220;build trust&#8221; with users by providing transparency about what their app is doing. The company also suggested it could give the developers themselves better insight into the SDKs they&#8217;ve chosen to install, to ensure their behavior aligns with what the developer wants and expects.</p>
<p>Apple has not said when the new feature may exit beta, but it&#8217;s possible it will ship when iOS 15.2 becomes publicly available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As urban rental markets recover and people flock back to cities, people are once again finding themselves with plenty of new neighbors in communities which are trying to embrace a renewed vibrancy of post-lockdown life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneroofapp.com/">OneRoof</a> is building a social network for residential buildings. Unlike Nextdoor which organizes communities based on zip codes or neighborhoods, OneRoof wants to build up a presence inside large multi-unit buildings so that neighbors can get to know each other in smaller, tighter-knit circles.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Nextdoor] goes by zip codes and in a city like San Francisco or New York&#8230; that encompasses tens of thousands of people,&#8221; OneRoof CEO Selin Sonmez tells TechCrunch. &#8220;These people have less in common at that point because it&#8217;s too large of a pool and it&#8217;s not relevant anymore.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sonmez notes that it&#8217;s not just about having things in common, people feel more safe communicating with a handful of neighbors rather than thousands of them. Sonmez and her co-founder (and husband) Nikolaos Georgantas hope the app can help people be more comfortable talking to the people they meet in their building&#8217;s elevator or in the hallways, fostering the relationships with relative strangers that the pandemic made so difficult in major cities.</p>
<p>The app has raised a small <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$1.25M seed raise to carry out this vision, led by General Catalyst with participation from</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Kleiner Perkins&#8217; discovery fund, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dream Machine, Script Capital and Urban US.</span></p>
<p>The app is organized around messaging, giving users a Slack-like hub to discuss various topics with neighbors while organizing their own sub-communities based on interests. Notably, OneRoof is not looking to foster deep partnerships with building management, noting that past efforts to create building-wide message boards have largely failed because of the reliance of building managers to moderate the groups.</p>

<p>Operating on such a small scale has its challenges. Their model relies on so-called &#8220;super neighbors&#8221; doing much of the initial onboarding work for their building. Once a user decides they&#8217;d like to get their building on OneRoof, they are able to request that OneRoof sends fliers to their neighbors mail boxes advertising the service while giving them a proprietary code to join the private app. They are also able to request door hangers which Sonmez says the app has had particular success with.</p>
<p>The app is live in around 400 building in New York City and has plans to start expanding to other major cities soon including Boston, Miami and Los Angeles.</p>
