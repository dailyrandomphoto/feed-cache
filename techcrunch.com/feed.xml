										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a> has made a name for itself among parents as a useful resource for vetting entertainment and technology in terms of its age-appropriateness. Now, the organization&#8217;s for-profit affiliate, <a href="http://www.commonsensenetworks.com/">Common Sense Networks</a>, is taking inspiration from those kid-friendly recommendations with the launch of new streaming service called <a href="https://www.sensicaltv.com/">Sensical</a>. The service offers age-appropriate, entertaining, and educational videos for children ages 2 through 10.</p>
<p>At launch, the free, ad-supported service includes over 15,000 hand-curated videos and over 50 topic-based channels for children to explore. And unlike other platforms, like Netflix or YouTube, Sensical doesn&#8217;t use algorithms to make content recommendations. Instead, kids are encouraged to follow their own interests and passions across over 50 topic-based channels. This includes things like Adventures, Animals, Arts &amp; Crafts, Music, Science, Sports, Video Games, and other sorts of kid-friendly topics.</p>
<p>Kids can star these channels, or individual videos or series, in order to keep up with their favorite content in a dedicated Favorites section within the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kids will see a selection of these channels based on their age, but the company is working to expand the channel lineup so there will be even more specific categories in the future. For example, instead of just &#8220;sports,&#8221; there could be channels like &#8220;soccer&#8221; or &#8220;gymnastics.&#8221; Instead of &#8220;Arts,&#8221; there could be &#8220;drawing&#8221; or &#8220;origami.&#8221; Instead of just &#8220;science,&#8221; it could include channels like &#8220;geography&#8221; or &#8220;robotics,&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172223" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172223" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg 2666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=1536,1123 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=2048,1498 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tablet-screen_a.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Common Sense Networks</p></div></p>
<p>The app also features a Live TV section, which is programmed throughout the day with kid-friendly content so kids don&#8217;t have to browse to find something to quickly watch.</p>
<p>While other streaming services on the market offer kid-friendly content &#8212; as that&#8217;s a huge selling point for subscribers &#8212; it&#8217;s not always organized in a way that makes sense. Sometimes, all the content gets lumped into a general &#8220;Kids&#8221; category where videos for little kids are mixed in with content for older children. Sensical, meanwhile, curates the content recommendations into three different experiences, including preschool (2-4), little kids (5-7), and big kids (8-10).</p>
<p>What the child sees is based on how parents configure their profile. Plus, parents can use the service&#8217;s ParentZone in-app dashboard to set screen time limits, extend limits as needed, and view daily reports on what the child has watched.</p>
<p>The service&#8217;s best feature, however, is that the content is assured to be age-appropriate &#8212; even the ads.</p>
<p>This is possible because the curation approach Sensical takes, which is very different from YouTube Kids. YouTube&#8217;s app for kids leans on algorithms to filter out adult content from YouTube&#8217;s broader library, but the company doesn&#8217;t manually review all the videos it includes. It warns parents that some inappropriate content could slip through. (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/youtube-kids-inappropriate-horrified-mom-discovers-suicide-instructions-in-video-on-youtube-and-youtube-kids/">And</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22412232/youtube-kids-autoplay">it</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html">has</a>). Common Sense Networks, meanwhile, says dozens of trained child development experts view, vet, and rate &#8220;every single frame of video&#8221; that goes live on its service using its proprietary IP and patent<b> </b>pending process. This system involves tagging content with specific child developmental benefits, too.</p>
<p>Sensical also vets its advertising, which is how the service is supported, with similar direct oversight. Its experts review the sponsor&#8217;s content to ensure it&#8217;s appropriate for children &#8212; an area that&#8217;s often overlooked on other services.</p>

<p>To fill its library, Common Sense Networks partnered with dozens of studios and distribution partners as well as digital-first creators.</p>
<p>Studio and distribution partners include CAKE (<i>Poppy Cat</i>), Cyber Group Studios (<i>Leo The Wildlife Ranger</i>), The Jim Henson Company (<i>The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss, Jim Henson&#8217;s Animal Show with Stinky and Jake</i>), Mattel (<i>Kipper, Pingu, Max Steel</i>), Raydar Media (<i>Five Apples’ limited series, Apple Tree House),</i> Superights (<i>Bo Bear, Handico</i>), WildBrain (<i>Teletubbies, Rev &amp; Roll</i>), Xilam Animation (<i>Learn and Play with Paprika, Moka&#8217;s Fabulous Adventures</i>), ZDF Enterprises (<i>Lexi &amp; Lottie, School of Roars</i>), Zodiak Kids (<i>Mister Maker, Tee and Mo</i>), ABC Commercial, CBC &amp; Radio-Canada Distribution, Jetpack Distribution, Nelvana, 9 Story Distribution International, Sesame Workshop, Serious Lunch, and Studio 100.</p>
<p>Digital creators, meanwhile, include ABCMouse, Aaron’s Animals, Alphabet Rockers, batteryPOP, California Academy of Sciences, GoldieBlox, The Gotham Group’s Gotham Reads, Guggenheim Museum, Howdytoons, Kids’ Black History, MEL Science + Chemistry, N*Gen, Pinkfong, Penguin Random House’s Brightly Storytime, Studio71 (<i>Parry Gripp, Maymo, Hyper Roblox</i>), Tankee, Ubongo Kids, Vooks, Bounce Patrol, Hevesh5, Mother Goose Club, StacyPlays, Super Simple Songs and The Whistle.</p>
<p>The service abides by the U.S. children&#8217;s privacy laws (COPPA), and is certified by the kidSAFE Seal Program.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172226" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172226" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2172226" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-screen_02a.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172226" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Common Sense Networks</p></div></p>
<p>Having briefly toyed around with the mobile app, it appears Sensical works as described. If I had any complaints personally, it would only be that the experience could be dismissed as &#8220;baby stuff&#8221; by older kids approaching their tween years, due to the cute pictures and youthful iconography used in the app&#8217;s design. Kids in older age groups take issue with being treated as if they&#8217;re younger &#8212; and they take particular notice of anything that does so. The same complaint goes for the Live TV programming, which was clearly aimed at littler kids when we checked it out, despite testing the app as child profile whose age was set to &#8220;10.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also think it would be nice if there was a better way to track Favorite channels and see when they&#8217;re updated with new videos, as kids moving to Sensical from YouTube will want to &#8220;feel&#8221; like they&#8217;re still connected to new and fresh content, not a library. But Sensical isn&#8217;t YouTube. There&#8217;s a trade-off between hand-curation and timeliness, and Sensical is favoring the former.</p>
<p>Sensical had been first introduced this spring during a closed beta, but is now publicly available to stream across web and mobile on iOS<b>, </b>Android<b>,</b><b> </b>Roku<b>, </b>Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV. This summer, it will expand to more distribution platforms, including VIZIO.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve spent millions of dollars running ads for brands like Outschool, Imperfect Produce and Microsoft. At <a href="http://demandcurve.com">Demand Curve</a>, we’ve worked with over 500 startups, meticulously documenting growth tactics for all growth channels. This post also incorporates what we&#8217;ve learned from our agency, <a href="http://bellcurve.com">Bell Curve</a>.</p>
<p>Here are seven ad types that have proven to increase click-through rates (CTR), with examples of each. Clone them to test in your own social ad campaigns.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Address common complaints and questions directly in your ads, as they will help eliminate objections upfront and encourage clicking to learn more.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Customer reactions</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling a consumer product, it’s likely that some of your customers have posted product reviews, unboxings or recommendation videos on their social media accounts. You can use your customers&#8217; user-generated videos in your social ads — with permission.</p>
<p>Search through Twitter, Instagram and Facebook for posts that mention your product. Reach out to the customer and ask them if you can use their content in an ad campaign, and subsequently, compile the most positive reactions into a video ad.</p>
<p>This works well because dramatic faces are attention magnets. Make sure the thumbnail photo shows a strong emotional image. People will click because they can&#8217;t help but want to see what provoked the emotion. User-generated reaction videos also highlight your products&#8217; &#8220;Moment of Wow.&#8221; If users care enough about your product to make a positive reaction video, their energy is contagious. Your ad audience will connect your product with a strong positive emotion.</p>

<h2>You versus the competition</h2>
<p>Comparison ads anchor your product against something your audience already knows. This works well for both ads and the landing page your ad will lead to when clicked on. Try positioning your strongest value proposition — the most valuable promise you&#8217;re making to your customer — against your generic competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the white-hot creator economy space, startups are increasingly looking to build paint-by-numbers platforms to help budding creators more easily execute on what were once seemingly insurmountable business challenges.</p>
<p>The ex-Uber team at <a href="https://www.pietrastudio.com/">Pietra</a> is cashing in on this vision with a plan to build a backend for launching and scaling creator product lines.</p>
<p>The startup, which previously acted as a marketplace for jewelry sellers, has changed a bit since they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/24/startups-weekly-diamond-encrusted-disruption/">announced a seed round from Andreessen Horowitz in early 2019</a>. Now, the company has pivoted from hocking diamonds to building a broad platform for creators that are looking to scale sales of physical goods, from interfacing with suppliers, handling orders and fulfillment and setting up an online storefronts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pietra tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve just raised a $15 million Series A led by Founders Fund with additional participation from Andreessen Horowitz, TQ Ventures and Abstract Ventures. The deal was led by Founders Fund&#8217;s Keith Rabois.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were initially focused on jewelry and luxury and the rise of creators in this luxury segment,&#8221; CEO Ronak Trivedi tells TechCrunch. &#8220;When we launched our beta last fall we had this platform that had evolved from a marketplace to a creator hub where any size creator could come in, use the platform, marketplace and tools to effectively launch a digital-first consumer business in the most efficient, cost-effective way possible.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=wZBEKlDWQ7" data-secret="wZBEKlDWQ7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pietra allows customers to shop around with a network of suppliers, find which one is best for them and move through the process from crafting samples through order fulfillment with a tech platform to guide them through the process. Trivedi says the ultimate goal is to &#8220;find the best suppliers in the world and try and bring them on the platform at the lowest minimum orders, so that it allows the most people to try to start a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is trying to help small creators scale their product distribution, but also handle all of the bits that can determine success when it comes to launching a brand in the first place, including building a pre-sale website and building up some attractive marketing images of products.</p>
<p>Early on, Pietra has a pretty distinct list of product verticals that they&#8217;re specializing in, including swimwear, makeup, apparel, fragrances and jewelry, among a few others. Overall, their platform seems pretty centered on the types of products that have been broadly successful with influencers who are looking to build out their first brands.</p>
<p>Pietra&#8217;s<a href="https://www.pietrastudio.com/pricing"> pricing</a> depends on how many of their services you&#8217;re using and what the scale of your operation is, but most services are charged on a per-unit basis with the startup also taking a percentage fee on goods sold through their marketplace. The startup is also working on a Pro offering with differentiated pricing designed for slightly more established brands that are doing multiple production runs per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has petitioned that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">newly minted Chair of the FTC</a> and implacable critic of the company, Lina Khan, be recused from decisions relating to the company. The company argues that she has been too outspoken about the failure to regulate Amazon to handle matters impartially.</p>
<p>It will be for the FTC to decide, and its oversight committee to supervise, whether Khan will recuse herself; an agency spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s argument (which you can read below) is that Khan has simply gone too far in her criticism of Amazon prior to her confirmation at the FTC, creating an effective &#8220;prejudgment&#8221; that precludes her ability to consider cases relating to the company objectively.</p>
<blockquote><p>Although Amazon profoundly disagrees with Chair Khan’s conclusions about the company, it does not dispute her right to have spoken provocatively and at great length about it in her prior roles. But given her long track record of detailed pronouncements about Amazon, and her repeated proclamations that Amazon has violated the antitrust laws, a reasonable observer would conclude that she no longer can consider the company’s antitrust defenses with an open mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it&#8217;s equally plain to &#8220;a reasonable observer&#8221; that Amazon, one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, is a natural target for analysis by an expert whose professional opinion is that antitrust regulation is inadequate and dated.</p>
<p>And it was arguably this very idea that set her on the path to her nomination and sudden ascendance to Chair. Her &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221; paper was not the manifestation of a vendetta against the online services giant — it was an indictment of the aging antitrust doctrine that permitted what she argued amounted to legalized monopolistic behavior.</p>
<p>Amazon may have been the one in the crosshairs, but it was only a stand-in for an entire school of regulatory thought that, Khan has persuasively argued in numerous papers and articles, mindlessly pursued a narrow definition of consumer harms and benefits. There are other ways that a company might act against consumer interests, such as crushing competition in a market by subsidizing costs through dominance of another market — something Amazon has made core to its entire business model.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HIJVKN1a1s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/amazon-antitrust-suit-dc-attorney-general/">DC attorney general files antitrust suit against Amazon over third-party seller agreements</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DC attorney general files antitrust suit against Amazon over third-party seller agreements&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/amazon-antitrust-suit-dc-attorney-general/embed/#?secret=HIJVKN1a1s" data-secret="HIJVKN1a1s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Furthermore, the position of Chair at the FTC is one of leadership and priority setting, not utter impartiality. The impartiality comes in the form of legal arguments that show a company has, for example, broken the law. Long-held opinions count for nothing with a judge, including Khan&#8217;s own public and professionally expressed opinions; should she lead the agency in an effort against Amazon, she will have to support her interpretation of the law with facts and systematic argument.</p>
<p>While one can only speculate at the administration&#8217;s true reasoning for its rapid elevation of Khan, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that it&#8217;s anything but a whole-hearted endorsement of the philosophy and change she advocates.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s expertise and perspective on antitrust have made Amazon a natural antagonist, not because Khan is a monomaniacal crusader, but because Amazon could very well represent one of the largest regulatory failures in history. To point that out is not grounds for recusal — it may however be grounds for making history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://swordhealth.com/">SWORD Health</a>, a virtual musculoskeletal care platform founded in 2015, announced today that it has raised an $85 million Series C funding round led by General Catalyst. Other participating investors included BOND, Highmark Ventures, BPEA, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, Transformation Capital and Green Innovations. The funding comes months after the company raised a $25 million Series B round &#8211; which, put differently, means that the New York-based company has now raised $110 million across six months.</p>
<p>CEO and founder of SWORD Health,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vbento"> Virgílio Bento</a>, said that company was not actively having conversations with external VCs when it raised the round. The Series C closed within three weeks of the first anchor investor’s check.</p>
<p>“Given the interest of the market, given the valuations, and given the ability to bring other stellar investors [who] can help us grow even faster and more efficiently &#8211; that’s why we decided to raise again,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SWORD Health’s massive tranche of capital comes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">the world of MSK digital health startups continues to boom</a>, thanks to the broad rise of virtual care. Venture-backed startups such as Kaia Health, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/kaia-health-grabs-75m-on-surging-interest-in-its-virtual-therapies-for-chronic-pain-and-copd/">saw its business grow by 600% in 2020</a> and Hinge Health, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">which was last valued at $3 billion</a>, are hitting growth stage. SWORD Health, while founded in 2015, has only been in the market for 18 months. Bento declined to share the company’s exact valuation, but he confirmed that it was north of $500 million.</p>
<p>MSK conditions, which can range from a sprained ankle to a disc compression, are diverse and, unfortunately, universally felt. The sheer expansiveness of the condition has triggered a crop of entrepreneurs to create solutions that help people avoid surgery or addictive opioids, two of the mainstream ways to deal with MSK conditions.</p>
<p>SWORD Health&#8217;s solution looks like this: The platform connects consumers to a virtual physical therapist who is accessible via traditional telemedicine. Beyond that, the company gives each consumer a tablet and motion sensors. The consumers are promoted to go through the motions, and get feedback and tips through a SWORD HealthDigital Therapist.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nikillinit">Nikhil Krishnan</a>, the founder of Out-of-Pocket, explained how it all works <a href="https://www.outofpocket.health/p/sword-health-and-virtual-musculoskeletal">through a first-person account:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>As you go through them, the sensors + digital therapist can tell if the movements are correct and how far you’re moving in each direction. The digital therapist has 5000 different types of feedback messages like “don’t bend your knee,” “lean forward more,” and “your squat form is more embarrassing than your Facebook etiquette circa 2009.” You get a score of 1-5 stars depending on how far you move in a direction for a given exercise. My regimen was usually between 17-25 exercises and in total would take me 20-25 minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>SWORD Health sells to insurers, health systems and employers in the United States, Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>SWORD Health’s biggest competitor is Hinge Health, last valued at $3 billion. However, for now, Bento isn&#8217;t too worried about the behemoth.</p>
<p>“It’s really two different studies on how to build a healthcare company,” Bento said. He pointed to how SWORD Health spent its first four years as a company developing its sensor, while he claims that Hinge went out to the market with “a half-baked solution&#8221; in sensor technology.</p>
<p>That said, in March 2021, Hinge acquired medical device maker Enso to grow its<a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/hinge-health-adds-breakthrough-pain-mgt-tech-to-digital-msk-clinic/"> non-invasive, musculoskeletal therapy tech</a>, and continues to have the biggest marketshare among private startups in the sector.</p>
<p>The company touted that it has increased its number of treated patients 1,000% year over year, which has led to 600% year-over-year revenue growth. Given the fact that it&#8217;s only been in the market for 18 months, these metrics don’t provide an entirely holistic picture into the business, but instead offer a snapshot into the recent growth of an early-stage tool. With millions more, the SWORD Health founder is set to invest more in the company, and continue to not focus too much on profitability.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big problem that we want to solve, so we really want to reinvest all of the gross profit that we are generating into building a platform that is able to deliver more value to patients,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit had a successful first commercial launch, meaning there&#8217;s now officially another small satellite launch provider in operation with a track record of delivering payloads to space. Virgin Orbit&#8217;s LauncherOne rocket took off from its carrier aircraft at around 11:45 AM EDT today, and the spacecraft had a successful series of engine fires and stage separations to make the trip to low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>On board, Virgin Orbit carried seven payloads, including the first-ever defense satellite for the Netherlands, as well as cubsats developed by the U.S. Department of Defense for its Rapid Agile Launch initiative. The initiative is seeking to test the viability of flying small spacecraft to space on relatively short notice on launch platforms with increased flexibility, which Virgin Orbit&#8217;s provides thanks to its ability to take off horizontally from more or less conventional runways.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit also carried two Earth observation satellites for Polish startup SatRevolution, and it will be delivering more in future flights to help build out that company&#8217;s planned 14-spacecraft constellation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In January, Virgin Orbit completed its final demonstration mission, reaching orbit for the first time with LauncherOne. That paved the way for this mission, and the company plans to increase the pace and frequency of its commercial missions, with at least one more planned tentatively for later this year and many more in 2022.</p>
<p>In terms of payload capacity, Virgin Orbit&#8217;s Launcher One can carry around 1,100 pounds to low Earth orbit, which compares favorably with the capacity of Rocket Lab&#8217;s Electron, which can carry around 661 pounds to the same destination.</p>
<p>It fits a niche for small satellite operators that currently have a lot of demand, served in part by SpaceX, as well with its ridesharing missions, but Virgin Orbit has the potential to provide more dedicated services for operator looking to launch just a few small spacecraft for a modest constellation. And as mentioned, its potential for varying its take-off location in future could be a big competitive advantage in the defense and security industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed seven new charges against Paige Thompson, the former Amazon Web Services (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a>) engineer accused of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/capital-one-hacked-over-100-million-customers-affected/">hacking Capital One</a> and stealing the personal data of more than 100 million Americans.</p>
<p>The new charges, which include six counts of computer fraud and abuse and one count of access device fraud, were revealed in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974985-capitalone-hack-june-2021-superseeding-indictment">court documents</a> filed earlier this month, obtained by <a href="https://therecord.media/new-charges-filed-against-capital-one-hacker-trial-postponed-to-2022/">The Record</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The previous indictment charged Thompson with one count each of wire fraud and computer crime and abuse, which meant she faced five up to five in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. As a result of the additional charges, Thompson now faces up to 20 years of jail time.</p>
<p>The superseding indictment has also expanded the number of victimized companies from the four listed in the 2019 indictment to eight. In addition to Capital One, a U.S. state agency, a U.S. public research university and an international telecommunications conglomerate, the list now includes a data and threat protection company, an organization that specializes in digital rights management (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/drm/">DRM</a>), a provider of higher education learning technology, and a supplier of call center solutions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The companies have not been named, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/capital-one-breach-vodafone-ford-researchers/">security firm CyberInt previously said </a>that Vodafone, Ford, Michigan State University and the Ohio Department of Transportation may all be victims of the breach.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Thompson, who used the handle “erratic” online and was identified after boasting about her activities on GitHub, remains accused of using her knowledge from her previous employment as a software engineer at Amazon to create a program that identified which customers of a cloud computing company (the indictment doesn&#8217;t name the company, but it has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-29/capital-one-data-systems-breached-by-seattle-woman-u-s-says">identified as Amazon Web Services</a>) had misconfigured firewalls. Once the tool found its target misconfiguration, Thompson allegedly exploited it to extract privileged account credentials.</p>
<p>The prior indictment alleges that once Thompson gained access to victims&#8217; cloud infrastructure using the stolen credentials, she then accessed and downloaded data to a server at her residence in Seattle. It remains unclear whether any of the information was passed to third parties.</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capital-one/">Capital One</a> breach, which the company confirmed in July 2019, the stolen data comprised 106 million credit card applications, which included names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth, along with 140,000 Social Security numbers, 80,000 bank account numbers, and some credit scores and transaction data. Capital One, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/capital-one-security-chief-shuffle/">which replaced its cybersecurity chief four months after the incident</a>, was <a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2020-036.pdf">fined $80 million</a> in August 2020 for the security breach and its failure to keep its users’ financial data secure.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also allege that Thompson copied and stole data from at least 30 entities in total that used the same cloud provider, and claim that, in some cases, she used this access to set up cryptocurrency mining operations using victims&#8217; cloud computing power &#8211; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/ico-snafu/">practice known as cryptojacking</a>.</p>
<p>Thompson pleaded not guilty and was released on pre-trial bond in August 2019. She was initially set to face trial in November 2019, but the trial was delayed to March 2020 due to the huge amount of information the prosecution had to analyze.</p>
<p>The trial was later rescheduled to October 2020 due to the pandemic, then to June 2021, then October 2021, and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20974986-motion-to-pospone-capitalone-hack-trial-to-2022">now to March 14, 2022</a>, with prosecutors still citing the need for more time to analyze the data collected from Thompson’s devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian rocket launch startup <a href="http://www.gspacetech.com/">Gilmour Space Technologies</a> is betting that bigger isn’t always better. The company has developed a small launch vehicle it calls Eris, a 25-meter (82 foot) rocket that can deliver a payload of up to 215 kilograms (474 pounds) to sun synchronous orbit. Now, it’s raised a $61 million AUD ($46 million USD) Series C round to take Eris to space next year.</p>

<p>Eris is much smaller than other launch companies’ rockets. Relativity Space’s Terran One has a max payload capacity to LEO of around 1,250 kg (2,756 lbs); even SpaceX’s Falcon 1, its first and smallest orbital rocket, could deliver 450 kg (990 pounds). Gilmour Space is wagering that the lighter payload will result in lower costs for a burgeoning suite of customers looking to send spacecraft to orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funds will also go toward nearly doubling the company’s workforce, from 70 to 120 employees, and developing a new commercial spaceport at Abbot Point, Queensland. Australian legislators approved construction of the launch site in May. Gilmour Space is also examining a proposed launch site in South Australia to facilitate polar orbit launches.</p>
<p>Gilmour Space has already signed agreements with prospective customers for future Eris launches. This includes contracts with two Australian space startups: Space Machines Company, to launch a 35 kg spacecraft on Eris’s inaugural flight, and Fleet Space Technologies, to carry six nanosatellites in 2023. Gilmour Space has also signed an agreement with U.S.-based Momentus to use its orbital transfer services.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fine Structure Ventures and included contributions from Australian VCs Blackbird and Main Sequence, and Australian pension funds HESTA, Hostplus and NGS Super. Blackbird and Main Sequence are returning investors after leading Gilmour’s Series A and Series B, respectively. This is the largest amount of private equity funding ever raised by a space company in Australia, and brings the company’s total amount raised to $87 million AUD ($66 million USD).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s almost go-time for all you early-stage startup founders. That’s right, on July 8-9 thousands of determined entrepreneurs around the world will gather virtually for the best little two-day bootcamp we like to call <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a>.</p>
<p>Two days focused on the bottom-line essentials to build your start up the right way. Here we lay out five reasons why you should stop what you’re doing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">buy your pass</a> and invest in a conference designed to make your work life a whole lot easier.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1. Learn from leading startup experts</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We packed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the agenda</a> with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">incredible subject-matter experts</a> who will offer highly interactive presentations across a range of topics every startup founder needs to know. Listen, engage and learn so you can avoid painful, expensive missteps and move forward without having to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>“Vlad Magdalin, founder of Webflow, was very candid about the challenges he faced on his journey to success. You always hear about startups that raise millions of dollars, but you don&#8217;t necessarily hear about the ups and downs it takes to get to that point. It’s important for early founders to see that side, too.” — Ashley Barrington, founder of MarketPearl and Early Stage 2020 attendee.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">2. Implement advice right out of the gate</strong></p>
<p>Plenty of conferences are long on opinion but short on advice that you can adapt and fold into your business now — when you need it the most. You won’t find that happening at TC Early Stage. Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft, told us she came away for Early Stage 2020 with tips she could implement right away.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">3. Expand your network</strong></p>
<p>Big networks offer more opportunities. It’s just that simple. You’ll have plenty of time to expand your networking empire at Early Stage. And, as Ashley Barrington notes, you never know where a chance meeting might lead one day.</p>
<blockquote><p>“CrunchMatch made it easy to set up short networking sessions with attendees all over the world, and that was a big benefit. I met other early-stage founders to learn what they&#8217;re working on, pool resources and connect for potential future opportunities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">4. Improve your pitch deck</strong></p>
<p>Day two features a pitch-off between 10 early-stage founders. They’ll present their pitches and receive invaluable feedback from our panel of esteemed judges. Even if you’re not on that virtual stage pitching your heart out, you’ll learn a lot by tuning in. Take it from Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly, who attended Early Stage 2020.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pitch deck teardown session was great. VCs reviewed my deck and gave specific, actionable advice. Watching them provide comments on other decks was helpful, too. We’re incorporating the feedback and when we start fundraising, the improved slides will make it easier for VCs to understand our value proposition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">5. Connect with your community</strong></p>
<p>Every TechCrunch event, whether it’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage</a>, Disrupt or TC Sessions, strives to provide a sense of community. Why? Because you may go faster alone, but you’ll go further together. Commune, commiserate and celebrate with your tribe of early-stage founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>“TechCrunch does this thing of connecting total strangers to create a genuinely supportive community. We’re all trying to do the same thing, which is bring our idea to life and make it a reality. I loved that unexpected benefit.” — Jessica McLean, director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">Buy your pass</a> and join your community at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9. We can’t wait to welcome you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, there has been a surge of newly formed digital banks aimed at specific demographics. The banks in nearly all cases are trying to meet the needs of certain populations that they believe are feeling left out or underserved by traditional financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest such neobank to emerge is New York-based </span><a href="https://joindaylight.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as the first LGBTQ+ digital banking platform in the United States. (There is a digital bank in Brazil with a similar mission called </span><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/brazils-pride-bank-says-its-the-first-lgbti-bank-in-the-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pride Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by L</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GBTQ+ entrepreneurs Rob Curtis (CEO), Billie Simmons, a trans woman (COO) and Paul Barnes Hoggett (CTO), Daylight is announcing today that it has secured $5 million in a seed funding round. Kapor Capital and Precursor Capital co-led the round, which included participation from Anthemis Group, Clocktower, Financial Venture Studio and Citibank.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight says its mission is to “build a more equitable financial life for LGBTQ+ folks and their chosen families.” The company’s services are targeted toward LGBTQ+ people, their families, and allies — or as Dayilght describes it, “values-based consumers who want to support the queer community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, which was founded in 2020, plans to use its new capital mostly to expand its flagship product and lifestyle services, which are designed to improve financial equality and inclusion for the estimated 30-million-plus Americans who identify as LGBTQ+. It also plans to build out a LGBTQ+ business marketplace and a platform that offers discounts and rewards when members shop at merchants whose actions support the queer community.</span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qQ8jkhK9nx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">Which neobanks will rise or fall?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Which neobanks will rise or fall?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/embed/#?secret=qQ8jkhK9nx" data-secret="qQ8jkhK9nx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch Curtis explained why he believes Daylight is uniquely positioned to help the population deal with challenges such as higher debt accumulation to factors such as p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-existing conditions, lower insurance levels, HIV management needs and [gender] transition costs. At the same time, many members of the community also have lower income levels due to “continued workplace discrimination.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBT people engage with money really differently and there’s a multitude of reasons for that,” Curtis said. “We spend about the same proportion of our income on discretionary spend, but we&#8217;re about 20% less likely to have a savings account, 20% less likely to own investments like stocks, or a quarter less likely to own a mutual fund. And we estimate that only about 30% of our community has any estate planning in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, life in general tends to be more costly for LGBTQ+ persons, Curtis believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is expensive to be a queer person,” he said. “Not only do we find that when we come out to our parents, 40% of us no longer have financial support for things like college and those transitions from childhood into adulthood. We end up with 50% more college debt. We also have increased sexual health costs and some have gender affirming surgery that they need to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the time we get to our 30s, we will be told ‘you can have one of the following three things: gender affirming surgery, a home deposit or a child,’ ” Curtis added. And, on top of that, having a child is generally more expensive for this population because people either have to adopt or hire a surrogate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kapor Capital Partner Brian Dixon believes that the fact that Daylight’s founders have personally experienced problems within the traditional banking industry gives them the necessary insight to help others in the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those problems include friction associated with names on issued cards, which leads to customers being outed as trans. The population also faces a lack of adequate financing products, Dixon believes, for things such as surrogacy, IVF, adoption, transition support and mental health.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">Maybe neobanks will break even after all</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=Mweqgd4nkI" data-secret="Mweqgd4nkI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many neobanks do not provide a truly unique banking experience that will result in a mass exodus from traditional banks,” Dixon said. “Daylight has an opportunity to be the outlier, especially given their focus on community. Daylight’s unique features include a seamless card issuance process that allows trans and non-binary customers to order a card in their preferred name, book sessions with expert LGBTQ+ financial coaches, get peer-to-peer advice from their digital community and earn rewards that are meaningful to the LGBT+ community.”</span></p>
<p>Daylight will offer features such as a checking account, the ability for members to get paid two days early, free ATMs and &#8220;no hidden fees,&#8221; according to Curtis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that payday early is really important because we know that there are high rates of credit card declines for folks who are buying hormones,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature the Daylight platform offers is personalized recommendations to members which alert them when they’re spending money with merchants that support anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and initiatives, a practice known as “rainbow washing.” It will also offer alternative merchants that it says are “more aligned with the community’s values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“LGBTQ+ consumers, and those that support them, are very intentional about where they spend, but it’s difficult for an individual to know whether they’re spending in line with their values, or inadvertently shopping with brands that engages in rainbow washing while funding politicians and projects that work against our interests,” Curtis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daylight is currently in beta but already has “thousands and thousands” of customers on its wait list, said Curtis, who estimates that it will have 10,000 customers by the time it launches in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other digital banks targeting specific demographics that have raised funding over the past year include Fair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a multilingual digital bank and financial services platform that </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/fair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently launched to the public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after raising $20 million in 40 days earlier this year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mandolin just marked its first birthday earlier this month, and yet the Indianapolis-based startup is already announcing a $12 million Series A. That’s a quick follow up to the $5 million seed it raised in early October of last year. Turns out the global pandemic is a pretty fortuitious time to launch and grow a concert streaming platform.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed round was co-led by 645 Ventures and Foundry Group and featured additional funding from existing investors like High Alpha and TIME Ventures (Marc Benioff).</p>
<p>The big question, of course, is what happens to a company like Mandolin when the world starts opening back up? Sure concert livestreams got a massive boost as fans and artists alike were seeking an outlet as touring ground to a halt. But what now that venues are starting to reopen.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As artists return to performing in sold out venues, Live+ will undoubtedly become a can’t-live-without digital complement that amplifies live shows,” CEO Mary Kay Huse said in a release. “Our new round of financing will support us in driving innovation of our core solution, delivering new digital offerings, and reinforcing our routes to market, so that every show is Live+.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171776" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171776" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/osherov-9933-1.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2171776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mandolin</p></div></p>
<p>Granted, that’s…pretty abstract. But the simple answer is the company has been looking toward enhancing the in-person event as well, ahead of an inevitable reopening. Essentially the company wants to build a companion app for shows.</p>
<p>Here’s what Huse told Variety last week, “I would love it if we could see upwards of 50% of in-person attendees experiencing something digitally while in the venue, as early as before the end of the year. It’s just creating a compelling content that makes them want to do it.”</p>
<p>The company will also continue to focus on streaming, which may see a hit, but certainly isn’t going away, post-pandemic. The news also sees 645 Managing Partner Nnamdi Okike joining the company’s board.</p>
<p>“During COVID-19, livestreaming has been a game-changer for fans who want to experience their favorite artists, and for artists and venues who want to bring exciting live events for their fans,” Okike said. “Mandolin provides the best technology platform to enable these experiences, and they’re also scaling a company to meet the needs of this fast-growing category.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While many Chinese companies are seemingly struggling to find the demand that they expect for their shares on American exchanges, domestic companies are seeing some opposite results.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The American IPO market is hot for many companies, but surprisingly cool for others. The gap between the two cohorts of private companies looking to list is becoming notable.</p>
<p>When Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi first set an IPO price range, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/">was curious</a> about why the company felt so inexpensive. Compared to its American comps, shares in Didi simply felt underpriced at its proposed valuation interval. Recently, Didi stuck to its initial expectations by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/didi-announces-pricing-initial-public-120000514.html">pricing at $14 per share</a>, the upper end of its range, but no higher.</p>
<p>This week also brought a lackluster float for Chinese grocery-delivery company DingDong, which <a href="https://www.iposcoop.com/the-ipo-buzz-dingdong-chops-ipos-size/">cut its IPO raise</a> but only managed a flat American debut. Another China-based online grocery delivery service that went public domestically last week, Missfresh, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/chinese-online-grocery-firms-dingdong-missfresh-have-a-tough-ipo.html">is doing even worse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>With just those few data points, you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to be particularly bullish about U.S.-listed IPOs. Why go public in the United States if you are going to be underpriced and then trade poorly? The answer is that while many Chinese companies are seemingly struggling to find the demand that they expect for their shares on American exchanges, domestic companies are seeing some opposite results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re talking tech companies here, I should add; The Exchange doesn&#8217;t track IPO results for commodities diggers and biotech labs. It&#8217;s a big world. We have to focus.</p>
<p>There are contrary data points to our general thesis. Nio&#8217;s recent share price appreciation could be construed as such. But if we parse recent <em>IPO </em>news from SentinelOne and Xometry in contrast to what we&#8217;ve seen from Chinese tech companies&#8217; own paths to the American public markets, there really does seem to be a gap forming.</p>
<h2>Uneven ground</h2>
<p>Didi&#8217;s IPO price of $14 per share values the company at around $67 billion on a nondiluted basis, and as high as $70 billion if we counted more shares in its market cap calculations. As we previously calculated, with around $6.5 billion in total Q1 2021 revenue and positive net income, the company is trading at a stiff multiples discount to Uber.</p>
<p>Indeed, Uber&#8217;s <em>trailing</em> price/sales ratio is north of 8x. If we valued Didi&#8217;s revenues from the last twelve months at the same price, it would be worth nearly $179 billion. It&#8217;s not. And that&#8217;s the gap that we want to stress.</p>
<p>That a few other Chinese tech IPOs listed in the United States underperformed in the last week is contrasted by a blizzard of positive IPO results from domestic companies from just this week:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is building its own version of Twitter&#8217;s Super Follow with a feature that would allow online creators to publish &#8220;exclusive&#8221; content to their Instagram Stories that&#8217;s only available to their fans &#8212; access that would likely come with a subscription payment of some kind.</p>
<p>Instagram confirmed that the screenshots of the feature <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1409597323076853760">recently circulated</a> across social media are from an internal prototype that&#8217;s now in development, but not yet being publicly tested. The company declined to share any specific details about its plans, saying they&#8217;re not at a place to talk about this project just yet.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172118" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172118" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4pIMyPWYAEZJAU.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Exclusive Story in development via <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alessandro Paluzzi</a></strong></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The screenshots, however, convey a lot about Instagram&#8217;s thinking, as they show a way that creators could publish what are being called &#8220;Exclusive Stories&#8221; to their accounts, which are designated with a different color (<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1408017220391903234/photo/1">currently purple</a>). When other Instagram users come across the Exclusive Stories, they&#8217;ll be shown a message that says that &#8220;only members&#8221; can view this content. The Stories cannot be screenshot, either, it appears, and they can be shared as Highlights. A new prompt encourages creators to &#8220;save this to a Highlight for your Fans,&#8221; explaining that, by doing so, &#8220;fans always have something to see when they join.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Exclusive Stories feature was uncovered by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who often finds unreleased features in the code of mobile apps. Over the past week, he&#8217;s published a series screenshots to an ongoing Twitter thread about his findings.</p>

<p>Exclusive Stories are only one part of Instagram&#8217;s broader plans for expanded creator monetization tools.</p>
<p>The company has been slowly revealing more details about its efforts in this space, with Instagram Head Adam Mosseri first telling <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund">The Information</a> in May that the company was &#8220;exploring&#8221; subscriptions along with other new features, like NFTs.</p>
<p>Paluzzi also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1409612389381775361">recently found references</a> to the NFT feature, Collectibles, which shows how digital collectibles could appear on a creator&#8217;s Instagram profile in a new tab.</p>

<p>Instagram, so far, hasn&#8217;t made a public announcement about these specific product developments, instead choosing to speak at a high level about its plans around things like subscriptions and tips.</p>
<p>For example, during Instagram&#8217;s Creator Week in early June &#8212; an event that could have served as an ideal place to offer a first glimpse at some of these ideas &#8212; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CP9DDRyhJvj/">Mosseri talked</a> more generally about the sort of creator tools Instagram was interested in building, without saying which were actually in active development.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to create if we want to be the best platform for creators long term, a whole suite of things, or tools, that creators can use to help do what they do,&#8221; he said, explaining that Instagram was also working on more creative tools and safety features, as well as tools that could help creators make a living.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s super important that we create a whole suite of different tools, because what you might use and what would be relevant for you as a creator might be very different than an athlete or a writer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so, largely, [the creator monetization tools] fall into three categories. One is commerce &#8212; so either we can do more to help with branded content; we can do more with affiliate marketing&#8230;we can do more with merch,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The second is ways for users to actually pay creators directly &#8212; so whether it is gated content or subscriptions or tips, like badges, or other user payment-type products. I think there&#8217;s a lot to do there. I love those because those give creators a direct relationship with their fans &#8212; which I think is probably more sustainable and more predictable over the long run,&#8221; Mosseri said.</p>
<p>The third area is focused on revenue share, as with IGTV long-form video and short-form video, like Reels, he added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2172120" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2172120" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2172120" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/E4anF2wWUAshSl-.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2172120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Instagram Exclusive Story feature in development via </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Alessandro Paluzzi</strong> <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Instagram isn&#8217;t the only large social platform moving forward with creator monetization efforts.</p>
<p>The membership model, popularized by platforms like OnlyFans and Patreon, has been more recently making its way to a number of mainstream social networks as the creator economy has become better established.</p>
<p>Twitter, for example, first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">announced its own take on creator subscriptions, </a>with the unveiling of its plans for the Super Follow feature during an Analyst Day event in February. Last week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">began rolling out applications</a> for Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces &#8212; the latter, a competitor to Clubhouse&#8217;s audio social networking rooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Facebook just yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">launched</a> its Substack newsletter competitor, Bulletin, which offers a way for creators to sell premium subscriptions and access member-only groups and live audio rooms. Even Spotify has launched an audio chat room and Clubhouse rival, Greenroom, which it also plans to eventually monetize.</p>
<p>Though the new screenshots offer a deeper look into Instagram&#8217;s product plans on this front, we should caution that an in-development feature is not necessarily representative of what a feature will look like at launch or how it will ultimately behave. It&#8217;s also not a definitive promise of a public launch &#8212; though, in this case, it would be hard to see Instagram scrapping its plans for exclusive, member-only content given its broader interest in serving creators, where such a feature is essentially part of a baseline offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the pandemic achieved anything good, it was putting health front and center in the minds of the general public, elected officials, investors and innovators. Cityblock has been working on solutions for bringing together the healthcare industry and communities since long before now, but it raised a total of $372 million spanning December through March, so it&#8217;s definitely seeing the impact of the visibility of its mission in light of a worldwide healthcare crisis.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">June 30 at noon PT/3PM ET</a>, Cityblock co-founder and CEO Iyah Romm will join us for an episode of Extra Crunch Live, along with Cityblock investor and Maverick Ventures managing partner Ambar Bhattacharyya. We&#8217;ll talk about the process of fundraising for this critical area in urgent need of innovation, and what it&#8217;s like trying to manage that process when the business you&#8217;re in is experiencing one of its busiest and most fraught times ever. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-maverick-ventures-and-cityblock-health?ref=f959abde89a4">Register here for free</a>.</p>
<p>Romm and Bhattacharyya will also be providing live feedback to participants in our weekly Extra Crunch Live pitch-off, which you can apply to join live during the event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But we&#8217;ve talked about Cityblock a bit, let&#8217;s take a step back and look at our guests.</p>
<p>Iyah Romm co-founded Cityblock in 2017 and has been its chief executive ever since. Before that, he was entrepreneur in residence at Sidewalk Labs, from which Cityblock spun out. He has a long history in public health and private care, including as chief transformation officer at Commonwealth Care Alliance, and a stint at the Health Policy Commission and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>Bhattacharyya has spent more than a decade in VC, including at Bessemer and Bain, as well as in his current role at Maverick Ventures. His track record includes investments in companies that have had a total of 11 exists via IPO and acquisition, including four public market unicorns. His specific focus has been on early and growth-stage healthcare companies, so it&#8217;s a space he knows very well.</p>
<p>Maverick participated in Cityblock&#8217;s Series A, as well as its Series B and both the C and C extension rounds from this past year.</p>
<p>The episode goes down at noon PT/3PM ET on June 30 and is free to all who want to check it out live.

		BJ Jenkins is CEO of <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/">Barracuda</a>, a provider of cloud-enabled security and data protection solutions. He is a member of the boards of directors at <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/">SumoLogic</a> and <a href="https://www.generac.com/">Generac Power Systems</a>.
	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It used to be a heavily traveled two-way street in corporate America: CEOs joined other companies’ boards to broaden their experiences, expand their influence, or simply because it felt good. Boards sought out CEOs because of the knowledge they bring and their unique ability to interact with the company CEO as an equal.</p>
<p>But the number of sitting CEOs on outside boards keeps shrinking. As the CEO role has become more difficult and demanding, greater numbers of chief executives are shying away from external board roles and many boards now limit their own CEOs’ board assignments as well.</p>
<p>The pandemic accelerated the trend, according to a <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/ceos-as-directors-maybe-not">report</a> by management consulting firm Korn Ferry, citing “evidence that the unprecedented demands posed by the pandemic led many CEO directors to resign from outside boards to focus on their own organizations.” Fewer than half of CEOs now serve on an outside board, the report said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			One good thing about the drop in CEO board assignments is more opportunity for non-CEOs and other traditionally underrepresented groups to join corporate boards.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At the same time, many corporations are feeling pressure to bring more gender and racial diversity to their boards and are making membership available to a broader array of candidates than in the past.</p>
<p>Is the decrease in CEO board participation a positive or negative? Interestingly, it’s both.</p>
<p>Here are four benefits of CEOs serving on boards:</p>
<p><strong>Advising another company can make for a better CEO. </strong>CEOs who opt out of corporate board directorships out of fear of overextending themselves &#8212; and boards who restrict their own CEOs’ board assignments for the same reason &#8212; miss a key point: Time on a board usually makes them a better leader.</p>
<p>I’m on two outside boards. An inside view of another company’s challenges and opportunities, its peaks and valleys, what strategies worked and didn’t, has revealed insights I’ve ended up applying at my own company. Being on the other side of the table has even helped me better understand how to communicate with my company’s board.</p>
<p><strong>Serving on a board can prevent myopia. </strong>Because of digital disruption, businesses must move at an unprecedented pace to stay competitive. Job No. 1 for all CEOs is to act on this reality every day inside their companies. But drawing exclusively from their own company’s experience can blind a leader to broader perspectives in the outside world. A board stint is a great way to ensure they’re getting those.</p>
<p><strong>Board memberships can make CEOs more empathetic. </strong>There’s a lot of talk these days about the need for heightened empathy in the C-suite, and with good reason: The global health crisis, racial injustice and other extraordinary stressors demand that senior executives possess what McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/tuning-in-turning-outward-cultivating-compassionate-leadership-in-a-crisis">described</a> as four qualities “to manage in crisis and shepherd their organization into a post-crisis next normal” &#8212; awareness, vulnerability, empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>In these times, it’s critically important for a CEO to cultivate as wide a frame of reference as possible, and involvement with another company through a board directorship accomplishes that.</p>
<p><strong>Helping another company does broader good. </strong>If a CEO has the wherewithal beyond their own company responsibilities to bring value to another firm’s board, that’s a positive for the world at large. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.</p>
<p>For example, I’m a board member at a company that once was strictly a manufacturer of home standby generators. It’s now digital savvy, with Wi-Fi-equipped generators providing a number of services on users’ smartphones. This means they also needs a strong cybersecurity strategy, my area of expertise. I take satisfaction in believing my guidance is benefiting the company, its shareholders and its customers.</p>
<p>So what’s good about the drop in CEO board assignments? That’s easy: more opportunity for non-CEOs and other traditionally underrepresented groups, including women and people of color, to join corporate boards.</p>
<p>“In a little-noticed but remarkable shift, many firms are skipping the corner suite and looking elsewhere for directors,” Korn Ferry reported. “Recent data shows that nearly two-thirds of the more than 400 director seats filled last year were taken by someone other than a CEO. Experts say since both the pandemic and the racial-equality protests of last year, companies are determined to create boards with more diverse faces and more specific skill sets.”</p>
<p>Equilar’s most recent <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/81-q1-2021-equilar-gender-diversity-index">Gender Diversity Index</a> found that at the end of Q1 2021, 24.3% of all board seats in the Russell 3000 were occupied by women, up from 15% at the end of 2016. “The path toward equal representation of men and women in public company boardrooms seemed to go nowhere for decades, but there has been a significant clearing in recent years,” the report said. (Nevertheless, Equilar cautions that boards won’t hit gender parity until 2032.)</p>
<p>And many of these non-CEO board members are doing an excellent job. According to a <a href="https://boardspan.com/users/0/library/do-ceos-make-the-best-board-members">survey</a> by Stanford University’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance, 79% of board members feel that, in practice, active CEOs are no better than non-CEO board members. A CEO may bring cachet to the board, but many non-CEOs contribute real work as a director, the study said.</p>
<p>Increased diversity on boards isn’t just an excellent development by itself; board experience positions members well for future leadership roles and thus can act as a proxy to get more women and people of color into corner offices.</p>
<p>Making board membership accessible to a wider range of candidates beyond typically white male CEOs &#8212; they still <a href="https://thesocietypages.org/specials/fortune-500-ceos-2000-2020-still-male-still-white/">account</a> for almost 90% of Fortune 500 CEOs &#8212; offers hope that diversity in the business leader ranks will keep rising.</p>
<p>All things considered, I think this potential outweighs the negatives of more CEOs staying out of outside companies’ board rooms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Board tensions at <a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a>, a San Francisco-based digital health unicorn, have caused Bessemer Venture Partners to switch up its board director seat, replacing the original investor at the chair with a different one. Hinge Health co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielperez1">Daniel Perez</a> says BVP&#8217;s original board seat went to the partner who led the his company&#8217;s Series C round. The investor was recused from the board because they did not notify Perez of a new investment that the founder sees as competitive with Hinge &#8212; New York-based <a href="https://www.clearing.com/">Clearing</a>.</p>
<p>The scenario alarmed Perez, who has requested that the investor go unnamed, given the confidential information to which his board of directors is privy.</p>
<p>“You don’t develop a great reputation with entrepreneurs if you invest in competitive situations, particularly without giving them a heads up.&#8221; Adds Perez, &#8220;Some investors have a strong moral compass, some do not.&#8221; The partner that left Hinge Health&#8217;s board has not taken a board seat at Clearing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A spokesperson from Bessemer declined to comment on the event because the firm does not “publicly discuss the mechanics of private Board dynamics.”</p>
<p>There hasn&#8217;t been a complete break between Bessemer and Hinge Health, a now six-year-old company that was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">$3 billion </a>during its last round of funding in January. Initially describing the situation as a firing, Perez said that the company &#8220;separated ways&#8221; with the original partner. In lieu of that, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheValuesVC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Elliott Robinson,</a> a growth equity partner with Bessemer, was upgraded from board observer to the newest board director at Hinge Health. The switch enables Bessemer to maintain visibility into its investment, while at the same time, letting Hinge Health make a statement to the firm and future investors about how it views transparency.</p>
<p>The tiff points to the increasingly nuanced tension around competition between startups, as deal velocity and volume reach all-time highs. While founders expect certain standards of conduct from investors, including that they notify them of investments in directly competitive startups, investors<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> may be feeling more pressure to make faster decisions that clash with the founders they&#8217;ve already backed, while having different definitions of competition from their portfolios.</span></p>
<h2>Defining competition</h2>
<p>Hinge Health is a digital health startup in the musculoskeletal (MSK) space that sells its care to insurers, self-insured employers and health plans. Clearing, meanwhile, brands itself as a solution to chronic pain, which is a symptom of underlying MSK conditions. The latter is going direct-to-consumer with its service, ignoring insurance carriers altogether. The venn diagram of the two companies thus overlaps vaguely, but looks different both from a product and go to market strategy.</p>
<p>Certainly, <a href="https://www.clearing.com/">Clearing</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-dorfman-3a89803">Avi Dorfman</a>, previously the co-founder of Compass, does not consider the two direct competitors. Asked by TechCrunch about potential overlap for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/musculoskeletal-medical-startups-race-to-enter-personalized-healthtech-market/">recent piece on personalized healthcare</a> in TechCrunch, Dorfman pointed to Bessemer&#8217;s stake in both companies as evidence that the two are taking very different tacks and targeting different end customers.</p>
<p>Of course, early-stage companies can evolve quickly, and even if the two aren&#8217;t competing squarely today, Hinge and Clearing have enough in common &#8212; Clearing is &#8220;competitively spirited,&#8221; says Perez &#8212; that Perez was surprised that Bessemer wouldn&#8217;t at least broach the conversation about Clearing with him.</p>
<p>“I think the best practice is that the investor asks the existing company how they feel about the conflict, and if they think it&#8217;ll be competitive,” says Perez via email. “Baseline, you always have to have a conversation. I&#8217;ve had 3-4 of those conversations with investors, and we understand the parameters, is there meaningful conflict, and how to ensure confidential information isn&#8217;t shared.”</p>
<p>No doubt plenty of founders might agree. To protect themselves, venture firms never include language in the term sheets that promises they&#8217;ll never invest in competing companies, but there has traditionally been a tacit understanding between founders and the investors who back them that the investor will avoid backing a similar company at all costs.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz somewhat famously missed out on owning more of Instagram after also investing in a company that later veered into Instagram&#8217;s business and deciding that it needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/andreessen-horowitz-isnt-hedging-its-bets-with-picplz-and-instagram-it-has-picked-picplz/">pick one or the other</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca">Marc Andreessen</a> told TechCrunch at the time, in 2010: “This kind of stuff happens all the time. Entrepreneurs are like heat-seeking-missiles; they gravitate towards good opportunities . . . It’s less of a choice against Kevin [Systrom] and Instagram as it was we were just very excited about working with Dalton [Caldwell],” who co-founded the now-defunct Instagram rival and is today a partner with Y Combinator.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/sequoia-is-giving-away-21-million-to-a-payments-startup-it-funded-as-it-walks-away-from-deal/">Sequoia gave away its $21 million stake</a> in a payments company, Finix, after resolving that its early-stage investment in the company competed too directly with Stripe, among its most valuable portfolio companies.</p>
<p>As more and more deals get funded and faster, the possibility for competitive overlap is growing &#8211; along with the scenarios that can be considered conflicting in the first place. What happens when a startup pivots into a different market than the one that it sold its investors on, and is suddenly competitive with a portfolio company? Can a Sequoia India partner back a company that is directly competing with a Sequoia India company? Is it okay for there to be competing investments within the same firm as long as different partners are sitting on the board? While founders may deserve transparency, there has to be some sort of reasonable boundaries on what they consider competitive, as well as an understanding that not all firms make promises to avoid conflicts.</p>
<h2><strong>Legitimizing unspoken rules</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrupUxGP11SDPTpAIPJScaM4aUjkaFUxQPRtOZv5OX0/edit">Tania Shah,</a> a startup lawyer and the founder of <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/04/13/startup-brings-legal-services-to-entrepreneurs.html#:~:text=In%20The%20Know%20Legal%20is,proxy%20appointments%2C%20and%20simple%20wills.">The Know Legal</a>, often works with founders who are raising seed rounds and has to educate them on the “unspoken rule” of obligations around confidentiality and loyalty. Essentially, she explains the obligations of a passive investor versus a board member who has more access to confidential information along with voting power. Part of what she teaches is that VCs tend not to sign NDAs &#8212; even while she pushes her clients to ask for these &#8212; so founders need to be as certain as possible that they are taking money from the right sources.</p>
<p>“I think the role of attorneys right now is also to be teachers,” says Shah.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is no shortage of horror stories. Nabeel Alamgir, CEO and founder of Lunchbox, for example, struggled to raise his first institutional check for his restaurant tech startup. He eventually found an investor who had connections to restaurants in New York City who Alamgir wanted to land, so Alamgir shared everything about Lunchbox, from its financials to its product integration road map and go-to-market strategy. The investor eventually ghosted Alamgir. Within four months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/in-a-post-nda-world-does-transparency-help-founders-identify-conflicts-of-interest/ ">claims Alamgir,</a> that same investor’s portfolio company launched a product that directly mimicked Lunchbox.</p>
<p>In February,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/this-insurtech-alleges-a-venture-backer-founded-and-funded-a-copycat-a-founders-nightmare/"> a similar situation appeared to play out</a> when insurtech company Sure claimed that venture firm IA Capital Group, its Series A investor, had used privileged information to launch a similar company called Boost. (IA Capital told TC at the time that the firm didn’t realize there was a potential conflict until Boost was “already well underway.” Sure has since filed a <a href="https://www.axios.com/sure-inc-boost-insurance-venture-capital-lawsuit-4ac03bfa-300d-4bef-b126-6449f050bbd4.html">related lawsuit</a> against Boost.)</p>

<p>Hinge Health’s Perez say that this conversation around competing interests and conflict has grown in the past year in his conversations with investors. After all, VCs have  ballooning funds to invest and  LP expectations to meet &#8211; and it may become impractical at some point for these same investors to fully back away from compelling bets in booming industries.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone through a bunch of business cycles, and so I’m seeing this business cycle where there’s a lot of deal flow,” Perez said. In his case, “We’re not going to carve out a whole field of medicine and say that you can&#8217;t play at all in this field,&#8221; But at minimum, he says, VCs and their founders have to communicate as clearly as possible about what&#8217;s happening out there right now. Says Perez, &#8220;You have to have a conversation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft&#8217;s customer security chief says as many as one-third of all government demands that the company receives for customer data are issued with secrecy clauses that prevents it from disclosing the search to the subject of the warrant.</p>
<p>The figure was disclosed in testimony by Microsoft&#8217;s Tom Burt ahead of a House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, as lawmakers weigh a legislative response to efforts by the Justice Department under the Trump administration to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/technology/apple-google-leak-investigation-data-requests.html">secretly obtain call and email records</a> as part of an investigation into the leaks of classified information to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN.</p>
<p>Burt said that such secrecy orders &#8220;have unfortunately become commonplace,&#8221; and that Microsoft regularly receives &#8220;boilerplate secrecy orders unsupported by any meaningful legal or factual analysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his testimony, Burt said that since 2016, Microsoft received between 2,400 to 3,500 secrecy orders each year, or 7 to 10 a day. Microsoft said in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/law-enforcement-requests-report">its transparency report</a> that it received close to 11,200 legal orders from U.S. authorities last year.</p>
<p>By comparison, the U.S. courts approved 2,395 warrants with secrecy clauses a decade ago in 2010, which Burt said is fewer than the number of secrecy orders Microsoft alone received in any of the past five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are just the demands that Microsoft, just one cloud service provider, received. Multiply those numbers by every technology company that holds or processes data, and you may get a sense of the scope of the government’s overuse of secret surveillance,&#8221; Burt&#8217;s testimony says. &#8220;We are not suggesting that secrecy orders should only be obtained through some impossible standard. We simply ask that it be a meaningful one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the controversy over secrecy orders came of late when secrecy orders served on Apple, Google and Microsoft expired in recent weeks, allowing the companies to disclose to the news agencies that the Justice Department under the Trump administration had sought to obtain their records by demanding the data from the tech companies that host the data.</p>
<p>President Biden pledged to stop the collection of journalists&#8217; phone and email records, while also dropping some secrecy provisions. But lawmakers are likely to note that legislative change would be needed to codify policy into law.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Burt said the company will &#8220;do everything it can to prevent the misuse of secrecy orders.&#8221; The software and cloud giant also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/14/microsoft-sues-justice-department-for-transparency-in-government-data-searches/">sued the Justice Department in 2016</a> to challenge the constitutionality of gag orders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No, it&#8217;s not April Fool&#8217;s Day. But Twitter&#8217;s entire account has been taken over by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">NFTs</a>. As its new header reads: &#8220;I&#8217;ve stopped moisturizing because tweeting about NFTs is keeping me young now.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, the Twitter bird is going to look like a little baby duckling by the end of the day. This morning, Twitter posted, &#8220;140 free NFTs for 140 of you, besties,&#8221; nodding to Twitter&#8217;s initial 140 character limit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">140 free NFTs for 140 of you, besties <a href="https://t.co/0Pm0tNhIRg">pic.twitter.com/0Pm0tNhIRg</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Twitter (@Twitter) <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1410227743636217856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In retrospect, we should&#8217;ve expected this after Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey sold <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20">his first tweet as an NFT</a> earlier this year through a website called <a href="https://v.cent.co/">Valuables by Cent</a>, which is unaffiliated with Twitter, yet gives people the option to mint and sell NFTs of tweets. Even Mark Cuban, who has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">investing in the NFT space</a>, <a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/1355995109733621762?s=v_s">sold a tweet</a> on Valuables for 0.56 ETH, or $953 at the time. Dorsey&#8217;s NFT sold for 1630 ETH, which was worth about $2.9 million at the time of sale. He donated the proceeds to GiveDirectly to aid the COVID-19 response in Africa, but NFTs are still often criticized for their negative <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change">environmental impact</a> &#8212; others worry that the NFT market could just be a flash in the pan. But with major platforms like Twitter making NFTs, the fad might not be over just yet &#8212; or, Twitter could be testing the waters to gauge how its userbase reacts to an impromptu, free NFT drop before expanding its offerings in the space.</p>

<p>The catch with today&#8217;s Twitter NFT drop is that nobody can buy them &#8212; Twitter users can reply to the tweet for the chance to get one of 7 NFTs, which were minted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/nft-marketplace-startup-rarible-closes-14-2-million-series-a/">Rarible</a>, an NFT marketplace, in editions of 20, which makes 140 NFTs total.</p>
<p>According to Twitter, there have been over 29 million tweets on the platform about NFTs. What&#8217;s next for NFTs on Twitter? We&#8217;re not sure. But with Twitter&#8217;s rapid development of new features like Spaces, Super Follows, Twitter Blue, and more, it&#8217;s possible that this won&#8217;t be the last we hear about Twitter&#8217;s foray into crypto-powered collectibles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To train a robot to navigate a house, you either need to give it a lot of real time in a lot of real houses, or a lot of virtual time in a lot of virtual houses. The latter is definitely the better option, and Facebook and Matterport are working together to make thousands of virtual, interactive digital twins of real spaces available for researchers and their voracious young AIs.</p>
<p>On Facebook&#8217;s side the big advance is in two parts: <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/habitat-20-training-home-assistant-robots-with-faster-simulation-and-new-benchmarks">the new Habitat 2.0 training environment</a> and the dataset they created to enable it. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/facebook-is-creating-photorealistic-homes-for-ais-to-work-and-learn-in/">You may remember Habitat from a couple years back</a>; in the pursuit of what it calls &#8220;embodied AI,&#8221; which is to say AI models that interact with the real world, Facebook assembled a number of passably photorealistic virtual environments for them to navigate.</p>
<p>Many robots and AIs have learned things like movement and object recognition in idealized, unrealistic spaces that resemble games more than reality. A real-world living room is a very different thing from a reconstructed one. By learning to move about in something that looks like reality, an AI&#8217;s knowledge will transfer more readily to real-world applications like home robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But ultimately these environments were only polygon-deep, with minimal interaction and no real physical simulation — if a robot bumps into a table, it doesn&#8217;t fall over and spill items everywhere. The robot could go to the kitchen, but it couldn&#8217;t open the fridge or pull something out of the sink. Habitat 2.0 and the new ReplicaCAD dataset change that with increased interactivity and 3D objects instead of simply interpreted 3D surfaces.</p>
<p>Simulated robots in these new apartment-scale environments can roll around like before, but when they arrive at an object, they can actually do something with it. For instance if a robot&#8217;s task is to pick up a fork from the dining room table and go place it in the sink, a couple years ago picking up and putting down the fork would just be assumed, since you couldn&#8217;t actually simulate it effectively. In the new Habitat system the fork is physically simulated, as is the table it&#8217;s on, the sink it&#8217;s going to, and so on. That makes it more computationally intense, but also way more useful.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qb10vmYZ0Jc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the first to get to this stage by a long shot, but the whole field is moving along at a rapid clip and each time a new system comes out it leapfrogs the others in some ways and points at the next big bottleneck or opportunity. In this case Habitat 2.0&#8217;s nearest competition is probably AI2&#8217;s ManipulaTHOR, which combines room-scale environments with physical object simulation.</p>
<p>Where Habitat has it beat is in speed: according to the paper describing it, the simulator can run roughly 50-100 times faster, which means a robot can get that much more training done per second of computation. (The comparisons aren&#8217;t exact by any means and the systems are distinct in other ways.)</p>
<p>The dataset used for it is called ReplicaCAD, and it&#8217;s essentially the original room-level scans recreated with custom 3D models. This is a painstaking manual process, Facebook admitted, and they&#8217;re looking into ways of scaling it, but it provides a very useful end product.</p>

<p>More detail and more types of physical simulation are on the roadmap — basic objects, movements, and robotic presences are supported, but fidelity had to give way for speed at this stage.</p>
<p>Matterport is also making some big moves in partnership with Facebook. After making a huge platform expansion over the last couple years, the company has assembled an enormous collection of 3D-scanned buildings. Though it has worked with researchers before, the company <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/introducing-the-habitat-matterport-3d-research-data-set-for-training-embodied-ai">decided it was time to make a larger part of its trove available to the community</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve Matterported every type of physical structure in existence, or close to it. Homes, high-rises, hospitals, office spaces, cruise ships, jets, Taco Bells, McDonalds&#8230; and all the info that is contained in a digital twin is very important to research,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/former-ebay-product-chief-rj-pittman-takes-the-reins-at-3d-capture-company-matterport/">CEO RJ Pittman told me</a>. &#8220;We thought for sure this would have implications for everything from doing computer vision to robotics to identifying household objects. Facebook didn&#8217;t need any convincing&#8230; for Habitat and embodied AI it is right down the center of the fairway.&#8221;</p>
<p>To that end it created a dataset, HM3D, of a thousand meticulously 3D-captured interiors, from the home scans that real estate browsers may recognize to businesses and public spaces. It&#8217;s the largest such collection that has been made widely available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2171836" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/matterport-hm3d.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2171836" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2171836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/matterport-hm3d.gif" alt="3D spinning views of building interiors scanned by matterport." width="800" height="460" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2171836" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matterport</p></div></p>
<p>The environments, which are scanned an interpreted by an AI trained on precise digital twins, are dimensionally accurate to the point where, for example, exact numbers for window surface area or total closet volume can be calculated. It&#8217;s a helpfully realistic playground for AI models, and while the resulting dataset isn&#8217;t interactive (yet) it is very reflective of the real world in all its variance. (It&#8217;s distinct from the Facebook interactive dataset but could form the basis for an expansion.)</p>
<p>&#8220;It is specifically a diversified dataset,&#8221; said Pittman. &#8220;We wanted to be sure we had a rich grouping of different real world environments — you need that diversity of data if you want to get the most mileage out of it training an AI or robot.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the data was volunteered by the owners of the spaces, so don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s been sucked up unethically by some small print. Ultimately, Pittman explained, the company wants to create a larger, more parameterized dataset that can be accessed by API — realistic virtual spaces as a service, basically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re building a hospitality robot, for bed and breakfasts of a certain style in the U.S — wouldn&#8217;t it be great to be able to get a thousand of those?&#8221; he mused. &#8220;We want to see how far we can push advancements with this first dataset, get those learnings, then continue to work with the research community and our own developers and go from there. This is an important launching point for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both datasets will be open and available for researchers everywhere to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> started talking about a new set of communications tools <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">to enhance the text-based channels</a> at the end of last year. Today the company released a new audio tool called Slack Huddles and gave more details on a couple of other new tools including the ability to leave a video message and an enhanced employee directory, which you can access from inside Slack. All of these appear to have been designed with the changing nature of work in mind.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Slack Huddles, the audio tool that lets you have a real-time conversation with someone in Slack instead of typing out all of your thoughts. This will be much easier for people who find typing challenging, but the company also believes it will allow more spontaneous discussion, which mimics being in the office, at least to some degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huddles is a light-weight, audio-first way of communicating right in Slack. [It] recreates the spontaneous and serendipitous interactions that happen outside of scheduled meetings,&#8221; Tamar Yehoshua, chief product officer at Slack explained in a press briefing yesterday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As companies continue to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">introduce more flexible working models</a>, they will have to adjust how they work. Huddles is one way of thinking about that, says Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some things can be synchronous, but only take three minutes. Instead of [scheduling a meeting for] next Tuesdays from 11:30 to 12 and [using] the whole half hour because that&#8217;s what we scheduled, it&#8217;s two or three minutes, right now, And if the conversation fizzles out in the Huddle you leave it open, maybe someone joins later and says something, which you wouldn&#8217;t do on a call,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<p>And recognizing that not everyone will be able to hear, the new tool includes real-time transcription.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/embed/#?secret=e2e2bElGoq" data-secret="e2e2bElGoq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has also been talking about providing some kind of video message capability since last year. The idea is almost like a video voicemail or an Instagram Story where you shoot a short video and post it in Slack. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been thinking about it and we believe that by giving people a way to expressively and asynchronously share and consume information we can enable people to be more flexible in how they work, and reduce the need for video meetings,&#8221; Yehoshua said.</p>
<p>The new feature will enable Slack users to play back video, voice and screen recordings natively in Slack. People can record and upload short clips into a channel or DM, &#8220;enabling others to watch and respond on their own schedule,&#8221; she explained.  While this feature isn&#8217;t ready to release yet, Yehoshua reported it is being piloted and will be available to paid teams some time in the coming months.</p>
<p>The last piece is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/slack-snags-corporate-directory-startup-rimeto-to-up-its-people-search-game/">the Rimeto acquisition</a>, which Slack bought last year with an eye toward upping their corporate directory piece. The Rimeto product has in fact been repurposed as Slack Atlas, a corporate directory that users can access right in Slack, rather than moving to another program to find that information. It&#8217;s another way Slack can keep users in Slack to find the information that they need, while avoiding context switching. This is currently in limited customer testing, but should be available some time later this year, according to the company.</p>
<p>Slack first announced these tools last year, initially saying they were experimental, but quickly shifting them to the product road map. Butterfield <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/">appeared in a Clubhouse interview</a> in March with former TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine, who is now a SignalFire investor ostensibly to talk about the future of work, but he also went into more detail about these tools for the first time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to wrap this discussion into the future of work, and indeed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Slack&#8217;s future as part of Salesforce</a>, which bought the communications tool for $27 billion last year. Work is changing and Slack is looking to be a broader part of that solution, whatever the future holds.</p>
