										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.moka.care">moka.care</a>, a French startup that has built several services that should help you improve your psychological well-being. The company sells its solution to employers directly. They can then offer access to moka.care to their employees.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $3 million (€2.5 million) funding round from <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, the VC firm founded by former Alven partners Jeremy Uzan and Raffi Kamber. A long list of business angels are also participating in today’s round, such as Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia), Ning Li (Made.com, Typology), Florian Douetteau (Dataiku), Céline Lazorthes (Leetchi, MangoPay), Pierre Dubuc (OpenClassrooms), Marc-Antoine de Longevialle (LeCab), Adrien Ledoux (JobTeaser), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Thibault Lamarque (CASTALIE) and Côme Fouques (Indy).</p>
<p>moka.care believes that companies aren’t doing enough when it comes to mental health. Many companies give you a phone number and tell you that you can call that number to get mental support. But few employees actually call those helplines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why the startup is taking a completely different approach. The most important principle is that people are looking for different things. And you don’t necessarily know what you’re looking for when you’re feeling down. When you first contact moka.care, the company spends roughly half an hour talking with you to understand what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>There are three main options after that. moka.care could send you some recommendations for a practitioner — it can be a psychologist, a certified coach or a licensed therapist. moka.care also organizes group sessions around a specific topic. It could be focused on remote work, work-life balance, self-confidence, etc. Finally, moka.care also provides content on some of those topics. You can access that content and learn more about yourself.</p>
<p>With this granular approach, the company hopes it can tackle mental health conditions before it’s too late — you don’t want to recommend a therapist when an employee is already suffering from excessive stress, fatigue or burn-out.</p>
<p>Employees don’t pay for the first sessions as it’s part of moka.care’s plans. This way, the barrier to entry should be much lower for employees. Of course, if you want to book further appointments, you’ll have to pay at some point.</p>
<p>For employers, moka.care tries to lower the barrier to entry as well. Clients agree on a per-employee-per-month subscription plan based on some usage rate. If your employees end up using moka.care more than that, you don’t pay more. If your employees don’t use the service at all and you’re overpaying, the startup pays you back.</p>
<p>There are 30 companies currently using moka.care — it represents thousands of employees that could potentially create an account and access the service. The startup currently works with around 50 practitioners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Venmo mobile payments app is going to look very different in 2021 as it inches closer to neobank territory with expansions into budgeting, saving, and cryptocurrency, said Venmo parent company PayPal, during its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company also plans to put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">its $4 billion Honey acquisition</a> to work by integrating its suite of shopping tools into the Venmo app, including merchant offers, deals, price tracking and wish lists.</p>
<p>PayPal already signaled its intentions to bring cryptocurrencies to Venmo. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/"> entered the crypto market last November </a>by adding support for buying, holding, and selling cryptocurrencies in the U.S. through a partnership with the regulated crypto services provider, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2956193-1&amp;h=1362442868&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paxos.com%2F&amp;a=Paxos%C2%A0Trust+Company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paxos Trust Company.</a> At the time, PayPal noted it would bring a similar feature set to its Venmo app during 2021.</p>
<p>That time frame is still on track, PayPal confirmed during its earnings call with investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said, in the next few months, Venmo users will gain the ability to buy, hold and sell crypto inside the Venmo mobile app, along with other &#8220;investment alternatives.&#8221; (This statement refers to <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/central-bank-digital-currencies-a-matter-of-when-not-if-8211-paypal-ceo-61067468">PayPal&#8217;s work with central banks</a> who are developing their own digital currencies on the blockchain.)</p>
<p>Other changes to Venmo make the app sound as if it&#8217;s becoming more of a neobank competitor.</p>
<p>For example, PayPal said it will work with its financial industry partners this year to introduce features like budgeting and saving tools as well as bill pay options inside PayPal &#8212; additions that are common to modern-day mobile banking apps.</p>
<p>On Venmo, the forthcoming savings feature will look similar to PayPal&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/article/what-can-i-do-with-my-personal-paypal-account,-paypal-cash-account-or-paypal-cash-plus-account-faq3997">PayPal Cash Plus account</a>, where it partners with financial institutions to provide FDIC pass-through insurance. Today, funds held in the Cash Plus account are eligible for this insurance only if customers also have a PayPal Cash Card debit card, have enrolled in Direct Deposit, or have established Goals in their Cash Plus account. Venmo now has the pieces in place to offer the same.</p>
<p>Another change includes the Honey integration, which PayPal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/paypal-details-its-digital-wallet-plans-for-2021-including-crypto-honey-integration-and-more/">has been promising for some time</a>. Now, the company is offering more details around what those integrations will look like. It said the plan is to integrate Honey&#8217;s features into both its PayPal and Venmo platforms in the first half of 2021 &#8212; including Honey&#8217;s wish list, price monitoring tools, deals, coupons and rewards.</p>
<p>This integration will allow merchants to target specific demographics of PayPal and Venmo customers with personalized offers and discounts, thanks to PayPal&#8217;s two-sided marketplace. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In other words, the company will attempt to capture the consumer in the earlier stages of the shopping process, when they&#8217;re browsing for deals, looking up prices, or searching for specific products. Honey&#8217;s shopping tools could point them to a matching deal, and then the customer could complete the checkout process using the Venmo app. </span></p>
<p>These new tools will arrive at a time when the pandemic has forced more commerce to shift online, as retail stores and other in-person retail opportunities declined due to store closures and government lockdowns. Plus, some people today now just prefer to shop online because they no longer feel safe in physical retail stores where basic safety measures like mask-wearing and social distancing aren&#8217;t enforced.</p>
<p>This broader acceleration of e-commerce and &#8220;contactless&#8221; payments also helped PayPal to add 1.4 million new merchants in the quarter. It now has 29 million merchants across its platform, who interact with now nearly 350 million consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Venmo&#8217;s total payment volume grew 60% year-over-year to $47 billion, and its customer base grew 32%, ending just shy of 70 million accounts. The company expects its revenues will approach $900 million in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2056385" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2056385" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2056385" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?w=680" alt="Venmo credit card" width="680" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Credit_Card_Visual06.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2056385" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>Venmo has been rapidly expanding beyond being just a payments app. In recent months, it has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/venmo-launches-its-first-credit-card-offering-up-to-3-cash-back-personalized-rewards/"> launched its first credit card</a>, which will be 100% rolled out by month-end, as well as QR codes for in-store shopping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/venmo-begins-piloting-business-profiles-for-small-sellers/">business profiles</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/venmo-adds-a-check-cashing-feature-waives-fees-for-stimulus-checks/">cash-checking features</a> that arrived just in time to handle customers&#8217; stimulus checks.</p>
<p>But Venmo doesn&#8217;t aim to be a full neobank &#8212; at least not yet. Instead, it imagines itself as more of a &#8220;digital wallet&#8221; of sorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s digital reality is rapidly accelerating the need for a digital wallet that encompasses payments, financial services and shopping,&#8221; explained PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, speaking to investors. &#8220;This year, our digital wallet will change more than it has ever changed before, significantly increasing its functionality within a single, integrated and beautifully designed app that should meaningfully increase consumer engagement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As Venmo&#8217;s new features roll out, PayPal expects the app&#8217;s usage and payment volume to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are going to see&#8230;.a real bend in the historic rate of engagement. And it’s going to be all around that super app functionality in that digital wallet, moving well beyond just payments,&#8221; Schulman said.</p>
<p><em>Correction, 2/4/21, 1 pm et &#8212;  Schulman&#8217;s note about bill pay was referencing a launch inside PayPal&#8217;s app in 2021. It was mentioned alongside other forthcoming Venmo features, which led to some confusion. We&#8217;ve now corrected this. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tryflux.com/">Flux</a>, the London fintech that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/">built a technology platform for banks and merchants</a> to power itemised digital receipts and more, has seen its lengthy pilot with Barclays bear fruit.</p>
<p>Announced formally today &#8212; but actually quietly rolled out a few months ago &#8212; Flux-powered digital receipts are now available as an opt-in for all U.K. Barclays debit card holders within the bank&#8217;s main mobile banking app. Previously, the functionality was only available within the Barclays Launchpad app, which is available for customers that want to try out experimental or upcoming features.</p>
<p>Early last year, Barclays announced that it has invested in Flux, taking a minority stake, so the strengthening of its partnership isn&#8217;t too much of a surprise. Flux also went through the Techstars-powered Barclays accelerator in its very early days. However, not all corporate accelerators lead to great outcomes as corporates are notoriously risk-adverse. This one certainly wasn&#8217;t rushed but it&#8217;s meaningful regardless, giving Flux a major shot in the arm in reaching mainstream banking customers beyond the existing challenger bank partnerships it has forged.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZkvjCS1Yeq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/">Flux raises $7.5M Series A to bring its digital receipts platform to more banks and merchants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Flux raises $7.5M Series A to bring its digital receipts platform to more banks and merchants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/flux-series-a/embed/#?secret=ZkvjCS1Yeq" data-secret="ZkvjCS1Yeq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers who pay using their Barclays debit card for future in store purchases at H&amp;M, shoe retailer schuh and food outlets, which include Just Eat and Papa Johns, will see their receipts sent automatically to their app after making a purchase. They can then easily and securely view their receipts whenever they need by tapping on the transaction,&#8221; says Barclays. Crucially, although opt-in, Barclays customers will receive a prompt to set up digital receipts when they purchase items from retailers currently on-boarded to Flux.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by former early employees at Revolut, Flux bridges the gap between the itemised receipt data captured by a merchant’s point-of-sale (POS) system and what little information typically shows up on your bank statement or mobile banking app. Off the back of this, it can also power loyalty schemes and card-linked offers, as well as give merchants much deeper POS analytics via aggregated and anonymised data on consumer behaviour, such as which products are selling best in unique baskets.</p>
<p>On the banking side, along with Barclays, Flux has partnered with challenger banks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/starling-bank-marketplace/">Starling</a> and Monzo. Once banking customers link their account to the service, Flux delivers digital receipts (and where available rewards and loyalty) for transactions at Flux retailer partners.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Flux wants to become a standard for the interchange of item level digital receipt data — and the proprietary platform that powers that standard — but has always faced a chicken and egg problem: It needs bank integrations to sign up merchants and it needs merchant integrations to sign up banks. Barclays going live properly is another significant turn in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/flux-partners-with-fast-food-merchant-itsu-for-itemised-paperless-receipts/">the upstart&#8217;s flywheel</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://latitude.io">Latitude</a>, a startup building games with &#8220;infinite storylines&#8221; generated by artificial intelligence, is announcing that it has raised $3.3 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The idea of an AI-generated story might make you think of hilariously nonsensical experiments like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY7x2Ihqjmc">&#8220;Sunspring,&#8221;</a> but Latitude&#8217;s first title, <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/">AI Dungeon</a>, is an impressively open-ended (and coherent) text adventure game where you can choose from a wide variety of genres and characters.</p>
<p>And unlike a classic text adventure like Zork — where players quickly become familiar with &#8220;you can&#8217;t do that&#8221;-style messages when they type something the designers hadn&#8217;t planned for — AI Dungeon can respond to any command. For example, when my brave knight was charging into battle, I typed &#8220;get depressed&#8221; and he quickly sat on a rock with his head between his hands.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;How does the AI know what’s a good story?&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Nick Walton. &#8220;Because it’s read a lot of good stories and knows the patterns involved in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>AI Dungeon actually started out as one of Walton&#8217;s hackathon projects. And while the initial version didn&#8217;t win any prizes, he kept at it, assisted by improvements in OpenAI&#8217;s language generator, of which <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/">the most recent version is GPT-3</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108902" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108902" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108902" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?w=680" alt="AI Dungeon screenshot" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg 3578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AID-Gameplay-Edit-AI-Output.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108902" class="wp-caption-text">AI Dungeon</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The very first version of AI Dungeon I built was coherent on a sentence level, but on a paragraph level it made no sense,&#8221; Walton said. &#8220;Once you get to GPT-2, it makes a lot more sense. Once you get to GPT-3, it&#8217;s a lot more coherent on a story level. And so I think to a degree, these issues with coherency, the story not making sense, get solved as the AI gets better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latitude says AI Dungeon is attracting 1.5 million monthly active users. The startup plans to create more AI-powered games, and eventually to release a platform allowing other game designers to do the same.</p>
<p>Walton noted that without AI, video games are always constrained by imagination of its creators. Even when you get to games like The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall or No Man&#8217;s Sky, with randomly generated towns or planets, he argued that they&#8217;re really offering &#8220;the same spin on a similar concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, he said that in Daggerfall, &#8220;When you go to all these towns, they’re all basically the same. That&#8217;s the problem with procedural generation: You&#8217;re not coming up with unique things.&#8221; AI, on the other hand, can come up with &#8220;something completely unique that&#8217;s so, so different every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a business perspective, he said that this could lower the cost of developing AAA games from more than $100 million to less than $100,000 — though Latitude has a ways to go before it reaches that level, since it hasn&#8217;t even released a game with graphics yet. Walton also said this could lead to new levels of immersion and interactivity.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this technology, you could have a world with tens of thousands of characters with their own hopes and wants and dreams,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can have worlds that are dynamic, that are alive, rather than something like World of Warcraft, where you&#8217;ve got 10 million people who are doing the same quest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s funding was led by NFX, with participation from Album VC and Griffin Gaming Partners.</p>
<p>“Latitude is revolutionizing how games are made, creating a whole new genre of entertainment gaming fueled by AI,” said James Currier of NFX in a statement. “The best AI minds and engineers are gathering there to produce games that the world has never seen before. Latitude is already by far the leading AI games company.“</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As impressive as the cameras in our smartphones are, they&#8217;re fundamentally limited by the physical necessities of lenses and sensors. Metalenz skips over that part with a camera made of a single &#8220;metasurface&#8221; that could save precious space and battery life in phones and other devices&#8230; and they&#8217;re about to ship it.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to, but not descended from, the &#8220;metamaterials&#8221; that gave rise to flat beam-forming radar and lidar of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/22/gates-backed-lumotive-upends-lidar-conventions-using-metamaterials/">Lumotive</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/echodyne-steers-its-high-tech-radar-beam-on-autonomous-cars-with-echodrive/">Echodyne</a>. The idea is to take a complex 3D structure and accomplish what it does using a precisely engineered &#8220;2D&#8221; surface — not actually two-dimensional, of course, but usually a plane with features measured in microns.</p>
<p>In the case of a camera, the main components are of course a lens (these days it&#8217;s usually several stacked), which corrals the light, and an image sensor, which senses and measures that light. The problem faced by cameras now, particularly in smartphones, is that the lenses can&#8217;t be made much smaller without seriously affecting the clarity of the image. Likewise sensors are nearly at the limit of how much light they can work with. Consequently most of the photography advancements of the last few years have been done on the computational side.</p>

<p>Using an engineered surface that does away with the need for complex optics and other camera systems has been a goal for years. Back in 2016 I wrote about a NASA project that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/moth-eyes-inspired-the-design-of-this-hypersensitive-camera/">took inspiration from moth eyes</a> to create a 2D camera of sorts. It&#8217;s harder than it sounds, though — usable imagery has been generated in labs, but it&#8217;s not the kind of thing that you take to Apple or Samsung.</p>
<p>Metalenz aims to change that. The company&#8217;s tech is built on the work of Harvard&#8217;s Frederico Capasso, who has been publishing on the science behind metasurfaces for years. He and <span id="m_7014018653220318688gmail-m_5304010451562732722gmail-docs-internal-guid-46472761-7fff-b5e1-8371-b9b5f5e61db6">Rob Devlin, who did his doctorate work in Capasso&#8217;s lab, co-founded the company to commercialize their efforts.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Early demos were extremely inefficient,&#8221; said Devlin of the field&#8217;s first entrants. &#8220;You had light scattering all over the place, the materials and processes were non-standard, the designs weren&#8217;t able to handle the demands that a real world throws at you. Making one that works and publishing a paper on it is one thing, making 10 million and making sure they all do the same thing is another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their breakthrough — if years of hard work and research can be called that — is the ability not just to make a metasurface camera that produces decent images, but to do it without exotic components or manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really using all standard semiconductor processes and materials here, the exact same equipment — but with lenses instead of electronics,&#8221; said Devlin. &#8220;We can already make a million lenses a day with our foundry partners.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108534" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108534" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2108534" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png" alt="Diagram comparing the multi-lens barrel of a conventional phone camera, and their simpler &quot;meta-optic&quot;" width="1024" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png 1118w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lens-diagram.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108534" class="wp-caption-text">The thing at the bottom is the chip where the image processor and logic would be, but the meta-optic could also integrate with that. the top is a pinhole.</p></div></p>
<p>The first challenge is more or less contained in the fact that incoming light, without lenses to bend and direct it, hits the metasurface in a much more chaotic way. Devlin&#8217;s own PhD work was concerned with taming this chaos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Light on a macro [i.e. conventional scale, not close-focusing] lens is controlled on the macro scale, you&#8217;re relying on the curvature to bend the light. There&#8217;s only so much you can do with it,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But here you have features a thousand times smaller than a human hair, which gives us very fine control over the light that hits the lens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those features, as you can see in this extreme close-up of the metasurface, are precisely tuned cylinders, &#8220;almost like little nano-scale Coke cans,&#8221; Devlin suggested. Like other metamaterials, these structures, far smaller than a visible or near-infrared light ray&#8217;s wavelength, manipulate the radiation by means that take a few years of study to understand.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2108455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg" alt="Diagram showing chips being manufactured, then an extreme close up showing nano-scale features." width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg 1886w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=768,250 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=680,221 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=1536,500 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metalenz-magnification.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>The result is a camera with extremely small proportions and vastly less complexity than the compact camera stacks found in consumer and industrial devices. To be clear, Metalenz isn&#8217;t looking to replace the main camera on your iPhone — for conventional photography purposes the conventional lens and sensor are still the way to go. But there are other applications that play to the chip-style lens&#8217;s strengths.</p>
<p>Something like the FaceID assembly, for instance, presents an opportunity. &#8220;That module is a very complex one for the cell phone world — it&#8217;s almost like a Rube Goldberg machine,&#8221; said Devlin. Likewise the miniature lidar sensor.</p>
<p>At this scale, the priorities are different, and by subtracting the lens from the equation the amount of light that reaches the sensor is significantly increased. That means it can potentially be smaller in every dimension while performing better <em>and</em> drawing less power.</p>

Beyond the vignetting it&#8217;s not really easy to tell what&#8217;s different, which is kind of the point.</p></div></p>
<p>Lest you think this is still a lab-bound &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if&#8221; type device, Metalenz is well on its way to commercial availability. The $10M round A they just raised was led by 3M Ventures, Applied Ventures LLC, Intel Capital, M Ventures and TDK Ventures, along with Tsingyuan Ventures and Braemar Energy Ventures — a lot of suppliers in there.</p>
<p>Unlike many other hardware startups, Metalenz isn&#8217;t starting with a short run of boutique demo devices but going big out of the gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we&#8217;re using traditional fabrication techniques, it allows us to scale really quickly. We&#8217;re not building factories or foundries, we don&#8217;t have to raise hundreds of mils; we can use whats already there,&#8221; said Devlin. &#8220;But it means we have to look at applications that are high volume. We need the units to be in that tens of millions range for our foundry partners to see it making sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Devlin declined to get specific, he did say that their first partner is &#8220;active in 3D sensing&#8221; and that a consumer device, though not a phone, would be shipping with Metalenz cameras in early 2022 — and later in 2022 will see a phone-based solution shipping as well.</p>
<p>In other words, while Metalenz is indeed a startup just coming out of stealth and raising its A round&#8230; it already has shipments planned on the order of tens of millions. The $10M isn&#8217;t a bridge to commercial viability but short term cash to hire and cover up-front costs associated with such a serious endeavor. It&#8217;s doubtful anyone on that list of investors harbors any serious doubts on ROI.</p>
<p>The 3D sensing thing is Metalenz&#8217;s first major application, but the company is already working on others. The potential to reduce complex lab equipment to handheld electronics that can be fielded easily is one, and improving the benchtop versions of tools with more light-gathering ability or quicker operation is another.</p>
<p>Though a device you use may in a few years have a Metalenz component in it, it&#8217;s likely you won&#8217;t know — the phone manufacturer will probably take all the credit for the improved performance or slimmer form factor. Nevertheless, it may show up in teardowns and bills of material, at which point you&#8217;ll know this particular university spin-out has made it to the big leagues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The early-stage carbon offset API developer, <a href="https://www.usepatch.com/">Patch</a>, could be another one of Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s early bets on climate tech.</p>
<p>According to several people with knowledge of the investment round, former OpenTable chief executive and current Andreessen Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan is looking at leading the young company&#8217;s latest financing.</p>
<p>Such an investment would be a win for Patch, which could benefit from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s marketing muscle in a space that&#8217;s becoming increasingly crowded. And, if the deal goes through, it could be an indicator of more to come from one of the venture industry&#8217;s most (socially) active investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://pachama.com/">Pachama</a>, <a href="https://www.cloverly.com/">Cloverly</a>, <a href="https://www.carboninterface.com/">Carbon Interface</a>, and <a href="http://cooler.dev/">Cooler.dev</a> all have similar API offerings, but the market for these types of services will likely expand as more companies try to do the least amount of work possible to become carbon neutral through offsetting. A growing market could generate space for more than one venture-backed winner.</p>
<p>Neither Patch&#8217;s co-founders nor Andreessen Horowitz responded to a request for comment about the funding.</p>
<p>One concern with services like Patch is that its customers will look at offsetting as their final destination instead of a step on the road to removing carbon emissions from business operations. To fix our climate crisis will take more work.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/bspellacy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brennan Spellacy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-grunfeld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aaron Grunfeld, </a>two former employees at the apartment rental service Sonder, Patch raised its initial financing from <a href="https://versionone.vc/announcing-patch/">VersionOne Ventures</a> back in September.</p>
<p>Around 15 to twenty companies that are using the service now, according to people familiar with the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The company has an API that can calculate a company&#8217;s emissions footprint based on an integration with their ERP system and then invests money into offset projects that are designed to remove an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>While services like Pachama privilege lower-cost sequestration solutions like reforestation and forest management, Patch offers an array of potential investment opportunities for offsets. And the company tries to nudge its customers to some of the more expensive, high technology options in an effort to bring down costs for emerging technologies, said one person familiar with the company&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>Like other services automating offsetting, Patch evaluates projects based on their additionality (how much additional carbon they&#8217;re removing over an already established baseline), permanence (how long the carbon emissions will be sequestered) and verifiability.</p>
<p>And, as the company&#8217;s founders note in their own statement about the company&#8217;s service, it&#8217;s not intended to be the only solution that customers deploy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a class="dn jq" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f" rel="noopener nofollow">majority of climate models</a> indicate that we need to reduce our emissions globally, while <em class="ks">also</em> removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,&#8221; the founders wrote in a Medium post. &#8220;We take care of a company’s carbon removal goals, while they focus their efforts on reducing emissions, a more proprietary task that requires intimate operational knowledge. Patch complements this behavioral shift and gives us a real chance to mitigate climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>VersionOne&#8217;s Angela Tran addressed any concerns about the defensibility of Patch&#8217;s technology in her own September announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also believe that defensibility comes with the aggregation and “digitization” of quality supply. When we view Patch as a marketplace, we believe that businesses (demand) care about the type of projects (supply) they purchase to neutralize their emissions,&#8221; Tran wrote. &#8220;For example, a company might choose their sustainability legacy to be linked with forestry or mineralization projects. Patch is partnering with the best carbon removal developers and the latest negative emission technologies to build a network of low-cost, impactful projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Patch is explicitly focused on climate change, Andreessen has made a few early investments in a broad sustainability thesis. The firm led a $9 million investment into <a href="https://usesilo.com/info">Silo</a> last year and backed <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/bill-gates-backed-breakthrough-energy-ventures-backs-cobalt-hunters-kobold-metals/">KoBold Metals back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Silo has developed an enterprise resource planning tool for perishable food supply chains. Currently focused on wholesale produce, Silo said in a statement last year that it would be extending its services to meat, dairy and pantry items over the next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">“The market potential for an innovator like Silo to reduce waste and improve margins is enormous and we’re excited to support its efforts as the system of record for food distribution in the United States,” said Anish Acharya, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement at the time. “Silo is well-positioned to scale beyond the west coast to help more customers modernize and transition their operations from pen and paper to software.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, KoBold is a software developer that uses machine learning and big data processing technologies to find new prospects for the precious metals that companies need to make new batteries and renewable energy generation technologies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;By building a <em>digital </em>prospecting engine — full stack, from scratch — using computer vision, machine learning, and sophisticated data analysis not currently available to the industry, KoBold’s software combines previously unavailable, dark data with conventional geochemical, geophysical, and geological data to identify prospects in models that can only get better over time, as with other data network effects,&#8221; wrote Connie Chan in a blog post at the time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Taken together, these investments coalesce into a picture of how Andreessen Horowitz and its pool of $16.5 billion in assets under management may approach the renewables industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced the launch of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee">Apigee X</a>, the next major release of the Apgiee API management platform it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/google-will-acquire-apigee-for-625-million/">acquired</a> back in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at what&#8217;s happening &#8212; especially after the pandemic started in March last year &#8212; the volume of digital activities has gone up in every kind of industry, all kinds of use cases are coming up. And one of the things we see is the need for a really high-performance, reliable, global digital transformation platform,&#8221; Amit Zavery, Google Cloud&#8217;s head of platform, told me.</p>
<p>He noted that the number of API calls has gone up 47 percent from last year and that the platform now handles about 2.2 trillion API calls per year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the core of the updates are deeper integrations with Google Cloud&#8217;s AI, security and networking tools. In practice, this means Apigee users can now deploy their APIs across 24 Google Cloud regions, for example, and use Google&#8217;s caching services in more than 100 edge locations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108876" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108876" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png 1758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=1536,838 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-04-083122.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108876" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Apigee X now integrates with Google&#8217;s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Cloud Armor</a> firewall and its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam#:~:text=Cloud%20Identity%20and%20Access%20Management%20(IAM)%20lets%20administrators%20authorize%20who,manage%20Google%20Cloud%20resources%20centrally.">Cloud Identity Access Management</a> platform. This also means that Apigee users won&#8217;t have to use third-party tools for their firewall and identity management needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do a lot of AI/ML-based anomaly detection and operations management,&#8221; Zavery explained. &#8220;We can predict any kind of malicious intent or any other things which might happen to those API calls or your traffic by embedding a lot of those insights into our API platform. I think [that] is a big improvement, as well as new features, especially in operations management, security management, vulnerability management and making those a core capability so that as a business, you don&#8217;t have to worry about all these things. It comes with the core capabilities and that is really where the front doors of digital front-ends can shine and customers can focus on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform now also makes better use of Google&#8217;s AI capabilities to help users identify anomalies or predict traffic for peak seasons. The idea here is to help customers automate a lot of the standards automation tasks and, of course, improve security at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZ6DYaSZ4WI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>As Zavery stressed, API management is now about more than just managing traffic between applications. But more than just helping customers manage their digital transformation projects, the Apigee team is now thinking about what it calls &#8216;digital excellence.&#8217; &#8220;That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re thinking of the journey for customers moving from not just &#8216;hey, I can have a front end,&#8217; but what about all the excellent things you want to do and how we can do that,&#8221; Zavery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;During these uncertain times, organizations worldwide are doubling-down on their <span class="il">API</span> strategies to operate anywhere, automate processes, and deliver new digital experiences quickly and securely,&#8221; said James Fairweather, Chief Innovation Officer at Pitney Bowes. &#8220;By powering APIs with new capabilities like reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Cloud Armor (WAF), and Cloud CDN, <span class="il">Apigee</span> X makes it easy for enterprises like us to scale digital initiatives, and deliver innovative experiences to our customers, employees and partners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Axios<a href="https://www.axios.com/hubspot-acquisition-the-hustle-0e1743eb-d29c-4caf-a419-7fd2584b1307.html"> broke the news</a> of the deal and reported that it values the startup at around $27 million. HubSpot declined to comment on the deal price, and while tweeting about the acquisition, The Hustle CEO Sam Parr <a href="https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1357099443141632002">wrote</a>, &#8220;Early in my career I was transparent with money. But I didn’t like the result of sharing that stuff. So we’re not disclosing the price and HubSpot has agreed. I&#8217;m taking it to the grave!&#8221;</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ir.hubspot.com/news/hubspot-signs-agreement-to-acquire-the-hustle-adding-content-to-help-scaling-companies-grow-better">press release</a> about the acquisition, HubSpot noted that customers are finding its products through content like its YouTube videos and HubSpot Academy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By acquiring The Hustle, we&#8217;ll be able to better meet the needs of these scaling companies by delivering educational, business, and tech trend content in their preferred formats,&#8221; said HubSpot&#8217;s senior vice president of marketing Kieran Flanagan in a statement. &#8220;Sam and his team have a proven ability to create content that entrepreneurs, startups, and scaling companies are deeply passionate about, and I&#8217;m excited to bring them on board to take that work to the next level.”</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BUYERS</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had lots of media co&#39;s try to buy us. We said no. Most ad 1st media companies are dying. And I don’t want to join a sinking, clickbait ship. </p>
<p>I always thought a b2b SAAS biz should buy us. But never thought they&#39;d be bold enough to try.</p>
<p>But HubSpot came along.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>HubSpot says The Hustle&#8217;s flagship newsletter has 1.5 million subscribers. It also has a subscription offering called Trends and a podcast called My First Million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to build the largest business content network in the world,&#8221; Parr <a href="https://twitter.com/theSamParr/status/1357099452037758976">tweeted</a>. &#8220;Soon, we’ll expand to a variety of mediums on a bunch of different topics and will have really innovative products coming out.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the U.S., we take for granted the ability to invest and trade in the stock market. So while we can get in an uproar about the various ways Robinhood may or may not be acting responsibly, it can be easy to forget that not everyone in the world has the same access to potentially making &#8212; or losing &#8212; money via trading as we do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mexico City-born Sergio Jiménez Amozurrutia, the fact that in his country of more than 120 million people, only a </span><a href="https://www.cnbv.gob.mx/SECTORES-SUPERVISADOS/BURS%C3%81TIL/Boletines-de-Prensa/Prensa%20%20Casas%20de%20Bolsa/Comunicado%20de%20Prensa%20078%20CB%20junio%202020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tiny fraction </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the population have the ability to invest in the capital markets just didn’t seem right. To him, the lack of widespread participation in investing is an example of the rich getting richer as part of an infrastructure “that is built for the wealthy.” The result of the imbalance is that a lot of people are locked out of making potentially wealth-building investments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So after selling Easy Credit, a consumer lending platform he’d built with Rick Rafael Bueno (whom he met in 2015 at a hackathon at Tech de Monterrey), Amozurrutia set out to give Mexicans access to something he believed they’d never had access to: an app-based consumer trading platform.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That platform, called <a href="https://miflink.com">Flink</a>, attracted the attention of Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Accel, which just led a $12 million Series A for the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexico’s ALLVP, Clocktower, Kevin Efrusy and Oskar Hjertonsson and existing backer Raptor Financial Group participated in the financing as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for what Flink has to offer is clear. Since launching its first brokerage product in July of 2020, Flink has surpassed 1 million users and 800,000 active brokerage accounts. This makes Flink the largest retail brokerage service in Mexico, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It averages 6,000 new customers a day, mostly due to word of mouth, the company said. And, the app was recently ranked in the top 10 of all apps downloaded in Mexico via Google Play, surpassing Spotify and Facebook app downloads, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most legacy Mexican banks cater to less than 1% of the population — meaning most Mexicans don’t have a bank account, let alone a brokerage account,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “At Flink, we’re guided by the belief that Mexico’s financial system should work for everyone — not only a select few.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Latin Americans are underbanked is not new news. In Mexico in particular, there are far fewer banks than the thousands the U.S. is home to. Those banks, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes, make it challenging for most people to make investments by charging high fees, among other barriers to entry, such as large minimum deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, here in Mexico, the population is not that sophisticated like in the U.S. in terms of investing in the markets,” he told TechCrunch. “The banks and incumbents take advantage of that and make people feel like they’re not smart enough to manage their money. They say, ‘Give me your money and I’ll invest it and charge you fees.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink is out to not only give Mexicans a way to invest, but to help educate them as well. Ninety percent of its users are first-time investors, and many are millennials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you compare this kind of product with Robinhood or Acorns for example, the difference with us is that we need to be even more responsible with the kind of information and access we are trying to provide,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. “We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to educate on a basic level.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108474" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108474" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2108474 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="356" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=1536,804 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=2048,1072 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mock2.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108474" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Flink</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink has also built a community around the product so that people can share ideas and try to help each other, including a Facebook group made up of more than 35,000 people.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Accel partner Andrew Braccia (who was also an early investor in Slack), the most interesting thing about Flink is that in many ways it is “creating a market,” rather than building an offering in an already large and sophisticated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A high percentage of customers are a younger demographic that has never invested before, and never had the tools or opportunity to use a product like Flink,” Braccia said. “It’s a responsibility we take very seriously so we’re trying to make sure there’s a tremendous amount of education and transparency in the process.”</span></p>
<p>He also believes Flink&#8217;s story and the larger opportunity of what&#8217;s happening in Mexico &#8220;is one centered around accessibility and hope.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Flink’s product is not only coming from Mexico, but from other Latin American countries such as Colombia, Chile, Peru and Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink can’t yet enter those markets due to regulatory constraints, but getting licenses to do business in Latin American countries is something the company plans to use some of its new capital to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you try to understand the deeper issues around financial services in Latin America,” Amozurrutia said, “you will see the status quo is really similar.”</span></p>
<p>Accel&#8217;s Braccia agrees.</p>
<p>Flink, he believes, has already created a level playing field for those who want to participate in investing in Mexico.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the vast majority of their users are first-time participants in the stock market speaks to the significance of their vision of financial accessibility—a vision that we believe will continue to resonate with other markets throughout Latin America,&#8221; Braccia told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flink also plans to use its funding in part to continue improving the user experience and product offering, as well as to add to its current headcount of 60 to be able to meet rising demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to get to 4 million users by the end of 2021,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amozurrutia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, backing Flink fits into Accel&#8217;s overall investment thesis. The firm has also put money in other fintechs globally, such as France’s Lydia, London-based Monzo and WorldRemit, Galileo and Braintree/Venmo, among others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is introducing features that will allow users to take vital health measurements using just the camera they already have on their smartphone, expanding health and fitness features typically only available on dedicated wearables to a whole new group of people. Beginning next month, and available initially on Google Pixel phones exclusively (but with plans to offer it for other Android devices in future), users will be able to measure both their heart rate and their respiratory rate using just their device&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>Typically, taking these measurements has required specialized hardware, including red or green light-based heart rate monitors like those found on the Apple Watch or on fitness trackers like those made by Google-acquired Fitbit. Google&#8217;s hardware and software teams, including the Google Health unit led by Director of Health Technologies Schwetak Patel, have managed to develop computer vision-based methods for taking these measurements using only smartphone cameras, which it says can produce results that are comparable to clinical-grade measurement hardware (it has produced a study to validate these results, which it&#8217;s making available in pre-print format while it seeks peer review through an academic journal).</p>
<p>For respiratory rate, the technology relies on a technique known as &#8216;optical flow,&#8217; which monitors movements in a person&#8217;s chest as they breathe and uses that to determine their breathing rate. In its clinical validation study, which covered both typical individuals in good health, and people with existing respiratory conditions, Google&#8217;s data indicates that it&#8217;s accurate to within 1 breath per minute across all participants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For heart rate, Google is initially using the camera to detect &#8220;subtle color changes&#8221; in a user&#8217;s finger tip, which provide an indicator about when oxygenated blood flows from your heart through to the rest of your body. The company&#8217;s validation data (again, still subject to external review) has shown accuracy within 2% margin of error, on average, across people with a range of different skin types. Google is also working on making this same technology work using color changes in a person&#8217;s face, it says, though that work is still in the exploratory phase.</p>
<p>Google is going to make these measurement features available to users within the next month, it says, via the Google Fit app, and initially on currently available Pixel devices made by the company itself. The plan is then to expand the features to different Android devices running Android 6 or later, sometime &#8220;in the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108839" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108839" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Google-Fit_measuring-heart-rate.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="835" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;My team has been working on ways that we can unlock the potential of everyday smart devices,&#8221; Patel said in a press briefing regarding the new features. This would include smart devices in the home, or a mobile phone, and how we leverage the sensors that are starting to become more and more ubiquitous within those devices, to support health and wellness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patel, who is also a computer science professor at the University of Washington and who has been recognized with an ACM Prize in Computing Award for his work in digital health, said that the availability of powerful sensors in ubiquitous consumer devices, combined with advances in AI, have meant that daily health monitoring can be much more accessible than ever before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think that&#8217;s going to be a really important area moving forward given that if you think about health care, the journey just doesn&#8217;t end at the hospital, the four walls of the hospital,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really this continuous journey, as you&#8217;re living your daily life, and being able to give you feedback and be able to measure your general wellness is an important thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google is explicit about these features being intended for use in a person&#8217;s own tracking of their general wellbeing – meaning it&#8217;s not meant as a diagnostic or medical tool. That&#8217;s pretty standard for these kinds of features, since few of these companies want to take of the task of getting full FDA medical-grade device certification for tools that are meant for general consumer use. To that end, Google Fit also doesn&#8217;t provide any guidance or advise based on the results of these measurements; instead, the app provides a general disclaimer that the results aren&#8217;t intended for medical use, and also offers up some very high-level description of why you&#8217;d even want to track these stats at all.</p>
<p>Many of the existing dedicated wellness and health tracking products on the market, like the Oura ring, for instance, provide more guidance and actionable insight based on the measurements it takes. Google seems intent on steering well clear of that line with these features, instead leaving the use of this information fully within the hands of users. That said, it could be a valuable resource to share with your physician, particularly if you&#8217;re concerned about potential health issues already, in place of other less convenient and available continuous health monitoring.</p>
<p>Patek said that Google is interested in potentially exploring how sensor fusion could further enhance tracking capabilities on existing devices, and in response to a question about potentially offering this on iPhones, he said that while the focus is currently on Android, they ultimate goal is indeed to get it &#8220;to as many people as possible.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">launched less than a year ago</a> by Blackboard co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasen">Michael Chasen</a>, integrates exclusively with Zoom to offer a more customized classroom for students and teachers alike. The inaugural product, Class for Zoom, uses both management and instruction tools to bolster the video conferencing call experience.</p>
<p>Formerly named ClassEDU, the startup announced today that it has added $30 million to its balance sheet, upping its total funding secured to $46 million. Raising that much pre-launch gives the startup key wiggle room, but it also gives validation: a number of Zoom’s earliest investors, including Emergence Capital and Bill Tai, who wrote the first check into Zoom, have put money into Class.</p>
<p>The money will be used to grow Class’ 60-person team to 100, as well as meet international demand for its product. More than 6,000 institutions from the United States, Dubai, Japan and Europe are on Class’ waitlist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On the instruction side, Class for Zoom helps teachers launch live assignments, quizzes and tests, which can be completed by students in real time. On the management side, tools range from attendance trackers to features that allow a teacher to see how much time a student is participating in activities. Currently, ClassEDU is in a private, paid beta with more than 60 customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108367" style="width: 1014px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108367" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png" alt="" width="1004" height="691" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png 1004w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=768,529 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=680,468 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Class-for-Zoom-Attendance-.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Class</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, Class software is only usable on Macs, but its beta will be available on iPhone, Windows and Android in the near future. The public launch is at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The startup is built entirely atop the Zoom platform, but functions as a standalone business versus a third-party integration, like what one would find on Zoom apps. Class is using the Zoom SDK, which is free, to use its back-end audio and video capabilities but build front-end interface and experience. Like any early-stage startup that relies on another business to work, the platform risk is notable.</p>
<p>At the same time, the risk comes with reward: Zoom is a household name, which helps Class reduce significant friction when selling to schools, says Chasen. Instead of a school having to replace the technology they have been using for the last year, Chasen says that Class can simply make it better.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going for the broader, larger deployments that just need to know that they have the stability and the scalability of Zoom, with just teaching learning tools built on top of that,” Chasen said. Over 125,000 schools use Zoom already, he said, which is enough to build a big business. The startup has no current plans to integrate with Teams or WebEx.</p>
<p>The startup sees the changing tide in edtech boiling down to a difference in sales, similar to Udemy’s new president’s sentiment with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/udemys-new-president-discusses-the-reskilling-companys-future/"> enterprise sales earlier this week.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>“At Blackboard, we had a six to nine month sales cycle, we’d have to explain that e-learning is a thing,” Chasen said, who was at the LMS business for 15 years. “[With Class] we don’t even have to pitch. It wraps up in a month, and our sales cycle is just showing people the product.</p>
<p>The big hurdle for Class, and any startup selling e-learning solutions to institutions, is post-pandemic utility. While institutions have traditionally been slow to adopt software due to red tape, Chasen says that both of Class’ customers, higher ed and K-12, are actively allocating budget for these tools. The price for Class ranges between $10,000 to $65,000 annually depending on the number of students in the classes.</p>
<p>“We have not run into a budgeting problem in a single school,” he said. “Higher ed has already been taking this step towards online learning, and they&#8217;re now taking the next step, whereas K-12, this is the first step they’re taking.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric bike sales boomed in 2020, a phenomenon driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it delivered consumers&#8217; daily lives.</p>
<p>Now, Rad Power Bikes is reaping those rewards and using them to double its workforce and scale globally.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based startup said Thursday it has raised $150 million from institutional investors including Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Counterpoint Global Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, TPG&#8217;s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round — the largest of a U.S. electric bike startup — is a validation of Rad Power&#8217;s business model and its ability to expand beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019. Rad Power Bikes declined to disclose its 2020 sales numbers.</p>
<p>Rad Power is a direct-to-consumer electric bike seller known for creating robust products that combine features like fat tires, big batteries and motors with touchscreens and even cargo carrying capacity — all at prices hundreds of dollars below its competitors.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2007, initially was a low-volume custom bike builder. That changed in 2015, after Rad Power founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh teamed up with friend Ty Collins and relaunched as a direct-to-consumer business. That year, they funded the RadRover Electric Fat Tire bike through an Indigogo campaign. The company has evolved into a large-volume seller and today has 11 different bikes in its portfolio, which are sold in 30 countries.</p>
<p>Rad Power has added more than just bikes. The company has built out its online sales platform, pre- and post-purchase customer support teams, retail showrooms, service van and a local service partner network. The company has always been profitable even as it has expanded, Radenbaugh said.</p>
<p>The company has largely been bootstrapped, although it did raise a private round of a few million dollars in 2009 and a $20 million injection of capital in 2020. To date, Rad Power has raised $175 million — the vast majority of which came in this new round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt this was a special opportunity because we&#8217;re able to accelerate investments into a bunch of areas of the business where we&#8217;ve already been experimenting for years and that we found work,&#8221; Radenbaugh said.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to scale in just about every sector of its business, Radenbaugh said. Rad Power employs 325 people today and Radenbaugh said they plan to double the team by the end of 2021. The company also plans to add more retail showrooms and service locations, continue to add more contract manufacturers in an aim to diversify its supply chain, and add more accessories so consumers and customize their bikes.</p>
<p>The team that will grow the fastest is Rad Power&#8217;s research and development department, which is currently at about 35 people, Radenbaugh added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The core strategy is to continue to develop new vehicle categories,&#8221; Radenbaugh  said. &#8220;So while we&#8217;ll still be an  ebike company — and we&#8217;re always going to have pedals and it&#8217;s always going to have that type of experience — we will continue to create stuff that really blurs the lines between ebikes and scooters and mopeds and even the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mountaintop, a sort of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/">supergroup game development studio</a> founded by veterans from a multitude of other major companies in the industry, has collected a $5.5 seed round from friends and family, and announced that their first title will be a PvP shooter.</p>
<p>The company emerged last summer, headed by Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell and several others from larger gaming concerns that decided to strike off on their own. The idea would be to create an independent studio free from the pervasive culture of crunch and toxicity frequently found (or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-21/ubisoft-sexual-misconduct-scandal-harassment-sexism-and-abuse">reported</a>) at bigger publishers and developers.</p>
<p>Being independent also means no allowance from a big publisher, so they needed to get some capital to work with. That manifested from the enviably deep pockets of their families and friends, who I suppose felt more than justified in funding the activities of people whom they know to be successful entrepreneurs and industry movers and shakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $5.5 million seed will go towards their first title, which will be a PvP shooter. Now, this may give some pause, as PvP shooters number among the last five years&#8217; biggest successes (Overwatch, PUBG, Fortnite, Apex) and most notable failures (Crucible, Battleborn, Paragon, Gigantic) — the latter seemingly in fruitless attempts to emulate the former.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4wRNQ4ExDp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/">Oculus co-founder and games industry vets form Mountaintop Studios</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Oculus co-founder and games industry vets form Mountaintop Studios&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/oculus-co-founder-and-games-industry-vets-form-mountaintop-studios/embed/#?secret=4wRNQ4ExDp" data-secret="4wRNQ4ExDp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But the opportunistic corporate me-too attitude that sunk many a game is unlikely to exist at Mountaintop, a small team with no shareholders breathing down their neck — except their friends and family, who will be too polite to do so. If they think they can make an interesting and commercially viable PvP shooter, I say have at it, I&#8217;m tired of the other ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be nice to know that the product came from a crunch-free environment as well — as we&#8217;ve seen with Supergiant&#8217;s &#8220;Hades,&#8221; people working on their own schedules to make something they care about can have remarkable results.</p>
<p>As Mitchell put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all know great games and products can be built without crunch. It&#8217;s about thoughtful scoping, planning, execution every step of the way. That’s not to say that avoiding crunch is easy — it’s incredibly challenging, especially with unexpected curve balls along the way.</p>
<p>In the end though, it always comes down to leadership and the decisions they make. At Mountaintop, we&#8217;re committed to doing right by the team, always.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company has grown from the founding team of five now to 20. Although Mountaintop wasn&#8217;t intended from the start to be a pandemic-proof setup, its remote-first approach did mean that hiring during COVID didn&#8217;t mean changing how they planned for the company to work. Currently they have people from Epic, Blizzard, Naughty Dog, Respawn, Infinity Ward, Ubisoft, Raven, Turtle Rock, Double Fine, PopCap, and (obviously) Oculus.</p>
<p>But among the team&#8217;s other priorities were diversity and inclusion. With 19 of the 20 people on staff men, and 18 of the 20 white, that seems to be presenting more of a challenge to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just getting started, but we&#8217;re building a studio with diversity and inclusion at the core, where everyone feels like they belong. We have a long way to go, but we&#8217;re committed to seeing it through,&#8221; said Mitchell. With a target headcount of about 50, there&#8217;s a still a lot of room to grow into that promise.</p>
<p>No indication when we&#8217;ll learn more about the game, but at the current cadence we can probably expect another tidbit of info this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The cloud infrastructure market in 2020 reflected society itself, with the richest companies getting richer and the ones at the bottom of the market getting poorer. It grew to $129 billion for the year, according to <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-ends-2020-high-while-microsoft-continues-gain-ground-amazon">data from Synergy Research Group</a>. That&#8217;s up from around $97 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>Synergy also reported that the cloud infra market reached $37 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $33 billion in the third quarter, and 35% from a year ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard from every founder under the sun for the last 9 months that the pandemic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/the-accelerating-digital-transformation-redux/">accelerating digital transformation</a>, and that a big part of that was an expedited shift to the cloud. These numbers would seem to bear that out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As usual the big three were Amazon, Microsoft and Google, with Alibaba now firmly entrenched in fourth place and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/ibm-transformation-struggles-continue-with-cloud-and-ai-revenue-down-4-5/">IBM falling back to fifth</a>. But Microsoft grew more quickly than rival Amazon, reaching 20% market share at the end of 2020 for the first time. Keep in mind that the Redmond-based software giant has now doubled its share since 2017. That&#8217;s remarkably rapid rapid growth. Meanwhile Google and Alibaba took home 9% and 6% respectively.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what that all looks like in chart form:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108512" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108512" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?w=680" alt="Cloud infrastructure marketshare for fourth quarter 2020 from Synergy Research." width="680" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg 1127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CIS-Q420.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Synergy Research</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon is an interesting case in that it has plateaued at around 33% for four straight years of Synergy data, but because it&#8217;s one-third share of an increasingly growing market, that means that it has kept growing its public cloud revenues as the category itself has expanded.</p>
<p>Amazon closed out the year with $12.74 billion in Q4 AWS revenue, putting it on a run rate of over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">just over $50 billion</a> for the first time. That was up from $11.6 billion the prior quarter. While Microsoft&#8217;s numbers are always difficult to parse from its earning&#8217;s reports, doing the math of 20% of $37 billion, it came in with $7.4 billion up from $5.9 billion last quarter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I4pt2bhSIh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=I4pt2bhSIh" data-secret="I4pt2bhSIh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google brought in $3.3 billion, up from $2.98 billion in Q3 2020, and Alibaba pulled in $2.22 billion, up from $1.65 billion over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>John Dinsdale, principal analyst at Synergy says the leaders are pretty firmly entrenched at this point with huge absolute market numbers and also huge gaps between the cloud providers. &#8220;AWS has been a great success story for over ten years now and it remains in an extremely strong market position despite increasing competition from a broad swathe of strong IT industry companies. That is a great testament both to Amazon and to the AWS leadership team and you’d have to suspect that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">not change with the new regime</a>,&#8217; he told me.</p>
<p>He sees Microsoft as a worthy rival, but one that is bound to hit a growth wall at some point. &#8220;It is certainly feasible that Microsoft will continue to narrow the gap between itself and Amazon, but the bigger Microsoft Azure becomes the tougher it is to maintain really high growth rates. That is just the law of large numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market share at the bottom of the cloud infrastructure space continued to decline even while the number of dollars at stake have continued to expand dramatically. &#8220;The market share losers have been the large group of smaller cloud providers, who collectively have lost 13 percentage points of market share over the last 16 quarters,&#8221; Synergy wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Dinsdale says all is not lost for these players, however. &#8220;Regarding the smaller players (or the big companies that have only a small market share), they can either focus on specific market niches (can be based around geography, service type or customer vertical) or they can try to offer a broad range of cloud services to a broad range of customers. Companies doing the former can do quite well, while companies doing the latter will find it extremely tough,&#8221; Dinsdale told me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-cloud-market-q4-2020">Canalys has slightly different numbers</a> with a total market of around $142 billion and almost $40 billion for the quarter, but the percentages are in line with Synergy&#8217;s:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108514" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108514" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2108514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Canalys 4th quarter 2021 cloud infrastructure market share percentages" width="680" height="644" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=300,284 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=768,727 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=680,644 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-5.35.58-PM.jpg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2108514" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>At some point the numbers get so big they almost cease to have meaning, but as large as the public cloud revenue numbers become, they remain a relatively small percentage of overall worldwide IT spend. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-20-gartner-says-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-4-percent-in-2021">According to Gartner estimates</a>, worldwide IT spend in 2020 was $3.6 trillion (with a T). That means that the cloud infrastructure market accounted for just 3.85% of total spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Think about that for a moment: less than 4% of IT spend currently is on cloud infrastructure, leaving so much room for growth and for those billions to grow ever bigger in the coming years.</p>
<p>It would certainly make it more interesting if someone could come in and disrupt the leaders, but for now at least they are going to be hard to push out of the way unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens to the way we think about computing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies gather more data, ensuring that they can trust the quality of that data is becoming increasingly important. An analytics pipeline is only as good as the data it collects, after all, and messy data &#8212; or outright bugs &#8212; can easily lead to issues further down the line.</p>
<p>Seattle-based <a href="https://iterative.ly/">Iteratively</a> wants to help businesses build data pipelines they can trust. The company today announced a $5.4 million seed funding round led by Google&#8217;s AI-centric Gradient Ventures fund. Fika Ventures and early Iteratively investor PSL Ventures also participated, with Gradient Ventures partner Zach Bratun-Glennon joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Patrick Thompson, <span class="il">Iteratively</span>’s Co-founder and CEO, started working on Iteratively about two years ago. Before that, he worked at Atlassian and at Syncplicity, where he met his co-founder Ondrej Hrebicek. After getting started, the team spent six months doing customer discovery and the theme they picked up on was that companies weren&#8217;t trusting the data they captured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We interviewed a ton of companies who built internal solutions, trying to solve this particular problem. We actually built one at Atlassian, as well, so I was very much intimately familiar with this pain. And so we decided to bring a product to market that really helps alleviate the pain,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108591" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108591" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/product-image-feature.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108591" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Iteratively</p></div></p>
<p>In a lot of companies, the data producers and data consumers don&#8217;t really talk to each other &#8212; and if they do, it&#8217;s often only through a spreadsheet or wiki. Iteratively aims to provide a collaborative environment to bring these different groups together and create a single source of truth for all stakeholders. &#8220;Typically, there&#8217;s a handoff process, either on a JIRA ticket or a Confluence page or spreadsheet, where they try to hand over these requirements &#8212; and generally, it&#8217;s never really implemented correctly, which then causes a lot of pain points down down the line,&#8221; Thompson explained.</p>
<p>Currently, Iteratively focuses on event streaming data for product and marketing analytics &#8212; the kind of data that typically flows into a Mixpanel, Amplitude or Segment. Iteratively itself sits at the origin of the data, say an app, and then validates the data and routes it to whatever third-party solution a company may use. That means the tool sits right where the data is generated, but this setup also means that none of the data ever flows through Iteratively&#8217;s own servers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108592" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108592" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2108592" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="49" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=150,25 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=300,49 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=768,126 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=680,112 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/iteratively-logo.png?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108592" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Iteratively</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t actually see the data,&#8221; Thompson stressed. &#8220;We&#8217;re not a data set processor. We&#8217;re a wrapper over the top of your own analytics pipeline or your own third party SaaS tools, but we verify the payloads as they flow through our SDK on the client.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over time, though, that may change, he acknowledged and Iteratively may do some data processing as well, but likely with a focus on metadata and observability.</p>
<p>Since the company doesn&#8217;t actually process any of the data itself, it&#8217;s <a href="https://iterative.ly/pricing">charging customers by seat</a> and not based on how many events move through their pipelines, for example. That may obviously change over time as the company looks into doing some data processing on its side as well.</p>
<p>Currently, Iteratively has about 10 employees and plans to grow that to 20 by the end of the year. The company plans to hire across R&amp;D, sales and marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Iteratively</span>&#8216;s software has a unique approach to enabling company-wide collaboration and enforcing data quality,&#8221; said Gradient&#8217;s Bratun-Glennon. &#8220;Going forward, we believe that intelligent analytics and data-driven business decision making will differentiate successful companies and best-in-class products. <span class="il">Iteratively</span>&#8216;s mission, product and team are poised to give each of their customers these capabilities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The commercialization of space isn&#8217;t just about what new sensors we can put into orbit on cheaper and smaller satellites – it&#8217;s also about studying and leverage the advantages of a microgravity environment on manufacturing and production. European startup Space Cargo Unlimited is focused on turning microgravity benefits into viable commercial ventures on Earth, and it just announced it will be working with global vine nursery company Mercier on applying the benefits of space to create more hardy wine grape vines.</p>
<p>Space Cargo Unlimited has already done some work on how microgravity can impact wine – it shipped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/">crate of red wine to the International Space Station in 2019</a>, and then returned it to Earth last year after a full 12 months aging aboard the station in near zero-G. Now, the startup has formed a subsidiary dedicated to in-space biotech specifically, Space Biology Unlimited, and it&#8217;s going to be the one working with Mercier on figuring out how to grow new grape vine varietals that are more resistant to changes in the climates in which they grown.</p>
<p>In addition to the case of Bordeaux that Space Cargo Unlimited sent up, the company also sent 320 vine canes (basically the core structure of a vine that results from the maturation of the juvenile shoot), and it just recently received those back on SpaceX&#8217;s cargo dragon return trip from the ISS. Those canes, half from Cabernet grapes, and half from Cabernet Sauvignon, have shown &#8220;unprecedented biological changes&#8221; according to Mercier CEO Guillaume Mercier in a statement. They&#8217;ll now be cloned and studied to see if they provide any advantages in terms of potential for growth on &#8220;our fast-warming planet,&#8221; he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Arb69JkeV9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/">A startup just launched red wine to the International Space Station to age for 12 months</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A startup just launched red wine to the International Space Station to age for 12 months&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/a-startup-just-launched-red-wine-to-the-international-space-station-to-age-for-12-months/embed/#?secret=Arb69JkeV9" data-secret="Arb69JkeV9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Everything from battery production, to additive manufacturing, to basic chemical and medical manufacturing has been tested in a microgravity environment. Microgravity can reduce the physical strain of gravity, most obviously, to make production of complex structures possible where it wouldn&#8217;t be on Earth. The unique environment, which also includes a much different radiation profile, also leads to unexpected variances in the growth and development of organic structures that, while they don&#8217;t occur naturally on Earth, can sometimes be replicated to achieve useful outcomes.</p>
<p>The effects of microgravity have been studied using the ISS for years, but more affordable and frequent access to space has made it a much more promising commercial avenue for many companies and startups that previously wouldn&#8217;t have been able to justify the associated costs or timeframes around the work. Space Cargo Unlimited is one of the companies that looks well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, two giants of the cannabis industry are announcing a partnership to create an improved retail experience for consumers and dispensaries alike. Through this partnership, <a href="https://www.leafly.com">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://www.iheartjane.com">Jane&#8217;s</a> technology solutions will offer dispensaries powerful tools to sync online e-commerce with in-store inventory &#8212; something that is sorely lacking in the cannabis world.</p>
<p>Legal weed shoppers know the pain. A handful of different apps report to show the inventory of local dispensaries and yet, the online menus often do not line up with the store&#8217;s real-time inventory. What&#8217;s more, sometimes other dispensaries have different ways of listing the same product. There&#8217;s a good reason for the dispensaries: there&#8217;s not an industry standard UPC barcode and the dispensaries often have hundreds of fast-moving SKUs from dozens of vendors.</p>
<p>Leafly and Jane&#8217;s partnership seeks to solve the pain on both sides of the counter. Jane&#8217;s technology enables dispensaries to build a modern e-commerce platform through automation and machine learning. Jane&#8217;s technology will soon be built into Leafly&#8217;s Menu Solutions that works with over 30 point-of-sale systems. This should result in less tedious work for the dispensaries and a much more consistent online experience for the shopper.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jane and Leafly have deep inroads into the cannabis world. According to this announcement&#8217;s press release, over the past year, Jane&#8217;s solution powered over 17 million orders and $2 billion in cannabis sales. Over 1,800 dispensaries and brands use Jane. Likewise, in 2020, more than 4,500 cannabis retailers used Leafly&#8217;s platform, and the company saw 120 million visitors to its online marketplace.</p>
<p>Despite the successes, Leafly experienced a turbulent 2020 with layoffs and leadership changes. Yoko Miyashita took over as the company&#8217;s CEO in August 2020 and has been focused on Leafly leaning heavily into building a better online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Right now, in early 2021, there isn&#8217;t an Amazon of weed or even a Shopify of weed for several reasons, but primarily because the cannabis industry is still under a federal prohibition. This solution pushes the cannabis industry closer to a modern e-commerce business. With Jane&#8217;s ability to standardize and auto-populate product listings, and Leafly&#8217;s deep point of sale integrations, both the consumer and dispensary sees benefits.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Leafly and Jane&#8217;s CEOs on this partnership. It&#8217;s clear that the two are excited about this project and see this partnership as a watershed moment for retail cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Dispensaries] don&#8217;t have a solution that can be seamless like a Shopify or Amazon,&#8221; Jane&#8217;s CEO Socrates Rosenfeldsaid. &#8220;I think, together with Jane&#8217;s ability to cleanse information in real-time, and essentially automate e-commerce for large brick and mortar selling sellers, combining that with Leafly&#8217;s consumer marketplace, we are making shopping for cannabis as simple as shopping on Amazon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosenfeld explained that he sees this partnership goes behind an Amazon-like shopping experience. He sees this as a way of returning value and protecting local dispensaries by empowering them with technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problems in cannabis are unique enough, and the plant has a complexity that we want to honor,&#8221; Leafly CEO Yoko Miyashita said. We don&#8217;t think we can get there with antiquated ways of doing things. It&#8217;s bringing the intentionality around shared values to innovate and ultimately empower the communities that we serve.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Identity and access management service Okta today launched its new design system, both for its own corporate and brand use, but also as an open-source project under the <a href="https://github.com/okta/odyssey">Apache 2.0 license</a>. The <a href="https://odyssey.okta.design/">Odyssey Design System</a>, as the company calls it, is similar to the likes of Google&#8217;s Material Design or Microsoft&#8217;s Fluent Design. It may not have quite the same number of features, but what makes it stand out is a focus on accessibility, with every element of the design system being compliant with the W3&#8217;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Brian Hansen, Okta&#8217;s SVP of Design, told me that until now, the company didn&#8217;t really have a unified design system. Instead, it had what he called a &#8220;glorified pattern library.&#8221; And while the engineers loved it, because it allowed them to build new UIs quickly, it was hard for the team to add new patterns. &#8220;And so it was limited in what it could do,&#8221; Hansen said. &#8220;And what you ended up having to do sometimes is compromise &#8212; particularly as a designer &#8212; and kind of shove the square peg into the round hole.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108572" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108572" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png" alt="" width="576" height="629" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=275,300 275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_BrandSystem.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Okta</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that Okta has moved beyond its early startup roots, though, the team decided that it was time to go back to the drawing board and build a more fully-featured design system for the company &#8212; and you may soon see it yourself in Okta&#8217;s sign-in widget, which is where most users are likely to encounter it. But it&#8217;s worth remembering that Okta, the platform, also offers a plethora of backend tools for admins that most users never see. Those admins typically want a very information-dense user experience and a design that makes it easy for them to get things done and move on. Okta&#8217;s third group of users, Hansen stressed, is developers and what matters a lot to them &#8212; in addition to all the technical details &#8212; is documentation, which has to be easily readable (from a design perspective).</p>
<p>As Hansen noted, though, internally, it wasn&#8217;t a realistic project to simply switch every surface area to Odyssey at once. &#8220;As a designer, you want everything to be perfect all at once. But you also have to be pragmatic and live with some things that aren&#8217;t perfect,&#8221; he acknowledged. So while the Okta brand is now getting this refresh and some of the user-facing services, it&#8217;ll take a while before every Okta service can make this move.</p>
<p>For the admin console, for example, Hansen&#8217;s team decided that it would take years to switch out the UI. So instead, the team opted for a bridge strategy where it created the style sheets to essentially mimic the Odyssey design. &#8220;Then we can cut over to Odyssey-native components and they&#8217;ll blend in. We can&#8217;t have a Franken app &#8212; we can&#8217;t have two different generations of UI coexisting. That to me just ruins trust. No one would be happy with that,&#8221; Hansen said.</p>
<p>Developers who want to give Odyssey a try for their own projects can do so and <a href="https://odyssey.okta.design/components/">explore the different components it has to offer</a>. And designers can <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/676870123940302956/project/2512934/Odyssey-UI">try it out in Figma</a>, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today launched Viva, a new &#8220;employee experience platform,&#8221; or, in non-marketing terms, its new take on the intranet sites most large companies tend to offer their employees. This includes standard features like access to internal communications built on integrations with SharePoint, Yammer and other Microsoft tools. In addition, Viva also offers access to team analytics and an integration with LinkedIn Learning and other training content providers (including the likes of SAP SuccessFactors), as well as what Microsoft calls Viva Topics for knowledge sharing within a company.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like most employees, you know that your company spends a lot of money on internal communications and its accompanying intranet offerings &#8212; and you then promptly ignore that in order to get actual work done. But Microsoft argues that times are changing, as remote work is here to stay for many companies, even after the pandemic (hopefully) ends. Even if a small percentage of a company&#8217;s workforce remains remote or opts for a hybrid approach, those workers still need to have access to the right tools and feel like they are part of the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2108356" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Learning-resources-in-Microsoft-Viva-Learning.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2108356" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2108356" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Learning-resources-in-Microsoft-Viva-Learning.gif" alt="" width="960" height="650" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2108356" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have participated in the largest at-scale remote work experiment the world has seen and it has had a dramatic impact on the employee experience,&#8221; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a pre-recorded video. &#8220;As the world recovers, there is no going back. Flexibility in when, where and how we work will be key.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argues that every organization will require a unified employee experience platform that supports workers from their onboarding process to collaborating with their colleagues and continuing their education within the company. Yet as employees work remotely, companies are now struggling to keep their internal culture and foster community among employees. Viva aims to fix this.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Viva is powered by Microsoft 365 and all of the tools that come with that, as well as integrations with Microsoft Teams, the company&#8217;s flagship collaboration service, and even Yammer, the employee communication tool it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/microsoft-completes-its-1-2b-yammer-acquisition/">acquired back in 2012</a> and continues to support.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aDLjVQZmno?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>There are several parts to Viva: Viva Connections for accessing company news, policies, benefits and internal communities (powered by Yammer); Viva Learning for, you guessed it, accessing learning resources; and Viva Topics, the service&#8217;s take on company-wide knowledge sharing. For the most part, that&#8217;s all standard fair in any modern intranet, whether it&#8217;s from a startup provider or an established player like Jive.</p>
<p>Viva Insights feels like the odd one out here, especially after Microsoft&#8217;s kerfuffle around <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/12/01/our-commitment-to-privacy-in-microsoft-productivity-score/">its Productivity Score</a>. The idea here is to give managers insights into whether their team (but not individual team members) are at risk of burnout, for example, in order to encourage them to turn off notifications or set daily priorities (a good manager, I&#8217;d hope, could do this without analytics, but here we are, in 2021). It&#8217;s also meant to help company leaders &#8220;address complex challenges and respond to change by shedding light on organizational work patterns and trends.&#8221; Sure.</p>

<p>Because this is Microsoft in 2021, there&#8217;s also a lot of talk about employee well-being in today&#8217;s announcement. For most employees, that means fewer meetings, more focus time and turning off notifications after work. Obviously there are technical tools to help with that, but it&#8217;s really a question of company culture and management. I&#8217;m not sure you need analytics integrated with LinkedIn&#8217;s Glint for that, but you can now have those, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the world of work changes, the next horizon of innovation will come from a focus on creativity, engagement and well-being so organizations can build cultures of resilience and ingenuity,&#8221; said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president, Microsoft 365. &#8220;Our vision is to deliver a platform for the employee experience that helps organizations create a thriving culture with engaged employees and inspiring leaders.&#8221;</p>
