										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic and shift to remote work that came with it, many people took advantage of their newfound flexibility to try living in different places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup poised to benefit from this is <a href="https://zeusliving.com/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=demand-1p-b2c-brand-national&amp;utm_adgroup=zeus&amp;utm_term=%2Bzeus%20%2Bliving&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaignid=405781600&amp;utm_adgroupid=1306220097757066&amp;msclkid=02607c1ac0ea1266b8081d7c3adfef49">Zeus Living</a>, which is focused on giving people “flexible living” options and has just raised $55 million in a round led by </span><a href="https://sig.com/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initialized Capital, CEAS Investments, TI Platform, NFX, Opendoor’s Eric Wu and Miras also participated in the financing, which brings the startup’s total raised to $125 million. The company declined to reveal its current valuation, but it was valued at $205 million at the time of its last raise in 2019.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeus Living started its life by redecorating landlords’ homes and renting the furnished properties primarily to relocated workers for 30-day stays (or longer) for a new type of corporate housing. Since then, it has broadened its focus and evolved into a company that gives people &#8212; not just corporate employees &#8212; more options to generally move around with less commitment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since our start, we provided &#8216;home&#8217; to people traveling for work, but also for grandparents spending extended time with newborn grandbabies, people seeking healthcare and families renovating their homes,” said CEO and co-founder Kulveer Taggar. “Over the past 18 months we&#8217;ve superseded corporate housing and are challenging the old, rigid rental market by offering beautifully designed homes outfitted at fair prices and flexible terms in places residents want to live.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;9 proptech investors talk co-living, home offices and other pandemic trends&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/9-proptech-investors-talk-co-living-home-offices-and-other-pandemic-trends/embed/#?secret=qc9hy069aH" data-secret="qc9hy069aH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a cool comeback story, considering that at the onset of the pandemic, Zeus Living made headlines for laying off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 80 people, or about 30% of the company. And the demand is there.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence of the pandemic and the resulting remote work shift, Zeus Living says it saw a “6x increase” in residents booking leases with no predetermined end date, for an average stay of 129 nights, over the last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, Taggar believes “there is a new American dream” that doesn’t involve buying a house as being a symbol of someone “making it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see now for this new generation, that goal or dream, doesn&#8217;t relate as much to buying a house,” he told TechCrunch. “They want to invest in experiences of possessions. They want to be more mobile. And they just want to do that without tons of headache and hassle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Zeus Living offered 2,400 homes on its site, partnering with homeowners to manage their properties and rent them out. Today, that has grown to nearly 5,000 homes in 96 U.S. cities such as Austin, Miami, Portland and Philadelphia. Occupancy is 87%, compared to 82% in 2020, while “revpar” (the revenue it achieves for the homeowners whose properties it manages) has increased 21% this year compared to last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, residents have spent over 1.4 million nights with Zeus, and 811,562 of those were during the pandemic. The company is approaching $250 million in lifetime booking revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since those March 2020 layoffs, the company has been able to hire back some of the people it was forced to lay off,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to Taggar. But it’s still operating somewhat lean comparatively speaking, with 122 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company emphasizes that unlike its investor Airbnb, it is not a marketplace and manages its homes &#8212; from curation to design to property management and service.  Airbnb is a channel for Zeus, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Zeus, Taggar said, users can browse the thousands of homes that it manages and pick the dates they want to stay there &#8212; whether it be five weeks or five months, all from their phone. Residents also don’t have to set up utilities or Wi-Fi. Zeus will take care of that, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can be flexible and leave with just two weeks’ notice,” he said. “And you can then trust that the experience is going to be good because Zeus has put in the hard work of curating the home in the first place. We&#8217;ve inspected it, and we know it&#8217;s safe, and then we will design it to make it comfortable for you to live in.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217534" style="width: 317px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217534" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2217534 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg?w=200" alt="Zeus Living" width="307" height="461" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Zeus-Living-Booking.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217534" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zeus Living</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Zeus was growing revenue 3-4x a year since it started in 2015, it hit a temporary speed bump when the pandemic started, according to Taggar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we’re getting back on that path,” he said.“ We’re making the rental experience very modern and turnkey. Even if the operations behind the scenes to make that all work are quite involved and complicated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to focus on growth and expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re supply constrained in all of our markets, so we want to go and get more homes,” Taggar told TechCrunch. “We also want to keep investing in, and improving, the online experience for our homeowners and residents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, he said, Zeus Living has had $40 million in unmet demand over the past 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know where people want to live and how much they’re willing to pay for flexible living,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garry Tan, founder and managing partner of Initialized Capital, is a repeat investor in Zeus Living, having led its seed and Series A rounds and invested in its Series B and C financings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Tan believes the world of property management is “stuck in the same place taxi companies were before ride-hailing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeus Living, he believes, has created something that is a bit of “set and forget” for property owners. At the same time, it’s helping meet a need for people seeing flexible living options in “the absolute best markets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going into this new phase where people don&#8217;t have to be in a handful of cities,” he told TechCrunch. “You can be anywhere in the country. And this new idea of FlexLiving is that it makes that possibility more accessible to everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes Zeus even more special, in Tan’s view, is its ability to find properties in desirable areas of town that usually only the people who live in a city know about, so the residents can “live like a local.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s actually much harder to get those locations, so it’s also much more profitable, because it&#8217;s also where customers want to be,” Tan said.</span></p>
<p>Of course, Zeus Living is not the only player in the flexible rental space. <a href="https://theguild.co/">The Guild</a>, an Austin, Texas-based startup that turns apartments into comfortable short-term accommodations for business and other travelers, last raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/the-guild-which-turns-apartments-into-short-term-rentals-has-nabbed-25-million-in-series-b-funding/">a $25 million Series B</a> in January of 2020. Last June, hospitality startup Sonder raised $170 million at a $1.3 billion valuation although it&#8217;s important to note that the company &#8212; which rents serviced apartments akin to boutique hotels &#8212; is more of a competitor to Airbnb.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Verizon-owned Visible, a budget cellular carrier owned by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/verizon/">Verizon,</a> has confirmed that hackers accessed and charged user accounts.</p>
<p>The incident, first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724592/visible-account-breach-cell-purchases-outside-sources-passwords">The Verge</a>, came to light earlier this week after Visible customers took to social media to report that their account had been hijacked. Some reported that their email address and password had been changed, and many said that unwanted charges had been made through their Visible accounts.</p>
<p>One customer wrote in the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/visible"> Visible subreddit</a> that their account was hacked and an iPhone bought with that user&#8217;s connected PayPal account. Another said they had three iPhones ordered within 24 hours in their name. &#8220;Each time a different shipping/billing address,&#8221; they said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Visible initially remained silent on the issue, the company on Wednesday <a href="https://twitter.com/Visible/status/1448322443085557772">confirmed on Twitter</a> that “threat actors were able to access username/passwords from outside sources, and exploit that information to log in to Visible accounts.&#8221; This, along with a follow-up tweet advising users not to re-use passwords across multiple accounts, suggests those affected were likely victims of a large-scale <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/credential-stuffing/">credential stuffing</a> attack, whereby stolen account credentials, typically consisting of lists of usernames and/or email addresses and corresponding passwords, are used to gain unauthorized access to accounts using automated login requests.</p>
<p>However, although this suggests that Visible itself wasn’t breached, many customers have highlighted the carrier’s lack of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) support, which may have prevented the hijacking of accounts.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has asked Visible whether it has plans to enable 2FA, but the company has yet to respond. The carrier has not yet said how many users are affected.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement given to The Verge, the company said: “Visible is aware of an issue in which some member accounts were accessed and/or charged without their authorization.

<p>Per <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Visible/comments/q7j7id/here_we_go/">the Visible subreddit</a>, the company has also told customers that, moving forward, “any purchases will require you to re-validate your payment information as an added security measure.” The company is also advising users to reset their passwords, particularly if it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s used for multiple services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK social audio startup <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wisdom-audio-community/id1576484544">Wisdom</a> has launched a new mentorship marketplace that&#8217;s described as a mix between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse</a> and the celebrity-focused courses platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/masterclass-just-raised-100-million-for-celebrity-fueled-content/">Masterclass</a>.</p>
<p>The app lets users log on to find conversations which they can join live (with the chance to ask questions) or listen back to on-demand (streamed talks are automatically saved to the profile of the talk giver).</p>
<p>The idea is for conversations to be centered around advice. But that advice can be on pretty much anything people want to hear about &#8212; from the get-go there&#8217;s a broad range of topics in play, from parenting and dating, to career and finance, mental health and wellbeing, fitness and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218004" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup says it&#8217;s built a &#8216;TikTok-style&#8217; algorithm to recommend talks to users based on topic hashtags and behavioral data-mining &#8212; factoring in things like what users are clicking on how much sustained engagement a talk is getting to try to help quality conversations rise to the top. (It also says the app has reporting tools for problem conversations and 24/7 human monitoring in case of safety issues.)</p>
<p>At launch Wisdom has around 10,000 &#8220;experts&#8221; signed up to dish out knowledge through audio livestreams, following around a month of early testing. Work on the app only started around eight months ago, per the founder.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SsYa4UwUBX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/embed/#?secret=SsYa4UwUBX" data-secret="SsYa4UwUBX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While anyone can sign up and start giving talks on the app, Wisdom has a verification system in place for what it calls &#8220;Top Mentors&#8221; to help users navigate who self-claimed experts are &#8212; and whether they might be worth listening to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the flip side it&#8217;s incentivizing people with knowledge worth sharing to get involved by &#8212; in the first instance &#8212; offering the chance to earn a &#8220;virtual currency&#8221;, called Mentorcoin, based on listens and engagement with their talks.</p>
<p>It says anyone can start earning the in-app currency by streaming their advice, it&#8217;s not just reserved for power users &#8212; saying it wants to support a creator middle class, not just funnel money to a fantastically tiny top-slice as some other creator platforms are (er, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/twitch-streamers-respond-after-huge-leak-of-creator-payout-data/">hi Twitch</a>!).</p>
<p>Mentorcoin can be exchanged for giftcards from outlets like Amazon and Target (or donated to charities like Clean Water Fund) &#8212; but the plan is to expand monetization features for mentors so they can build out an advice-giving business on the platform in the future.</p>
<p>One thing it&#8217;s looking at on that front is allowing mentors to offer paid one-to-one conversations. But currently it&#8217;s purely social audio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social audio &#8212; it&#8217;s a leveller, not everybody writes so well&#8230; but everyone can speak. I think audio is authentic. You can read the tone and emotion in people&#8217;s voices. It allows them to be more vulnerable,&#8221; says founder and CEO Dayo Akinrinade.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a mentor or an expert you can be helping people even when you&#8217;re not on Wisdom because your library of talks is saved against your profile and anyone can come back at any time and listen to your talk &#8212; so, oftentimes, with access to knowledge or mentoring programs by the time you&#8217;ve done the [back and forth asking when you&#8217;re both free the conversation may not happen].</p>
<p>&#8220;[But] if they follow you on Wisdom whenever you go live they&#8217;ll get an alert. So one of the next features we&#8217;re looking at is &#8216;Audio Office Hours&#8217; &#8212; so why shouldn&#8217;t it be on your LinkedIn or your website, even if you go live on Wisdom once a week, once a month&#8230; a lot of people who maybe have privilege and are experts they [feel they] don&#8217;t have the time to give back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really foreseeing a future where experts could&#8230; go live on Wisdom &#8212; it might be once a week, it might be once a month &#8212; [saying] these are my audio office hours, people can listen live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisdom is not the first startup to see value in trying to bring a little helpful order to the babble of on-demand chatter that&#8217;s now available at the tap of an app on platforms like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>Nor indeed the first to focus on advice-giving as its special sauce (see, for eg, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/anyone-is-building-a-marketplace-for-advice-one-5-minute-call-at-a-time/">Anyone</a>). But Akinrinade reckons its creator-first approach will help the fledgling social audio platform stand out.</p>
<p>Supporting diverse voices is another core goal for Wisdom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mission is to democratize access to mentorship and to democratize access to knowledge. I believe that knowledge shouldn&#8217;t be privilege, it should just be a default &#8212; a right that anyone can have,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The app includes features intended to help structure talks in a way that makes them accessible to a range of voices &#8212; such as a timer to keep conversations moving so no one guest can monopolise the stream.</p>
<p>Although initially the focus for the app is on English-speaking countries like the UK, the US, Australia, and Canada. So that&#8217;s one limit.</p>
<p>Akinrinade &#8212; who has a background in management consultancy and has previously founded another startup (London-based black dating app <a href="https://www.africlick.com/">Africlick</a>) &#8212; says she noticed the access problem around mentorship when she was working at <a href="https://weareonetech.org/">OneTech</a>, a UK diversity in startups program.</p>
<p>She also notes frustration with using professional networking platform LinkedIn for mentoring &#8212; saying the inboxes of experts get inundated with &#8216;pick your brain&#8217; requests which end up ignored, unless a person can get introduced through a mutual contact which in turn compounds the problem of systemic inequality.</p>
<p>Her hope for Wisdom is that it will help break down such barriers and &#8220;democratize&#8221; access to knowledge.</p>
<p>The startup is backed by a number of angel investors who &#8212; fittingly enough &#8212; Akinrinade says she met on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a tech founder at the time working on a dating app &#8212; but then we were just talking and social audio is just so exciting and so kind of present. And &#8212; yeah &#8212; that&#8217;s how we started Wisdom!&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify&#8217;s in-car entertainment system known as just &#8220;Car Thing,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spotify-launches-an-in-car-entertainment-system-car-thing/">launched this spring</a> on an invite-only basis, is now becoming more broadly available. The company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-10-14/5-things-to-know-about-the-newest-limited-release-of-car-thing/">announced</a> today Car Thing will become available to U.S. users who want to purchase the $79.99 device. Previously, Spotify had distributed the product for just the cost of shipping during its limited release testing period, noting that this was Spotify&#8217;s first hardware and it wanted to &#8220;get things right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Spotify says U.S. users who had previously signed up for the Car Thing waitlist will be offered the ability to purchase the device ahead of others. However, any current Spotify user &#8212; free or Premium &#8212; can sign up for the Car Thing waitlist. The product will roll out to these customers in time.</p>
<p>The device requires a Spotify Premium membership (either an Individual, Family or Student plan). Users will also need a smartphone for the mobile data. But you won&#8217;t need a paid subscription in order to enter your name on the waitlist at this time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The device itself is a lightweight (3.4 oz.), thin (4.6″ x 2.5″ x 0.7″) music and podcast player that offers a combination of voice control, knobs, buttons, and a touchscreen display for navigating its menus and selecting the media you want to hear. Through Car Thing, users can access Spotify&#8217;s entire catalog of music and podcasts while in their vehicle.</p>
<p>The idea is to offer a way for vehicle owners without built-in infotainment systems, like Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, to have an easier way to access Spotify&#8217;s personalized listening experience.</p>
<p>Car Thing can be mounted inside the car in a number of different ways, thanks to the variety of different mounts that ship alongside the gadget along with a car charger and USB-C cable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg 11944w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1331 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its main interface features four preset buttons that let you save your favorite content for quick access. By default, these are configured with your Liked Songs and Spotify’s Daily Drive and Morning Commute playlists, with the last preset empty. You can change any of these to match your own preferences.</p>
<p>You can also speak to Car Thing using the &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice commands, which the device receives through its four microphones at the top. Currently, Spotify’s<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/"> policy regarding its use of voice data</a> explains the company will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you, and may use the data to improve the feature over time.</p>
<p>Since its limited launch earlier this year, Spotify has already released some software updates aimed at improving the Car Thing experience. The company says it will continue to do so in the future, as well, as the device rolls out to more people.</p>
<p>Spotify did not say how many Car Thing devices have been shipped to date.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Copy.ai’s software can, for example, write a blog post outline based on a few sentences and create link descriptions for Facebook ads and even generate a company motto.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.copy.ai/">Copy.ai</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulYacoubian/status/1317224680038825990">launch on Twitter</a>, the company, a GPT-3 AI-powered platform that generates copywriting tools for business customers, secured another round of funding.</p>
<p>This time, the company brought in an $11 million Series A round, led by Wing Venture Capital, with participation from existing investors Craft Ventures and Sequoia, and new investors including Tiger Global and Elad Gil. This follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">$2.9 million seed round</a> announced in March and brings the company’s total funding to $13.9 million.</p>
<p>Copy.ai’s software costs $35 a month and can, for example, write a blog post outline based on a few sentences and create link descriptions for Facebook ads and even generate a company motto.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A year since CEO Paul Yacoubian and Chris Lu co-founded the company, it is seeing $2.4 million in annual recurring revenue. Not profitable yet, the company did double its revenue over the last year and went from three employees to 13, Yacoubian told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="D0cDGB2USr"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">Writing helper Copy.ai raises $2.9M in a round led by Craft Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Writing helper Copy.ai raises $2.9M in a round led by Craft Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/embed/#?secret=D0cDGB2USr" data-secret="D0cDGB2USr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though it raised funding earlier this year, he and Lu felt the time was right to go after a Series A to expand the team and hire more engineers to provide capacity for new product features. One recent feature is Editor, which enables users to organize thoughts, save ideas and edit notes directly in the app. Copy.ai is also developing products for long-form content creation.</p>
<p>“AI is good at pattern-matching, and when you feed it more information about a business, it can assume the identity of the business, so we are also building a teams product so as the AI learns more, you can invite other business users to sign up, too,” Yacoubian added.</p>
<p>The company will be investing the new capital into hiring. It is a fully remote team with employees all over the country. Copy.ai already has over 300,000 marketers using its tools, like eBay, Nestlé and Ogilvy. Over 3,000 have signed up for a free trial since the seed round and it has more than 10,000 premium customers.</p>
<p>Copy.ai is early into AI natural language generation, something Yacoubian said the company is just scratching the surface of, so it will continue to improve the core app experience and the quality of the text that is generated.</p>
<p>The founders also hit it off with Wing Venture Capital partner Zach DeWitt, who Yacoubian said understands the company’s vision and how well artificial intelligence can help marketers.</p>
<p>“While looking at the creative capacity of AI, we hear a lot about automation taking away jobs, but not a lot of narrative to create value for yourself or your company,” Yacoubian added. “If AI progresses, it will be a source of empowerment and another tool that has uncapped potential. It is interesting in how it can unlock human capital, and in a smaller company that can’t afford full-time agencies, provide a quick, simple tool that solves their problem.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DeWitt said customers are fully moving online as digital penetration increases, and companies have to meet customers where they are, whether that be newsletters, blogs, social media or email.</p>
<p>In speaking with small business customers of Copy.ai, he got a sense that  the amount of written content is overwhelming to some, and to enable marketers or founders to write a great piece of copy, using AI is the best way to do that.</p>
<p>DeWitt, himself, used the product to generate his initial email to the company. He also writes a weekly blog and is active on Twitter, so Copy.ai’s products have come in handy as he thinks about blog post ideas and content formats, he said.</p>
<p>He added that the company is one of the fastest-growing that Wing had come across for a company this young. They are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/ng99ea/ama_w_paul_and_chris_from_copyai_how_we_grew_from/">leveraging social media</a> to make their metrics public, which in turn generates loyalty and provides a way for them to learn in public as well, something that initially attracted Wing to the company.</p>
<p>“This round was massively oversubscribed, so you can get a sense of the interest in the company, the quality of the team and their traction,” DeWitt added. “Chris and Paul had the luxury of being selective in the investors they chose to set them up for future success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared micromobility operator Bird announced that it has secured commitments from Apollo Investment Corporation to raise its existing $40 million vehicle financing credit facility to $150 million. The upsize goes into effect once the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/"> SPAC deal with Switchback II Corporation</a> officially closes.</p>
<p>The shareholder vote to approve and confirm the business combination is scheduled for November 2. This announcement, coming just weeks ahead of Bird becoming a publicly listed company, could potentially be a move by the company to instill investor confidence before the bell rings.</p>
<p>Bird&#8217;s chief financial officer, Yibo Ling, says the upsize in Bird&#8217;s credit facility from Apollo is a result of the &#8220;strong cash generating capabilities&#8221; of its fleet of electric scooters and bikes. (Disclaimer: Apollo acquired Verizon Media Group, which owns TechCrunch. The company is now called Yahoo Inc.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217930" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;With the increased liquidity provided by the upsized facility, we believe we are well positioned to support our expansion plans,” Ling said in a statement.</p>
<p>The news comes just a day after Bird announced it would be manufacturing &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/">tens or hundreds of thousands</a>&#8221; of vehicles equipped with its new location-based sidewalk riding detection technology over the next year, the type of scale that would require a large upfront capital investment. Bird says Apollo will fund the vast majority of vehicle purchases, allowing Bird to pay a small upfront amount to the financing solutions company initially, with plans outlined to pay the total amount back over about nine months as it generates revenue.</p>

<p>Sources familiar with the terms of the credit facility say vehicle financing, upsize notwithstanding, already helps Bird to be more capital efficient, giving it access to deep pockets in the winter, when Bird usually purchases vehicles, and time to generate revenue in the spring and summer months. The repayment terms of the credit facility are still the same as when <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001861449/000119312521250592/d431538ds4a.htm">Apollo initially committed $40 million, per Bird&#8217;s SEC filing</a> – Because Apollo&#8217;s collateral is the vehicles themselves and cash from the vehicles, Bird can only pay back its debt from revenue earned by the vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the upsize is new, it&#8217;s not surprising. Bird had already stated an objective to expand its vehicle financing capabilities to fund the majority of vehicle CapEx in 2022 and beyond when it presented its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001829730/000119312521158297/d469014dex993.htm">investor deck</a> back in May, so Apollo&#8217;s increase appears to be in line with those goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One in 20 people suffer from <a href="https://gi.org/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/#tabs1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">irritable bowel syndrome</a>, a common disorder related to how your bowels work, that can cause a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain and difficulty using the bathroom.</p>
<p>A go-to remedy for gut sensitivity is to avoid certain foods, but many of the associated diets are very restrictive, said Anjie Liu, one of the co-founders of Boston-based biotechnology company <a href="https://www.fodzyme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwi Bio</a>, who knows firsthand the difficulties of living with IBS.</p>
<p>“I would have stomach pains after eating and went to the doctor, who then referred me to a specialist, which is the typical IBS journey, because no one has an idea of what is wrong with you,” Liu told TechCrunch. “Between 10% and 15% of people suffer from IBS, but only half of those people are officially diagnosed.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217646" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This led her to pair up with David Hachuel to develop a way to make eating a painless ritual for 40 million other Americans also suffering from IBS. Kiwi’s first product, FODZYME, came out in May. FODZYME uses patent-pending enzymes to break down common digestive triggers.</p>
<p>And now today, Kiwi Bio announced a $1.5 million seed round from a group of investors that includes Y Combinator, North South Ventures, Surf Club Ventures, Acacia Venture Capital Partners, Savage Seed (a fund managed by Emily Leproust) and Golden founder Jude Gomila.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pandemic&#8217;s shift to remote wellness helps Numan raise $40M Series B led by White Star&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/pandemics-shift-to-remote-wellness-helps-numan-raise-40m-series-b-led-by-white-star/embed/#?secret=SzFwgMia5B" data-secret="SzFwgMia5B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Liu, who was diagnosed with IBS six years ago, said many people initially try medication, but find there is no way to manage symptoms other than cutting out half of the foods they would normally eat. The diet, known as the low-FODMAP diet, is what 80% of doctors prescribe. However, it is “extremely hard to follow, and as a result, there is low compliance,” she added.</p>
<p>For many, this means avoiding foods like garlic and onions. To Liu, who tried the diet for nearly three years, it meant sometimes missing out on life and the enjoyment of food. With FODZYME, people can sprinkle the powder on foods, in the case of the first product, like garlic, onions, bananas and wheat, before they are eaten.</p>
<p>Liu explained that they chose the powder form because it more easily integrates with the foods versus a capsule.</p>
<p>“We learned through clinical testing that capsules were one of the worst ways to deliver enzymes,” Liu said. “Those products almost never make it to the human gut where they interface with the actual users. That’s why ours is a powder that goes directly on food, which we found worked much better.”</p>
<p>Kiwi is also working on a chewable version as well as a supplement that will counteract sugar alcohols. All of the ingredients in FODZYME are recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One of the company’s advisors, Thomas Wallach, a pediatric gastroenterologist at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, said via email he believes Kiwi’s work is different from other companies in the digestive health space that are relying on unproven concepts and the fact that the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21751434/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">placebo effect in IBS and intestinal discomfort is quite strong</a>.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with that to be honest, as if it’s a safe product and people feel better, I’m pretty happy,” he said. “However, Kiwi is really aimed at introducing a real therapeutic agent, with potential applications in several conditions from IBS to dysmotility to short gut. It’s a novel and exciting idea, and one I’m really excited to help investigate.”</p>
<p>Wallach clinically specializes in disorders of abdominal pain, including irritable bowel syndrome, as well as being a translational researcher focused on intestinal epithelial homeostasis. He explained that gas makes stretching worse, and our intestinal microbiota eat FODMAPs and many bugs turn them into gas. The low-FODMAP diet aims to decrease gas, and says it has a very good success rate, particularly in people who also have hyper mobile joints or dysautonomia.</p>
<p>In addition to what Liu mentioned about the low-FODMAP diet being restrictive, Wallach added that the diet doesn’t introduce a lot of fiber, which could result in someone’s microbiome being altered in a negative way. Kiwi is &#8220;Lactaid for fiber,&#8221; allowing people with IBS to eat more freely with some preparation, he said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, fiber is good for you, and removing it from the diet is not sustainable,” Wallach added. “Kiwi’s enzyme package pre-digests FODMAPs, ideally decreasing the amount that ends up in the colon while avoiding nutritional limitations or removal of all fiber. I was very impressed by their focus on empiric validation, with plans for both in vitro model system testing, and as it&#8217;s generally regarded as a safe substance, rapid movement into clinical trials.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it’s been a busy summer for Kiwi. Liu and Hachuel were part of Y Combinator’s summer cohort and saw Kiwi’s inventory already sell out twice this summer. A bottle of FODZYME retails for $39 and can be purchased in a 30-day or 60-day supply. The company now serves over 600 customers and is growing at 18% weekly.</p>
<p>The company has been busy strengthening its supply chain to gear up for scaling its product. Additionally, it hired a head of growth and a community engagement and success manager.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow the FODZYME product, to develop new products in the pipeline, for example, novel enzymes to tackle unaddressed FODMAP groups and support planned clinical studies.</p>
<p>“We discovered during fundraising that Kiwi Bio fit neither the mold of a traditional biotech company nor that of conventional consumer products, food or CPG,” Liu said. “We had to find the right blend of investors to support us in all the dimensions we occupy, and particularly ones who are comfortable thinking at intersections.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farming accounts for 24 percent of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions, and this is largely due to the intensive, ‘industrial’ farming methods employed in the last few decades, together with the rise in the consumption of meat. However, a new approach has been taking the farming world by storm. &#8216;Regenerative Farming&#8217; practices hand unproductive land back to nature, boosts wildlife, and stores planet-killing CO2, literally using soil as a carbon sink.</p>
<p>By creating woodlands and restoring peatlands, carbon can be captured while simultaneously arresting the decline in natural diversity, essential for things like bee pollination. Plus, Regenerative Farming plays into the drift away from older government subsidy regimes, which are switching to focusing on the environment, CO2 emission, and away from industrial farming.</p>
<p><a href="https://agreena.com/">Agreena</a> is a Dutch startup which mints, verifies, and sells carbon credits generated by farmers who transition to more regenerative forms of farming.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launched only this summer, the company has now raised a $4.7 million Seed funding round led by <a href="https://www.giant.vc/">Giant Ventures</a>, along with the Danish Government&#8217;s Danish Green Future Fund. A number of European farmers also participated.</p>
<p>Agreena says its platform provides farmers with an economic incentive to switch from traditional arable farming to regenerative agricultural methods by issuing them a &#8216;CO2e-certificate&#8217; which can be sold between farmers and potential buyers.</p>
<p>So how does it work? Farmers register their fields and get advice on transitioning to regenerative practices. The changes are then monitored by Agreena via satellite imagery and soil verification. The farmers can then sell the CO2e-certificates independently or via Agreena’s marketplace to companies that want to buy the carbon offsets from the farmers. Buyers then track their sponsored CO2 reductions at a field level via Agreena’s platform.</p>
<p>Simon Haldrup, Agreena CEO, said: “Our team consists of 30 professionals including carbon scientists, software developers, and commercial growth hackers. Agriculture has deep roots in Denmark, a historically proud farming nation, which is why the company was born here, but we are scaling across Europe and intend to expand globally.” Agreena was founded by Haldrup, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliekfahler/?originalSubdomain=dk">Julie Koch Fahler</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ida-boesen-88533230/?originalSubdomain=dk">Ida Boesen</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Agreena claims to have contracted more than 50,000 hectares in its first year, pre-selling more than 20% of their minted carbon offset certificates.</p>
<p>The startup has some competition in the space. Voluntary carbon market for agriculture including US scale-up <a href="https://www.indigoag.com/">Indigo</a> (US unicorn), Nori ( US &amp; blockchain-focused), and UK/France based Soil Capital. But Agreena says its key differentiator is its vertically integrated carbon platform.</p>
<p>Cameron McLain, co-founder and managing partner of Giant Ventures, commented: “We’re excited by Agreena’s vertically integrated approach towards agricultural carbon offsets, which is empathetic to the nuances of the industry and the incentives of farmers. We also believe Agreena can become the dominant internet marketplace for facilitating online B2B commerce within farming, a nut which no one has yet cracked.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/thank-you-evan">announced</a> co-founder Evan Sharp is exiting its full-time role with the company, where he&#8217;s served as Chief Design &amp; Creative Officer, in order to join Jony Ive at his new creative collective <a href="https://www.lovefrom.com/">LoveFrom</a>. After his last day today, Oct. 14, 2021, Sharp will move into an advisory role with Pinterest which will focus on company strategy, product, design, brand and culture. He will also continue to serve on Pinterest&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Pinterest was <a href="https://about.pinterest.com/en/node/19/mailto%3Apress%40pinterest.com">founded</a> in March 2010 by co-founders Sharp, Ben Silbermann, and Paul Sciarra, and Pinterest today credits Sharp with leading the company during its evolution from a visual discovery engine to a global inspiration platform. While at Pinterest, Sharp oversaw product strategy and user experience, including architecting its Shopping and Creator platforms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218016" style="width: 188px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218016" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?w=178" alt="" width="178" height="178" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg 178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/t8rES8rg.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218010" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Reflecting back over the last decade, I feel filled with gratitude and pride at what our team and our community have achieved. Together we’ve built Pinterest: a technology company and platform that is a positive ‘home of inspiration’ for hundreds of millions of people around the world,&#8221; said Sharp, in a statement. &#8220;After long reflection on how I can best grow my ability to serve, I’ve decided to shift my focus and join Jony Ive and the remarkable creative collective he’s assembled at LoveFrom. I look forward to continuing to partner with Ben and the team at Pinterest on the company’s ambitious evolution into the global platform where creators and merchants inspire people to create a life they love,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Evan’s unique talent, vision and passion have been instrumental in building Pinterest into a home of inspiration for hundreds of millions of people around the world,&#8221; said Pinterest co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann, also in a statement. &#8220;I’m thankful for his partnership, leadership and friendship over the past 10 years and grateful that he will continue to support Pinterest as a Board member and in his new role as an advisor.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pinterest tells us Sharp&#8217;s role was a unique co-founding role, so it will not be replaced. He also did not have a current team officially reporting to him, so there are no changes in the reporting structure. Instead, the design team will continue to operate under Head of Product Naveen Gavini, and with leadership from Head of Design Lindsay Mindler.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There&#8217;s no word yet on what Sharp&#8217;s role will be at LoveFrom, but <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ex-apple-design-boss-jony-ive-recruited-at-least-four-former-colleagues-to-new-firm?rc=ajsw4d">several ex-Apple employees</a> have already joined Ive at the firm, including Wan Si, Eugene Whang, Chris Wilson, and Patch Kessler. (Jeff Tiller, however, left this summer.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p>In a memo sent to employees, Silbermann said the following:</p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p><em>Hi Team, </em></p>
<p><em>I write to share some bittersweet news: Evan will be stepping away from his day-to-day work at Pinterest. He will be starting an exciting new adventure outside the company (which I’ll let him tell you about!). Here at Pinterest, he will be transitioning into an advisory role and continue serving as a board member. So the good news is that he’s not going far away.</em></p>
<p><em>Still, this is the end of a chapter. In processing it, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the beginning. Evan and I met in 2009 in New York City. We hit it off immediately. We talked about our (nerdy) interests, our families, and our hopes for the future. He was clearly a builder at heart, which was fitting because he was in architecture school. I remember thinking: Wow, I want to work with this guy. </em></p>
<p><em>Eventually, we began talking about building a tool to help you collect the things you love on the internet. That idea turned into a product, which we later named Pinterest. And so began the start of an amazing, decade-long journey together, and with all of you. </em></p>
<p><em>Evan’s been so essential to Pinterest’s growth. Sometimes the tasks were small—he once hurt his wrist putting together IKEA desks at our first office. Often, his contributions were transformational. Countless times, he’s taken a whiteboard of ideas, and translated them into a meaningful experience in the product and company.  </em></p>
<p><em>But what I’ve always loved is not just what he’s built, but how he’s built—with empathy, care and concern for others. He’s never been afraid to speak up for those values in a meeting. No matter how big Pinterest got, that never changed. </em></p>
<p><em>For me personally, it’s hard to capture what Evan’s partnership has meant to me. When I reflect on our years building together, I don’t think about a business plan or an OKR. Instead, I think about all those long days, late nights and many phone calls—nurturing a shared dream together; celebrating incredible highs and encouraging each other through tough lows; being at each other’s weddings and meeting each other’s kids for the first time. He’s not only been a great co-founder, but a great friend.  </em></p>
<p><em>While Evan won’t be a daily presence at Pinterest anymore, more than anything, I’m grateful—for the person he is, for the work he’s done, and for the counsel he’ll continue providing in his new role. </em></p>
<p><em>We’re hosting Q&amp;A tomorrow and I hope to see you all there so we can say with one collective voice: Thanks, Evan!</em></p>
<p><em>— Ben</em></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Sharp, in a note to staff, said the decision was a tough one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The full message read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Thanks, Ben. </em></p>
<p><em>Pinterest has been the gift of a lifetime.</em></p>
<p><em>When I think back over the past 11 years, I feel filled with gratitude and pride for what our team—and our community—have built together.</em></p>
<p><em>When we started Pinterest, we never dreamed that hundreds of millions of people around the world would be using it every month to get inspiration for all facets of their lives. At least I didn’t!</em></p>
<p><em>As proud as I am of what we’ve built, how we build it—the values that each of us has woven into the way we do business—makes me even prouder.</em></p>
<p><em>We are not perfect, but we care. We work hard to Put Pinners First.</em></p>
<p><em>That matters.</em></p>
<p><em>As you might imagine, this is a tough decision for me. What job will ever be able to compete with leading Pinterest? None.</em></p>
<p><em>But when I think about how to create a life that I love, one thing is clear to me: I really, really want to grow as a designer and product builder. That’s why I’ve made the decision to work with the designer Jony Ive at LoveFrom. This chance for me to learn alongside the very best at their craft is a tremendous opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>And yet: I’m very excited about our vision and strategy here at Pinterest over the next few years. It’s going to be the most ambitious, challenging and rewarding few years in our history.</em></p>
<p><em>So while I will no longer be working on Pinterest every day, in my current role, I’m really looking forward to continuing to contribute to our company strategy, our product, our brand and our culture—and, I hope, to bring back new learnings as well.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to thank each person reading this for choosing to make our mission and our company the place you invest your time, energy and creativity.</em></p>
<p><em>The best part of this past decade for me has been getting to work alongside so many extraordinary people: extraordinary in their talent, their hard work and their intellect, and also in their character, their values and their heart.</em></p>
<p><em>Ben: You especially. Your integrity, your resilience, your unbelievable work ethic, and your childlike love of apps and the internet has made you the very best partner—and friend—I could ever have asked for.</em></p>
<p><em>You know the best thing about founding a company? You get to build your dream place to work.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you all for helping make my dream come true.</em></p>
<p><em>— Evan</em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the AIs of the future are, as many tech companies seem to hope, going to look through our eyes in the form of AR glasses and other wearables, they&#8217;ll need to learn how to make sense of the human perspective. We&#8217;re used to it, of course, but there&#8217;s remarkably little first-person video footage of everyday tasks out there — which is why Facebook put <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-to-perceive-the-world-through-your-eyes">collected a few thousand hours for a new publicly available dataset</a>.</p>
<p>The challenge Facebook is attempting to get a grip on is simply that even the most impressive of object and scene recognition models today have been trained almost exclusively on third-person perspectives. So it can recognize a person cooking, but only if it sees that person standing in a kitchen, not if the view is from the person&#8217;s eyes. Or it will recognize a bike, but not from the perspective of the rider. It&#8217;s a perspective shift that we take for granted, since it&#8217;s a natural part of our experience, but that computers find quite difficult.</p>
<p>The solution to machine learning problems is generally either more or better data, and this case it can&#8217;t hurt to have both. So Facebook contacted research partners around the world to collect first-person video of common activities like cooking, grocery shopping, typing shoelaces, or just hanging out.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215524" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The 13 partner universities collected thousands of hours of video from more than 700 participants in 9 countries, and it should be said at the outset that they were volunteers and controlled the level of their own involvement and identity. Those thousands of hours were whittled down to 3,000 by a research team that watched, edited, and hand-annotated the video, while adding their own footage from staged environments they couldn&#8217;t capture in the wild. <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/ego4d-unscripted-first-person-video-from-around-the-world-and-a-benchmark-suite-for-egocentric-perception">It&#8217;s all described in this research paper.</a></p>
<p>The footage was captured by a variety of methods, from glasses cameras to GoPros and other devices, and some researchers chose also to scan the environment in which the person was operating, while others tracked gaze direction and other metrics. It&#8217;s all going into a dataset Facebook called Ego4D that will be made freely available to the research community at large.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217137" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217137" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg" alt="Two images, one showing computer vision successfully identifying objects and another showing it failing in first person." width="1024" height="552" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg 1845w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=680,366 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/visionfail.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2217137" class="wp-caption-text">Two images, one showing computer vision successfully identifying objects and another showing it failing in first person.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;For AI systems to interact with the world the way we do, the AI field needs to evolve to an entirely new paradigm of first-person perception. That means teaching AI to understand daily life activities through human eyes in the context of real-time motion, interaction, and multisensory observations,&#8221; said lead researcher Kristin Grauman in a Facebook blog post.</p>
<p>As difficult as it may be to believe, this research and the Ray-Ban Stories smart shades are totally unrelated except in that Facebook clearly thinks that first-person understanding is increasingly important to multiple disciplines. (The 3D scans could be used in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/facebook-and-matterport-collaborate-on-realistic-virtual-training-environments-for-ai/">Habitat AI training simulator</a>, though.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research is strongly motivated by applications in augmented reality and robotics,&#8221; Grauman told TechCrunch. &#8220;First-person perception is critical to enabling the AI assistants of the future, especially as wearables like AR glasses become an integral part of how people live and move throughout everyday life. Think of how beneficial it would be if the assistants on your devices could remove the cognitive overload from your life, understanding your world through your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The global nature of the collected video is a very deliberate move. It would be fundamentally shortsighted to only include imagery from a single country or culture. Kitchens in the U.S. look different from French ones, Rwandan ones, and Japanese ones. Making the same dish with the same ingredients, or performing the same general task (cleaning, exercising) may look very different even between individuals, let alone entire cultures. So, as Facebook&#8217;s post puts it, &#8220;Compared with existing data sets, the Ego4D data set provides a greater diversity of scenes, people, and activities, which increases the applicability of models trained for people across backgrounds, ethnicities, occupations, and ages.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217142" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217142" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217142" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg" alt="Examples from Facebook of first-person video and the environments where it was taken." width="1024" height="637" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg 1629w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=1536,955 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/facebook4d-examples.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2217142" class="wp-caption-text">Examples from Facebook of first-person video and the environments where it was taken.</p></div></p>
<p>The database isn&#8217;t the only thing Facebook is releasing. With this sort of leap forward in data collecting, it&#8217;s common to also put out a set of benchmarks for testing how well a given model is using the information. For instance, with a set of images of dogs and cats, you might want a standard benchmark that tests the model&#8217;s efficacy in telling which is which.</p>
<p>In this case things are a bit more complicated. Simply identifying objects from a first person point of view isn&#8217;t that hard — it&#8217;s just a different angle, really — and it wouldn&#8217;t be that new or useful, either. Do you really need a pair of AR glasses to tell you &#8220;that is a tomato&#8221;? No: like any other tool, an AR device should be telling you something you <em>don&#8217;t</em> know, and to do that it needs a deeper understanding of things like intentions, contexts, and linked actions.</p>
<p>To that end the researchers came up with five tasks that can be, theoretically anyway, accomplished by analyzing this first-person imagery:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Episodic memory</strong>: tracking objects and concepts in time and space so that arbitrary questions like &#8220;where are my keys?&#8221; can be answered.</li>
<li><strong>Forecasting</strong>: understanding sequences of events so that questions like &#8220;what&#8217;s next in the recipe?&#8221; can be answered, or things can be preemptively noted, like &#8220;you left your car keys in the house.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Hand-object interaction</strong>: identifying how people grasp and manipulate objects, and what happens when they do, which can feed into episodic memory or perhaps inform the actions of a robot that must imitate those actions.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-visual diarization</strong>: associating sound with events and objects so that speech or music can be intelligently tracked for situations like asking what the song was playing at the cafe, or what the boss said at the end of the meeting. (&#8220;Diarization&#8221; is their &#8220;word.&#8221;)</li>
<li><strong>Social interaction</strong>: understanding who is talking to whom and what is being said, both for purposes of informing the other processes and for in-moment use like captioning in a noisy room with multiple people.</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren&#8217;t the only applications or benchmarks possible, of course, just a set of initial ideas for testing whether a given AI model actually gets what&#8217;s happening in a first-person video. Facebook&#8217;s researchers performed a base-level run on each task, described in their paper, that serves as a starting point. There&#8217;s also a sort of pie-in-the-sky video example of each of these tasks if they were successful <a href="https://youtu.be/taC2ZKl9IsE">in this video</a> summarizing the research.</p>
<p>While the 3,000 hours — meticulously hand-annotated over 250,000 researcher hours, Grauman was careful to point out — are an order of magnitude more than what&#8217;s out there now, there&#8217;s still plenty of room to grow, she noted. They&#8217;re planning on growing the dataset and are actively adding partners as well.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using the data, keep your eye on the Facebook AI Research blog and maybe get in touch with one of the many, many people listed on the paper. It&#8217;ll be released in the next few months once the consortium figures out exactly how to do that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>YouTube is the third-most-used website within schools, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matthew-gross">Matthew Gross</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://newsela.com/">Newsela.</a></p>
<p>“That is incredible, considering how difficult it is to find videos, how unfiltered it is and how inaccessible it is for many students who have different learning abilities and learning levels,” said Gross. “Video has to evolve.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217854" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To that end, Newsela announced today that it has acquired HapYak, an interactive video software business for the enterprise, for an undisclosed amount. This marks Newsela’s first acquisition, as the content company has been working more on content partnerships and licensing up until this point. The deal comes months after Newsela raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/newsela-the-replacement-for-textbooks-raises-100m-and-becomes-a-unicorn/"> $100 million in a round that brought its valuation to $1 billion.</a></p>
<p>HapYak is a little fancier than YouTube in its enterprise-specific offerings. Gross said that he got validation for the importance of video after seeing users turn to other DIY platforms to build interactive videos.</p>
<p>Ethos-wise, bringing customizable functionality to videos &#8212; instead of a static experience &#8212; is in line with how Newsela iterates on products. For example, the startup disrupted textbooks by bringing them online, and giving teachers a way to tailor the same content to different learning types. Now, the startup wants to disrupt video by adding a layer of interactivity. Beyond the HapYak acquisition, Newsela plans to tap into its access to thousands of videos it has through content providers.</p>
<p>“What will be most exciting to teachers and students is the level of engagement and level of interactivity…because accessibility is so critical,” he said. “It’s a critical issue that students with different learning levels, of background knowledge, different abilities and different age groups…you need to have videos become accessible to students across all walks of life.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gross declined to comment on whether video functionality will be a product that is offered to free users or only those who pay for a Newsela subscription. The latter could impact the accessibility of Newsela’s new efforts, as the digital divide continues to limit which students, and entire districts, get access to software.</p>
<p>Eight months ago, Newsela boasted that its 2020 annual recurring revenue grew 81% over 2019, with new bookings surging 115%. The CEO declined to share if 2021 is on pace to eclipse, meet or fall behind those totals.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Newsela only hosted a small percentage of video content on its platform. The company has been, and will continue to be, a text-focused company that wants to improve literacy of students across the world, according to Gross. Despite this background, Newsela thinks that video content will be non-negotiable in learning going forward.</p>

<p>“Videos are really central to instruction and an incredible amount of information can be conveyed very quickly and efficiently through video,” Gross said. “It serves not as anything better or worse than text, but as a critical supplement in a video-driven world.”</p>
<p>While some may feel like Newsela’s foray into video is late, Gross said that his company intentionally didn’t look at the form factor in the past.</p>
<p>“I think a worst-case scenario are videos that don&#8217;t have a lot of rigor, and instruction videos that are really just all about engagement,” Gross said. While he didn’t name any specific startups, he thinks that some trick school teachers into thinking that video-based instruction is good for kids through engagement metrics. In reality, though, some interactive tools fail to deliver high-quality education, thus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-future/">missing an important balance</a> between engaging content and pedagogically sound learning.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s not the kind of learning that we&#8217;re used to in the 21st century, and then video in school would just be seen as a total turn-off rather than something that&#8217;s truly getting kids excited about learning.”</p>
<p>Beyond the HapYak acquisition, Newsela revealed that it has acquired the natural learning AI assets from Fluent City, a language learning startup. Interestingly, Newsela wasn’t interested in the startup’s language learning capabilities (which it subsequently sold off to Brightcove).</p>
<p>The transaction, Gross said, will allow Newsela to better analyze the text that they license from content providers to aid curation, modifications and recommendations for its customers.</p>
<p>Both deals signal that Newsela, armed with fresh capital, is getting aggressive about how it gets the right content to the right student in the right format at the right time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The current environment of accelerated digitalization and remote work “has created an unprecedented attack surface,” according to co-founder Richard Seewald.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Evolution Equity Partners is targeting cybersecurity and enterprise software companies for its new Evolution Technology Fund II LP for which it announced Thursday a final closing totaling $400 million.</p>
<p>The fund was oversubscribed and included new and returning institutional investors, corporates and family offices from the United States, Europe, Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p>Richard Seewald, managing partner at Evolution, said via email that the firm, based in New York City, Palo Alto, London and Zurich has made 12 investments from the new fund so far. He expects to invest in 20 to 25 companies overall.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217879" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Investments will range from $10 million to $50 million in early- and growth-stage companies focused on cybersecurity, machine learning, big data and SaaS to build market-leading platforms.</p>
<p>A few of the investments from Evolution Technology Fund II include quantum encryption company Arqit-Quantum, fraudulent money detection company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/quantexa-raises-153m/">Quantexa</a> and digital asset protection company Unbound Security.</p>
<p>Seewald and Dennis Smith, both technology entrepreneurs, started the firm in 2008 and have made 42 investments to date. Evolution currently has more than $1 billion of assets under management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The cybersecurity market presents a compelling opportunity over the next decade and even longer, due to the sophistication of hackers and criminals increasing over the past few years, “creating material unquantified risk to our economy and society,” Seewald said. The current environment of accelerated digitalization and remote work “has created an unprecedented attack surface.”</p>
<p>“Our approach to cybersecurity is being reassessed to address a redefined world,” he added. “It&#8217;s not only the traditional cybersecurity stack that is salient in order to protect our digital world, it&#8217;s also security and antifraud categories relating to blockchain, quantum computing, identity protection amongst others. Integrating these segments offers the potential to tilt the scale in our favor and to the detriment of our adversaries. Evolution invests in segments traditionally identified as cybersecurity as well as adjacent categories that together are defined as ‘Technology that Safeguards our Digital World.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://tala.co/">Tala</a>, an emerging markets digital lender that offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/with-loans-of-just-10-this-startup-has-built-a-financial-services-powerhouse-in-emerging-markets/">loans between $10 to $500</a> to consumers and small business owners, has raised $145 million in Series E funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upstart, a company founded by ex-Googlers Dave Girouard, Anna Counselman and Paul Gu, led the round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi network Stellar Enterprise Foundation participated, alongside new investors Kindred Ventures and the J. Safra Group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing investors IVP, Revolution Growth and Lowercase Capital also joined the round that brings Tala’s total funding raised to a little over $360 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new investment values Tala north of $800 million, according to a source close to the company.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unlike the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/tala-series-d-india/">last financing round</a> where Tala raised $100 million debt financing in addition to its $110 million Series D, the microlender only raised equity this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivanisiroya">Shivani Siroya</a> founded Tala after leaving her job as an investment banking analyst. The idea came while engaging in some research for the United Nations Population Fund. She discovered that many people she talked to in emerging markets were creditworthy but lacked immediate access to credit and quick loans.</span></p>
<p>To add to that, over 2 billion of these people have limited access to financial services and working capital <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/video/2016/03/10/2-billion-number-of-adults-worldwide-without-access-to-formal-financial-services">per World Bank statistics</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studying the issues causing this problem, Siroya concluded that the financial system in these markets was essentially not designed to meet the needs of the underserved segment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And Tala could change that; and so far, it has (to an extent). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Tala first launched its mobile application to offer credit and collateral-free loans to consumers in Kenya but has since expanded to the Philippines, Mexico and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/tala-series-d-india/">more recently</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/tala-series-d-india/">, India</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company uses users’ phone data and their activity (for instance, the frequency and timeliness of paying phone bills) to create credit scores that determine the amount of credit a user can receive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 6 million customers across these four markets use Tala, and the company claims to have disbursed over $2.7 billion worth of credit since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with 12,000 new users signing up every day to access credit, Tala is making a transition to offer a broader range of financial services around an account and capture more value across the supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our Android application has allowed over 6 million individuals to access our first product, which was access to credit, said Siroya to TechCrunch over a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “And now we’re moving beyond that to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">become that full financial account for our customers. And, again, across our markets, that’s what we’re looking to do with this fundraise.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PayPal-backed money lender Tala raises $110M to enter India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/tala-series-d-india/embed/#?secret=bkoSUiz2JS" data-secret="bkoSUiz2JS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder and CEO emphasized that the new product offerings will help customers “use, save, protect and grow their money better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of this as a credit-led approach to digital banking that leverages a credit card or similar offering (in Tala’s case, credit via mobile phones) and provides other services around a bank account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Neobanks such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brazil’s Nubank and Neon and Nigeria’s FairMoney and Carbon have explored this model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what prompted Tala to go this route? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Siroya, users reduced how they used cash during the pandemic and showed Tala different pain points for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">why customers needed more financial products beyond credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because of the relationship and the trust that we have with our customers, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wanted to move </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be able to meet those needs,” Siroya said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Tala, users have access to an account and other tools to borrow, save and manage their money, the company said in a statement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In turn, Tala claims it will offer an expanded range of personalized credit options, including longer-term loans to match customers’ income cycles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integral to this new direction is the use of crypto and decentralized finance to enable the company’s roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PayPal-backed company says it wants to develop the first mass-market crypto product for emerging markets and making crypto affordable to its users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Tala plans to use blockchain-based finance to refine its capital market strategy and connect investors and borrowers on the Tala platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.upstart.com/about">Upstart</a> and the <a href="https://www.stellar.org/foundation?locale=en">Stellar Development Foundation</a> (SDF), two investors in the round, are critical to this next phase of growth for Tala. An AI lending platform, Upstart has assisted banks and credit unions originate more than $13 billion worth of loans. At the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SDF &#8212; the nonprofit arm of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stellar network &#8212; leverages interoperability with the world’s existing financial systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> kind of matches both things. One is continuing to refine and become even better </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our credit offerings,” said Siroya. “And then the other side is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thinking about how do we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this experience and leverage crypto with these platforms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the announcement, Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart and Denelle Dixon, the executive director and CEO of the Stellar Development Foundation, will join Tala’s board of directors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During our conversation, I referred to Branch, a close competitor to Tala, and noted it was interesting both platforms concurrently thought to provide other services besides credit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Tala, Branch started as a digital lender offering loans to customers in Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania and India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now the company, backed by Visa, IFC and Andreessen Horowitz, is maturing into a digital bank that provides bill payments, money transfer and investment features</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Siroya can spot the coincidence, she doesn’t shy away from lauding her company above other seeming competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do think that, across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our markets, we’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeing that many fintechs are coming in and seeing the same opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But again, when you think about the design of those platforms and products, there is nobody </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that has the global breath that Tala has for underserved segment across our four markets,” the CEO said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its new capital, Tala plans to also grow its team across the four markets it serves and the U.S., where it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is headquartered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company says it will also pull forward plans for geographic expansion, though it kept numb on what markets they could be.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI shopping assistant and <a href="https://www.karmanow.com/">shopping network Karma</a> announced that it has raised $25 million in Series A funding led by Target Global followed by MoreTech Ventures, with participation from existing investors including NFX and Altair Capital. Karma allows users to plan their next online purchases, get notified about real-time price and inventory updates, access coupons and earn automatic cashback.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based company was founded in 2014 by Jonathan Freidman and Ronen Yuval-Hoch as a simple bookmarklet tool to help consumers save and track products. Since then, Karma has launched browser extensions, along with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/karma-your-shopping-assistant/id1086670571">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shoptagr&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> apps. The company now employs nearly 60 people across Tel Aviv, Minsk, Belarus and the U.S., and has grown to include over 30,000 retail partners such as Apple, Nordstrom, Farefetch, Target and Nike.</p>
<p>“Karma started with a very simple need: just knowing when something goes on sale in your size and color in real-time,&#8221; Jonathan Freidman, Karma CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;The idea is originally from my wife. She came to us one day and said: why isn’t this process automated? We started from there, basically just knowing when there’s a price change and automating that for the user,” he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217554" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, Karma has three core functions. Firstly, the service allows users to create shopping lists where they can save a product for later in one universal cart. In the background, Karma will automatically notify the user if there’s a price change or if something comes back in stock. This function is focused on helping users to streamline and plan their purchases in one location.</p>
<p>Secondly, the service automatically searches the web for coupons at checkout, which is similar to the premise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">PayPal’s Honey</a> service. When asked how Karma compares to Honey, Friedman stated that although Karma does have an automatic coupon-finder like Honey, this feature is just one aspect of Karma’s offerings. He said Karma is different than Honey because it takes users on the complete pre-purchasing journey and aggregates relevant services all in one place, while also surfacing coupons. However, PayPal&#8217;s interest in Honey is also about capturing users ahead of purchase these days. Its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/paypal-launches-its-super-app-combining-payments-savings-bill-pay-crypto-shopping-and-more/">integration</a> into the PayPal app sees the fintech company targeting shoppers with personalized deals.</p>
<p>Friedman also outlined that Karma’s third core function allows users to automatically earn cashback on hundreds of retailers. Karma surfaces all of the relevant cashback offers that users are eligible for at checkout.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217558" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217558" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2217558" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/karma-mobile.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217558" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“All three of these functions aim to help you automate a lot of the pre-purchasing journey and save time and money. We always want to try to provide users with the best value, but it’s very important for us to streamline the experience,&#8221; Friedman said. &#8220;Today, you need a lot of different apps for different things like coupons or cashback, but we offer all of that in one ecosystem,” he noted.</p>
<p>With this latest round of funding, Friedman says Karma will focus on doubling the size of its team within the next year. The company also plans to add more features to the tool in the future and continue to heavily invest in AI and machine learning. Additionally, Karma will focus on finding ways to grow its userbase.</p>
<p>Karma currently has around three million customers and around 650,000 monthly active users. Its userbase has been growing between 15% to 20% month-over-month, and Karma users have saved a total of over $144 million so far this year.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of our customers are millennials, followed by Gen Z. I think it’s important to point out that we do not attract the typical coupon-hunters, that’s not our audience, Friedman stated. &#8220;Our audience is a high-quality shopping audience because if you look at the average order value across our merchant partners, the average order value is over $100. We are extremely strong in the higher end, so we do not attract the typical coupon audience at all. We attract an audience that wants to shop smarter or wants to automate a big part of the shopping journey. Obviously, no one wants to overpay so we also want to make sure that you never pay more than you should,” he added.</p>
<p>As for the future, Friedman said Karma is not only focused on the pre-purchasing journey for its users but is also looking at moving into point of sale and post-purchase strategies, as well.</p>
<p>Essentially, Karma is “creating the biggest shopping network in the world,” he believes, and it can become the market leader in automating the shopping experience. He noted that the company plans to improve users’ shopping journeys by launching additional services and features, some of which are scheduled to launch by the end of the year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.getmayd.com/">Mayd</a> has spied an opportunity to build out a medicine delivery platform in Europe which partners with the small-scale pharmacies that tend to be the norm on the continent, capitializing on how the pandemic has generally accelerated demand for on-demand delivery.</p>
<p>The startup, which was only founded at the beginning of this year, has bagged €13 million ($15M) in seed funding from 468 Capital, Earlybird and Target Global to build out its vision of delivering meds to Europeans&#8217; doors fast &#8212; within 30 minutes if they&#8217;re ordered before noon (or the next day, at a selected slot starting from 8am).</p>
<p>Regulatory restrictions and fragmentation across Europe, with a patchwork of per-country rules around prescriptions, may explain why this use-case hasn&#8217;t already been sewn up by a handful of pharmacy or platform giants.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217955" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The picture for medicine delivery in Europe is very different vs the US, per Mayd co-founder Lukas Pieczonka, who notes that a patchwork of rules can apply in different countries in Europe &#8212; including (still) some limitations on e-prescriptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the US companies they are pharmacies. So they have a pharmacy licence for every state or for a selected number of states and they are operating as a pharmacy. For us it&#8217;s not true &#8212; we are a platform for pharmacies and for consumers,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be a pharmacy. We will heavily work in a very tight way with our partners but we are not a pharmacy. I think this is the biggest difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Germany, where Mayd is starting out, the country is in the process of gearing up for an e-prescription system that&#8217;s due to go live in January &#8212; as part of wider moves to digitize healthcare services (such as by bringing in electronic patient records).</p>
<p>Such per country regulations likely (partly) explains the meaty size of Mayd&#8217;s seed raise, along with the usual tech and recruitment challenges of scaling an urban logistics app business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In Germany there is a different situation who can deliver medicine. At the end the pharmacist needs control of the delivery process which is slightly different from the typical delivery model,&#8221; notes Pieczonka. &#8220;We set up an infrastructure where [the pharmacist] can really control what kind of rider is now delivering what to whom&#8230; If the pharmacist, for example, puts the wrong medicine in the bag or something you should always be able to stop the delivery.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly there&#8217;s a lot of regulatory stuff you need to also implement in your marketplace&#8230; so it&#8217;s not like you can just add it if you&#8217;re a food delivery or whatever delivery. You really need to focus on the specific segment in order to also have the credibility for the pharmacies.&#8221;</p>
<p>From next year, Germans will be able to get a digital prescription from their doctor which they can send to a pharmacy to fulfil &#8212; with reimbursement of the associated health insurance claim tied in.</p>
<p>Doing e-prescription delivery also means integrating with specific pharmacy infrastructure &#8212; which in Germany will involve the use of QR codes.</p>
<p>So again it&#8217;s not just another product that can be slung in the backpack of a gigging food delivery rider.</p>
<p>That said, European regulations haven&#8217;t been a complete blocker to launching such a model earlier, per Pieczonka. But he argues the timing is right now &#8212; with growing digitization of healthcare services and people in the region far more open to app-based delivery and convenience than they may have been pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;In general we could have done this model two years ago. Actually this was also the first thing we were wondering why there&#8217;s no one doing it in Germany &#8212; or probably in France or in different other big European countries. And actually we didn&#8217;t really find an answer. But what we found on our way there is that there are some regulatory tweaks for every country that you need to first crack until you can manage to really operate,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we went through different topics &#8212; groceries, food delivery, beverages &#8212; you see almost everything gets delivered instantly. But something that you really need if you are sick and you really don&#8217;t want to go out is medicine &#8212; so this is something where we said hey this really makes sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting there are a number of telehealth platforms operating private services in Europe that can deliver prescription medicine directly and speedily following a virtual consultation with a doctor &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/12/kry-bags-66m-to-launch-its-video-call-a-doctor-service-in-more-european-markets/">Sweden&#8217;s Kry</a>.</p>
<p>But &#8212; again &#8212; Mayd argues there&#8217;s room for multiple models to get meds to Europeans&#8217; doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will see different approaches &#8212; one solution is just sending your prescription to a pharmacy so you can pick it up, the other tells you which pharmacy probably has it in stock, the other one tells you where you probably get the cheapest price for you product. But these are all single solutions and we think you need to integrate,&#8221; says Pieczonka.</p>
<p>Mayd is gearing up for Germany switching on reimbursement for e-prescriptions next year by launching a service now, ahead of that change &#8212; meaning initially it&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> limited to delivering only non-prescription items from pharmacy partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, from today, Berlin residents can kick the tyres of its delivery service to get non-prescription products like bandaids or baby formula delivered to their door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And while on-demand delivery platforms do exist in some European markets that could speedily deliver the same sort of (non-prescription) stuff you could buy in a pharmacy &#8212; Spain&#8217;s Glovo, for example, touts itself as a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/"> &#8216;deliver anything&#8217; app</a> &#8212; Mayd argues there&#8217;s room for a specialist platform for pharmacies given complex and variable requirements around delivering prescriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">From January, Mayd will be able to take orders for prescription items &#8212; linking patients to pharmacies that will process their prescriptions; pack their medicines for delivery (fulfilled by its e-bike or scooter riding delivery staff who are <em>not</em> gig workers but full time employees); and provide advice to the patient, either via a phone call or in text form through its app based on the patient&#8217;s preference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">No prescription will be delivered prior to the patient receiving advice from the pharmacists about how to take the medication and potential side effects, per Pieczonka. </span></p>
<p>Mayd&#8217;s delivery service <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is starting in the German capital &#8212; where he says it has most of the city covered by pharmacy partners (it has around 30 so far) but needs to add more to reach the outskirts of Berlin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pieczonka also says Mayd will also be expanding the service </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to other cities in Germany this year &#8212; touting an addressable market of €60BN across the country as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">s ambitions don&#8217;t stop there, though, as it&#8217;s eyeing wider European expansion. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">No decisions have been made on which other regional markets to target yet &#8212; but Pieczonka sounds confident the model can scale.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our first focus is on Germany because it&#8217;s the biggest market in Europe and if we crack this we can also go to other countries. At the end you also see a bigger trend that everyone gets delivered their stuff &#8212; so there&#8217;s no reason why people in Spain or Italy or France or wherever shouldn&#8217;t get [medicines] delivered,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Mayd&#8217;s business model in Germany is to take a commission from pharmacies on sales of any non-prescription items it routes to them &#8212; and a delivery fee (or listing platform fee) for fulfilling e-prescription deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the last 12 months, <a href="https://outschool.com/">Outschool</a>, a marketplace for kid-friendly enrichment classes, has raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/outschool-newly-profitable-raises-a-45m-series-b-for-virtual-small-group-classes/">Series B</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">Series C</a> and, now, it&#8217;s Series D. The startup announced today that its latest round, a $110 million tranche of capital, brings its valuation to $3 billion just four months after hitting unicorn status.</p>
<p>The fast infusion of capital was in response to the virtual programming demands triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Outschool today is offering over 140,000 virtual, small-group classes to students between the ages of 3 and 18. The startup also grew its base of teachers, who lead these classes, from less than 600 people to over 7,000 today, leading to an increase of bookings of 150% in the same time period.</p>
<p>“We were an early stage startup, we had very, very promising growth and a vision for the future, which resulted in our Series A round of funding,” said CEO and co-founder Amir Nathoo. “Suddenly, we’ve rapidly had to accelerate to being a growth stage company, we’ve gone from 25 employees to 164, and single digit millions of bookings to over $100 million in bookings.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217932" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Outschool’s growth tear is impressive, it comes with an asterisk of a question: does growth-stage company culture mix well with a mission of serving children? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">As concerns rise</a> over the impact of platforms like Instagram on kids, younger startups are under more pressure to show how to align business incentives, and their impressionable user base.</p>
<p>Nathoo thinks fears of large companies with big platforms that aim toward children are a “reasonable concern.” In fact, he thinks about this dynamic a lot.</p>
<p>“We’ve been venture-funded from the very start, and I hope our actions, and how we go about our work reflects our values,” he said. “The fact that venture funding hasn’t affected the fact that we’re a mission-driven company and values-driven company, and that’s not going to change.” In its previous fundraise, Outschool announced that it has dedicated <a href="https://blog.outschool.com/outschool-secures-75m-series-c-funding-to-inspire-kids-to-love-learning/">2% of its stock to reward teachers</a>, in the event of liquidity. It also established Outschool.org, which has doled out $2,500,000 worth of classes for free to low-income families in the U.S. Finally, the startup has been strict about how ownership on its cap table works as to stay in control of business decisions, but Nathoo didn’t provide more details on the intricacies of how that looks.</p>

<p>The co-founder also thinks there are many advantages to venture funding for Outschool customers, namely that the platform can afford to invest ahead of its revenue to make the product better. It means more unique classes, network effects, and better scale.</p>
<p>“We have prioritized expansion of Outschool this year so we are not focused on profitability,” he added. “As such, hence the latest funding raise, we are not at profitability at this time.”</p>

<p>This ethos in mind, it makes sense that Outschool’s big goal in the growth-stage is to shift its concentration of customers from single consumers, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/employers-are-consumer-edtechs-next-beta-test/">enterprise deals through schools or employer benefits. </a>The strategy shift, Nathoo describes, will take payment pressure off of parents and thus promote accessibility for its after school classes. He hopes that, in the next five years, more than half of the enrollments on the platform are coming from employers and schools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>In recent months, Outschool’s employer benefit offering has attracted significant interest. Over the past year, employees have spent over $1.1 million in employer-paid credits on Outschool.</p>
<p>The company curates landing pages on behalf of employers, who then offer the service to working parents. Outschool also offers a concierge service in which parents can share their kids’ interests and availability, and an Outschool team member will book classes on their behalf with employer-paid credits. Beyond these efforts, the company created a dashboard that human resource teams can use to understand how their employee base is engaging with classes and topics, and then draw conclusions on how the benefit impacts overall retention.</p>
<p>Nathoo’s true idea of the future, though, lies in how his product will go in schools. The company wants to build onboarding and enrollment into schools, as well as get on the same wavelength as state and local regulators.</p>
<p>“I envision a world where kids are spending half of their time in K-12 education learning online with others,” he said. “There’s enormous value in having a local community, but also enormous value in being able to really personalize your learning and find others around the world who have exactly your interests and learn in the same way.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The industry will continue to see adoption across all areas, especially as more people are educated on finding the right product and modality and more states legalize cannabis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://dutchie.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dutchie</a>, a four-year-old, Bend, Oregon company that charges cannabis dispensaries a monthly fee to create and run their websites and manage orders, is on a roll this year, raising its second large round of funding &#8212; this time a $350 million Series D at a $3.75 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The new valuation is more than double what was announced in March when Dutchie brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million in Series C funding at a $1.7 billion valuation</a>.

<p>The latest funding round is led by D1 Capital Partners, with participation from existing investors, including Tiger Global, Dragoneer, DFJ Growth, Thrive Capital, Gron Ventures and Casa Verde Capital. New investors include Willoughby Capital, Glynn Capital and Park West Asset Management.

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In new round, Dutchie, focused on smoother cannabis retail, sees its valuation soar by eight times&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/embed/#?secret=52ZxCuQfO6" data-secret="52ZxCuQfO6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dutchie co-founder and CEO Ross Lipson spoke to me yesterday about the company’s serious tailwinds, driven by the societal shift of wider adoption of cannabis products, health and wellness benefits and more states passing friendlier regulations.</p>
<p>“The verdict is out, and cannabis is a force for good. That is the biggest development we are excited about,” Lipson told TechCrunch. “The cannabis space is the fastest growing industry, up 35% year over year. Dutchie is working with over 5,000 dispensaries in North America and processed $14 billion in annualized sales for those dispensaries. We’ve seen 100% year over year growth with dispensaries.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Dutchie is continuously working to propel the industry forward with continuous education on the benefits of cannabis and backing more legalizations and regulatory work. Cannabis is seeing more startups bringing technology into the fold, attracting talent and investment. In April, Crunchbase reported that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/cannabis-startups-navigate-regulations-lack-of-capital-to-plant-industry-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$357 million was invested into cannabis companies so far in 2021</a>, while forecasters say <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-cannabis-market-size-projection-100-billion-by-2030-2020-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis will be a $100 billion industry in the U.S. by 2030</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/these-5-vcs-have-high-hopes-for-cannabis-in-2021/">TechCrunch spoke to cannabis venture capital investors</a>. Morgan Paxhia, managing director of Poseidon Investment Management, said that “2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&amp;A and new innovative startups coming on scene.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lipson said Dutchie had a long relationship with D1 Capital, and along with existing investors, kept in constant communication about the business and its customers. To keep up with demand, both Dutchie and D1 decided it was the right time for an investment to accelerate the mission to streamline dispensary operations.</p>
<p>Dutchie has already made a $100 million commitment to invest in R&amp;D over the next 12 months, so that is where some of the new funding will be deployed, Lipson said. He is also adding to the company’s employee base of 500 people across 40 states and Canada.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now that the company has entered Series D territory, I asked Lipson if an IPO was part of the company’s future goals, and he said “we are always looking at all opportunities.”</p>
<p>As for the future of the cannabis industry, he said we will continue to see adoption across all areas, especially as more people are educated on finding the right product and modality and more states legalize cannabis.</p>
<p>“There are more initiatives, like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safe Banking Act</a> to help banks provide services for cannabis-related businesses and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Act</a>,” he added. “We don’t see federal legalization in the near term, but are optimistic that it will come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neobank wave is beginning to take shape in Africa, particularly in Nigeria, where new fintechs are trying to take on legacy banks by providing cheaper and more personalized banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkle, founded by an ex-CEO of a former Nigerian incumbent bank, is one such fintech, and it has closed a seed round of $3.1 million to scale operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerians have a love-hate relationship with traditional banks. Even though</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the number of active bank accounts in the country is <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2020/09/10/may-2020-active-bank-accounts-in-nigeria-surge-14-41-to-111-5-million-as-covid-19-drives-account-opening/">above 100 million</a> (from a population of about 200 million), problems around inefficient service delivery, serial downtimes, and bad loans and experiences have made many people distrust banking services.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217234" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neobanks sensed an opportunity and are vying for the attention of these banked but unsatisfied customers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkle, like any neobank in the market, is counting on standard features such savings, bill payments, top-ups, requesting or sending funds, as well as less common features &#8212; like bill splitting and reviewing spending breakdowns &#8212; to attract customers in a crowded market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re quite different in a way because instead of separating financial services from lifestyle, we&#8217;ve tried to bring them together, especially as we&#8217;ve seen that more people are beginning to lead more digitally-led lives,&#8221; CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/uzomadozie">Uzoma Dozie</a> said to TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It means that we don&#8217;t see our customers from accounts, payments, deposits or credit perspectives, but from how can we help them do what they want to do at any particular time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; So that&#8217;s Sparkle&#8217;s pitch &#8212; to provide financial, lifestyle and business support services to Nigerians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, the company launched Sparkle Business to acquire a different set of underserved users: small and medium businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkle claims the new business arm has caught on well with this category, which now has access to inventory and invoice management, tax advice, and payroll and employee management services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses can access these features with a tax identification number (TIN) and an email address &#8212; the lowest form of documentation in the market for businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2217958" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2217958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2217958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?w=621" alt="Sparkle" width="621" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?resize=274,300 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?resize=768,841 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?resize=621,680 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sparkle-Fundraise.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2217958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sparkle</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkle&#8217;s mix of providing banking services to individuals and businesses on a single platform is unique. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other neobanks in the country &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Kuda</a>, VBank, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Carbon</a> &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to offer tailored services to individuals. At the same time, platforms including Brass and Prospa cater to varying sizes of businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As a small business, I&#8217;m not carrying my bank account on my mobile. I&#8217;m carrying my business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we are bringing everything about your business into one place so that you can do business wherever you are,&#8221; Dozie said. &#8220;For individuals, we&#8217;re bringing everything into one place so that you can do what you want to do quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wherever you are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the bottom line is that we&#8217;re providing you with the information that you need to take spontaneous decisions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozie highlights some features of Sparkle that customers might hardly get with other platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, customers can check the transaction history with a particular beneficiary without browsing through a financial statement, confirm the location where they made each transaction,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and schedule payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sparkle&#8217;s design is also tailored to how most Nigerians operate their lives offline. Customers can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounts (personal and business) and switch whenever they want to on Sparkle. They can use the platform on various</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phones with the same enhanced security as other platforms that allow login on a single phone, Dozie said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching last year, the neobank has acquired over 40,000 customers on the individual banking side and 2,000 businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company began charging individual customers small fees to keep their accounts running and plans to charge businesses for most features except taxation services, said Dozie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to most digital banks in the country, Sparkle has a microfinance bank license. It has also secured a partnership with Visa to allow users to make in-person or digital payments with a Visa card. Other partnerships are with companies like Network International and PwC Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone knowledgeable on how the Nigerian fintech space works knows it can take some time to secure licenses and partnerships. Sparkle has been able to do so in under a year due to its CEO&#8217;s vast experience and connections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Sparkle, Dozie was the CEO and last group managing director of Diamond Bank. He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> oversaw the bank&#8217;s corporate, commercial and retail arms before its merger with Access Bank; the business is now 29 million customers strong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>With Sparkle, Dozie is keen on expanding the capabilities of Nigeria&#8217;s banking and retail sectors, continuing from where he left off at Diamond Bank. As an investor himself, he enlisted an all-Nigerian cast for his seed round &#8212; lead investor <span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadway Assurance, participant Trium Network and a few unnamed high-net-worth individuals. The investment comes after Sparkle closed a </span>friends and family pre-seed round of $2 million within the past year.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He opined that while he could have raised money from foreign investors, he chose to go with this group of investors because they provide the experience and market that Sparkle needs to scale in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He was also keen on getting high-net-worth individuals to invest in a tech company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as a group of investors and business builders, we are Nigerians who are bullish about Nigeria and the opportunity the country presents </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building global networks and communities, all via one app,&#8221; the CEO said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO told TechCrunch that Sparkle will use the investment for two purposes: building robotic process automation to help with mundane and repetitive processes, then hiring talent across engineering, finance risk and marketing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://sumup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SumUp</a>, a European-based competitor to Square, PayPal/iZettle and others that provide mobile-powered card readers and other sales technology to merchants and small businesses, has made an acquisition in the U.S. to dig deeper into that market, and to expand the kinds of services that it provides to customers globally.</p>
<p>The company has acquired <a href="https://www.fivestars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fivestars</a>, which provides loyalty, marketing, payments and other services to small merchants, used by some 70 million consumers and 12,000 businesses in the U.S.. London-based SumUp said it will be paying $317 million in a combination of cash and stock for the San Francisco startup.</p>
<p>That is a bump up on the startup&#8217;s valuation as a private company. According to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54557-38/company/profile#deal-history/157699-90T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>, FiveStars &#8212; which was originally incubated in Y Combinator and later backed by VCs that included Salt Partners, Lightspeed, DCM Ventures, Menlo Ventures and HarbourVest Partners &#8212; was last valued at $285 million post-money when it raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/fivestars-series-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series D of $52.5 million a year ago,</a> in October 2020.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Fivestars sold up, nor whether it was proactively approached or looking for a buyer, but you can&#8217;t help but wonder what kind of an impact the last year and a half, where a lot of people turned away from shopping in person due to the pandemic, had on the company&#8217;s business &#8212; which is largely predicated on in-person transactions.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, SumUp buying Fivestars now represents how it will be doubling down on the opportunity ahead now that people and merchants <em>are</em> coming back into the physical shopping fold.</p>
<p>SumUp got its start in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/make-way-for-another-european-square-sumup-launches-with-20m-in-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012</a> as one of the many Square clones emerging out of Europe at a time when the U.S. company had yet to expand outside of its home market. Since then it has diversified into online payments, invoicing and other services needed by merchants and other small businesses. And it has grown. Today the company has more than 3 million merchant users in 34 markets, scale that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/sumup-which-helps-businesses-take-card-payments-raises-895m-to-double-down-on-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helped it raise nearly $900 million in debt</a> earlier this year to fuel further expansion.</p>
<p>That funding has been used both to continue building out SumUp&#8217;s platform and footprint in existing markets, as well as to move into new territories.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although SumUp has in theory been active in the U.S. for a couple of years, its presence there is modest, admitted Andrew Helms, SumUp&#8217;s managing director in the country. So this acquisition &#8212; SumUp&#8217;s first in the country &#8212; will be used to get a deeper foothold in that market.</p>
<p>Fivestars is a popular product, and SumUp hopes to leverage that existing business, which Fivestars says drives more than $3 billion in sales and 100 million transactions per year, to grow its own relationships with merchants, specifically signing them up to SumUp&#8217;s own card readers and other sales technology. Helms confirmed that the plan will be to keep Fivestars&#8217; branding for now and to work on integrating its product more closely into SumUp&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>Victor Ho, Fivestars&#8217; co-founder and CEO, will also be staying on, along with the rest of the company&#8217;s SF-based team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded Fivestars to give small businesses the opportunity to thrive in the digital economy and over the years, we&#8217;ve achieved just that,&#8221; Ho said in a statement. &#8220;Understanding that SumUp shares this mission, it was an easy decision to partner, and together, we look forward to supporting a retail market that champions small business success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acquiring Fivestars also makes a lot of sense in the context of how SumUp has grown. Part of its strategy has always been to pursue inorganic expansion, and over the years that has including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/sumup-and-payleven-merge-as-european-square-clones-consolidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merging with Payleven</a>, another Square clone originally incubated by Berlin&#8217;s Rocket Internet; and buying<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/sumup-acquires-multi-channel-e-commerce-platform-shoplo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> and integrating Shoplo</a> to give its merchants the ability to sell across multiple marketplaces online.</p>
<p>Notably, SumUp didn&#8217;t have a loyalty product before this, so there will likely be opportunities to bring Fivestars&#8217; technology for the first time into other markets outside of the U.S., such as in Europe and Latin America, where SumUp is already active.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company has raised a $1 million seed round to enhance its platform and scale in Asia. Norwegian investor </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.kistefos.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kistefos</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Markel Digital Investment and an angel investor participated in the latest round. Antler joined in its previous funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In June 2021, Surer added a new feature, the Instant Quote Marketplace, which allows users to get quotations automatically and instantaneously. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company is currently operating its service in Singapore, but plans to enter other markets like Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Gordon Tay said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are focusing on building a digital ecosystem that serves for parties creating (the insurers) and distributing (the intermediaries) insurance products, and we run a B2B2C model,” co-founder Gordon Tay said. It is opposed to many other insurtech companies that operate an aggregator model, going direct to the consumer (B2C), he added.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Surer claims that it has seen strong traction with more than 350 intermediary signups and demo requests. Approximately $1 million in gross written premiums (GWP) was transacted, and the company expects to generate $1.5 million in GWP transactions by the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Asia’s general insurance market is about $564 billion, and Singapore has approximately $2.9 billion, Gordon Tay mentioned. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similar models to Surer outside of Southeast Asia include WeFox in Europe and Turtlemint in India, which have proven successful, Gordon Tay noted. </span></p>
<p>There are other insurtech players like online brokers &#8212; including Singapore’s MoneySmart and PolicyPal, and India’s PolicyBazaar and Indonesia’s PasarPolis, and Malaysia’s PolicyStreet &#8212; which are not Surer’s competitors but can be partners. The online brokers create products underwritten by the insurers and then sell them directly to consumers through their online platform. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">They can list their products on Surer’s platform (the Instant Quote Marketplace) and leverage the Surer intermediary force as an additional distribution channel (in addition to their online channel), Tay explained. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Kistefos has a strong investment portfolio in Norway and Europe, including companies delivering financial services. We see huge potential in Asian markets, and Surer has shown the ability to capitalize on the trend of digital transformation in the insurance industry in the region,” Bengt Rem, CEO of Kistefos, said. </span></p>
