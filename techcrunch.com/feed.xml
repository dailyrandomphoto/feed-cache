<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I handle people ops as a consultant at several different tech startups. Many have employees on OPT or STEM OPT who didn’t get selected in this year&#8217;s H-1B lottery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The companies want to retain these individuals, but they’re running out of options. Some companies will try again in next year’s H-1B lottery, even though they face long odds, particularly if the H-1B lottery becomes a wage-based selection process next year. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Others are looking into O-1A visas, but find that many employees don’t yet have the experience to meet the qualifications. Should we look at Canada?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Specialist in Silicon Valley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Specialist,</p>
<p>That’s what we’re all about &#8212; finding creative immigration solutions to help U.S. employers attract and retain international talent and help international talent reach their dreams of living and working in the United States.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sophie-alcorn/">written a lot</a> on how U.S. tech startups can keep their international team members in the United States. One strategy is to <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/038-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp-course/">help the startup employees become qualified for O-1As</a>. Another is to obtain <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-how-can-i-get-an-h-1b-without-the-lottery/">unlimited H-1B visas without the lottery</a> through nonprofit programs affiliated with universities. Sometimes candidates return to school for master’s degrees that offer a work option called CPT, or curricular practical training.</p>

<p>But sometimes, companies end up deciding to move some of their international talent to Canada to work remotely. Recently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcpavlopoulos/">Marc Pavlopoulos</a> and I discussed how to help U.S. employers and international talent on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/080-working-for-u-s-startups-from-canada-with-marc-pavlopoulos/">podcast</a>. Through his two companies, <a href="https://syndesus.com/">Syndesus</a> and <a href="https://www.path2canada.ca/">Path to Canada</a>, Pavlopoulos helps both U.S. tech employers and international tech talent when their employees or they themselves run out of immigration options in the United States. He most often assists U.S. tech employers when their current or prospective employees are not selected in the H-1B lottery.</p>
<p>Through Syndesus, a Canada-based remote employer — also known as a professional employment organization (PEO) — Pavlopoulos helps U.S. employers retain international tech workers who either no longer have visa or green card options that will enable them to remain in the United States or those who were born in India and are fed up by the decades-long wait for a U.S. green card. U.S. employers that don’t have an office in Canada can relocate these workers to Canada with the help of Syndesus, which employs these tech workers on behalf of the U.S. company, sponsoring them for a Canadian Global Talent Stream work visa.</p>
<p>Syndesus also helps U.S. tech startups without a presence in Canada find Canadian tech workers and employ them on the startup’s behalf. As an employer of record, Syndesus handles payroll, HR, healthcare, stock options and any issues related to Canadian employment law.</p>
<p>Pavlopoulos’ other company, Path to Canada, currently focuses on connecting international engineers and other tech talent working in the U.S. — including those whose <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/026-f-1-students-and-work/">OPT or STEM OPT</a> has run out — who cannot remain in the U.S. find employment in Canada, either at a Canadian company or at the Canadian office of a U.S. company. These employees get a Global Talent Stream work visa and eventually permanent residence in Canada. Pavlopoulos intends to expand Path to Canada to help tech talent from around the world live and work in Canada.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One year later, Clubhouse is finally out of beta. The company announced Wednesday that it would end its waitlist and invite system, opening up to everybody. Now, anybody can follow Clubhouse links, hop into a creator&#8217;s community or join any public event.</p>
<p>Clubhouse is also introducing a real logo that will look familiar — it&#8217;s basically a slightly altered version of the waving emoji the company already used. Clubhouse will still hold onto its app portraits, introducing a new featured icon from the Atlanta music scene to ring in the changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invite system has been an important part of our early history,&#8221; Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth wrote in a blog announcement. They note that adding users in waves and integrating new users into the app&#8217;s community through Town Halls and orientation sessions, helped Clubhouse grow at a healthy rate without breaking &#8220;but we’ve always wanted Clubhouse to be open.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s trajectory has been wild, even for a hot new social app. The then invite-only platform took off during the pandemic and inspired a wave of voice-based social networking that probably still isn&#8217;t anywhere near cresting. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> and everybody else eventually followed suit, splicing voice chat rooms and voice events into their existing platforms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N8FEpgKTIi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/embed/#?secret=N8FEpgKTIi" data-secret="N8FEpgKTIi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s rise is Interest in Clubhouse reached a fever-pitch early this year, and the app&#8217;s rise is inextricable from the pandemic-imposed social isolation that saw people around the globe desperate for ways to feel connected as the months dragged on.</p>
<p>The world is slowly, unevenly opening up and Clubhouse is gradually changing along with it. After a long iOS-only stretch, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/clubhouse-android-app-launch/">introduced an Android app in May</a>. Now, Clubhouse says they&#8217;ve reached 10 million Clubhouse downloads in the Android app&#8217;s first two months. And earlier this month, Clubhouse introduced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/"> text-based chat feature called Backchannel</a> that broadened the singularly voice-centric app&#8217;s focus for the first time.</p>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s success is a double-edged sword. The app&#8217;s meteoric rise came as a surprise to the team, as meteoric rises often do. The social app is still a wild success by normal metrics in a landscape completely dominated by a handful of large, entrenched platforms, but it&#8217;s difficult to maintain momentum – or at least the perception of momentum. Opening the app up to everybody should certainly help.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">New predictions indicate that tech companies committing to accessibility will reap a total of<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forrester/2021/07/01/how-10b-in-design-spending-will-soon-be-up-for-grabs-annually/?sh=4ed7ef021ea9"> $10 billion to $16 billion</a> in annual design spending across the U.S. and Canada. The surge in funds reinforces accessibility as not only an ethical priority, but a financial one, too.</p>
<p>Accessibility isn’t, like many believe, kryptonite for profits. It is a moneymaker. One, because making your product accessible adds an additional<strong> <em>multitude </em></strong>of people to your potential market. Two, because it actually optimizes your workflow by accounting for more issues beforehand. Three, because it will come back to bite you on the ass with hefty lawsuits and public exposure (read: profit and customer loss) if you ignore it. If anything, remember this: The cost of noncompliance is about <a href="https://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/true-cost-compliance/">three times higher</a> than that of complying.</p>
<p>Today, we’re seeing something similar to what happened with diversity and inclusion: While many businesses used to consider D&amp;I a headache, we’ve since woken up to the fact that having a diversity of genders, ages and ethnicities has a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2018/01/25/more-evidence-that-company-diversity-leads-to-better-profits/?sh=418483251bc7"> direct effect on the bottom lines</a> of companies. The same realization will come with accessibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At its core, accessibility means making your product as usable as possible to the greatest number of people. The appeal and efficiency that entails correlates to higher revenue. So here’s why all businesses can achieve a high ROI from paying attention to accessibility, and how to optimize those returns.</p>
<h2>Start by making your teams aware of what they’re missing</h2>
<p>Having a training strategy in your business can <a href="https://www.ripleytraining.co.uk/blog/how-can-training-boost-your-profits/">drive your profits up</a> by nearly 50%. When educating your team about accessibility, you’re not just giving them new skills to raise productivity, you’re optimizing their workflow for the long run and fostering a healthier team culture.</p>

			Making your product accessible adds an additional multitude of people to your potential market and optimizes your workflow by accounting for more issues beforehand.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>What many teams aren’t understanding today is that accessibility simply opens a product to more users. If we don’t make our employees aware of this, they’ll continue to shy away from the word “accessibility” because they think it means being walled in by some unintelligible regulations. But when we make that process easy to digest for the whole team and create a shared language on accessibility, we make it easier to understand the ultimate goal: smarter design and development.</p>
<p>There<em> are</em> simple ways for businesses to get their heads around accessibility, from IBM’s<a href="https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/"> Equal Access Toolkit</a> to Microsoft&#8217;s<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/"> inclusive design</a> page to the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">A11Y Project</a>. However, there has been a concerning lack of access to free accessibility resources, which is a key issue that our wider community is <a href="https://www.getstark.co/library/resources">trying to change</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s get into the specifics: Through awareness and training, you will start convincing your team about the importance of accessibility so they can commit to it wholeheartedly, not only for the sake of users but because it will improve their own work experience. Working with accessibility in mind makes employees’ work processes more efficient and reduces the cost of errors happening down the line. Moreover, managers will expend fewer resources supervising work to make sure it&#8217;s compliant or reworking designs that don’t meet the mark.</p>
<p>Employees will understand the needs of customers far more if they’re made aware of the varied ways different people interact with a product. We’re not talking about a statistically insignificant group: People with disabilities are the largest minority in the United States.<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html#:~:text=61%20million%20adults%20in%20the,is%20highest%20in%20the%20South."> One in four</a> U.S. adults suffer from a disability, and globally, we’re talking about<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability#:~:text=Results-,One%20billion%20people%2C%20or%2015%25%20of%20the%20world's%20population%2C,million%20people%2C%20experience%20significant%20disabilities."> 1 billion</a> people &#8212; but far more when you account for the many individuals who can’t or won’t go to the doctor or aren’t diagnosed at all. You’ve probably experienced this, too. Temporary disabilities — like having your arm in a cast for a couple of months or recovering from a serious operation — will affect your ability to use certain products if they haven’t been made with you in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, providing this conscious training lets your staff know you are open to having conversations on how to improve work conditions and culture. A happy team is a more resilient team that will stick with you on your product journey, avoiding the costs of recruiting new hires.</p>
<h2>Better testing, better efficiency</h2>
<p>As your product grows, it becomes less and less malleable. It’s harder to fix the first row of bricks on a new house if you’re already building the second and third stories.</p>
<p>That’s why we need to rethink testing. Continuously trying out your product will tell you what needs tweaking as you advance. The problem is, people with disabilities are being excluded from the testing process. And even when they do appear in data sets, their data are often <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/flawed-data-is-putting-people-with-disabilities-at-risk/">treated as anomalies</a> because they don’t follow the patterns we’re used to seeing from able-bodied people.</p>
<p>Fixing this starts with how we envision our target market. Do you have people with disabilities — and that includes the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170605-the-hidden-challenges-of-invisible-disabilities"> invisible ones</a> — in your target user base? As part of your personality profiles? In other words, are you reaching out to and including them, or are they more of a bycatch you don’t expect to see using your product?</p>
<p>Then test for qualitative as well as quantitative input. Get diverse users into the “office,” ask them how they feel about navigating your product. Did it take them time to learn how a certain feature worked? Was something a complete roadblock? We need to understand how they interact with your software as much as the data coming in on retention and time spent per visit.</p>
<p>This has a direct impact on your bottom line. Compliance issues cause a world of pain further on in your journey, when you’re paying <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/21/beyonce-lawsuit-website-ada-compliant/">hefty fines</a> and rebuilding core elements of your product. Lawsuits against allegedly inaccessible websites are rising, and last year <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2021/04/federal-website-accessibility-lawsuits-increased-in-2020-despite-mid-year-pandemic-lull/">over 2,500</a> were filed.</p>
<p>With more accurate testing, your processes will become more efficient because you’re understanding where and when in your product lifecycle you need to insert tools and make changes. Essentially, you’ll optimize your workflow. You’ll advance in a straight line as you iterate, rather than having to pause production to go back and make adaptations as and when you realize they’re needed. You’ll launch and get your product into consumers’ hands faster.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’ll be testing within a diverse community that is personally invested in your product’s success — that will give you quicker and more detailed feedback loops.</p>
<h2>Create an internal accessibility team</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s job to understand accessibility. However, there will always be people who are specifically focused on ensuring product design, development and marketing initiatives are met.</p>
<p>This group of people should be responsible for upskilling others about accessibility and being the go-to for inclusive design. A company of a few hundred people could assign the task to about 10 people. But at an early-stage startup, it is not enough to just put one or two people on the job. Making accessibility a core part of design and development needs to be baked into the wider culture for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Your long-term returns on assigning a few people to carry out the process accurately will always be higher than the initial expense. Those people will ensure each team is working optimally for all of its users and in sync with one another, rather than wasting valuable time working to lower standards.</p>
<p>It’s better to keep this special team in-house not only to save money but because these are people who already eat, sleep and breathe your product. When bringing in outsiders, whether or not they’re experts, there will always be something of a gap between what they need to know to help and how much you can give as a company. That means any issues that in-house team members aren’t yet aware of, or can’t yet conceptualize, will probably remain unaddressed.</p>
<h2>Be smart about how you allocate your budget</h2>
<p>You can’t think in the short term when you decide where to put your money. Today’s businesses are designed to steer budgets toward the most tangible and immediate returns. Yet pouring cash into growing fast and furiously, selling quick and cashing in, simply isn’t that simple. Companies won’t buy a product that’s flawed. Brands don’t hold up when there’s little thought going into the product and who’s using it. Consumers won’t fall in love with you.</p>
<p>Strong business leaders will see that there is a time horizon to any investment. Inclusive design is both a cost-saving model and a profit builder, but you won’t see that from one day to the next. You’ll see that when users come to you that you wouldn’t have reached otherwise, and when you avoid the pitfalls that can not only cost, but take down, a company.</p>
<p>So allocate an accessibility budget alongside the product roadmap, from start to finish, taking into account purchasing specialized tools, educating your team and spending time designing your testing strategy, among other things. Set deadlines for accomplishing each goal, and allocate separate resources and timelines per process &#8212; it’s better to start with quick wins on newer projects so your team can see and feel the reward, then repeat. You may be spending more at the start as you educate your team, design your testing strategy or purchase specialized tools.</p>
<p>What you don’t want to see in your company is the accessibility conversation, budget and action plan concentrated toward the end of your product development journey. By then, it will be more about fixing what’s wrong than getting it right, at greater cost to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is giving its Alexa voice platform a shot in the arm after seeing <a href="https://voicebot.ai/2020/10/25/amazon-alexa-skill-growth-has-slowed-further-in-2020/">further declines in skill growth</a> over the past year, indicating lagging interest from third-party voice app developers. At the company&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-live">Alexa Live developer event</a> today, the company announced a slew of new features and tools for the developer community &#8212; its largest release of new tools to date, in fact. Among the new releases are those to encourage Alexa device owners to discover and engage with Alexa skills, new tools for making money from skills, and other updates that will push customers to again make Alexa more a part of their daily routines.</p>
<p>The retailer&#8217;s hopes for Alexa as voice shopping platform <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-reality-behind-voice-shopping-hype">may have not panned out</a> as it had hoped, as only a sliver of Alexa customers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/shopping-via-smart-speakers-is-not-taking-off-report-suggests/">actually made</a> Amazon.com purchases through the smart speakers. However, the larger Alexa footprint and developer community remains fairly sizable, Amazon said today, noting there are &#8220;millions&#8221; of Alexa devices used &#8220;billions of times&#8221; every week, and over 900,000 registered developers who have published over 130,000 Alexa skills.</p>
<p>Still, Amazon hasn&#8217;t yet solved the challenge of helping customers find and discover skills they want to use &#8212; something that&#8217;s been historically difficult on voice-only devices. That&#8217;s improved somewhat with the launch of Alexa devices with screens, like the Alexa Show, which offers a visual component.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But largely, Alexa device owners <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/purchases-via-smart-speakers-are-not-taking-off">continue to use its most basic functions</a> &#8212; smart home control, playing music, setting alarms and reminders, making lists, and other simple queries. It has yet to produce what would be considered, by most,<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-11/amazon-s-alexa-has-80-000-apps-and-no-runaway-hit?sref=gni836kR"> a &#8220;runaway hit&#8221; voice app. </a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2150981" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2150981" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2150981" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg 1901w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Echo-Show-8_Glacier-White_Side-Table.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2150981" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>In an attempt to tackle this problem with more features, Amazon says it will introduce a way for developers to create Widgets for their skills which customers can then add to their Echo Show or other Alexa device with a screen sometime later this year. Developers will also be able to build Featured Skill Cards to promote their skills in the home screen rotation.</p>
<p>In other words, Amazon&#8217;s solution is to make Alexa more like a mobile device in terms of app discovery. While perhaps useful to those who have Alexa devices with screens, that doesn&#8217;t bode well for Alexa&#8217;s future as a voice-only platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for voice-only devices, developers will now be able to have their skill suggested when Alexa responds to common requests, like &#8220;Alexa, tell me a story,&#8221; &#8220;Alexa, let&#8217;s play a game,&#8221; or &#8220;Alexa, I need a workout,&#8221; among others. And Alexa will begin to offer personalized skill suggestions based on customers&#8217; use of similar skills, while new &#8220;contextual discovery&#8221; mechanisms that will allow customers to use natural language and phrases to accomplish tasks across skills. Of course, Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/amazon-alexa-now-responds-to-certain-questions-with-skills-that-can-help-you-when-alexa-cant/">tried other ways of suggesting skills before now</a>, but those impacts have been negligible on the larger skill ecosystem. (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/amazon-echo-how-to-turn-off-alexas-unwanted-by-the-way-suggestions/">Some efforts even annoyed users</a>.)</p>
<p>Amazon also said it&#8217;s expanding the ways developers can get paid for their skills.</p>
<p>Already, it offers tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/alexa-skills-can-now-offer-one-time-use-purchases-like-in-game-hints-or-points/">consumables</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/amazon-introduces-subscriptions-for-alexa-skills-makes-them-free-for-prime-members/">paid subscriptions</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/alexa-in-skill-purchasing-which-lets-developers-make-money-from-voice-apps-launches-internationally/">in-skill purchases.</a> Now, it will add support for Paid Skills, a new in-skill purchase that allows customers to pay a one-time fee to access the content a skill provides. It will also now expand in-skill purchases to India and Canada. So far, in-skill purchases have yet to drive significant revenue. A <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-learns-a-new-skill-making-money-from-alexa">2019 report</a> found that Alexa skill revenue in the first 10 months of the year was only $1.4 million,<a href="https://voicebot.ai/2019/12/16/amazon-brings-in-1-4-million-in-2019-of-alexa-skill-revenue-so-far-well-short-of-the-5-5-million-target-according-to-the-information/"> far short</a> of Amazon&#8217;s $5.5 million target. It&#8217;s uncertain that one more way to make a purchase will change that trend.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#8217;t speak to how much its developers made, instead saying only that developer revenue from in-skill purchases had &#8220;more than doubled&#8221; year-over-year.</p>
<p>Amazon will now attempt to leverage the developer community to drive sales on its retail site, too.</p>
<p>With new &#8220;Shopping Actions,&#8221; developers can sell Amazon products in their skill. For example, a role-playing game could suggest customers buy the tabletop version, as sci-fi game <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paizo-Alexa-Games-Starfinder/dp/B082SZRSRJ">Starfinder</a> does. Developers can also now earn affiliate revenue on their product referrals.</p>
<p>Music and media skill developers will be able to use new tools for more entertaining experiences, like a Song Request Skill that DJs can use to take song requests via Alexa, which <a href="https://www.iheartradio.ca/apps-en/Amazon-Alexa">iHeartRadio</a> will adopt. Others will shorten the time it takes for Radio, Podcast and Music providers to launch interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Other new features aim to make skills more practical and useful.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180487" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180487" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="490" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg 1210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?resize=768,628 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?resize=680,556 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-21-at-12.16.20-PM.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>For example, restaurants will gain access to a Food Skill API that will allow them to create pickup and delivery order experiences. A new &#8220;Send to Phone&#8221; feature will allow developers to connect their skill with mobile devices, and new event-based triggers and proactive suggestions will enable new experiences &#8212; like a skill that reminds users to lock their home when they are leaving. Amazon-owned Whole Foods will use these features for a curbside pickup experience arriving later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>Alexa replenishment support, which allows customers to reorder common household items like laundry detergent or batteries, will also expand to replacement parts to better tie in with other sorts of household and smart home devices. Thermostat makers Carrier and Resideo will use this to replenish air filters and Bissell will use this with its vacuum cleaners.</p>
<p>Menahile, safety device makers &#8212; like smoke, carbon-monoxide, and water leak detectors &#8212; will be able to tie into Alexa&#8217;s security system, Alexa Guard to send notifications to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Amazon is also introducing a set of new tools that make creating skills easier for developers, including the ability to use Alexa Entities, which is basically Amazon&#8217;s own set of general, Wikipedia-like knowledge. They&#8217;ll also gain access to new tools to aid with custom pronunciations plus the previously U.S.-only <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/conversations/about-alexa-conversations.html">Alexa Conversations nature language feature</a> (now in beta in Germany, developer preview in Japan, and live all English locales). A longer list of tools focus on regional expansions of existing toolkits (i.e. AVS, ACK), and others that enable better interoperability with smart home devices &#8212; like those that allow for unique wake words, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.upgrade.com">Upgrade</a> is launching a new credit card today. The Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card is a classic Visa credit card that works across the Visa network. But you get 1.5% in bitcoin rewards when you make payments.</p>
<p>Upgrade isn’t the first company to announce a credit card with bitcoin rewards — but it’s the first one that is generally available. If your application is approved, you can start using the virtual card immediately.</p>
<p>BlockFi announced its own credit card with bitcoin rewards in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockfi-announces-early-2021-launch-for-bitcoin-rewards-credit-card">December 2020</a>. Gemini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/gemini-is-launching-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">followed suit</a> quickly after. But those cards are still not generally available. A couple of weeks ago, BlockFi started <a href="https://blockfi.com/new-features-for-the-blockfi-rewards-visa-signature-credit-card">inviting people</a> on its waitlist. So a general rollout should come sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>As for the Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card, the company offers credit lines from $500 to $25,000 depending on your credit score. It works with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Like other Upgrade credit cards, there are no monthly fees, late fees or returned payment fees.</p>

<p>Essentially, this new card works pretty much like Upgrade’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/upgrade-adds-rewards-program-to-its-credit-card/">existing credit card</a>. But instead of getting 1.5% cash back on all purchases, you get 1.5% back in bitcoin — there’s no specific category, no<br />
partner retailer, no point system. It’s a straightforward, uncapped cash back program.</p>
<p>While you get rates that range between 8.99% and 29.99%, Upgrade encourages you to combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. Once you’ve done that, you pay equal monthly payments at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Upgrade Card is already delivering over $3 billion in annualized credit to consumers,&quot; co-founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche said in a statement. &quot;Starting today, anyone can apply for an Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card and enjoy the same affordable and responsible credit as with any Upgrade Card, plus the potential upside and fun of owning bitcoin.&quot;</p>
<p>The company has partnered with <a href="https://nydig.com">NYDIG</a> for the bitcoin rewards. Right now, you can’t do much with your bitcoins. You can choose to hold them or sell them. There’s no way to transfer your bitcoins to another wallet for instance. If you choose to sell your rewards, there’s a 1.5% transaction fee.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this card isn’t available in all 50 states. Customers in Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia can’t order a Upgrade Bitcoin Rewards Card at the moment.</p>
<p>Once again, Upgrade is diversifying its portfolio of products as a top-of-the-funnel strategy. By diversifying its credit card offering, it’ll lead to more personal loans down the road.</p>
<p>To be fair, Upgrade encourages you to pay down your debt as you receive your rewards when you make your monthly balance payments. But Upgrade wants to own the customer relationship so that you’ll think about them whenever you need a personal loan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The payments space &#8211; amazingly &#8211; remains up for grabs for startups. Yes dear reader, despite the success of Stripe, there seems to be a new payments startup virtually every other day. It’s a mess out there! The accelerated growth of e-commerce due to the pandemic means payments are now a booming space. And here comes another one, with a twist.</p>
<p><a href="https://whenthen.com/">WhenThen</a> has built a no-code payment operations platform that, they claim, streamlines the payment processes “of merchants of any kind”.  It says its platform can autonomously orchestrate, monitor, improve and manage all customer payments and payments ops.</p>
<p>The startup’s opportunity has arisen because service providers across different verticals increasingly want to get into open banking and provide their own payment solutions and financial services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded 6 months ago, WhenThen has now raised $6 million, backed by European VCs Stride and Cavalry.</p>
<p>The founders, Kirk Donohoe, Eamon Doyle and Dave Brown  are three former Mastercard Payment veterans.</p>
<p>Based “out of Dublin, CEO Donohoe told me: “We see traditional businesses embracing e-comm, and e-comm merchants now operating multiple business models such as trade supply, marketplace, subscription, and more. There is no platform that makes it easy for such businesses to create and operate multiple payment flows to support multiple business models in one place – that&#8217;s where we step in.”</p>
<p>He added: “WhenThen is helping ecommerce digital platforms build advanced payment flows and payment automation, in minutes as opposed to months. When you start to integrate different payment methods, different payment gateways, how you want the payment to move from collection through to payout gets very, very complex. I’ve been doing this for over a decade now, as an entrepreneur building different businesses that had to accept collect and pay payments.”</p>
<p>He said his founding team “had to build very complex payment flows for large merchants, airlines, hotels, issuers, and we just found it was ridiculous that you have to continue to do the same thing over and over again. So we decided to come up with WhenThen as a better way to be able to help you build those flows in minutes.”</p>
<p>Claude Ritter, managing partner at Cavalry said: “Basic payment orchestration platforms have been around for some time, focusing mostly on maximizing payment acceptance by optimizing routing. WhenThen provides the first end-to-end payment flow platform to equip businesses with the opportunity to control every stage of the payment flow from payment intent to payout.”</p>
<p>WhenThen supports a wide range of popular payment providers such as Stripe, Braintree, Adyen, Authorize.net, Checkout.com, etc., and a variety of alternative and locally preferred payment methods such as Klarna Affirm, PayPal, BitPay.</p>
<p>&#8220;For brave merchants considering global reach and operating multiple business models concurrently, I believe choosing the right payment ops platform will become as important as choosing the right e-commerce platform. Building your entire ecomm experience tightly coupled to a single payment processor is a hard correction to make down the line – you need a payment flow platform like WhenThen,&#8221; added Fred Destin, founder of Stride.VC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Outbound sales managers typically rely on high volumes of inquiries to find customers, but this means that their revenue is often in proportion to the size of their team. <a href="https://www.outplayhq.com/">Outplay</a> helps them scale more easily with tools that automate campaigns, identifies the likeliest prospects and uses data to decide the right time to send pitches. The company announced today it has raised $7.3 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital India.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used for tech development and hiring, and brings Outplay’s total raised so far to $9.3 million. Its previous funding was a $2 million raise from Sequoia Capital India’s Surge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/sequoia-capital-indias-surge-invests-2m-in-sales-engagement-platform-outplay/">announced in March</a> after Outplay took part in the program’s fourth cohort.</p>
<p>Since its seed round, Outplay says it has grown its revenue four times and now has customers in more than 50 countries, serving primarily B2B software companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outplay was founded in 2019 by brothers Ram and Lax Papineni. The two previously<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/12/appvirality/"> launched AppVirality</a>, a referral marketing tool for app developers.</p>

<p>Outplay was designed for sales team who contact prospects through multiple channels, like phone calls, emails, SMS, LinkedIn and Twitter. It integrates the channels into one interface, so salespeople don’t have to switch between apps. Outplay also automates sequences, or marketing campaigns that include an initial pitch sent through various channels and automatic follow-up messages if a reply isn’t received within a pre-set time.</p>
<p>The platform is meant to replace the process of cold-calling potential customers, which is time-consuming and difficult to scale, and enable salespeople to focus on the best prospects, helping them decide what channel to use and when to contact them.</p>
<p>Since its seed funding, Outplay has launched several new tools and features, including a Chrome extension that lets salespeople add prospects from LinkedIn and Gmail, send emails, make calls and perform other tasks without having to visit Outplay’s dashboard. It also added integrations with sales tools like Gong, Dynamics CRM and Zapier (Outplay was already integrated with customer relationship management platforms Pipedrive, Salesforce and Hubspot).</p>
<p>One major new feature is Magic Outbound Chat, a web chat box that is launched when a prospective customer clicks on an email link. Salespeople are notified and provided with context about the prospect. Laxman told TechCrunch that most chat boxes are designed for inbound sales teams, and Magic Outbound Chat has helped some of its teams grow their sales pipeline by 300%.</p>
<p>Laxman said that the onboarding process for Outplay takes just a few days and sales managers are provided with a playbook of successful sequences to help them get started.</p>
<p>Outplay’s competitors include unicorns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/">Outbound</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/atlantas-salesloft-raises-100m-for-its-digital-sales-platform-now-valued-at-1-1b/">SalesLoft</a>. Laxman said that in the mid-2000s, inbound sales processes and tech began rapidly evolving as SaaS adoption increased, but outbound sales teams still relied on the same high-volume tactics they had been using for years.</p>

<p>“The previous outbound sales tech disruption happened in 2011 when Outreach and Salesloft were founded. We really respect what they have done to the industry, but the approach is not scalable and the revenue eventually becomes a function of the size of the outbound sales team,” he said, adding that Outplay is changing the process by using data-driven signals to help sales representatives engage with the likeliest prospects at the right time in the right channel.</p>
<p>For example, Outplay’s Dynamic Sequencing automatically moves prospects from one sequence to another one that has a higher chance of success. In one scenario, Outplay can be configured to move a prospective who opens a sales representative’s email more than four times to another sequence that focuses on people who appear interested in a product. Laxman said some of its customers have seen open rates as high as 80% in the second sequence with Dynamic Sequencing.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sequoia India principal Harshjit Sethi said, “Outbound sales needs are evolving rapidly and reps now need personalized, automated and contextual tools to drive sales which Outplay is successfully enabling. Sales reps spend an average of four hours per day on Outplay, demonstrating the effectiveness of the product which has category-leading customer reviews.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One thing seems certain: The past year-and-a-half has fundamentally transformed the world of live events. The pandemic left plenty of venues scrambling for alternative revenue streams and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9451748/venues-closing-coronavirus-america-list/">shutting down for good.</a></p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s been a massive driver for those companies working to expand the reach of in-person events. Take LiveControl, which just raised a $30 million Series A led by Coatue and featuring existing investors First Round Capital, Box Group, Susa Ventures and TriplePoint. The round brings the So Cal company’s total funding to $33 million, on the heels of a $3.2 million seed led by FRC last August.</p>
<p>The company offers a production suite that’s a sort of plug and play solution for venues. “What if you could snap your fingers and an entire video product crew would appear, for just $150?” CEO Patrick Coyne asked, extremely rhetorically in a comment offered to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180090" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180090" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180090" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/LiveControl-Web-Player.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180090" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LiveControl</p></div></p>
<p>LiveControl says its technology has been deployed in “hundreds” of spots in the U.S., everywhere from music venues and comedy clubs to Broadway theaters and religious institutions. With its device agnostic software and support, the company also provides third-party camera hardware as part of a package, for a more out-of-the-box solution.</p>
<p>The latest funding round will go toward accelerating its technology and expanding employee headcount from 40 people to 120 over the next year and a half. LiveControl and its investors are clearly bullish on the possibilities here. But there remain broader questions around how much audience members’ interest in remote viewing regresses to the mean once venues reopen across the country and world.</p>
<p>“Video is now table stakes for most organizations, venues and creators,” says Coyne. “We’re only seeing it accelerate, and everyone is forward leaning to make bigger investments to improve their video quality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get ready for a startup throwdown of global proportions (literally).

<p>Not familiar with <a href="https://extremetechchallenge.org/">XTC</a>? It’s the world’s largest pitch competition focused on solving humanity’s most vexing challenges. You gotta love a competition that serves the greater good — and a startup ecosystem for purpose-driven companies determined to build a more sustainable, equitable, healthy, inclusive and prosperous world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The road to the XTC finals was crowded to say the least. More than 3,700 startups from 92 countries applied to compete in one of these categories: Agtech, Food &amp; Water, Cleantech &amp; Energy, Edtech, Enabling Tech, Fintech, Healthtech and Mobility &amp; Smart Cities.</p>
<p>Talk about a daunting endeavor. Team XTC, which consisted of deeply experienced investors, entrepreneurs and executives, winnowed down that field to these seven competing finalists: <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wasteless.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Wasteless&amp;index=2&amp;md5=8733230a552e45e44627c151adfd465e">Wasteless</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mpsinnovation.com.au%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Mining+and+Process+Solutions&amp;index=3&amp;md5=b021e931caff6cb3bd7798bd3eb5282a">Mining and Process Solutions</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.testmaster.com.ng%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Testmaster&amp;index=4&amp;md5=40ab0b68bcc0bb748efe416e258c6093">Testmaster</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dotincorp.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Dot+Inc.&amp;index=5&amp;md5=bf9f3f3b067413ddc61bd341bc254be7">Dot Inc.</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hillridge.com.au%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Hillridge+Technology&amp;index=6&amp;md5=6a51cb157cab9c5b6da92f938847d38a">Hillridge Technology</a>, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.genetikaplus.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Genetika%2B&amp;index=7&amp;md5=bbfd4073d12f3c8cc696b51407e77543">Genetika+</a> and <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffotokite.com%2F&amp;esheet=52454585&amp;newsitemid=20210701005962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Fotokite&amp;index=8&amp;md5=7de195ec767e4f6a32a696ba178cdf6e">Fotokite</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Safe Security, a Silicon Valley <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/its-time-to-better-identify-the-cost-of-cybersecurity-risks-in-ma-deals/">cyber risk</a> management startup, has secured a $33 million investment from U.K. telco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bt/">BT</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Safe Security — formerly known as Lucideus — helps organizations to measure and mitigate enterprise-wide cyber risk using its security assessment framework for enterprises (SAFE) platform. The service, which is used by a number of companies including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/facebook/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/softbank/">Softbank</a> and Xiaomi, helps businesses understand their likelihood of suffering a major cyberattack, calculates a financial cost to customers’ risks and provides actionable insight on the steps that can be taken to address them.</p>
<p>This funding round saw participation from Safe Security’s existing investors, including former Cisco chairman and chief executive John Chambers, and brings the total amount raised by Safe Security to $49.2 million.</p>
<p>BT said the investment, which is its first major third-party investment in cybersecurity since 2006, reflected its plans to grow rapidly in the sector. Philip Jansen, BT CEO said: “Cybersecurity is now at the top of the agenda for businesses and governments, who need to be able to trust that they’re protected against increasing levels of attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Already one of the world’s leading providers in a highly fragmented security market, this investment is a clear sign of BT’s ambition to grow further.”</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive Saket Modi said he was &#8220;delighted&#8221; to be working with BT.</p>
<p>“By aligning BT’s global reach and capabilities with SAFE’s ability to provide real-time visibility on cyber risk posture, we are going to fundamentally change how security is measured and managed across the globe,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, which will see Safe Security double its engineering team by the end of the year, BT will combine the SAFE platform with its managed security services, and gain exclusive rights to use and sell SAFE to businesses and public sector bodies in the UK. BT will also work collaboratively with Safe Security to develop future products, according to an announcement from the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">the trading boom of 2020 and 2021</a> slowing?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a question The Exchange has had on its mind since Robinhood released <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm">its latest IPO filing</a>. The popular U.S. consumer-focused investing app told investors in the document that it expects revenues to decline in the third quarter compared to its Q2 performance. The company highlighted historically strong crypto volumes in preceding quarters as part of the reason for its anticipated revenue decline.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Naturally, we got to thinking about Coinbase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely fair to say that Coinbase and Robinhood are bullish enough about the cryptocurrency market to be unbothered by short-term changes to crypto trading volumes. Coinbase discussed rising and falling consumer interest in trading cryptos in its own IPO filings, for example.</p>
<p>The now-public unicorn has lived through crypto ups and crypto downs. A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.</p>

Coinbase posted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">insanely good early-2021 results</a> thanks to a bull run in cryptocurrency prices that drove retail interest and trading fees. Robinhood also saw a rush of crypto demand, something that TechCrunch explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/crypto-trading-on-robinhood-spiked-to-9-5m-customers-in-first-quarter/">here</a>. And Square itself has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/what-squares-smashing-earnings-tell-us-about-consumer-bitcoin-demand/">seen crypto revenues explode</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/robinhoods-q2-revenue-appears-to-soar/">equities interest and demand for options</a> also elevated the fortune of many consumer fintechs during the COVID-19 savings and investing boom. But crypto revenues had a big part to play. Let&#8217;s examine both situations through the lens of the latest from Robinhood.</p>
<h2>Robinhood&#8217;s market notes</h2>
<p>There are some 316 mentions of &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; in Robinhood&#8217;s latest IPO filing. We&#8217;re going to stick to those we consider the most important.</p>
<p>As context, Robinhood shared preliminary Q2 data. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">discussed it here</a> if you want to go deeper into the aggregate figures. But after its disclosure of hard numbers, Robinhood had some interesting notes about the current quarter (emphasis TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p>Trading activity was particularly high during the first two months of the 2021 period, returning to levels more in line with prior periods during the last few weeks of the quarter ended June 30, 2021, and remained at similar levels into the early part of the third quarter. <strong>We expect our revenue for the three months ending September 30, 2021 to be lower, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, as a result of decreased levels of trading activity relative to the record highs in trading activity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly in cryptocurrencies</span>, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, and expected seasonality.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And in a discussion of some other performance metrics, including funded accounts and the like, Robinhood had this to say (emphasis TechCrunch):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>We anticipate the rate of growth in these Key Performance Metrics will be lower for the period ended September 30, 2021</strong>, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, <strong>due to the exceptionally strong interest in trading, <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularly in cryptocurrencies</span>, we experienced in the three months ended June 30, 2021, </strong>and seasonality in overall trading activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Falling revenue and slowing KPM growth is not really the world&#8217;s best set of metrics to flash up during an IPO run. But a quick scan of Robinhood&#8217;s 2020 revenues indicates it&#8217;s unlikely that the unicorn will be able to post year-over-year growth in the final two quarters of 2021. Still, its period of rapid-fire revenue growth appears to have come to an end after Robinhood posted top-line expansion in every quarter since Q4 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global investment group Eurazeo invested $53 million in <a href="https://www.pangaea.holdings/">Pangaea Holdings</a> for a minority investment in the Los Angeles e-commerce company rooted in creating premium men’s personal care brands.</p>
<p>The investment is part of a larger $68 million round that includes $15 million in Series B funding from a group of backers including Unilever Ventures and GPO Fund and existing investors Base10 Partners and Gradient Ventures. This brings the company’s total funds raised to $87 million since the company was founded by Richard Hong and Darwish Gani in 2018.</p>
<p>Harlem Capital’s Henri Pierre-Jacques invested in both Pangaea’s seed round in 2019 and Series A in 2020. He’s known Gani since college and worked with Hong over the past two years, calling the pair “one of the most data-driven and founder market fits I have seen.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At the seed stage, the business was already a seven-figure business and has continued to see astonishing growth,” he added. “Pangaea, to date, has been a brand incubator, but post the Series B will expand to be a vertically integrated e-commerce platform for other brands. We are even more excited for this next phase of their growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hong started Pangaea with the launch of men’s skincare brand Lumin that contains natural Korean-based formulations. In fact, he was among a group of people living together in an apartment using Korean beauty products and hiding it from their roommates, Gani told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gani later joined Hong as a co-founder to scale the business, as they realized there was a bigger opportunity for global e-commerce.</p>
<p>“Men are actually into skincare, but not as comfortable talking about it,” Gani said. “For Richard, he came from a place where skincare was more culturally accepted. His idea was to provide high-quality products, but presented in a way that people can understand their use and help them to form a habit.”</p>
<p>Pangaea ended up developing proprietary infrastructure, including warehousing, payments and shipping, as a holding company to grow and scale direct-to-consumer brands. It’s latest brand, Meridian, offering grooming products, launched in 2020. Products are now selling in more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>Though headquartered in Los Angeles, the company is basically remote, with more than 300 employees across its major hubs in LA, Lagos, Nigeria, Singapore and Europe.</p>
<p>The company is already cash flow positive, and the new funding will enable Pangaea to round out leadership roles in its brands and reach the next stage of growth with the goal of being “omnichannel male megabrands,” Gani said. The company is also investing in additional product categories, new brands and potentially licensing its proprietary software.</p>
<p>Gani said he is excited to work with Eurazeo, which he referred to as “experts in building and scaling consumer brands.” The firm will work with Pangaea to continue developing the Lumin and Meridian brands and accelerate its international expansion.</p>
<p>Jill Granoff, Eurazeo’s managing partner and brands CEO, said in a written statement that the company “is well-positioned for future growth.”</p>
<p>“Richard and Darwish have launched a platform and products that address a significant need in an attractive, growing market,” Granoff added. “The team has achieved impressive results in a short period of time across geographies and categories, demonstrating strong product appeal to global consumers. They have also built a highly scalable technology that can support future brand development.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.spendesk.com">Spendesk</a> has <a href="https://blog.spendesk.com/en/series-c-funding">announced</a> earlier today that it has raised a $118 million funding round (€100 million) led by General Atlantic. Overall, the company has raised $189 million (€160 million) since its inception.</p>
<p>Existing investors Index Ventures and Eight Road Ventures participated once again in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>Spendesk, as the name suggests, focuses on all things related to spend management. Originally founded in startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a>, the startup first offered virtual and physical company cards for employees. While corporate cards are quite popular in the U.S., many small and medium companies in France can’t give a card to every single employee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why spending your company’s money can be a cumbersome process. You can borrow your boss’ card but they’ll have to trust you with it. You can pay with your own personal card but you want to be reimbursed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>By combining a SaaS platform with corporate cards, it opens up a ton of possibilities. For instance, you can create an approval workflow for expensive purchases. You can set different budgets for different teams.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tEU0ruMw2p"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=tEU0ruMw2p" data-secret="tEU0ruMw2p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Over time, Spendesk has expanded beyond cards to manage expenses and invoice processing. It tries to automate some repetitive accounting tasks as well. Employees are automatically reminded that they have to attach a receipt for each transaction. You can export everything to Xero, Datev, Sage, Cegid or Netsuite.</p>
<p>If that pitch sounds familiar, it’s because there are a handful of European startups that are all doing well in this field. <a href="https://www.soldo.com">Soldo</a> recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/">$180 million</a> while <a href="https://www.pleo.io/">Pleo</a> snatched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/">$150 million</a> at a $1.7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>And yet, Spendesk doubled its revenue over the past year. Its team grew from 150 to 300 employees and it plans to double its headcount again over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>It means two things — the market opportunity is important and many customers are switching from old school workflows to modern SaaS products. That’s why three startups can grow at the same time.</p>
<p>“Traditionally, finance teams haven’t been equipped with the tools that can support this transformation,” Spendesk co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant said in a statement. “In the past few years we have built the reference spend management solution for finance teams in Europe, which frees businesses and their people from administrative constraints of spending and managing money at work. While our solution is about empowering finance teams, we are actually delivering value to the entire business through the finance team.”</p>
<p>Spendesk currently has 3,000 clients, including Algolia, Soundcloud, Curve, Doctolib, Gousto, Raisin, Sezane and Wefox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Twitter launches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">Super Follows</a>, YouTube adds <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/youtubes-newest-monetization-tool-lets-viewers-tip-creators-for-their-uploads/">new monetization tools</a> and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">embraces e-commerce</a>, the social media sphere is heating up with new ways for creators to make a living. Now, Tumblr is joining the fray with Post+, the platform&#8217;s first attempt at allowing users to monetize their content. Post+ is debuting today in limited beta for an exclusive selection of creators in the U.S., who were hand-picked by Tumblr.</p>
<p>Like Twitter&#8217;s Super Follows, Tumblr&#8217;s Post+ lets creators choose which content they want to put behind a paywall, whether that&#8217;s original artwork, personal blog posts or Destiel fanfic. Creators can set the price for their subscriber-only content starting at $3.99 per month, with additional tiers at $5.99 and $9.99. The process of making content under Post+ is the same as any other Tumblr post &#8212; all creators will have to do is check a box to indicate that the post is for paying subscribers only, whether that&#8217;s a video, audio clip, text post, image, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180371" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180371" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180371" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png 8001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/05_Categories.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180371" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tumblr</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Not reserved only for professionals, or those with 10K followers or higher, Tumblr’s Post+ will push the boundaries of what’s considered money-making content on the internet: Shitposters, memelords, artists, fan fiction writers, all of the above and everyone in between will be able to create content while building their community of supporters, and getting paid with Post+,&#8221; a Tumblr spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>For millennials who live-blogged their reading of the last <em>&#8220;</em>Hunger Games&#8221; book on its release day in 2010, Tumblr might seem like a relic of the past. Founded in 2007, the platform has gone through plenty of change over the years. In 2013, Tumblr was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/what-will-tumblr-become-under-the-ownership-of-techs-only-goldilocks-founder/">acquired by Yahoo for $1.1 billion</a>, and then Yahoo was later acquired by Verizon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180381" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180381" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2180381 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png 1938w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=768,348 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=680,308 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=1536,696 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tumblr-Monthly-Traffic.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SimilarWeb</p></div></p>
<p>But a massive shift came for Tumblr in December 2018, when the platform banned all sexually explicit content and pornography. A month prior, the Tumblr app had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/19/tumblr-booted-from-app-store-due-to-child-porn/">removed from the iOS App Store</a> after child pornography passed through the app&#8217;s filtering technology, which led the platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/tumblrs-back-in-the-app-store-following-porn-ban-announcement/">ban pornography entirely</a>. Four months after the ban, Tumblr&#8217;s monthly page views had <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-lost-a-third-of-its-users-after-porn-ban">declined by 151 million</a>, or 29%. Since then, the platform has retained a core userbase, hovering between about 310 million and 377 million page views per month, according to SimilarWeb, though the analytics still indicate a slight downward trend. Tumblr declined to provide its monthly active user numbers, but shared that the platform has more than 11 million posts per day and 500 million blogs.</p>
<p>In 2019, the platform was sold to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/wordpress-com-owner-automattic-acquires-journaling-app-day-one/">Automattic</a>, the company that owns WordPress. Though Tumblr hasn&#8217;t exhibited significant growth since the fateful porn ban, under its new ownership, it&#8217;s exploring new ways to generate profit by creating features that appeal to its now younger demographic. According to Tumblr, over 48% of users are Gen Z. These Gen Z users spend 26% more time on the platform than older bloggers, and their average daily usage time is increasing over 100% from year to year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube will begin pilot testing a new feature that will allow viewers to shop for products directly from livestream videos. The feature will initially launch with just a handful of creators and brands, the company says, and is an expansion of the integrated shopping experience YouTube<a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/"> began beta testing</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>That feature was designed only for on-demand videos, and allowed viewers to tap into the &#8220;credibility and knowledge&#8221; of trusted creators in order to make informed purchases, the company explained at the time. It said it would roll out to more creators over the course of 2021.</p>
<p>More recently, YouTube <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/youtube-to-host-small-business-shopping-event-in-e-commerce-push?srnd=markets-vp&amp;sref=gni836kR">tested livestreamed shopping</a> with a one-day shopping event focused on small businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s video platform, for years, has been a powerful tool for product discovery, as its more than 2 billion logged-in users per month turn to the service to watch product reviews, demos, unboxings, shopping hauls and other content that could inspire future purchases. But creators who wanted to sell from their YouTube videos would often have to promote affiliate links to online stores through the video&#8217;s description or in-video elements, like <a href="https://blog.sellfy.com/sell-on-youtube/">cards or end screens</a>.</p>

<p>In more recent years, YouTube also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/youtube-introduces-channel-memberships-merchandise-and-premieres/">introduced</a> <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9454088?hl=en">a merch shelf</a> that would allow viewers to shop a set of specific products the creator selected.</p>
<p>The integrated shopping experience, meanwhile, allows viewers to shop the products shown in the video itself by tapping on a &#8220;view products&#8221; button, which brings up a list of the items being featured.</p>

<p>This feature allows YouTube to better compete with the growing number of video shopping experiences becoming available from both startups and competitors, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-shop-instagram-live-shopping/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/1189600611393606">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/tiktok-begins-testing-in-app-shopping-to-challenge-facebook">TikTok</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/pinterest-to-test-live-streamed-events-this-month-with-21-creators/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/amazon-influencer-program-opens-to-livestreamers-for-broadcasting-to-amazon-live/">Amazon</a> and Snapchat. Many of those include support for livestream videos, too.</p>
<p>Over the past year, for example, startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/">Popshop Live</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">Talkshoplive</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Whatnot</a> and others have raised multimillion-dollar rounds to invest in their own live video shopping businesses. Meanwhile, Facebook recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/facebook-debuts-live-shopping-fridays-featuring-beauty-fashion-and-skincare-brands/"> launched Live Shopping Fridays</a> to test live shopping within the beauty, fashion and skincare space. And Walmart has partnered with TikTok on livestream shopping events on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">multiple</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">occasions</a>.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s own interest in this space has been heating up, as well, as just this week the company announced it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">was acquiring Indian video shopping app Simsim</a> &#8212; an indication of Google&#8217;s interest in further integrating video shopping experiences into its own platform. Google also integrated video shopping into its Shopping search business, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">which included one effort</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Shoploop</a>, a video shopping product that graduated from Google&#8217;s in-house incubator, Area 120.</p>
<p>The expansion of YouTube&#8217;s integrated video shopping experience was <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/making-it-easier-to-find-deals/">announced</a> today alongside other new Google Shopping features, including the addition of a new section that organizes deals and sales on Google&#8217;s Shopping tab, which will be free for merchants who want to list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new voice-based social app that cites Clubhouse as its biggest inspiration offers a playful new way to stay in touch with close friends and family. <a href="https://zebra.chat/">Zebra</a> leaves video out of the equation altogether, inviting users to snap on-the-fly photos and send them off paired with casual voice updates.</p>
<p>Zebra focuses on asynchronous sharing, but it also lets users call one another if they&#8217;re both already hanging out on the app. The result is a fun and casual way to stay in touch for anyone who doesn&#8217;t feel like accidentally getting sucked into Instagram&#8217;s endless, ad-strewn feed every time they want to give a friend a quick update.</p>
<p>For now Zebra is a two-person team consisting of CEO Dennis Gecaj, a product designer based in Berlin, and Amer Shahnawaz, Zebra&#8217;s head of engineering, who previously worked on Snap Maps at Snapchat. The pre-seed funding was led by Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s fresh early-stage venture firm Seven Seven Six, which the Reddit co-founder announced in June. The app will launch formally in August but is now open for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zebra-share-talking-photos/id1548469840">preorders through the App Store</a> and as a <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/gX5l5oDB">beta in TestFlight</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GwPfaCPwFX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/seven-seven-six-the-new-venture-firm-from-alexis-ohanian-closes-150-million-fund-1/">Seven Seven Six, the new venture firm from Alexis Ohanian, closes $150 million Fund 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seven Seven Six, the new venture firm from Alexis Ohanian, closes $150 million Fund 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/seven-seven-six-the-new-venture-firm-from-alexis-ohanian-closes-150-million-fund-1/embed/#?secret=GwPfaCPwFX" data-secret="GwPfaCPwFX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;It’s no secret that we are in the midst of an audio revolution, one that has ushered in a series of new audio-first social platforms and content vehicles,&#8221; Ohanian said, noting that Zebra&#8217;s unique blend of photos and voice is what caught his eye.</p>
<p>Gecaj sees voice-based social networking as a much richer alternative to text-dominant platforms. While products like Instagram allow voice messages and technically let users make voice calls by disabling the camera, voice usually plays second fiddle to video. But video calls are more taxing and require more commitment — it&#8217;s no coincidence more and more Zoom cameras blinked offline as the pandemic dragged on.</p>
<p>Unlike Clubhouse, which Gecaj calls a &#8220;huge inspiration, Zebra is social audio designed for your inner circle. &#8220;With everything opening back up we saw an incredible opportunity for an asynchronous format for that,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gecaj hopes that Zebra&#8217;s &#8220;talking photos&#8221; can capture the collective imagination in a way that makes early growth natural. Anyone who downloads Zebra can invite friends individually without needing to share their full contact list (and they&#8217;ll need to &#8212; you can&#8217;t do anything on the app without friends). Because Zebra&#8217;s interface is so clean and streamlined, this process is painless and doesn&#8217;t necessitate any extra digging through menus.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wHedZDurWX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/">Clubhouse ventures beyond audio with Backchannel, a new messaging feature</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse ventures beyond audio with Backchannel, a new messaging feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/clubhouse-dms-backchannel/embed/#?secret=wHedZDurWX" data-secret="wHedZDurWX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea of a &#8220;zebra&#8221; — naturally, Zebra is trying to make &#8220;zebra&#8221; happen — is that people like to see what they are talking about. On a different messaging app, this would require sending a photo and then sending a voice message in quick succession. But on Zebra, sending a photo is the main thing you can do. The app opens right to the camera where you snap a picture. You then hold the photo to record a snippet of voice to go along with it and send it off to friends and family, who appear in a row beneath the camera.</p>
<p>Zebra isn&#8217;t worried about the prospect of talking people into downloading another app. Gecaj sees a natural split emerging as creators and audiences increasingly become the focus of social platforms that were initially designed to help friends stay in touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the trend is a division between creator platforms where you go to be entertained and platforms you go to hang out with your friends,&#8221; Gecaj told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>On top of that, he hopes that Zebra&#8217;s dual focus on voice and photos, two aspects of social networking that platforms either don&#8217;t prioritize or are actively abandoning, can make it appealing for people who aren&#8217;t as interested in video.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really also think that text messaging doesn&#8217;t have the same emotion as voice&#8230; and voice has been really neglected,&#8221; Gecaj said. &#8220;There&#8217;s really a richness to voice, a power to voice that nothing else has.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every startup wants to raise venture capital. And then there are those that do want to raise VC money but don’t want to use it for specific things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a number of firms have emerged looking to meet the credit needs of such venture-backed and growth startups: </span><a href="http://www.i80group.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">i80 Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of those firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Goldman Sachs investment banker </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhelwani/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marc Helwani</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> founded i80 in 2016 after investing in early-stage New York-based fintechs in 2014-2015 via his VC fund, Avenue A Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It became very clear to me that fintech was going to explode,” he recalls. “At that time, it was still relatively new. And every time I spoke to a company, they would tell me, ‘We know how to raise VC, but what about the credit?’ I just saw this white space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, proptechs that buy homes on behalf of buyers don’t want to use venture money. Fintechs that want to make loans to consumers don’t want to use equity to do it. Instead, in those cases, credit might be more desirable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter i80. The firm offers credit exclusively, and over the years has quietly committed more than $1 billion to over 15 companies &#8211;including real estate marketplace </span><a href="https://www.properly.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Properly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, finance app </span><a href="https://www.moneylion.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MoneyLion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and SaaS financing company </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/capchase-raises-280m-to-scale-its-financing-platform-for-subscription-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capchase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; that have all raised a significant amount of venture capital but are looking for credit “to help them scale very efficiently and in a non-dilutive manner so they can retain more ownership of their companies,” Helwani said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its $1 billion milestone follows fund commitments nearing $500 million from an unnamed &#8220;leading global asset manager&#8221; as well as other institutional and retail investors.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180120" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180120" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2180120 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="289" height="434" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marc-Helwani.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180120" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Founder and Chief Investment Officer Marc Helwani / i80 Group</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I80 &#8212; which derives its name from the highway that connects New York and San Francisco &#8212; is mainly focused on the fintech and proptech sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are the two centers for the venture ecosystem,” Helwani said. “And we’re trying to be a bridge between those two cities.” I80 has offices in both locations and will soon be opening one in Montreal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm works in conjunction with VC firms such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z (more formally known as Andreessen Horowitz); Affirm and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin’s SciFi; Khosla Ventures; Union Square Ventures; and QED.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a perfect world, venture capital would be called venture equity,” Helwani said. “VCs’ capital is critical for companies to hire and get office space. But when it comes time to do what the actual business is, such as provide loans or buy homes, capital like ours is very accretive without VCs and management losing ownership in the business. In these cases, using both credit and equity makes a lot of sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helwani is reluctant to call what i80 offers venture “debt.” He says that has a very specific connotation and is what Silicon Valley Bank and others like it do in providing debt as a percentage of a previous equity round. Instead, according to Helwani, i80’s approach is to minimize fees. The vast majority of its deals are “interest-rate related.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With mortgages, for example, we never think about the fees upfront, and focus more on the interest rate,” Helwan said. “We believe the more transparent we are, the more companies will want to work with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I80 conducts quarterly calls with VCs and for now, that’s how it typically sources most of its deal flow. It also gets referrals. Helwani believes that i80 stands out from other firms also offering credit in that it’s “not trying to be credit investors in VC clothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also thinks that the fact that the i80 team is made of operators, as well as investors, is a contributing factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is set to close another half a dozen deals in the next 60 to 90 days, and then plans to set its sights on raising more capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to fill this void, and help companies raise money in their subsequent rounds at higher valuations,” Helwani said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based startup <a href="https://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab</a> has been <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/sketchfab-is-now-part-of-epic-games">acquired</a> by <a href="https://www.epicgames.com">Epic Games</a>, the company behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine. Sketchfab has been building a platform to upload, download, view, share, sell and buy 3D assets. Essentially, it is the leading repository for 3D files on the web.</p>
<p>Epic Games isn’t disclosing the terms of the deal. Sketchfab will still operate as a separate brand and offering. Epic Games also says that all integrations with third-party tools will remain available, including with Unity.</p>
<p>The deal makes a ton of sense as Epic Games has been developing — and acquiring — some of the most popular creation tools. Unreal Engine has been one of the most popular video game engines of the past couple of decades.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More recently, Unreal Engine has been used for different use cases beyond video games, such as special effects, 3D explorations of virtual worlds, mixed reality projects and more.</p>
<p>But an engine without assets is pretty useless. That’s why creators either design their own 2D and 3D assets, outsource this process or buy assets directly. It led to the creation of an entire ecosystem of assets and creators.</p>
<p>Epic Games has its own <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">Unreal Engine marketplace</a>, but Sketchfab has been working on building the definitive 3D marketplace for many years with three important pillars — technology, reach and collaboration.</p>
<p>On the technology front, Sketchfab lets you view 3D models on any platform. The Sketchfab viewer works with all major browsers on both desktop and mobile — you can see <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/sketchfab-is-joining-the-epic-games-family-7fb77b704779481b9f132b9c146716bb">an example on Sketchfab</a>. It also works with VR headsets. You can upload 3D models from your favorite 3D modeling app, such as Blender, 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D and Substance Painter.</p>
<p>Sketchfab can also convert any format into glTF and USDZ file formats. Those formats work particularly well on Android and iOS.</p>
<p>When it comes to reach, Sketchfab has grown tremendously over the years. In 2018, the company shared <a href="https://sketchfab.com/blogs/community/2-million-users-200-million-visitors-and-1-billion-page-views/">some metrics</a> — 1 billion views, 2 million members and 3 million 3D models. Around the same time, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/sketchfab-launches-a-store-to-become-a-stock-photo-site-for-3d-models/">a store</a> so that creators can buy and sell assets directly on the platform.</p>
<p>Finally, Sketchfab launched an interesting feature for companies that work with 3D models all the time — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/sketchfab-launches-team-platform-to-share-and-collaborate-on-3d-models/">Sketchfab for Teams</a>. It’s a software-as-a-service play that lets you share a Sketchfab account with the rest of the team. Essentially, it works a bit like a shared Google Drive folder — but for 3D models.</p>
<p>With today’s acquisition, Epic Games is making some immediate changes. Starting today, store fees have been reduced from 30% to 12% — just like on the Epic Games Store. The company lowered commissions on ArtStation immediately after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">acquiring ArtStation</a>, as well.</p>
<p>As for Sketchfab users paying a monthly subscription fee, everything is a bit <a href="https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404339809169-Epic-Games-FAQ">cheaper</a> now. All features in the Plus plan are now available for free, all features in the Pro plan are available to Plus subscribers, etc.</p>
<p>“We built Sketchfab with a mission to empower a new era of creativity and provide a service for creators to showcase their work online and make 3D content accessible,” Sketchfab co-founder and CEO Alban Denoyel said in the announcement. “Joining Epic will enable us to accelerate the development of Sketchfab and our powerful online toolset, all while providing an even greater experience for creators. We are proud to work alongside Epic to build the Metaverse and enable creators to take their work even further.”</p>
<p>With the acquisitions of ArtStation and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/epic-games-buys-photogrammetry-software-maker-capturing-reality/">Capturing Reality</a>, Epic Games has been on an acquisition spree. It’s clear that the company wants to build an end-to-end developer suite for the gaming industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space propulsion developer Accion Systems has closed its most significant funding round yet. The company raised $42 million in a Series C led by Tracker Capital, bringing its valuation to $83.5 million.</p>
<p>Along with the investment, Tracker Capital also acquired a majority stake in the company. This latest injection of capital will facilitate the development and manufacturing of the company’s fourth generation propulsion system, dubbed the tiled ionic liquid electrospray (TILE) system.</p>
<p>The TILE system uses electrical energy to push charge particles (ions) out its back to generate propulsion. While ion engines have been around for decades, Accion uses a liquid propellant, an ionic liquid salt, instead of gas. The liquid is inert and nonpressurized, meaning there’s no risk of explosion. It also results in a product that doesn’t need bulky components like ionization chambers, and an overall smaller and lighter weight system relative to the spacecraft — key considerations in space, where every gram of payload has a high price tag.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It lets us build really, really small systems,” Accion co-founder Natalya Bailey explained to TechCrunch. “Instead of trying to take an existing ion engine the size of a Prius and shrink it down, we can start with very small systems because of this propellant.” And she does mean small — each thruster tile is about the size of a postage stamp.</p>
<p>The TILE system is also scalable and modular, meaning it could feasibly be used on anything from CubeSats to propelling an interplanetary spacecraft, Accion CEO Peter Kant added in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s one of the few occasions where the total addressable market and the actual addressable market that we can serve are pretty closely aligned and almost overlap,” he said.</p>
<p>The newest generation of the TILE system is the same size as its predecessors, but Accion is increasing the number of emitters on a given chip — emitters being the technology that actually shoots out the ions, generating the momentum — by almost tenfold. “We get more ions per area and that gives us a whole lot more thrust with the same amount of space,” Kant said.</p>
<p>Accion is looking to ship the first fourth-gen thruster systems in the middle to late summer of 2022.</p>
<p>The TILE system was developed by Accion co-founders Natalya Bailey and Louis Perna while the two were at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The tech generated a ton of interest from big aerospace companies, but they decided to found Accion in 2014 rather than sell. The company manufactures and assembles its product at its facility in Charlestown, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The TILE system was onboard commercial spacecraft, one with Astra Digital and one with NanoAvionics, that went up on SpaceX’s Transporter-2 launch at the end of June. Accion started by focusing on serving smaller spacecraft first, like CubeSats, but Bailey said that was just the beginning.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going after that segment initially, and then intending to reinvest our learnings in building larger and larger systems that eventually can do big geostationary satellites and interplanetary missions and so on. The systems that went up on the most recent launcher [is] probably good for a satellite up to about 50 kilograms [ … ] For us, it&#8217;s on the smaller end of where we intend to go.”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> took a trip down memory lane to the great WeWork saga. We had WSJ reporter and author<a href="https://twitter.com/eliotwb?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Eliot Brown</a> on the show to chat about his new book, &#8220;The Cult of We,&#8221; written with his colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/maureenmfarrell">Maureen Farrell.</a> You can <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/645810/the-cult-of-we-by-eliot-brown-and-maureen-farrell/">snag it here</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>Brown and Farrell were key reporting voices during WeWork&#8217;s rise and fall, covering the company&#8217;s growth, hijinks and demise.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/">WeWork has filed to go public via a SPAC</a>, bringing the co-working startup to the public markets years after it initially tried for an IPO. It will debut at a fraction of the value that it once commanded on the private markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For fun, you can read <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm">the original WeWork S-1 filing here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/WeWork-Management-Presentation-March-2021-vF-1.pdf">WeWork-SPAC deck is here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we had Brown on the show, we took the time to dive into how he handled reporting the WeWork story, what his take is on today&#8217;s startup market, and how the tech media in general can do a better job. It felt like a masterclass for journalists and founders alike, which we&#8217;d argue is Equity&#8217;s sweet spot.</p>
<p>What lessons can we take away from WeWork&#8217;s rise and fall? At a very basic level, that companies with slim gross margins are not software companies and should not be valued as such. And that allowing founders to have monarchical control of their company goes against historical norms of good corporate governance, which isn&#8217;t so smart.</p>
