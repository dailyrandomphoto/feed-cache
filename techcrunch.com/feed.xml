										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, we&#8217;ve seen a growing trend of creators adopting digital and social media, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a supplement to their media presence but also as a cornerstone of their personal brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerated creator economy trends. Many popular artists and figures have had to postpone concerts and live events, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using social media to carry out these activities and engage their fans. Proliferating through Western and far East markets, the creator economy bug, which has made platforms like Cameo and Patreon unicorns, is beginning to take centre stage in MENA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://minlyapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Egypt-based creator economy platform, is announcing that it has closed a $3.6 million seed round to allow stars across the MENA region to create authentic, personalized connections with their fans.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, which Minly says was oversubscribed, was co-led by 4DX Ventures, B&amp;Y Venture Partners, and Global Ventures. It also included participation from unnamed regional funds and angel investors like Scooter Braun, founder of SB Projects and Jason Finger, co-founder of Seamless and Grubhub. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say time spent viewing social media surpassed time spent viewing TV within the MENA region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But one shortcoming with social media is that its content often feels mass-produced. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When creators make posts, it&#8217;s most times void of personalization to the different categories of fans they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">possess</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, this dilutes the fan experience and limits the extent and number of ways the creator can monetize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/shinnawy">Mohamed El-Shinnawy</a>, Tarek Hosny, and Bassel El-Toukhy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides tools for creators to craft what it calls &#8216;authentic connections&#8217; with their superfans and audience at scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;In short, our goal is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eventually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver tens of millions of unique, unforgettable experiences to fans each year,&#8221; El-Shinnawy said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinnawy, who brings more than 15 years of media and technology experience to the table, is the chief technology officer at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He sold his first company Emerge Technology to a U.S.-based media company. He has also delivered work for Hollywood’s top studios, such as Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal, Disney, Fox, and Warner Brothers, while playing a role in the global expansion of Apple TV+, Disney+, and Netflix’s to the MENA region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has experienced rapid growth since launching late last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has more than 50,000 users along with an impressive list of popular regional celebrities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, users can buy personalized video messages and shoutouts from their favourite celebrities, get unprecedented access to the talent they admire most, and celebrities, in turn, connect with their fans on a deeper level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also assembled a diverse roster of celebrities. They range from traditional movie and television stars and athletes to musicians and internet influencers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these popular figures include Tamer Hosny, Fifi Abdou, Assala Nasri, and Mahmoud Trezeguet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we have already differentiated ourselves from other creator economy platforms in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We do this by offering the best catalogue of stars and user experience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And our entire team is working hard to grow this gap even further,&#8221; said El-Shinnawy on the crop of stars </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has onboarded to the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CTO further gave instances of the connection created by celebrities with their fans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Egyptian singer Tamer Hosny <a href="https://minlyapp.com/r/EqlvNlhy1y1QC2drKAsHC4ZXFy50vDkv">made a surprise appearance</a> at two fans&#8217; engagement party</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actress and dancer Fifi Abdou also <a href="https://minlyapp.com/r/iN0i15BHdYG3mpK8l2MQOkxaUHqo4Hgd">sent a personal message to one of her biggest fans</a>, who has Down syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes a small commission on transactions made through its platform. However, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> majority of the transaction price, a figure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> didn&#8217;t disclose, goes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the creator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also encourages celebrities to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> donate a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their earnings to partner charities on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly&#8217;s knack for creating a personalized experience was one reason Pan-African VC firm 4DX Ventures invested. The firm&#8217;s co-founder and general partner Peter Orth, who will be joining Minly&#8217;s board, said the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundamentally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing the relationship between celebrities and fans in the MENA region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team has both the ambition and the expertise to build a full-stack digital interaction platform that could change the way digital content </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consumed in the region,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creator economy market surpassed $100 billion in value this year and is still growing at an impressive rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pace of content creation will only speed up since surveys suggest that being a YouTuber or TikTokker or the most common term, a Vlogger is one the most desirable careers among Gen Zs. VC firms like a16z, Kleiner, and Tiger Global have also heralded this growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">considerably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributed to the more than $2 billion invested in creator economy platforms this year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In MENA, there&#8217;s a huge opportunity for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The region has over 450 million, of which 30% are young people. This demography </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a deep connection with social media, and El-Shinnawy believes MENA will soon contribute to a large part of the total creator economy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the goal is to capture a huge </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that spend and become a multi-billion dollar category-leading company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The creator platform has a case to do so. As it stands, the opportunity to build a creator economy one-stop-shop in MENA is huge compared to other regions that already have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> entrenched incumbents. Also, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the few platforms in the region with meaningful venture funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The creator economy is in its infancy and growing at lightning speed. We have the opportunity to build this category’s first unicorn in MENA,” the CTO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is doubling down on building local celebrity acquisition teams in Egypt and other parts across MENA and the GCC, where it has seen significant traction. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also scale its engineering team to churn out more products to build a horizontal creator platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, there&#8217;s big news with the expansion of Android apps to Windows. Apple also came out swinging against sideloading and expanded its profitable Search Ads business to China&#8230;with more than a few caveats. Meanwhile, TikTok launched its own take on mini-apps after tests, making its videos more interactive.</p>

<h3>Microsoft brings Android apps to Windows 11</h3>

<p>Microsoft surprised industry observers this week at its Windows 11 event with news that it will make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore">Android apps available</a> on the next version of its operating system. The apps will run natively on Windows 11 and can be downloaded from Amazon&#8217;s Appstore through the new Windows Store included in the updated OS. They&#8217;ll also be able to be integrated into the Start menu and pinned to the taskbar, and can tile or &#8220;window&#8221; as part of the OS&#8217;s new application placement user interface.</p>
<p>The Amazon partnership will bring increased attention to the Amazon Appstore, whose importance has somewhat fizzled over the years given the general lack of investment and its close ties to Amazon Fire devices, which are <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/vendor-market-share/tablet/worldwide">outsold</a> by iPad. App developers today tend to focus initially on the App Store and Google Play, not Amazon&#8217;s Appstore. However, bringing some <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/">3 million</a> Android apps to Windows users opens up a huge new potential market for Android. But could it actually make coding for &#8220;iOS first&#8221; less of a given for certain types of applications &#8212; like those that complement the productivity environment enabled by a Windows PC, perhaps?</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Android apps are coming to Windows 11 through the Amazon Appstore&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/android-apps-are-coming-to-windows-11-through-the-amazon-appstore/embed/#?secret=5JNtWPMtdg" data-secret="5JNtWPMtdg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the near-term, more consumers may begin to sideload the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mas/get/amazonapp">Amazon Appstore app</a> on their Android devices for their paid app installs in order to gain access to the cross-platform support a Google Play version would not necessarily provide.</p>
<p>Microsoft noted during the event that it&#8217;s partnering with Intel to use its Intel Bridge technology to make this Appstore integration possible on x86 systems. However, the Intel-powered apps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549303/windows-11-intel-bridge-android-apps-amd-arm-processors">will also run on AMD and Arm processors</a>, The Verge noted, though the technical details of how that will work were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Microsoft during the event demonstrated how the app integration would work by showing off TikTok running in a vertical format on the new Windows OS. This may not have been the best example, as TikTok has a fairly usable website for watching videos. Meanwhile, the image of the Amazon Appstore in the Windows Store showed other apps including those from Ring, Uber, Yahoo, Khan Academy, Kindle, Game of War: Fire Age, My Talking Tom Friends, and more, which indicates this is a comprehensive rollout.</p>
<p>Ahead of this news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/19/this-week-in-apps-spotify-debuts-a-clubhouse-rival-facebook-tests-audio-rooms-in-us-amazon-cuts-appstore-commissions/">Amazon announced</a> it would soon lower its cut on app developer revenues from 30% to 20%, as part of a new program for small businesses. The program, which also includes promotional credits for AWS, could help boost developer support for the Appstore. Plus, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546635/microsoft-windows-11-new-app-store">on the larger Windows Store</a>, non-game developers can keep 100% of their revenue if they use their own payment platforms for in-app purchases. Apps and games using Microsoft&#8217;s payment platform split revenue with the company at 85%/15% and 88%/12%, respectively. This sort of commission structure combined with the introduction of Android apps makes the Windows Store seem more developer-friendly than Apple&#8217;s App Store, which Microsoft likely hopes will keep it out of antitrust crosshairs.</p>
<h3>Apple launches Search Ads in China</h3>
<p>Apple this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/apple-search-ads-china/">brought its search advertising business</a> to China five years after its U.S. debut. The system allows developers to bid on an advertising slot based on keywords users search for in the App Store. Though the move opens up a major new market for app developers, the system in China is fairly complex and comes with several caveats. Developers will need to upload documents, including business licenses and other files, that confirm their account has been approved before being able to run ads. Apple may then submit these documents to third-party databases and government entities for validation.</p>
<p>According to Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://searchads.apple.com/v/help/b/docs/apple-advertising-guidelines-for-mainland-china.pdf">guidelines</a>, the industry-specific licenses required exclude most foreign businesses from directly advertising in mainland China. Instead, they&#8217;ll need to work with local partners who will run ads on their behalf.</p>
<p>The expansion for now only includes the Search Ads in the App Store and not the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot/">newly added Search Tab ads</a>, where developers can bid on a slot directly on the Search tab in the App Store itself.</p>

While there are consumer benefits to allowing for choice &#8212; like getting your hands on apps that don&#8217;t fit Apple&#8217;s rules, for example &#8212; Apple makes the case that sideloading could compromise user privacy and security in a number of ways, including potentially opening up users to being scammed and making it more difficult for parents to lock down kids&#8217; iPhones, among other things. Pirated apps could also eat into legitimate developer revenue, not to mention Apple&#8217;s own. Apple&#8217;s Director of User Privacy Erik Neuenschwander went into further detail with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90649203/apple-iphone-sideloading-safety-apps-tech">Fast Company</a> about Apple&#8217;s position, noting attackers could even trick users into thinking they were downloading from the App Store when they were not.</p>

<p>Alternative browser Brave this week <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search-beta/">introduced</a> its own search service, Brave Search, now available in beta across all platforms &#8212; including web, Android and iOS. The service is different from other search engines because it does not track or profile users, and it leverages its own search index for answering queries instead of relying on other providers. Its ranking algorithms will be community-curated and open. Soon, it will also offer options for both an ad-free paid search and an ad-supported search option, allowing users to decide how they want to proceed.</p>
<p>Brave Search was announced in <a href="https://brave.com/brave-search/">March</a> when Brave acquired Tailcat. The company says the new service will later this year become the default in the Brave browser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rumor has it, if you whisper mafia to a venture capitalist or tech reporter, a seed investment and headline appears within minutes. That process quickly turns into seconds if the mafia reference includes the letters S, T, R, I, P and E before it.</p>
<p>Tech mafias, otherwise known as a group of early employees within a company who spin out to start their own, independently successful companies, became a popularized term <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/the-rise-of-the-new-crypto-mafias/">thanks to PayPal</a> in the early 2000s. As my lede alludes, the term has since become a cliche of sorts. Everything is a mafia, including you, dear Startups Weekly newsletter subscribers. Jokes aside, I’d argue the term is still a helpful way to track the way talent moves in the ever-growing world of startups.</p>
<p>Many venture capitalists have been making subtle, and not-so-subtle efforts, to back the next cohort of star employees turned star entrepreneurs. Wave Capital originally began as an institutional venture capital fund explicitly for Airbnb alumni starting new companies. Ross Fubini of XYZ Ventures introduced Palantir’s first business hire to its first engineer and now invests in the community out of his fund. Eric Tarczynski of Contrary Capital launched Contrary Talent, a program that helps early career professionals navigate the world of entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This newsletter was going to be about the undercovered mafias that are brewing in tech, but <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1403085207121637376">a recent exchange with some of you on Twitter</a> took me in an entirely new direction. Check out the thread if you want to know the next mafioso, but today, I want to explore a more modern way to think about these entities.</p>
<h3>Glamorization of mafias</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2170445" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170445" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/smoky_backroom.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170445" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Britt Erlanson / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Rebekah Bastian, the chief executive and founder of OwnTrail, isn’t the biggest fan of mafias — even though she’s technically a part of one herself. The first-time founder was the former Zillow VP of Product and VP of Community &amp; Culture who thinks that the growing world of mafias comes with some problematic truths.</p>
<p>“While it&#8217;s true that these ‘mafias’ are good for the people within them and often touted with pride, there are reasons that they are problematic from an equity perspective,” she said. First, she pointed to how hiring from and funding employees from a given company, if that company doesn&#8217;t have diverse representation (particularly at the leadership level), propagates the inequitable cycles of who is getting hired and funded. Second, she thinks that the press focuses on startups coming out of these companies that serve a privileged subset of the population, instead of mission-focused ones.</p>
<p>What do you think? Her argument is essentially to not glamorize the concept of hiring within existing networks, because if white, male entrepreneurs only hire from within their existing networks, the resulting company will look and act white and male. On the flip side, and this is what gets me excited, underrepresented founders who raise millions of dollars, suddenly have the power to usher in an entirely different group of techies into this world. The Glossier mafia would look quite different than the PayPal mafia.</p>
<p>As I said before, I think &#8220;mafias&#8221; are certainly a compelling way to track how talent moves. I don’t think we should stop paying attention to the phenomenon or shame people for being opportunistic about alumni groups. It’s how the world works. Instead, I think that there’s hope that problems inherent to them are changing as founding groups themselves become more diverse. To Bastian’s point, I think there’s a way to be more intentional about what is idolized and what is not.</p>
<h3>A new descriptor</h3>
<p>A few people also mentioned that we should start using a different word to describe this dynamic instead of &#8220;mafia&#8221; due to its more nefarious connotations. Here’s a list of your best suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaOgundu/status/1403348280352796678">Tribe</a></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Happy weekend, everyone. I hope that your week wasn’t too hectic and that you are getting a good recharge in. That said, we have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>Something that has been cropping up more and more in my inbox, SMS folder and Twitter DMs are venture rounds from startups with an open-source backbone. Essentially, startups have roots in an open-source project, often with the progenitors of that open tech inside the company itself.</p>
<p>A good example of this at the very end stage of the startup world was Confluent. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/confluents-ipo-brings-a-high-growth-high-burn-saas-model-to-the-public-markets/">went public this week</a> to pretty good effect, pricing above its IPO range and later appreciating further. Confluent is predicated on the open-source tech Kafka, which you’ve probably heard of.</p>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/mavolpi">Mike Volpi of Index Ventures</a>, an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/confluent-closes-24m-series-b-round-for-its-apache-kafka-based-stream-data-platform/">early backer of Confluent</a>, on the company’s IPO day. During our chat, we got to nibble on the open-source (OSS) startup world, which Volpi said changed dramatically in recent years. From his telling, venture investors back in 2015 weren’t too hyped about open-source startups, arguing that there already was one (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/what-does-red-hats-sale-to-ibm-tell-us-about-couchbases-valuation/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Red Hat</a>), and that that was going to be roughly about it.</p>
<p>If we did our math correctly, Index wound up with a stake worth in excess of $1 billion in Confluent at its IPO price. So, the haters were wrong about OSS.</p>
<p>That said, Volpi added that while he’s as bullish on open-source-focused startups as before, the market has become increasingly picked over as more investors pile into backing the model. That inventors are putting more money to work in the space is not a surprise if you’ve been reading startup funding coverage. BuildBuddy is an example that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-15m-to-help-developers-build-software-more-quickly/">I wrote about last December</a>. Ron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/tecton-teams-with-founder-of-feast-open-source-machine-learning-feature-store/">covered Tecton</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/airbyte-announces-26m-series-a-for-open-source-data-connector-platform/">Airbyte</a> recently.</p>
<p>The trend of venture interest in OSS has been building for some time. Hell, VCs wrote about an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/tracking-the-explosive-growth-of-open-source-software/">explosion of open-source startups for TechCrunch back in 2017</a>. But the Confluent IPO and the recent wave of funding rounds for startups in the space seem to indicate that market appetite for such companies has reached a new, higher plateau. (If you are building an OSS-focused startup and recently raised capital, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">say hi</a>.)</p>
<h2>More on Confluent’s IPO</h2>
<p>The Exchange also spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps?lang=en">Confluent CEO Jay Kreps</a> on his company’s IPO day. A few notes from that chat are worth our time. Here are our key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing is never going back to “normal”:</strong> That venture capitalists were able to start doing deals over Zoom was only so surprising. After all, you’d expect your average VC to be somewhat technology savvy. But Kreps said that his IPO roadshow worked well over digital channels, and that he was able to talk to more folks, more quickly than if he had been jet-hopping around the country for face-to-face meetings. If the even more conservative public-market investor set is fine with Zoom, digital pitching is a done deal.</li>
<li><strong>Public markets are still burn friendly: </strong>Confluent is a quickly growing software company that is not yet profitable. Its IPO reception is a good indication that losing money remains perfectly acceptable in today’s market. Per Kreps, if you have a huge market &#8212; he reckons that Confluent has a $50 billion market to attack &#8212; and can show that capital is being invested &#8212; CEO code for <em>not being utterly torched by an inefficient business model and cost structure </em>&#8212; then losses are just fine. This matters for Q3 IPO hopefuls who have more growth than net income. Which is most of them.</li>
<li><strong>Even public investors like open source:</strong> The Exchange also asked Kreps about being an open-source company approaching the public markets. Was it a positive or negative? A positive, per the CEO, adding that technology has a history of being built around open standards, which means that OSS fits neatly into historical trends. And he added that because open-source projects can have strong organic momentum, it can help public investors see future growth at the corporate level. Neat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OK, how about even more open source news?</h2>
<p>Hope you like open-source software news, because I have even more for you. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/prefect-announces-32m-series-b-funding-led-by-tiger-global-to-deliver-on-growing-demand-for-dataflow-automation-301309467.html">Prefect raised a $32 million Series B</a>. I didn’t get to cover the round when it happened, but did catch up with the company this week for a quick chat.</p>
<p>The company is based around the PrefectCore, an open-source project. PrefectCore helps companies make sure that their data inflow is set up correctly, focusing on things like scheduling, monitoring, logging and so forth. The company calls this sort of work negative engineering; it falls into a dead space of sorts. No one really wants to work on it, per the startup.</p>
<p>Notably, Prefect, instead of offering a hosted version of its open-source project, instead sells a monitoring service. It thinks that hosting OSS projects is a somewhat old-hat way of monetizing such projects. So, instead of selling hosting or feature-gating, the company’s commercial product is an API that tracks what PrefectCore is managing. If it reports all green lights, good shit, you’re in swell shape. If not, you have an issue.</p>
<p>But what matters is that Confluent shows that OSS startups can reach a huge scale and become big IPOs. And Prefect indicates that there may be even more ways to skin the OSS cat when it comes to making money off open-source software.</p>
<p>So, expect more OSS VCs deals to land this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a tough year for business. From ransomware attacks and power outages to cloud downtime and supply-chain disruptions, it’s never been more important to communicate to customers and stakeholders about what’s going wrong and why. Yet, with partial data and misinformation often spreading faster than official word, it’s also never been harder to deliver accurate and timely messages.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of this environment, I wanted to convene a group of specialists to talk about what the future of crisis comms holds for startups, technology companies, and business more broadly. We had a great set of three folks discuss how to build resilient orgs, handle the decentralization going on in tech today, and how to prioritize crisis management over the mundane tasks every day.</p>
<p>Joining us were:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>, who as commandant of the Coast Guard and during his career, was commander of the Atlantic coast during 9/11, and led federal responses during Hurricane Katrina, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.</li>
<li><b>Ana Visneski</b>, who worked with Allen on building out the Coast Guard’s first digital presence as an officer and chief of media, is now senior director of communications and community at <a href="https://www.h2o.ai">H20.ai</a> and was formerly global principal of disaster communications for Amazon Web Services.</li>
<li><b>John Visneski</b> is the chief information security officer (CISO) at <a href="https://accolade.com">Accolade</a>, and was formerly director of information security at The Pokémon Company. He served 10 years in the U.S. Air Force, where he served as chief of executive communications, and yes, is Ana’s brother.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This discussion has been edited and condensed for clarity</i></p>
<h2 id="Prepping an organization for catastrophe">Prepping an organization for catastrophe</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: You’ve all been in disaster communications, in some cases for decades. What are some of the top-level lessons you’ve learned about the field?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Great communications and great communications people can’t save a dysfunctional organization. There’s only so much you can do with what you’ve got. I want to say that as a proviso because I’ve seen a lot of people try to communicate their way out of a problem.</p>
<p>The big difference between Katrina in 2005 and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 was Katrina was before Twitter and Facebook and Deepwater was after it. In the old days, you went out and did your job. There might be an after-action report, but it was pretty much done within your organizational structure.</p>
<p>I’m going to really date myself. We sent forces into Somalia [around 1993]. It was the first time in history that CNN watched the people come to shore from the amphibious vehicles and I knew life had changed dramatically. There is no operation that takes place these days where the public is not part of the operation, part of the environment, part of the outcomes that are generated. If you fail to realize that, you’re going to fail right away. Anybody who’s got a cell phone enters your world of work.</p>
<p>So the question is, how do you think about that? That’s resulted in a significant Black Lives Matter movement with George Floyd and somebody happened to be there with a cell phone, and if that had not happened, that situation probably would not have turned out the way it did. So the question is what are we to make of that loop?</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Generally speaking, your organizational hierarchies are not designed to be optimized for a crisis. They’re designed to build consensus. They’re designed to understand budgets. They’re designed for long-term planning. It’s the same in the military and it’s even worse in the private sector. And so there’s no concept of situational leadership. There’s no concept of who’s actually in charge during a particular crisis.</p>
<p>In recent attacks, the folks that were in my position, didn’t do a good enough job of explaining the technical aspects of what was going on in such a way that their organization could channel that into something that could then be translated to the public.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: That’s actually called the theory of excellence in crisis communications, which is basically you have to have this transparency and this well-organized system before something goes wrong. And almost everyone doesn’t.</p>
<p>A good example is in 2017, when S3 broke for AWS, which is how I ended up doing crisis comms for them. I looked around and I said, “Well, why don’t we use our crisis comms plan?” And my boss said, “Our what?” And so I ended up building the critical event protocol and I built it based off the Incident Command System (ICS) that is used by federal agencies during a disaster. And essentially it was a big red button that says “Stop! Everyone get on a call, figure out who’s in charge of responding” that just unifies everyone.</p>

<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I’ll give you a classic antidote because I’ve written about it quite a bit. When I was going to the Sloan School at MIT, in December of ’88, we went down to New York and visited a bunch of CEO’s, and one of the days we went across the river to see the CEO at Exxon, a guy named [Lawrence G. Rawl]. During the discussion, I asked, “Bhopal was the biggest industrial accident in the history of the world today. As a CEO running a big corporation, have you thought about what happened if you had a similar Bhopal-type situation?” He spent 20 minutes going over their extremely well-thought-out communications plan and four months later, the Exxon Valdez ran underground and they actually failed at everything.</p>

<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Your plan that you write down on paper is only as good as how much you practice it. Right? One of the things that the military typically is pretty good at is practicing before you play. Doing mock drills, doing tabletop exercises, having a red team that throws things at you that you might not expect.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Yeah. I’ve dealt with a couple of large firms that have had very big problems. The default setting, if you haven’t thought about this ahead of time, is they go to a subject matter expert and hold them accountable for what the organization should do. That is not the way to do it. You need a designated person to create unity of effort. It’s got to involve the C-suite, and it’s got to involve not only your clients and your stakeholders, but your supply chain.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: We keep talking about training, but just having a plan in the first place is critical. With some of these big companies, they’re so siloed that when something like this happens, everyone’s trying to do the right thing and running into each other. If you don’t have redundancies built in and backups for your backups, you’re going to go down hard.</p>
<p>You’ve got a plan for what happens if your main spokesperson <i>was</i> the incident? Or what happens if there was an earthquake and, all of a sudden, you don’t have your C-suite to talk? And John can talk a lot about this, but the last mile is another problem with crisis comms. If it’s a big disaster, you’ve got to plan around your tech, how are you going to get the information from the field back to where you can actually broadcast it out to people?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: When I got called to go to Katrina, I was on my way to the airport and the last thing I did was I sent my son along to a Best Buy to get me a mobile handheld and a SiriusXM receiver, so I could have awareness of what was being done. As far as the communications, a thing like that was the smartest thing I did.</p>

<p><b>John Visneski:</b> One of the biggest challenges is this all needs to be resourced, right? Your company needs to actually dedicate resources to that prior planning. To being able to build out the infrastructure, to being able to have hot-swap data centers and locations and things like that. And sometimes whether it’s your board or whether it’s your CFO or whoever’s holding the purse strings for your organization, it’s really hard to justify the return on investment that a lot of folks see as sort of a rainy day fund.</p>
<p>So it’s incumbent upon the leadership of the organization, particularly the leadership that is going to be involved in some sort of a disaster response to get ahead of those conversations and understand how disaster response can do things to protect revenue.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Because of the pandemic, we’ve had almost two years of shit hitting the fan. So we’re seeing a lot more C-suite leaders going, “We need to know how to be prepared for what happens next.”</p>
<h2 id="Communicating in a decentralized and flat world">Communicating in a decentralized and flat world</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: If you think about the last 20 years, particularly in the private sector, we went from a model of headquarters buildings, large leadership structures all in one place, oftentimes a fairly hierarchical model of how to operate a company, etc. Today, we’re seeing decentralization, and a sort of horizontalness in a lot of companies. How does this new culture affect disaster communications?</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Well, now that there is this decentralization, it’s incredibly difficult to wrangle all of your people and get everyone on the same page. And you have to think about what happens if Slack goes down. It goes back to redundancies — you have to have multiple ways of contacting your people.</p>
<p>Along that line, I am not a fan of companies saying is, “You can’t post on social media or you shouldn’t do this or that.” Because all that does is sows distrust. Instead, I am a big fan of training your people to do it right. Of course, you have to have company policy that if someone during a crisis is posting secure information or lies, or is just being a racist jerk, obviously there are consequences, but training your people to use the tool right, helps with transparency.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: My motto when I was commandant was transparency of information breeds self-correcting behavior. If you put enough information out and everybody holds it, organizational intent becomes embedded into how people see the environment they’re in. They’re going to understand what’s going on and you won’t have to give them a direct order to do the right thing. They’ll understand that. And I think that’s really important.</p>
<p>In the military, we have something called a “common operating picture,” and it’s basically a display where everybody’s at, what they’re doing at any one time. It’s not an order. It’s not hierarchical. Instead, it provides context and provides a window into what you’re doing.</p>
<p>So I think there’s a difference between creating a common operating picture and what actually constitutes authority. If you can separate those, the more you put into the former, the less of the latter you’re going to have to do.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: I’m based in Seattle. We have an office in Philadelphia, an office in Houston, an office in San Francisco, and an office in Prague. There’s people in all those offices who are critical for our business. The advantage we have is the advantage that a lot of tech organizations take for granted, which is we were already going through a digital transformation, or we were already on the backside of digital transformation. Cloud focus, Software as a Service, Slack, email, Signal on my phone, a million different ways for me to communicate with my team, communicate with leadership and things like that.</p>
<p>What we take for granted is, there are a lot of organizations in the United States and worldwide that have not gone through that digital transformation. No offense to the military, but when I was at the Pentagon, if email went down, you might as well play hockey in the hallways because no work was going to get done.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: You can add losing GPS as well.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Exactly. So a lot of organizations have had to come to terms with how do they communicate when they’re distributed like that? The answer isn’t one-size-fits-all. It might be different for an Accolade, different from a Facebook, different from a Twitter, different from a Bank of America or a Bank of New York Mellon. Just based on what their architecture looked like pre-pandemic, what their architecture looks now, and what sort of investments they’ve made to future-proof themselves, should something this ever happen again.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I was on a Twitter Space recently, and I was talking that in the United States, especially those of us who are in the tech industry, we tend to take for granted all of this stuff. There are all of these assumptions that are made. In reality, not only do you have to deal with the last mile if a disaster happens, but you also have to deal with the fact that not everyone has one of these super computers in their pockets all over the world.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168316" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168316" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168316" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=2048,1394 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-630531258.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168316" class="wp-caption-text">Residents walk past a downed cell network tower in Polangui, Albay province on December 26, 2016.<br />Image Credits: CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about technological arrogance, but people forget radio. People forget that there are these older technologies that in a disaster are still where you’re going to go. John makes fun of me all the time, because I’m trying the new thing every time it comes out, but you can’t forget the stuff that works like radio in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="The crisis of crises and how to handle the infinite range of disasters today">The crisis of crises and how to handle the infinite range of disasters today</h2>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: The next subject I want to get to is the range and diversity of crises that are hitting organizations today. The Admiral had brought up Exxon and ’89. Okay, you’re an oil company, you have an oil spill — I wouldn’t call it predictable, but you can certainly create a plan. You can say, “Here’s how we need to communicate. Here’s how we handle this.”</p>
<p>But look at the range of stuff we’ve had to deal with in the last year. Everything from a pandemic to Texas power outages, wildfires in California, TSMC is dealing with a drought in Taiwan, you’ve got internal employee hostile workplace protests, external protests, ransomware attacks, bitcoin heists, and on and on.</p>
<p>Ultimately does the same toolbox work no matter what the crisis is? Or do different types of crises demand different kinds of responses? And how would you know the difference?</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I taught crisis leadership in large complex organizations for four years at George Washington University. In the last class, I told my students to write down the worst catastrophe they could ever think would happen that you have to go and wake up the president in the middle of the night. They all wrote it down on a piece of paper, folded it up and put it in a ball cap. I shook it up and pulled one of the pieces out.</p>
<p>I said to the class, “Just listen to what I’m about to say. Thanks for getting up and coming in early to the White House Press Corps office this morning. I want you to know the president was notified at 4:30 this morning about what happened. He and the First Lady were overwhelmed with grief for the loss of life and the impact on the community. We’ve set up a schedule where we’re going to brief the president every four hours and a meeting following the brief to the president. There’ll be a brief to the press 30 minutes after that. The cabinet’s been advised.” And I went on and on and on.</p>
<p>I finished and I said, “What do you think about that?” And James Carville, who was visiting, said, “It’s great” and he asked, “Well, what was the event?” And I said, “I never opened the paper.” So to your point there’s some things that are just a goddammed no-brainer.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I took the ICS [Incident Command System] structure and rebuilt it basically to work in the corporate setting. And the reason that’s so effective is it’s built to be flexible. You have someone who’s in charge overall, you have someone who’s in charge of communications. You have someone who’s in charge of logistics. You have someone who’s in charge of security, and it flexes up or down. And so no one can necessarily predict a “black swan” event. But you can build a core response system that is as close to all hazards as possible.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: Predict complexity.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Yes. And you predict that it will be complex and that nothing goes to plan. We’ve made a lot of jokes that nothing prepared me for a wedding during COVID like having been a first responder. Well, my brother got married last year too. And I did a little bit of help there with my background, but for my wedding, nothing was the same. And it’s the same thing during a disaster. Katrina is different from Gustaf. Gustaf was different from Sandy, but they’re all hurricanes at their core.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: I just spent an hour with a bunch of government employees earlier today on the same topic. What happens in a “complex” situation is that existing standard operating procedures, legal theories, frameworks, and governance break down and do not work, and they have to be replaced with some other way to deal with it.</p>
<p>ICS allows you to do, and with the right standard doctrine, you can get pretty close to a 50-60% solution that will get you headed in the right direction while you figure out the rest of it.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: I’ll say at least from the tech side of things is those plans need to abstract technology almost entirely. Take it up to a level where it doesn’t matter what your communications method is from a technological standpoint. Don’t assume that you’re going to have the bits and bytes flowing the way that we do now. Don’t assume cell towers, don’t assume power, don’t assume any of those sorts of things, because the second that you predicate your plan on those assumptions is the second that the complexity is going to come in and tell you you’re wrong. The 40% that is not planned for is going to become what outweighs the 60%.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: I think one of the things the tech industry kind of runs into is we are so reliant on the technology now that we can’t imagine what we’d do without it. At the end of the day, good crisis comms relies on good people, and good crisis and disaster response relies on the people doing it.</p>
<p>So you have to build your plan around the people and the structure there, and then use the technology at hand during the event to augment what plans you already have for people. Because by the time I’d write a crisis plan for something. If I included Twitter and blah, blah, blah, well, one like John just said, it’s going to break. Or by the time we have the crisis, the technology has changed and we’re using something else. So you got to write it from a perspective of people first and tech is the tool.</p>

<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: Okay, so obviously we should all spend more time figuring out how to communicate better during crises. But everyone is busy, and every person is trying to hit whatever metric they need for the quarter. How do you get a low-risk but hugh-impact issue like crisis management on the priority list?</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: For a B2B organization or a B2C organization or really anybody that’s selling a particular service, typically you need to lean on compliance requirements first. So customer contracts are going to say, from a security perspective, your data security addendum, your privacy addendums, and things that are generally going to have some language that centers around having a business continuity plan, a disaster response plan, an incident response plan, a cyber incident response plan, and then the really good contracts are the ones that actually specify you’ll do it no less than two times a year. So the first thing to lean on is those compliance requirements, because those will actually directly tie to revenue.</p>
<p>Then the secret sauce and what a lot of us in the cyber community are trying to get better at is how do you take that next step? We know that compliance does not necessarily mean security. We know that just because we have a written business continuity plan and that we say we exercise it, we present a report that says we exercise it, doesn’t necessarily mean we’re going that next mile to make sure that we train our employees. The education piece of it is really what we need to advocate to get additional resources for.</p>
<p><b>Admiral Thad Allen</b>: My pitch to these big companies is if you’ve got a regulatory requirement, you have a plan that’s required. Why would you fund that and not take the opportunity to add just a little bit of incremental effort and resources to take advantage of the natural cycle that you’re required to do anyway?</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: Hit them where the money is, because a good crisis plan can range in price. Let’s say you spend $200,000 getting your system set up. If you’re looking at these companies, a disaster or a crisis could tank your company. Or it could cost you millions and millions of dollars if you’re not prepared. So at the end of the day, the ROI is huge.</p>
<p>And like I said before, with COVID having just happened, I think more of leadership is aware that, “Hey, we’re not crisis proof just because we’re a gaming company or just because we’re whatever.” No, one’s crisis proof. So at the end of the day, you’re going to save money. If you just do it in the first place, because then you just have to update it every year, and you just have to do a little bit of training. The biggest cost is on the front end and then just maintaining it after that and updating it.</p>
<p><b>John Visneski</b>: Everyone knows that if something bad happens, if you don’t have plans in place, you’re going to lose a shit load of money. But let’s think about it from a consumer standpoint. Generally speaking, your average consumer is becoming much more conversant when it comes to privacy.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it isn’t enough just to say, “If we don’t have this, things can go really bad.” It’s also to say, “We can leverage this if we do this really well. And if we can advertise to our customers, whether it’s another business or whether it’s the consumer that not only do we protect your data, but also we have all these plans in place in order to react to complex situations.” You can actually use that as something that separates you from your near-peer competitors in the business world.</p>
<p><b>Ana Visneski</b>: At the end of the day, if the trust isn’t there in the tech and the trust isn’t there that you’re doing the right things, it doesn’t matter what you do when a crisis hits. You’re already in the trashcan.</p>

<p>Hey Equity fam, we have a small clip of extra for you today. After our live show &#8212; <strong>listen to the recording <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/equity-live-this-is-what-leadership-smells-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, it was good fun</strong> &#8212; we got to take a few questions from the audience, audio that was not included in the main episode as we didn&#8217;t have the time. But we&#8217;ve cut it out, given it a short polish, and have it for you today.</p>
<p>If you wanted even more Equity, here you go!</p>
<p>As a small note from the team, we know that this week&#8217;s Wednesday episode didn&#8217;t have the best audio quality. And to do a Twitter Spaces experiment the same week as a live show might have felt like a lot of change. Don&#8217;t worry, it just worked out that way. Equity will keep tinkering and having fun, but we&#8217;re back to normal next week.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Q&amp;A, and we&#8217;ll see you at our next live show!</p>
<p>&#8212; Grace, Chris, Natasha, Danny, and Alex</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bristol proved especially popular among tech investors last year — local businesses raked in an impressive $414 million in 2020, making it the third-largest U.K. city for tech investment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. is gaining in popularity as a great place to start a tech firm. The country is quickly catching up to China on the tech investment front, with VC investments reaching a record of $15 billion in 2020, according to <a href="https://technation.io/report2021/#uk-tech-investment">TechNation</a>. A global health crisis notwithstanding, London remained a favorite for investors. U.K. cities made up a fifth of the top 20 European cities, with names such as Oxford, Dublin, Edinburgh and Cambridge rising to the fore in 2020.</p>
<p>Bristol proved especially popular among tech investors last year — local businesses raked in an impressive $414 million in 2020, making it the third-largest U.K. city for tech investment. The city also has the most fintech startups per head in the U.K. outside London, according to <a href="https://www.whitecapconsulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bristol-Bath-FinTech-Ecosystem-Report-2019-20.pdf">Whitecap’s 2019-2020 Ecosystem Report</a>.</p>
<p>Efforts by the city&#8217;s private and public sectors to modernize the city have helped it rank among the <a href="https://www.huawei.com/uk/news/uk/2017/huawei-uk-smart-cities-index">top smart cities in the U.K.</a>, attracting a bevy of tech entrepreneurs. Its proximity to London has meant that it is a good alternative for founders looking for a more affordable stay while letting them tap the capital&#8217;s financial resources. The University of Bristol also has the largest robotics department in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bristol is also home to an important startup accelerator, <a href="https://www.setsquared.co.uk/">SETsquared</a>. A collaborative effort by the five universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey, the accelerator has supported over 4,000 entrepreneurs and helped their startups raise a total of £1.8 billion. Other startup support players include the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/bristol-entrepreneur-who-exited-for-800m-doubles-down-on-the-city-with-deep-tech-incubator-and-vc-fund/">Science Creates VC fund</a>, set up by entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/h_destecroix">Harry Destecroix,</a> and <a href="https://www.techspark.co/">TechSPARK</a> <a href="https://engine-shed.co.uk/">Engine Shed</a>.</p>
<p>Key emerging startups from Bristol include Graphcore, Open Bionics, Ultraleap, Immersive Labs and Five AI.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of the state of the tech ecosystem and the investor outlook for this city, we surveyed founders, leaders and executives involved in nurturing Bristol&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>The survey revealed that the city has a robust renewable, zero-carbon and fintech startup landscape. Robotics, VR, bio, quantum, digital and deep tech are also areas showing promise. As for the investing scene, although Bristol has a healthy angel network, the city lacks institutional VC, but with London only a drive or train ride away, this has not proved a significant problem.</p>

<h2>Coralie Hassanaly, innovation consultant, DRIAD</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in renewable and zero-carbon innovation, fintech and robotics. It&#8217;s weak in industry 4.0.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, LettUs Grow, Open Bionics, Ultraleap and YellowDog.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
A lot of focus on fintech, I think.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Bristol is a great middle ground between a large dynamic city (plus it&#8217;s not far from London) and access to nice countryside area. With remote working we can expect it will attract new residents in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Aimee Skinner, Abigail Frear and Stuart Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Second major city in U.K. innovation.</p>
<h2>Pete Read, CEO and founder, Persona Education</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in media/animation, edtech, social impact, health and science. I&#8217;m most excited by edtech and the possibility to reach and positively impact millions of students via online learning. It&#8217;s weaker in hardware and fintech.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Kaedim, Persona Education and One Big Circle.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
There are several very active tech investment networks coming from several angles, e.g., university-led, groups of private angels and tech incubators. The great thing is they all collaborate and share resources, ideas and expertise in initiatives such as The Engine Shed and Silicon Gorge.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
More people are moving in, as Bristol has a great urban lifestyle with easy access to the countryside and Southwest/Wales holiday spots, and an international airport 20 minutes from the center.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Jerry Barnes at Bristol PE Club; Abby Frear at TechSPARK; Briony Phillips at Rocketmakers; Jack Jordan-Connelly at SETsquared.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s developing rapidly with lots of support, so it will be bigger, attracting more investment and definitely more on the international scene five years from now.</p>
<h2>Kiran Krishnamurthy, CEO, AI Labs</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Our tech ecosystem is strong in the aerospace and defense sector. We are excited by the scope and scale of digital transformation opportunities with AI available in this sector. The main weakness in this sector is the slow pace of transformation, especially now due to the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore and YellowDog.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Compared to the U.K. tech sector average, Bristol has a <a href="https://www.beauhurst.com/blog/tech-companies-bristol/">very low proportion</a> of established companies (4% versus 8%), a higher proportion of seed stage companies (42% versus 37%), and a higher death rate (21% versus 17%). It’s a particularly young ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
It is possible that people moving out of London will come into Bristol due to the transport links, strong ecosystem and beautiful nature of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Bristol turns out to be San Francisco of Europe!</p>
<h2>Simon Hall, director, Airway Medical</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in the medtech, veterinary, industrial sectors.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Others have moved in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
SETsquared.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
We will see massive growth in five years.</p>
<h2>Ben Miles, CEO, Spin Up Science</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?<br />
</strong>Our sector is weak in entrepreneurial ambition among researchers, and so suffers from low rates of deep tech spinout activity from leading universities. We are most excited by the step change in activity we have seen in the past two years and culture shift towards innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Rosa Biotech, Albotherm and CytoSeek.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Medium strength in shallow tech; currently weak in deep tech.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
People are moving in.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Spin Up Science, Science Creates and Science Angel Syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Very strong in deep tech with an invested local community of entrepreneurs, incubators and investors.</p>
<h2>Rupert Baines, ex-CEO, UltraSoC</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol is strong in wireless (5G, 60 GHz, etc.), semiconductors (especially processors, AI/ML and parallel architectures), robotics and other hard tech/deep tech.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, Ultraleap, Blu Wireless and Five AI.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s limited. There are some angels, but few locally focused funds.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Much the same: People choose to live in Bristol/Bath for quality of life. Much of the work is already external — commuting to London.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Nigel Toon, Simon Knowles, Stan Boland, David May and Nick Sturge.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Much stronger, with more processor and hardware activity.</p>
<h2>Mathieu Johnsson, CEO and co-founder, Marble</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol has a strong robotics, aerospace and renewables scene. I&#8217;m most excited to see how the legacy in aerospace in Bristol will translate to future industry-defining companies. The ecosystem is weak on the investor side, though London VCs are less than a two-hour train journey away.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Graphcore, Ultraleap and Open Bionics.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
I believe Bristol will become more attractive.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
Tom Carter at Ultraleap, and Joel Gibbard at Open Bionics.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Getting closer to London and Cambridge.</p>
<h2>Chris Erven, CEO, KETS Quantum Security</h2>
<p><strong>Which sectors is Bristol&#8217;s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack?</strong><br />
Bristol has a strong biotech, quantum, digital, science-based/deep tech ecosystem. I&#8217;m excited by this eclectic city with exciting people that think differently.</p>
<p><strong>Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol?</strong><br />
Any QTEC, SETsquared, or UnitDX members and alumni.</p>
<p><strong>What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What’s their focus?</strong><br />
Very early/nascent, mostly angels.</p>
<p><strong>With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in?</strong><br />
Probably move in! Beautiful green spaces around, lots of interesting, independent shops. And (just about) commutable from London.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)?</strong><br />
The incubators — QTEC, QTIC, SETsquared and UnitDX; Bristol Private Equity Club; Harry Destecroix.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you think the city’s tech scene will be in five years?</strong><br />
Buzzing. More great startups and VCs moving in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, we caught up with Steve Sarracino the founder of the growth-equity firm <a href="https://www.activantcapital.com/">Activant Capital</a> in Greenwich, Conn., We&#8217;d last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/this-low-flying-growth-equity-firm-with-payments-and-logistics-bets-just-closed-a-255-million-fund/">talked with Sarracino</a> back in early April of last year, as people around the world were being forced into their homes by the pandemic, and his firm was just closing its third fund with $257 million in capital commitments.</p>
<p>As we learned, Activant, which tends to invest in e-commerce infrastructure and payments companies, is now (according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001835572/000156761921007887/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a>), nearing a close on a fourth fund that has targeted $425 million. It has &#8212; like a <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/us-vcs-europe/">growing number</a> of other U.S. firms &#8212; also opened a new office in Berlin, headed by Max Mayer, a former investor with Global Founders Capital.</p>
<p>We talked a bit about Activant&#8217;s growing interest in Europe and what underlies it. We also talked about the velocity of deal-making right now and what Sarracino makes of one of the hottest trends of the year: the many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: How long have you been investing in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>SS: A long time. We&#8217;d invested in Hybris [an e-commerce company that was <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2497458/sap-buys-e-commerce-vendor-hybris-in-strike-back-at-oracle--salesforce-com.html">acquired</a> by SAP in 2013 for $1.5 billion]. We&#8217;re also investors in NewMarket [a six-year-old, Berlin- and Boston-based SaaS company that was founded by serial entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanschambach/">Stephan Schambach</a>, who also founded Demandware].</p>
<p>We go back and forth to London all the time; it&#8217;s easy from the East Coast. But the continent is a different story. You really need to have a presence on the ground there.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Why make the move now?</strong></p>
<p>SS: There was always a lot of technical talent there &#8212; I think there are two times the number of STEM graduates in Europe as in the U.S. The challenge before was that the venture community was smaller &#8212; it takes a vibrant early-stage community to create later-stage opportunities. Europe was also missing middle management. In L.A. or New York or Boston, you can pull strong SVPs or even C-level execs out of Facebook and Amazon, but there wasn&#8217;t the same level of big companies there, and that has changed. They&#8217;re all [in Europe] now. So you&#8217;ve now got the technical talent, [sufficient] venture [dollars] and management.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are there other advantages? Are valuations any better in Europe or is Tiger Global <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/tiger-global/">driving up the numbers</a> there, too?</strong></p>
<p>SS: For the best companies, you don&#8217;t see much difference in valuation across continent. But the opportunity in Europe is attractive in the middle stage. Seed and A is pretty well covered, but B,C,D, and E is a very different game.</p>
<p>Another amazing thing about Europe is that while you do have to spend a little more on marketing, sales, and product because you have to be multi-lingual, you have to deal with different tax jurisdictions, you have to sell differently in different countries, European startups as a result are purpose-built to go global much faster versus U.S. companies. [In the U.S.], you have one giant market and you might pop into the UK and Canada, but it&#8217;s a very different proposition to go global.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do the European companies you talk with feel the need to establish a presence in the U.S. as soon as possible, or has that changed, too?</strong></p>
<p>SS:  In some areas, for example, where cloud adoption is behind in Europe versus the U.S., you can get hypergrowth in Europe. So it&#8217;s not a requirement or prerequisite to expand into the U.S. But, of course, it&#8217;s on the roadmap for anyone in the tech business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think about companies that could conceivably become rivals with your U.S. investments down the road?</strong></p>
<p>SS: We&#8217;re careful about investing in the same company but in different geographies because our belief is that they can compete globally, so we try and pick the global winner. If it&#8217;s a micro geo &#8212; let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a company that sells SMB infrastructure software in Germany and won&#8217;t get to the US, we wouldn&#8217;t have trouble backing [a similar company in the U.S.], but that&#8217;s something you have to pay close attention to, because we are on the board and we are active.</p>
<p>Our funds are fairly concentrated. In our third fund, we only have six assets. With this new fund, we&#8217;ll have 10 to 12 partnerships at most. So it&#8217;s a little easier to manage.</p>

<p><strong>TC: How can anyone invest in a market that&#8217;s moving this fast? We reporters see a lot of deals and they look so much alike at this point that it&#8217;s dizzying. It must be exponentially worse for you.</strong></p>
<p>SS: Things are moving fast and they&#8217;re expensive. Tiger and bigger firms have shifted the market. But there are still great opportunities in the mid-stages. Our overall philosophy is that, first, you want to find the startup that&#8217;s doing something different or doing something that no one has done in a long time. You also have to distinguish between a feature and a platform. Can this startup build out a real platform and acquire different types of customers? Third, you&#8217;ve got to know these sectors much better now than ever before, because, to your point, there are 15 companies doing the same thing these days, and to have that level of conviction, you have to meet with all 15 and pick what you think is the winning horse based on where the market is going, the quality of the team, and the quality of the product they can build.</p>
<p>In some ways it&#8217;s harder to differentiate, and there are a few ways to react to that. The way we react is to retrench to our core sectors that we know well and say no to a lot of stuff that seems really amazing but we&#8217;re just not going to get up to speed fast enough given the velocity of the market.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you determine whether a startup is working on a feature versus a platform?</strong></p>
<p>SS: It&#8217;s a real issue because there are a lot of great feature companies that can get to some scale pretty fast &#8212; $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million in revenue. But making that next step is hard. Companies with real network effects &#8212; meaning that every customer they add, there&#8217;s some benefit to the other customers &#8212; [can be] any sort of of two-sided marketplace, [it can be] embedded payments, [but there has to be] some other level of &#8216;value add&#8217; besides selling simple software.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also seeing more companies charging transactionally versus [a flat subscription rate]. I think that&#8217;s going to be a big trend over the next three years &#8212; this move away from SaaS to charging along the lines of what the customers cares about. When you charge the way the customer views their revenue, the product has to be very good and very differentiated.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve talked with me before about funding companies that help SMBs avoid getting hollowed out by Amazon. Just wondering what you make of these many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon we&#8217;re seeing in the U.S. and Europe and suddenly in Asia, too.</strong></p>
<p>SS: Oh, gosh. So they&#8217;re basically finding really neat products, buying them for cheap multiples of EBITDA, and then driving better advertising, visibility, and reviews on Amazon to get more buyers driving up EBITDA. It&#8217;s a brilliant play, but I&#8217;ve had my face ripped off a few times, and one [instance owed to there being] a single point of failure, so as Amazon shifts things, I think that introduces risk.</p>
<p>There are some really interesting assets out there. It&#8217;s just not what we do. I also think there was some Covid bump, because people were at home and not spending money on travel, so you saw spending shift away from services and experiences and into goods and products and I think that&#8217;s going to shift back quickly to experiences. So we&#8217;ll see what happens post COVID with some of these, but it&#8217;s going to be get the same kind of overarching growth that drove some of the underlying products. There&#8217;s  also a question about how much technology they&#8217;re really applying versus, is it more of a deal business. That&#8217;s unclear, but, I mean, some of them have raised like half a billion dollars so they got it, they&#8217;re doing something right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KynkMn5Hv3Q">new Megan Thee Stallion music video</a> out in time for triple digit temperatures. But instead of launching a fresh viral TikTok dance for summer, the single inspired an informal protest among Black creators tired of thanklessly launching trends into the social media stratosphere.</p>
<p>With the release of the video for &#8220;Thot Shit,&#8221; some Black TikTok creators began <a href="https://mashable.com/article/black-tiktok-strike-dance-megan-thee-stallion-thot-shit">calling attention to that exploitation this week</a>, inspiring others to <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieMac/status/1406630859596259329">refuse to choreograph a dance</a> to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture — much of which is <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/after-addison-rae-backlash-jimmy-fallon-hosted-black-tiktok-dancers-the-tonight-show">re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators</a> and culture at large.</p>
<p>The song choice probably isn&#8217;t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers — twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case — and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The &#8220;strike&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsskeonluv29/video/6974936656839281926?lang=en&amp;amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1">pointing to what happens when they&#8217;re not around</a>. (Predictably: not a lot.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Thot-Shit-6972655154873796610?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">On the sound&#8217;s page</a>, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theericklouis/video/6975379403282943237?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Black creators don&#8217;t get their due on the app</a>. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song&#8217;s lyrics are instructional but <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kiri.jaz/video/6976422643293490437">non-Black TikTok still can&#8217;t figure it out</a>.</p>
<p>The eminently danceable &#8220;Thot Shit&#8221; could build into Megan Thee Stallion&#8217;s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn&#8217;t know it.</p>

<p>When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a &#8220;critical and vibrant&#8221; part of the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fordahomies24/video/6975357226684878085?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1"> cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously</a> to a clip of Nicki Minaj&#8217;s 2016 song &#8220;Black Barbies&#8221; that <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/black-barbies-tiktok-sound/">specifically praises Black bodies</a> (&#8220;I&#8217;m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body&#8230;&#8221;). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.</p>
<p>&mdash; DEFUND &amp; ABOLISH POLICE, REFUND OUR COMMUNITIES (@BreeNewsome) <a href="https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/1408210077497057282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hankgreen1/video/6976405761987448069">TikTok&#8217;s economics are stacked against them</a>, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators, <a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/companies/why-instagram-influencers-are-unionising">particularly creators of color</a>, are turning to collective action and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/style/influencer-union-hollywood-SAG-AFTRA.html">even unionizing to assert their power</a>.</p>
<p>For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem — something even a quick glance at the desolate &#8220;Thot Shit&#8221; sound makes abundantly clear.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/aws-is-buying-encrypted-messaging-service-wickr/">Amazon buys encrypted messaging service Wickr:</a> </strong>If you thought it was strange that an e-commerce company runs the world’s biggest public cloud service, it may feel even stranger that that same public cloud service just bought an encrypted messaging service. But in the platform era, tech companies want to do everything, so we should not be shocked. Amazon’s cloud team intends to “continue operating Wickr as is and offer its services to AWS customers” starting now. In related news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/amazon-and-google-face-uk-cma-probe-over-fake-reviews/">Amazon and Google are taking whacks in the U.K.</a> over fake reviews.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/faa-clears-virgin-galactic-for-commercial-astronaut-spaceflight/"><strong>Virgin is a go:</strong></a> The American government has cleared Virgin Galactic for commercial spaceflight. The result of the news? Shares of the SPAC’d company rose by nearly 39% today. So, it’s a liftoff moment for the company <em>and</em> its market cap.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/why-is-didi-worth-so-much-less-than-uber/"><strong>Didi’s confusing value:</strong></a> Closing out our Top 3 today, TechCrunch took a look at the Chinese ride-hailing giant’s first IPO price range. We’re curious why it looks and feels so cheap compared to its erstwhile rival, Uber.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>TechCrunch stretched its legs today, giving us a lot to discuss past the usual funding round roll call. Here’s what you should read:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/deep-science-keeping-ai-honest-in-medicine-climate-science-and-vision/">What’s new in Deep Science:</a></strong> Behind the scenes of startup glitz and venture capital glamor is a bunch of scientific work, the stuff that powers the next generation of tech and the startups of tomorrow. Devin Coldewey has a digest of science work ranging from predicting liquid flow based on still images to AI systems faking confidence.</li>
<li><strong>The rapidly evolving early-stage market: </strong>If you care about how and when and why early-stage startups raise capital, TechCrunch has lots for you this week. Here’s a look at today’s <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">early-stage venture capital market in the U.S</a></strong>., and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/like-the-us-a-two-tier-venture-capital-market-is-emerging-in-latin-america/">here’s another focused on Latin America</a></strong>. More coming next week looking at what’s afoot in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, a host of startups raised more money. Here are a few highlights to keep you up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/mercuryo-raises-7-5m-for-crypto-focused-cross-border-payments-after-crossing-50m-in-arr/">Mercuryo raises $7.5M for crypto-powered, cross-border payments:</a></strong> One key use of blockchain tech that was touted years ago was sending money around the world. Traditional banking is famously bad at this, leading to high fees and other issues. Mercuryo could be cracking the model and has crossed the $50 million ARR mark. Impressive.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/edge-delta-raises-15m-series-a-to-take-on-splunk/">Edge Delta raises $15M to take on data analysis giants:</a> </strong>The startup’s new Series A puts it into closer competition with Splunk, Datadog and other huge companies that sell cloud-based data monitoring services. The real story is somewhat technical, but happy we had <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericl">Frederic Lardinois</a> on hand to explain it to us.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/kaszek-ventures-leads-a-15-million-round-in-chilean-asset-management-startup-fintual/"><strong>Fintual raises $15M for Latin American retail investing:</strong></a> The Robinhood-led boom in retail investing that the United States has seen in recent years is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon. And Fintual wants to take a bite out of the trend in the Latin American market. The Chilean startup now has a Series A under its belt to power its fight against both regulation and incumbent players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Musculoskeletal medical startups race to enter personalized health tech market</h2>
<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>From the world of Big Tech today we just have one more entry, as we covered Amazon’s big news up above. <a href="https://twitter.com/riptari">Natasha Lomas</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/linkedin-formally-joins-eu-code-on-hate-speech-takedowns/">reported today that</a> “Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.”</p>
<p>I wanted to raise this particular story because it somewhat underscores how internet regulation is shaping up around the world. You wouldn’t see this story, say, in the United States, or at least not in the same format. And in China, for example, another key internet market, it would also have a very different flavor. To some degree it feels like we’re dealing with three different &#8212; and increasingly distant &#8212; internets. Something for startups to chew on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings should have a clear purpose, but instead, they&#8217;ve become a way to measure status and reinforce what is colloquially referred to as CYA culture.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a kernel of truth in every joke, so whenever someone quips, &#8220;This meeting could have been an email!&#8221; you can bet that some small part of them meant it sincerely.</p>
<p>Few people know how to run meetings effectively and keep conversations on track. Making matters worse, attendees often don&#8217;t bother to prepare, which makes a boring session even less productive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the complication of workplace politics: How secure do you feel declining an invitation from a co-worker — or a manager?</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time a recurring meeting is added to a calendar, a kitten dies,&#8221; says Chuck Phillips, co-founder of MeetWell. &#8220;Very few employees decline meetings, even when it’s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Changing your meeting culture is difficult, but given that 26% of workers plan to look for a new job when the pandemic ends, startups need to do all they can to retain talent.</p>
<p>Aimed at managers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/reform-your-startups-meeting-culture/">this post offers several testable strategies</a> that will help you boost productivity and say goodbye to poorly run, lazily planned meetings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Declining a bad meeting should never be taboo, and you should reiterate your trust in the team and challenge them to spend their and others’ time with more intention,&#8221; Phillips says. &#8220;Help them feel empowered to decline a bad meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch, and have a great weekend.</p>

<h2>Why Amazon should pay attention to Shein</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2167952" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167952" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2167952" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png 1414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-21-at-9.53.54-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167952" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shein</p></div></p>
<p>In the last year, online apparel shopping app Shein grew active daily users by 130%, reports Apptopia.</p>
<p>Each day, thousands of new products arrive on the app&#8217;s virtual shelves. Items are rapidly designed and prototyped before Shein&#8217;s contractors put them into production in Guangzhou factories — two weeks later, those SKUs arrive in fulfillment centers around the globe.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reporter Rita Liao examined how the company&#8217;s agile supply chain has become hot talk among e-commerce experts, but beyond a strong logistics game and data-driven product development, Shein&#8217;s close relationships with suppliers are integral to its success.</p>
<p>She also tried to answer a question many are asking: Is Shein a Chinese company?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to pin down where Shein is from,&#8221; answered Richard Xu from Grand View Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a company with operations and supply chains in China targeting the global market, with nearly no business in China.”</p>

<p>MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool CEO Chris Bennett joined Extra Crunch Live to tear down the company’s early deck.</p>
<p>“The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare-bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points,” <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater'">Brian Heater</a> writes before noting the CEO admitted that “not much changed aesthetically between that first pitch and the Series A deck.”</p>
<p>“It aligned with what we were valuing at the time,” Bennett says. “We were really focused on getting the product-market fit and really trying to understand what our customers needed. And we’re really focused on building the team.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’ve been working on an H-1B in the U.S. for nearly two years. </strong></p>
<p><strong>While I’m grateful to have made it through the H-1B lottery and to be working, I’m feeling unhappy and frustrated with my job.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I really want to start something of my own and work on my own terms in the United States. Are there any immigration options that would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Seeking Satisfaction</strong></p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm calls SentinelOne’s looming debut “fascinating.”</p>
<p>“Why? Because the company sports a combination of rapid growth and expanding losses that make it a good heat check for the IPO market,” he writes. “Its debut will allow us to answer whether public investors still value growth above all else.”</p>
<p>Alex delves into an early dataset from SentinelOne and why public market investors still appear to value growth above anything else.</p>

<p>Guest columnist Rob Hudock, a litigator who focuses on helping companies recruit the best talent available while avoiding distracting workplace issues or lawsuits, lays out the importance of putting out any employment-related fires before an exit.</p>
<p>“Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals — from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers,” he writes.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance.”</p>

<p>Building an excellent product and a standout company culture require the same process, Heap CEO Ken Fine writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“At Heap, the analytics solution provider I lead, a defining principle is that good ideas should not be lost to top-down dictates and overrigid hierarchies,” he writes. “The best results come when you approach leadership like you would create a great product — you hypothesize, you test and iterate, and once you get it right, you grow it.”</p>
<p>Here, he lays out his method that argues in favor of iterative change, not “one-and-done decrees.”</p>

<p>The big news on Thursday was the announcement of Andreessen Horowitz’s new cryptocurrency-focused fund. Most focused on the eye-popping $2.2 billion figure, but Alex Wilhelm dug a bit deeper into the announcement to note that a16z isn’t just pumping a ton of money into the crypto space, it’s putting on gloves to fight for it.</p>
<p>Alex writes that “a16z intends to run defense for crypto in the American, and perhaps global, market. Crypto-focused startups are likely unable to tackle the regulation of their market on their own because they’re more focused on product work in a particular region of the larger crypto economy. The wealthy and connected investment firm that backs them will take on the task for its chosen champions.”</p>

<p>Moving from a pay-as-you-go model to a subscription service is more than just putting a monthly or yearly price tag on a product, CloudBlue’s Jess Warrington writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Executives cannot just layer a subscription model on top of an existing business,” Warrington writes. “They need to change the entire operation process, onboard all stakeholders, recalibrate their strategy and create a subscription culture.”</p>
<p>Warrington says that in his role at CloudBlue, companies often approach him for “help with solving technology challenges while shifting to a subscription business model, only to realize that they have not taken crucial organizational steps necessary to ensure a successful transition.”</p>
<p>Here’s how to avoid that situation.</p>

<p>Rebecca Bellan interviewed Veo CEO Candice Xie about the micromobility startup’s “old-fashioned way” of doing business.</p>
<p>“I understand people are eager to prove their unit economics, their scalability and also improve their matrix to the VC to raise another round,” Xie says. “I would say that’s OK in the consumer industry, like consumer electronics or SaaS.</p>
<p>“But we are in transportation. It is a different business, and transportation takes years of collaboration and building between private and public partners. … So I don’t see it happening from day one, turning over a billion-dollar company, while simultaneously having it all make sense for the cities and users.”</p>

<p>All companies want more or less the same thing: growth. But how do you accomplish it?</p>
<p>Ideally, don’t start from scratch.</p>
<p>The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. … “[F]orward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth,” Mark Spera, the head of growth marketing at Minted, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>“Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it’s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch. Here are five companies with growth strategies worth emulating — including the most important lessons you can begin applying to your business today.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more than 50 million Americans suffering from chronic pain and musculoskeletal (MSK) medical problems, a number of startups are offering patients new products &#8220;that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo,&#8221; reports Natasha Mascarenhas.</p>
<p>Startups hoping to enter this space have an uphill climb. Setting aside regulations that cover aspects like product packaging and marketing, they must compete with well-entrenched competition from Big Pharma as they try to partner with health insurance companies.</p>
<p>Natasha profiles three companies that are each taking a different approach to personalized health: Clear, Hinge Health and PeerWell.</p>

<p>In the second part of an Exchange series looking at the global early-stage venture capital market, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim unpacked the scene in Latin America, discovering it looked a lot like the situation in the United States: slow Series A rounds, fast B rounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>Despite that, the funds aren&#8217;t being equitably distributed, and the region still lags behind its peers: Brazil has the most $1 billion startups in Latin America, with 12. The U.S., meanwhile, has 369, and China has 159.</p>
<p>But the Latin American market remains hot, if not quite as scorching as the U.S. and China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers at <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/carbon-nanomaterial-light-strong-0624">MIT</a> and <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/nano-architected-material-resists-impact-better-than-kevlar">Caltech</a> have created a nanoengineered material that could be tougher than the likes of kevlar or steel. Made of interconnected carbon &#8220;tetrakaidecahedrons,&#8221; the material absorbed the impact of microscopic bullets in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>The study, led by MIT&#8217;s Carlos Portela, aimed to find out whether nanoarchitected materials — that is, designed and fabricated at the scale of nanometers — could be a viable path toward ultratough blast shields, body armor and other protective surfaces.</p>
<p>The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetradecahedron">tetrakaidecahedron</a>-based materials, however, isn&#8217;t a new one. The complex 14-sided class of polyhedron (there are about 1.5 billion possible variations) was proposed by Lord Kelvin in the 19th century as theoretically one of the most efficient possible for filling space with duplicates of itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If many such polyhedra can be packed into a small space and interconnected, Portela and his colleagues wondered, would they act as an efficient shock absorber? Such materials had been tested with slow deformations but not powerful impacts like you would expect from a bullet or micrometeoroid.</p>
<p>To find out, they assembled blocks of the material by means of nanolithography techniques, baking the resulting structure until it was pure carbon. Then they shot these carbon structures with 14-micron-wide silicon oxide bullets traveling well above the speed of sound (though at these scales, the comparison is a bit quaint).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170508" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170508" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2170508" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg" alt="Close-up of silicon oxide 'bullet' embedded in the carbon material" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MIT-Supersonic-Carbon-02-press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2170508" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MIT/Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The carbon structures, especially denser ones, absorbed the impact extremely well, stopping the particle dead — and crucially, deforming but not shattering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We show the material can absorb a lot of energy because of this shock compaction mechanism of struts at the nanoscale versus something that&#8217;s fully dense and monolithic, not nanoarchitected,&#8221; said Portela in a news release describing the discovery. &#8220;The same amount of mass of our material would be much more efficient at stopping a projectile than the same amount of mass of Kevlar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the researchers found they were able to model the impact and damage best by using methods generally used to describe meteors impacting a planet&#8217;s surface.</p>
<p>This is just an initial lab result, so soldiers won&#8217;t be wearing tetrakaidecahedronal flak jackets any time soon, but the experiment definitely shows the promise of this approach. If the team is able to find a way to manufacture the material at scale, it could be useful in all kinds of industries.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01033-z">Nature Materials</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Chinese ride-hailing giant appears set to be valued at a discount to its U.S. counterpart. By several tens of billions of dollars, it turns out. And we can’t quite figure out why.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years ago, U.S. ride-hailing giant Uber and its Chinese rival Didi were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/31/uber-china-will-reportedly-merge-with-archrival-didi-chuxing/">locked in an expensive rivalry</a> in the Asian nation. After a financially bruising competition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/didi-chuxing-confirms-it-is-buying-ubers-business-in-china/">Uber sold its China-based business to Didi</a>, focusing instead on other markets.</p>
<p>The two companies are coming head-to-head again, however, as Didi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">looks to list in the United States</a>. The company&#8217;s IPO filing was big news for the SoftBank Vision Fund, Tencent and Uber, thanks to its stake in Didi from its earlier transaction.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Uber is more diversified both geographically and in terms of its revenue mix. Didi is larger, more profitable and more concentrated.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But Didi appears set to be valued at a discount to Uber. By several tens of billions of dollars, it turns out. And we can&#8217;t quite figure out why.</p>
<p>This week, Didi indicated that it will target a $13 to $14 per-share IPO price, with each share on the U.S. markets worth one-fourth of a Class A share in the company. In more technical language, each <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp">ADR</a> is 25% of a Class A ordinary share in Didi, if you prefer it put like that.</p>
<p>With 288 million shares to be sold in its U.S. IPO, Didi could raise as much as $4.03 billion, a huge sum.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Didi worth at $13 to $14 per ADR? Using a nondiluted share count, Didi is valued between $62.3 billion and $67.1 billion. Inclusive of shares that may be issued thanks to vested options and the like, Didi could be worth <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-sets-valuation-target-of-62-billion-to-67-billion-in-ipo-11624575164">as much as $70 billion</a>; Renaissance Capital <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/83198/Chinese-ride-hailing-giant-DiDi-Global-sets-terms-for-$3.9-billion-US-IPO">calculates</a> the company&#8217;s midpoint valuation using a fully diluted share count at $67.5 billion.</p>
<p>Regardless of which number you prefer, Didi is not set to challenge Uber&#8217;s own valuation. Yahoo Finance pegged Uber at $95.2 billion as of this morning.</p>
<p>Why is the Chinese company worth less than its erstwhile rival? Let&#8217;s dig around in their numbers and find out.</p>
<h2>Didi versus Uber</h2>
<p>As a reminder, Uber&#8217;s Q1 2021 included adjusted revenues of $3.5 billion, a gain of 8% compared to the year-ago quarter. Uber&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA came in for the period at -$359 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">It is said that the best way to lose the next war is to keep fighting the last one. The citadels of the medieval ages were an effective defense until gunpowder and cannons changed siege warfare forever. Battlefield superiority based on raw troop numbers ceded to the power of artillery and the machine gun.</p>
<p>During World War I, tanks were the innovation that literally rolled over fortifications built using 19th-century technology. Throughout military history, innovators enjoyed the spoils of war while those who took too long to adapt were left crushed and defeated.</p>
<p>Cyberwarfare is no different, with conventional weapons yielding to technologies that are just as deadly to our economic and national security. Despite our military superiority and advances on the cyber front, America is still fighting a digital enemy using analog ways of thinking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			Despite our military superiority and advances on the cyber front, America is still fighting a digital enemy using analog ways of thinking.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This must change, and it begins with the government making some difficult choices about how to wield its offensive powers against an enemy hidden in the shadows, how to partner with the private sector and what it will take to protect the nation against hostile actors that threaten our very way of life.</p>
<h2>Colonial Pipeline was one step forward, two steps back</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html">ransomware attack</a> against Colonial Pipeline, the Russia-linked hacking group known as DarkSide reportedly shuttered and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-seizes-23-million-cryptocurrency-paid-ransomware-extortionists-darkside">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> recovered part of the $4.4 million ransom that was paid. These are positive developments and an indicator that our government is taking these types of attacks seriously. But it does not change the fact that cyberterrorists, acting with impunity in a hostile foreign country using a technique that has been known for years, managed to shut down the country’s largest oil pipeline and walk away with millions of dollars in ransom payments. They will likely never face justice, Russia will not face any real consequences and these attacks will no doubt continue.</p>
<p>The reality is that while companies can get smarter about cyber defenses and users can get more vigilant in their cyber hygiene practices, only the government has the power to bring this behavior to a halt.</p>
<p>Countries that permit cybercriminals to operate within their borders should be made to hand them over or be subject to crippling economic sanctions. Those found providing sanctuary or other assistance to such individuals or groups should face material support charges like anyone who assists a designated terrorist organization.</p>
<p>Regulators should insist that cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets help track down illicit transactions and parties or be cut off from the U.S. financial system. Law enforcement, the military and the intelligence community should be aggressively working to make it so difficult, so unsafe and so unprofitable for cyberterrorists to operate that they would not dare attempt another attack against American industry or critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Government must facilitate cooperation with private actors</h2>
<p>Our biggest vulnerability and missed opportunity is the inability of public and private entities to form a unified front against cyberwar. It is essential from both a defensive and offensive perspective that the government and private sectors share cyber risk and incident information in real time. This is not currently happening.</p>
<p>Companies are too scared that in revealing vulnerabilities they will be sued, investigated and further victimized by the very government that is supposed to help them defend against attack. The federal government still has no answer for the problems of overclassification of information, overlapping bureaucracies and cultural barriers that provide no incentive to proactively engage with private industry to share information and technologies.</p>
<p>The answer is not to strong-arm companies into coming to the table and expect one-way information flow. Private actors should be able to come forward voluntarily and share information without having to fear plaintiff litigation and regulatory action. Self-disclosed cyber data made in real time should be kept confidential and used to defend and fight back, not to further punish the victim. That is no basis for a mutual partnership.</p>
<p>And if federal agencies, the military or the intelligence community have intelligence about future attacks and how to prevent them, they should not sit on it until long after it will do any good. There are ways to share information with private industry that are safe, timely and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Cooperation should also go beyond the exchange of cyber event information. The private sector and academia account for a massive amount of advancement in the cyber space, with total research and development spending split roughly <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/us/bed/research-development-expenditure/4706/">90%-10% between the private and public sector</a> over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Our private sector &#8212; with technology companies employing the best and brightest spanning from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, to the technology corridor of Northern Virginia &#8212; has a tremendous amount to offer to the government yet remains a largely untapped resource. The same innovations driving private-sector profit should be used to strengthen national security.</p>
<p>China has already figured this out, and if we cannot find a way to leverage private-sector innovation and young talent in the United States, we will fall behind. If there has ever been a call to action where the Biden administration, Democrats and Republicans in Congress can set politics aside and embrace <a href="https://www.axios.com/senator-warner-calls-congress-cyberattacks-6313c867-a67e-4836-9d47-f09d45a6faeb.html">bipartisan solutions</a>, this is it.</p>
<h2>Look to the military-defense industry model</h2>
<p>Thankfully, there is a model public-private dynamic that in many ways is working. Weapons systems today are almost exclusively manufactured by the <a href="https://www.idb.org/what-is-the-defense-industrial-base/">Defense Industrial Base</a>, and when deployed to the battlefield there is constant two-way communication with warfighters about vulnerabilities, threats and opportunities to improve effectiveness. This relationship was not forged overnight and is far from perfect. But after decades of efforts, secure collaboration platforms were developed, security clearance standards were established and trust was formed.</p>
<p>We must do the same between cyber authorities in the federal government and actors throughout the private sector. Financial institutions, energy companies, retailers, manufacturers and pharmaceuticals must be able to engage the government to share real-time cyber data in both directions. If the federal government learns of a threat group or technique, it should not only take the offensive to shut it down but also push that information securely and quickly to the private sector.</p>
<p>It is not practical for the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security or the military to assume the burden of defending private networks against cyberattacks, but the government can and should be a shoulder-to-shoulder partner in the effort. We must adopt a relationship that recognizes this is both a joint battle and burden, and we do not have years to get it right.</p>
<h2>Call to action</h2>
<p>When you look at the history of war, the advantage has always gone to those who innovate first. With respect to cyberwarfare, the solution does not lie solely in advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing or blockchain. The most powerful development in today’s war against cyberterrorism might be as simple as what we all learned in preschool: the value of sharing and cooperation.</p>
<p>The government, the technology industry and the broader private sector must come together not only to maintain our competitive edge and embrace advances like cloud computing, autonomous vehicles and 5G, but to ensure that we defend and preserve our way of life. We have been successful in building public and private partnerships in the past and can evolve from an analog relationship to a digital one. But the government must take the reins and lead the way.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week, we'll explore a number of projects aimed at identifying or confirming bias or cheating behaviors in machine learning systems, or failures in the data that support them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Research papers come out far too frequently for anyone to read them all. That’s especially true in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/deep-science/">This column</a> aims to collect some of the more interesting recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter.</p>
<p>This week we have a number of entries aimed at identifying or confirming bias or cheating behaviors in machine learning systems, or failures in the data that support them. But first a purely <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/06/14/uw-researchers-turn-single-photo-into-video/">visually appealing project</a> from the University of Washington being presented at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.</p>
<p>They trained a system that recognizes and predicts the flow of water, clouds, smoke and other fluid features in photos, animating them from a single still image. The result is quite cool:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2169362" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/symmetric-720-GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2169362" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2169362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/symmetric-720-GIF.gif" alt="Animation showing how a system combined guesses at previous and forthcoming moments to animate a waterfall." width="600" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2169362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hołyński et al./CVPR</p></div></p>
<p>Why, though? Well, for one thing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">the future of photography is code</a>, and the better our cameras understand the world they&#8217;re pointed at, the better they can accommodate or recreate it. Fake river flow isn&#8217;t in high demand, but accurately predicting movement and the behavior of common photo features is.</p>
<p>An important question to answer in the creation and application of any machine learning system is whether it&#8217;s actually doing the thing you want it to. The history of &#8220;AI&#8221; is riddled with examples of models that found a way to look like they&#8217;re performing a task without actually doing it — sort of like a kid kicking everything under the bed when they&#8217;re supposed to clean their room.</p>
<p>This is a serious problem in the medical field, where a system that&#8217;s faking it could have dire consequences. <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-05/uow-mam052721.php">A study, also from UW, finds</a> models proposed in the literature have a tendency to do this, in what the researchers call &#8220;shortcut learning.&#8221; These shortcuts could be simple — basing an X-ray&#8217;s risk on the patient&#8217;s demographics rather than the data in the image, for instance — or more unique, like relying heavily on conditions in the hospital its data is from, making it impossible to generalize to others.</p>
<p>The team found that many models basically failed when used on datasets that differed from their training ones. They hope that advances in machine learning transparency (opening the &#8220;black box&#8221;) will make it easier to tell when these systems are skirting the rules.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this week, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">wrote about the early-stage venture capital market</a>, with the goal of understanding how some startups are raising more seed capital before they work on their Series A, while other startups are seemingly raising their first lettered round while in the nascent stages of scaling.</p>
<p>The expedition was rooted in commentary from <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Rudina Seseri of Glasswing Ventures</a>, who said abundant seed capital in the United States allows founders to get a lot done before they raise a Series A, effectively delaying these rounds. But after those founders did raise that A, their Series B round could rapidly follow thanks to later-stage money showing up in earlier-stage deals in hopes of snagging ownership in hot companies.</p>
<p>The idea? Slow As, fast Bs.</p>
<p>After chatting with Seseri more and a number of other venture capitalists about the concept, a second dynamic emerged. Namely that the “typical” early-stage funding round, as Seseri described it, was “becoming atypical because of the rise of preemptive rounds [in which] typical expectations on metrics go out the window.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Series As, she said, could come mere months after a seed deal, and Series B rounds were seeing expected revenue thresholds tumble in part to “large, multiasset players that have come down market and are offering a different product than typical VCs &#8212; very fast term sheets, no active involvement post-investment, large investments amounts and high valuations.”</p>
<p>Focusing on just the Series A dynamic, the old rule of thumb that a startup would need to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) is now often moot. Some startups are delaying their A rounds until they reach $2 million in ARR thanks to ample seed capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>While some startups delay their A rounds, others raise the critical investment earlier and earlier, perhaps with even a few hundred thousand in ARR.</p>
<p>What’s different between the two groups? Startups with &#8220;elite status&#8221; are able to jump ahead to their Series A, while other founders spend more time cobbling together adequate seed capital to get to sufficient scale to attract an A.</p>
<p>The dynamic is not merely a United States phenomenon. The two-tier venture capital market is also showing up in Latin America, a globally important and rapidly expanding startup region. (Brazilian fintech startup Nubank, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">just closed a $750 million round</a>.)</p>
<p>This morning, we’re diving into the Latin American venture capital market and its early-stage dynamics. We also have notes on the European scene, so expect more on the topic next week. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s hot</h2>
<p>Mega-rounds are no longer an exception in Latin America; in fact, they have become a trend, with ever-larger rounds being announced over the last few months.</p>
<p>The announcements themselves often emphasize round size: For instance, the recent $100 million Series B round into Colombian proptech startup Habi was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210623005589/en/Habi-Raises-100-Million-Series-B-Led-by-SoftBank-and-Expands-Footprint-into-Mexico">touted</a> as &#8220;the largest Series B for a startup headquartered in Colombia.&#8221; This follows other 2021 records such as &#8220;the largest Series A for Mexico &#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">$65 million for online grocer Jüsto</a> &#8212; and &#8220;the largest Series A ever raised by a Latin American fintech&#8221; &#8212;  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/">$43 million</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">&#8220;Plaid for Latin America&#8221;</a> Belvo.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mercuryo.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has built a cross-border payments network, has raised $7.5 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The London-based company describes itself as “a crypto infrastructure company” that aims to make blockchain useful for businesses via its “digital asset payment gateway.” Specifically, it aggregates various payment solutions and provides fiat and crypto payments and payouts for businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put more simply, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo aims to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrencies as a tool for putting in motion next-gen, cross-border transfers or, as it puts it, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“to allow any business to become a fintech company without the need to keep up with its complications.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The need for fast and efficient international payments, especially for businesses, is as relevant as ever,” said Petr Kozyakov, Mercuryo’s co-founder and CEO. While there is no shortage of companies enabling cross-border payments, the startup’s emphasis on crypto is a differentiator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our team has a clear plan on making crypto universally available by enabling cheap and straightforward transactions,” Kozyakov said. “Cryptocurrency assets can then be used to process global money transfers, mass payouts and facilitate acquiring services, among other things.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2170352" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2170352" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2170352 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Alexander-Vasiliev-Greg-Waisman-Petr-Kozyakov--e1624639508126.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1331" /><p id="caption-attachment-2170352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Left to right: Alexander Vasiliev, Greg Waisman, Petr Kozyakov / MercuryO</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo began onboarding customers at the beginning of 2019, and has seen impressive growth since with annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April surpassing over $50 million. Its customer base is approaching 1 million, and the company has partnerships with a number of large crypto players including Binance, Bitfinex, Trezor, Trust Wallet, Bithumb and Bybit. In 2020, the company said its turnover spiked by 50 times while run-rate turnover crossed $2.5 billion in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build on that momentum, Mercuryo has begun expanding to new markets, including the United States, where it launched its crypto payments offering for B2B customers in all states earlier this year. It also plans to “gradually” expand to Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target Global led Mercuryo’s Series A, which also included </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participation from a group of angel investors and brings the startup&#8217;s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to launch a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptocurrency debit card (spending globally directly from the crypto balance in the wallet) and continuing to expand to new markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo’s various products include a multicurrency wallet with a built-in crypto exchange and digital asset purchasing functionality, a widget and high-volume cryptocurrency acquiring and OTC services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kozyakov says the company doesn’t charge for currency conversion and has no other “hidden fees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We enable instant and easy cross-border transactions for our partners and their customers,” he said. “Also, the money transfer services lack intermediaries and require no additional steps to finalize transactions. Instead, the process narrows down to only two operations: a fiat-to-crypto exchange when sending a transfer and a crypto-to-fiat conversion when receiving funds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo also offers crypto SaaS products, giving customers a way to buy crypto via their fiat accounts while delegating digital asset management to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether it be virtual accounts or third-party customer wallets, the company handles most cryptocurrency-related processes for banks, so they can focus more on their core operations,” Kozyakov said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lobanov, Target Global’s co-founder, said that as an experiment, his firm tested numerous solutions to buy Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doing our diligence, we measured ‘time to crypto’ – how long it takes from going to the App Store and downloading the app until the digital assets arrive in the wallet,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercuryo came first with 6 minutes, including everything from KYC and funding to getting the cryptocurrency, according to Lobanov.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The second-best result was 20 minutes, while some apps took forever to process our transaction,” he added. “This company is a game-changer in the field, and we are delighted to have been their supporters since the early days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the startup plans to release a product that will give businesses a way to send instant mass payments to multiple customers and gig workers simultaneously, no matter where the receiver is located.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Several personalized health tech startups hope to reinvent care for patients suffering from musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the pandemic unevenly roars on, <a href="https://twitter.com/emelton?lang=en">Emily Melton</a>, founder and managing partner of <a href="https://threshold.vc/">Threshold VC</a>, is reflecting on a previous public health crisis: the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>She says the response just over a century ago prompted the rise of interventional medicine — treating illness through surgery or medicine only after symptoms manifest. Today, interventional medicine is the dominant mindset in Western healthcare. And, Melton, a lead investor in health tech startups including Livongo, Tia and Calibrate, says the care pathway ages well.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Personalized medicine — the buzzy yet powerful framing growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups — is a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or comorbidities.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s happening in our society? Chronic diseases, chronic pain, diabetes and obesity,” she said. “That doesn’t require a magic pill and there&#8217;s not just a surgery. Oftentimes, there’s therapeutic components, behavior changes and movable touch points.”</p>
<p>Enter personalized medicine. The buzzy yet powerful framing is growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups. It’s a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or comorbidities. In hormonal health, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/hormonal-health-is-a-massive-opportunity-where-are-the-unicorns/">personalized medicine could add more data and specificity</a> to which birth control someone takes, instead of the usual process of trial and error. Essentially, it’s the opposite of interventional medicine.</p>
<p>“We’re not just an arm or a leg, we’re not just obese or a diabetic or a pain sufferer,” Melton said. “How do we treat you as a whole person?”</p>
<p>A number of companies are using this approach to reinvent care for patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain. These conditions are commonly treated with addictive opioids, a major public health concern. As an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, entrepreneurs are working on solutions that don’t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo. And the money market is certainly there: In 2017, the global MSK medical market <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/3973843/musculoskeletal-diseases-market-forecast-2020#:~:text=The%20global%20musculoskeletal%20diseases%20Market,5.5%25%20during%202018%20to%202023.">was valued at $57.4 billion</a>; the market for chronic pain, which overlaps with MSK medicine, is expected to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chronic-pain-treatment-market-to-cross-151-7-billion-value-by-2030-ps-intelligence-301136366.html">hit $151.7 billion in value by 2030.</a></p>
<p>“Oftentimes it&#8217;s not new ideas, it&#8217;s conflating a number of factors that come together at one moment in time that allow exponential change that makes a startup work,” Melton said, of the boom and recent activity in MSK medicine. Today, we’ll focus on three startups taking different approaches to help people suffering from chronic pain and MSK-related conditions: Clearing, PeerWell and Hinge Health.</p>
<h2><strong>Clearing</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avi-dorfman-3a89803/">Avi Dorfman</a> says going direct to consumers is the most effective way to treat chronic pain, so he founded<a href="https://www.clearing.com/"> Clearing</a>. The digital health startup worked with a medical advisory board of physicians and researchers from Harvard, Johns Hopkins and NYC&#8217;s Hospital for Special Surgery to create an opioid-free solution for people struggling with pain.</p>
<p>Last month, Clearing raised a $20 million seed round led by Bessemer and Founders Fund. Melton also invested in the round on behalf of Threshold.</p>
<p>Clearing offers four products: prescription compound cream that includes FDA-approved ingredients, CBD cream for topical discomfort, nutraceuticals to supplement joint health, and a directory of prerecorded, at-home exercises. It currently is available to patients in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EU for all its lethargy, faults and fetishization of bureaucracy, is, ultimately, a good idea. It might be 64 years from the formation of the European Common Market, but it is 29 years since the EU&#8217;s formation in the Maastricht Treaty, and this international entity is definitely still acting like an indecisive millennial, happy to flit around tech startup policy. It’s long due time for this digital nomad to commit to one ‘location’ on how it treats startups.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing we can all agree on, this is a unique moment in time. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptance of technology globally, especially in Europe. Thankfully, tech companies and startups have proven to be more resilient than much of the established economy. As a result, the EU’s political leaders have started to look towards the innovation economy for a more sustainable future in Europe.</p>
<p>This moment has not come soon enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The European tech scene is still lagging behind its US and Asia counterparts in numbers of startups created, talent in the tech sector, financing rounds, and IPOs / exits. It doesn’t help, of course, that the European market is so fractionalized, and will be for a long time to come.</p>
<p>But there is absolutely no excuse when it comes to the EU’s obligations to reform startup legislation, taxation, and the development of talent, to “level the playing field” against the US and Asian tech giants.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: The EU can’t seem to get its shit together around startups.</p>
<p>Consider this litany of proposals.</p>
<p>Starting as far back a 2016 we had the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2016%3A733%3AFIN">Start-Up and Scale-Up Initiative</a>. We even had the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/european-scaleup-manifesto/">Scale-Up Manifesto</a> in the same year. Then there was the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/startup-communities-look-ahead-11-concrete-policy-recommendations-european-leaders">Cluj Recommendations</a> (2019), and the <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">Not Optional</a> campaign for options reform in 2020.</p>
<p>Indeed, I’ve even contributed a few thoughts myself. In 2013 I was a “Special Rapporteur&#8221; to the European Commission’s “Startup Europe Initiative” supported by Vice President Neelie Kroes (at the time) and wrote the very first report that &#8211; more or less &#8211; became the foundation of all that came afterwards.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, the community of VC´s, founders, and startup associations in Europe has been saying mostly the same things for <em>years</em>, to national and European leaders.</p>
<p>Finally, this year, we got something approaching a summation of all these efforts.</p>
<p>Portugal, which has the European presidency for the first half of this year, took the bull by its horns and created something approaching a final draft of what the EU needs.</p>
<p>After, <em>again</em>, intense consultations with European ecosystem stakeholders, it identified eight best practices in order to level the playing field covering the gamut of issues such as fast startup creation, talent, stock options, innovation in regulation and access to finance. You name it, it covered it.</p>
<p>These were then put into the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/startup-europe">Startup Nations Standard</a> and presented to the European Council at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziTo5UOYnk8">Digital Day</a> on March 19th, together with the European Commission&#8217;s DG CNECT and its Commissioner Tierry Breton. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/on-friday-the-eu-will-put-startup-friendly-legislation-to-member-states-will-they-sign-up/">wrote about</a> this at the time.</p>
<p>Would the EU finally get a grip, and sign up for these evidently workable proposals?</p>
<p>It seemed, at least, that we might be getting somewhere. Some 25 member states signed the declaration that day, and perhaps for the first time, the political consensus seemed to be forming around this policy.</p>
<p>Indeed, a body set up to shepherd the initiative (the European Startup Nations Alliance) was even announced by Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa which, he said, would be tasked with monitoring, developing and optimizing the standards, collecting data from the member states on their success and failure, and reporting on its findings in a bi-annual conference aligned with the changing presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p>It would seem we could pop open a chilled bottle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bairrada_DOC">DOC Bairrada Espumante</a> and celebrate that Europe might finally start implementing at least the basics from these suggested policies.</p>
<p>But no. With the pandemic still raging, it seemed the EU&#8217;s leaders still had plenty of time on their hands to ponder these subjects.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech/">Scaleup Europe</a> initiative emerged from the mind of Emmanuel Macron, assembling a select group of 150-plus of Europe’s leading tech founders, investors, researchers, corporate CEOs and government officials to do some more pondering about startups. And then there was the <a href="https://europeanstartupnetwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Press-Release-10-May-2021-Action-Plan-to-Make-Europe-the-new-Global-Powerhouse-for-Startups.pdf">Global Powerhouse Initiative</a> of DG Research &amp; EU Innovation Commissioner Mariya Gabriel.</p>
<p>Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are about to go through this process all over again, with the EU acting as if it had the memory span of a giant goldfish.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not arguing that all these collective actions are a bad thing. But, by golly, European startups need more decisive action than this.</p>
<p>As things stand, instead of implementing the very reasonable Portuguese proposals, we will now have to wait for the EU&#8217;s wheels to slowly turn until the French presidency comes around next year.</p>
<p>That said, with any luck, a body to oversee the implementation of tech startup policy that is mandated by the European community, composed of organizations like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/">La French Tech</a>, <a href="https://startupportugal.com/">Startup Portugal</a> and <a href="https://startupestonia.ee/en">Startup Estonia</a>, might finally seem within reach.</p>
<p>Admittedly there might be light at the end of the tunnel. Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has responsibility for innovation and startups in the EU, and has a good reputation for getting things done. She also has the backing of President Van der Leyen to build a pan-European Innovation Ecosystem using the <a href="https://eit.europa.eu/">EIT</a> (€3 billion budget) the <a href="https://eic.ec.europa.eu/index_en">EIC</a> (€10 Billion budget) and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/european-innovation-ecosystems_en">EIE</a> (€500 million).</p>
<p>However, to anyone from the outside, it feels again as if the gnashing of EU policy teeth will have to go on yet longer. With the French calling for a &#8216;La French Tech for Europe&#8217; and the Portuguese having already launched ESNA, the efforts seem far from coordinated.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, tech startup founders and investors could not care less where this new body comes from or which country launches it.</p>
<p>After years of contributions, years of consultations, the time for action is now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for EU member states to agree, and move forward, helping other member states catch up based on established best practices.</p>
<p>It’s time for the long-awaited European Tech Giants to blossom, take on the US-born Big Tech Giants, and for Europe to finally punch its weight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has committed to doing more to quickly purge illegal hate speech from its platform in the European Union by formally signing up to a self-regulatory initiative that seeks to tackle the issue through a voluntary Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_3221">statement today</a>, the European Commission announced that the professional social network has joined the EU&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Countering Illegal Hate Speech Online, with justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, welcoming LinkedIn&#8217;s (albeit tardy) participation, and adding in a statement that the code &#8220;is and will remain an important tool in the fight against hate speech, including within the framework established by digital services legislation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I invite more businesses to join, so that the online world is free from hate,&#8221; Reynders added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While LinkedIn&#8217;s name wasn&#8217;t formally associated with the voluntary Code before now it said it has &#8220;supported&#8221; the effort via parent company Microsoft, which was already signed up.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/june/24/keeping-conversations-safe--trusted-and-professional">statement</a> on its decision to formally join now, it also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;LinkedIn is a place for professional conversations where people come to connect, learn and find new opportunities. Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn’t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members’ professional identities for the entirety of their career &#8212; it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the EU &#8216;illegal hate speech&#8217; can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.</p>
<p>A number of Member States have national laws on the issue &#8212; and some have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/germany-tightens-online-hate-speech-rules-to-make-platforms-send-reports-straight-to-the-feds/">passed their own legislation</a> specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.</p>
<p>The initiative kicked off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/facebook-twitter-youtube-and-microsoft-agree-to-remove-hate-speech-across-the-eu/">back in 2016</a> &#8212; when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).</p>
<p>Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined &#8212; with video sharing platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/tiktok-joins-europes-code-on-tackling-hate-speech/">TikTok signing up last October</a>, for example.</p>
<p>But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren&#8217;t participating. Hence the Commission&#8217;s call for more digital services companies to get on board.</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.</p>
<p>L<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a>) to existing ecommerce rules </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements &#8212; in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles &#8212; at least at a high level &#8212; the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code. </span></p>
<p>The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/eu-adopts-rules-on-one-hour-takedowns-for-terrorist-content/">this April</a>) &#8212; which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation &#8212; as Reynders&#8217; remarks underline.</p>
<p>Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of &#8216;carrots and sticks&#8217; where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial &#8216;danger zone&#8217; of speech regulation.</p>
<p>So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized &#8216;notice and response&#8217; procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there&#8217;s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On illegal hate speech, EU lawmakers eye binding transparency for platforms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/on-illegal-hate-speech-eu-lawmakers-eye-binding-transparency-for-platforms/embed/#?secret=0xiDOW6QPK" data-secret="0xiDOW6QPK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The EU has &#8212; for several years &#8212; had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/">voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation</a> too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)</p>
<p>And while lawmakers recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">announced a plan to beef that Code up</a> &#8212; to make it &#8220;more binding&#8221;, as they oxymoronically put it &#8212; it certainly isn&#8217;t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.</p>
<p>In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.</p>
<p>It added that it welcomed the results &#8212; but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.</p>
<p>The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of &#8216;fake news&#8217; being fenced on their platforms, including &#8212; on the public health front &#8212; what they last year dubbed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/tech-giants-must-open-up-about-the-coronavirus-infodemic-say-eu-lawmakers/">coronavirus infodemic</a>.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers&#8217; minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.</p>
