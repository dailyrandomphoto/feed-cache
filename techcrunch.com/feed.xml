										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve been hard at work building your game-changing startup. Diligent in its care and feeding so that, one day soon, it will grow into the mighty unicorn you envision. If you fit that description, we want you to apply to compete in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.</p>
<p>Any early-stage startup founder with an MVP — regardless of your category or geographic location — is eligible to apply. But here’s the thing. The window for tossing your hat into the ring is shrinking rapidly. Don’t wait — <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to compete in Startup Battlefield</a> before the window slams shut on <strong>May 27 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s run down the list of many benefits that come from competing in the world’s most famous startup launching pad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Perfect pitch:</strong> All competing startups get weeks of free training with the TC Startup Battlefield training squad. You’ll hone your presentations skills, polish your business model and pitch with cool, calm confidence come game day.</p>
<p><strong>Global exposure:</strong> An all-virtual Startup Battlefield means that thousands upon thousands of startup influencers, icons, tech media, potential investors, customers, collaborators and developers around the world will tune in to watch this always-epic event. All competitors — win or lose — bask in, and benefit from, this global, equal-opportunity spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>Plenty of perks:</strong> Battlefield gladiators are TC Disrupt VIPs. You’ll enjoy lots of complimentary bennies including exhibition space in virtual Startup Alley, event passes, tickets to future TC events, a private reception with members of the Startup Battlefield alumni community, access to the CrunchMatch networking platform and a free subscription to Extra Crunch.</p>
<p><strong>Mucho moola:</strong> One startup will rise above the rest to claim the Disrupt Cup, the title of Startup Battlefield Champion and take home $100,000 of equity-free prize money. Ka-ching.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll make your pitch to, and then answer questions from, panels of expert judges. Who are these mystical beings you need to impress? So far, we’ve announced two, with plenty more to come. We’re thrilled to have both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/alexa-von-tobel-will-join-disrupt-2021-as-a-startup-battlefield-judge/">Alexa von Tobel</a>, co-founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/gv-partner-terri-burns-is-joining-us-to-judge-the-startup-battlefield/">Terri Burns</a>, a partner at GV (formerly known as Google Ventures) on board.</p>
<p>Remember those influencers and potential investors we mentioned earlier? We’re talking about folks like Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars. Rachel told us that she goes to TechCrunch events to “find new and interesting companies, make new business connections and look for startups with investment potential.” She also shared her thoughts about Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>“The Startup Battlefield translated easily to the virtual format. You could see the excitement, enthusiasm and possibility of the young founders, and I loved that. You could also ask questions through the chat feature, and you don&#8217;t always have time for questions at a live event.”</p>
<p>Your unicorn dreams might be on an early-stage startup budget, but this is a huge opportunity for you to gain global exposure and have a good shot at winning $100,000. <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">Apply to compete in Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As far as AI systems have come in their ability to recognize what you&#8217;re saying and respond, they&#8217;re still very easily confused unless you speak carefully and literally. Google has been working on a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">new language model called LaMDA</a> that&#8217;s much better at following conversations in a natural way, rather than as a series of badly formed search queries.</p>
<p>LaMDA is meant to be able to converse normally about just about anything without any kind of prior training. This was demonstrated in a pair of rather bizarre conversations with an AI first pretending to be Pluto and then a paper airplane.</p>
<p>While the utility of having a machine learning model that can pretend to be a planet (or dwarf planet, a term it clearly resents) is somewhat limited, the point of the demonstration was to show that LaMDA could carry on a conversation naturally even on this random topic, and in the arbitrary fashion of the first person.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2154028" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2154028" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2154028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg 1784w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pluto.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2154028" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The advance here is basically preventing the AI system from being led off track and losing the thread when attempting to respond to a series of loosely associated questions.</p>
<p>Normal conversations between humans jump between topics and call back to earlier ideas constantly, a practice that confuses language models to no end. But LaMDA can at least hold its own and not crash out with a &#8220;Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand&#8221; or a non-sequitur answer.</p>
<p>While most people are unlikely to want to have a full, natural conversation with their phones, there are plenty of situations where this sort of thing makes perfect sense. Groups like kids and older folks who don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t care about the formalized language we use to speak to AI assistants will be able to interact more naturally with technology, for instance. And identity will be important if this sort of conversational intelligence is built into a car or appliance. No one wants to ask &#8220;Google&#8221; how much milk is left in the fridge, but they might ask &#8220;Whirly&#8221; or &#8220;Fridgadore,&#8221; the refrigerator speaking for itself.</p>
<p>Even CEO Sundar Pichai seemed unsure as to what exactly this new conversational AI would be used for, and emphasized that it&#8217;s still a work in development. But you can probably expect Google&#8217;s AIs to be a little more natural in their interactions going forward. And you can finally have that <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2329">long, philosophical conversation with a random item</a> you&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced a new feature for its Chrome browser today that alerts you when one of your passwords has been compromised and then helps you automatically change your password with the help of&#8230; wait for it&#8230; Google&#8217;s Duplex technology.</p>
<p>This new feature will start to roll out slowly to Chrome users on Android in the U.S. soon (with other countries following later), assuming they use Chrome&#8217;s password-syncing feature.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this won&#8217;t work for every site just yet. As a Google spokesperson told us, &#8220;the feature will initially work on a small number of apps and websites, including Twitter, but will expand to additional sites in the future.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now you may remember Duplex as the somewhat controversial service that can call businesses for you to make hairdresser appointments or check opening times. Google <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">introduced</a> Duplex at its 2018 I/O developer conference and launched it to a wider audience in 2019. Since then, the team has chipped away at bringing Duplex to more tasks and <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/duplex-helpful-updates/">brought it the web</a>, too. Now it&#8217;s coming to Chrome to change your compromised passwords for you.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153878" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_SaferWithGoogle_PasswordAutoChange_OF_v20.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153878" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2153878" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/05_SaferWithGoogle_PasswordAutoChange_OF_v20.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2153878" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by Duplex on the Web, Assistant takes over the tedious parts of web browsing: scrolling, clicking and filling forms, and allows you to focus on what’s important to you. And now we’re expanding these capabilities even further by letting you quickly create a strong password for certain sites and apps when Chrome determines your credentials have been leaked online,&#8221; Patrick Nepper, senior product manager for Chrome, explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BllfqjVd07"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/embed/#?secret=BllfqjVd07" data-secret="BllfqjVd07" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In practice, once Chrome detects a compromised password, all you have to do is tap the &#8220;change password&#8221; button and Duplex will walk through the process of changing your password for you. Google says this won&#8217;t work for every site just yet, but &#8220;even if a site isn’t supported yet, Chrome’s password manager can always help you create strong and unique passwords for your various accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how well this works in the real world. Every site manages passwords a little bit differently, so it would be hard to write a set of basic rules that the browser could use to go through this process. And that&#8217;s likely why Google is using Duplex here. Since every site is a little bit different, it takes a system that can understand a bit more about the context of a password change page to successfully navigate it.</p>
<p>In addition to adding this feature, Google is also updating its password manager with a new tool for important passwords from third-party password managers, deeper integration between Chrome and Android and automatic password alerts when a password is compromised in a breach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its I/O developer conference, Google today announced the next generation of its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPU) AI chips. This is the fourth generation of these chips, which Google says are twice as fast as the last version. As Google CEO Sundar Pichai noted, these chips are then combined in pods with 4,096 v4 TPUs. A single pod delivers over one exaflop of computing power.</p>
<p>Google, of course, uses the custom chips to power many of its own machine learning services, but it will also make this latest generation available to developers as part of its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">Google Cloud platform</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the fastest system we&#8217;ve ever deployed at Google and a historic milestone for us,&#8221; Pichai said. &#8220;Previously to get an exaflop you needed to build a custom supercomputer, but we already have many of these deployed today and will soon have dozens of TPUv4 pods in our data centers, many of which will be operating at or near 90% carbon-free energy. And our TPUv4 pods will be available to our cloud customers later this year.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The TPUs were among Google&#8217;s first custom chips. While others, including Microsoft, decided to go with more flexible FPGAs for its machine learning services, Google made an early bet on these custom chips. They take a bit longer to develop &#8212; and quickly become outdated as technologies change &#8212; but can deliver significantly better performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google kicked off its Google I/O Developer event this afternoon with a set of new collaborative workspace tools, which it&#8217;s calling, as a group, &#8220;Smart Canvas.&#8221; The company demonstrated using how Smart Canvas works for brainstorming and project planning, showing how users could drop in ideas about an upcoming launch, share their thoughts, work on documents together, join Google Meet calls and solve problems together.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/google-workspace-features/">enhancing its everyday collaborative documents</a>, like Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, with a dozen some new features, as a part of its effort in the Smart Canvas new product experience.</p>
<p>Currently, when users @mention others in a document, a smart chip will pop up, displaying that person&#8217;s location, job title and contact information. Smart chips will also now appear for recommended files and meetings in Docs, and will soon roll out to Sheets. This will make it easier for collaboratives to scan the associated, linked documents, as well as people, without having to switch apps to see the information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google has also improved the insert link experience to show relevant, intelligent suggestions for Drive files, headings and bookmarks within your document, based on the highlighted text where you&#8217;ll insert the link.</p>
<p>And Google&#8217;s assisted writing feature will now offer more inclusive language recommendations as you write — like that you use the word “chairperson” instead of “chairman,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SDBbFETGiA4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/smartchips-for-files-and-meetings-checklists-in-docs.html">Other updates include</a> a pageless format in Docs to remove page boundaries, emoji reactions in Docs, the ability to import info from Calendar meeting invites, connected checklists in Docs that let you assign items to other people and see these action items in Google Tasks, Table templates in Docs, a timeline view in Sheets, more assisted analysis functionality in our Sheets, the ability to create Docs, Sheets and Slides from Google Chat rooms, and more.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting changes, however, was support for live captions and translations in Google Meet, and the ability to now present your content to a Google Meet call on the web directly from your Doc, Sheet or Slide. This puts Google in competition with other meeting transcription services, like Otter.ai.</p>
<p>The updates paint a picture of Google&#8217;s aim to make its workspace apps connect more seamlessly, instead of being separate components &#8212; that helps to lock users inside Google&#8217;s walled garden, and makes it more difficult to swap out one of Google&#8217;s workspace apps for a competitor.</p>
<p>Today the Smart Canvas update is rolling out features that include the ability to insert smart chips for Docs, Sheets or Slides files, other Google Drive files, and Calendar events; creating checklists; and inserting links more easily with intelligent suggestions in the insert link dialog box. Other features will come in the months ahead.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Until COVID-19, healthcare was either all in-person or all virtual. Patients had to choose. Some patients chose both &#8212; an in-person health system for most things and perhaps <a href="https://hello.livongo.com/">Livongo</a> for diabetes care or <a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a> for back pain care.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that in-person all the time is inconvenient and a waste of time when all a clinician is doing is looking at a wound or responding to lab results. But all-virtual is not great when things are uncertain or patients need to be examined. While there are few silver linings to the horrendous COVID-19 pandemic, one is that nearly all providers and most patients have experienced virtual care and most have found it useful. This widespread adoption of virtual care, we believe, will lead to hybrid models that we call “click-and-mortar,” which combine the best elements of in-person and virtual care to deliver better outcomes more reliably and efficiently.</p>
<p>The uptake of virtual care in 2020 is stunning: <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/us-doctors-turn-to-telehealth-as-covid-19-limits-in-person-care-snap-chart/">97%</a> of primary care doctors provided some kind of telehealth care in 2020. Moreover, <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/263866/hp-issue-brief-medicare-telehealth.pdf">nearly 44%</a> of Medicare beneficiaries’ primary care visits were provided by telemedicine in 2020, compared with a mere 0.1% the year before.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The notion of virtual care has become so common that Google searches for “doctor online” result in a specialized tool displaying widely available virtual care platforms, such as Teladoc, Amwell, Doctor On Demand and MDLive. Moreover, telemedicine providers like Doctor on Demand, MDLive, Galileo and Firefly have all launched “virtual primary care” services designed to deliver non-urgent longitudinal primary care virtually. While these services may meet the needs of healthier patients, the absence of a physical location for physical examinations, diagnostic tests and procedures may limit their utility.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			This widespread adoption of virtual care, we believe, will lead to hybrid models that combine the best elements of in-person and virtual care to deliver better outcomes more reliably and efficiently.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are several potential advantages of virtual primary care. The ability to see patients in their homes can contribute new information about safety, social support and social determinants. In cases like behavioral health, they can decrease the stigma associated with accessing care. Virtual care platforms can more easily incorporate remote monitoring data, and virtual visits can occur as groups with teams of caregivers or other specialists simultaneously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, virtual visits may allow for more frequent “microvisits” to monitor how patients are progressing. They also facilitate more rapid treatment adjustments because they eliminate the need to travel to a doctor’s office. Virtual visits also have lower cost for physicians, avoiding brick-and-mortar overhead costs, and for some services offer 24/7 access, which may reduce the need to seek urgent care or emergency department care. Finally, patients may be able to gain expanded access to clinicians who match preferences based on things like ethnicity, LGBTQ orientation and gender, particularly in rural areas where options are limited.</p>
<p>For pure-play virtual care models to work, they need to rely on connected devices and patient cooperation. Using connected blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, oximeters, thermometers and scales, it is possible to replicate much of the physical exam. Just like for in-person care, a virtual provider can order lab tests, although it is impossible to do a quick urinalysis or strep test virtually without the supplies on hand.</p>
<p>Virtual providers who work closely with health plans may have more data on cost and quality to inform referrals but perhaps less local knowledge. A possible consequence is that virtual providers may have more transactional relationships with specialists and traditional local brick-and-mortar providers.</p>
<p>Data have shown virtual care delivers better clinical outcomes in certain cases. Virtual care has been shown to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1357633X16680541">reduce</a> emergency department visits and antibiotic overprescribing. Chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes are examples where virtual care has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33112529/">outperformed</a> in-person care. Virtual physical therapy has <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695370/">generated</a> cost savings and resulted in fewer back surgeries.</p>
<p>Despite these benefits of purely virtual care, we believe that ultimately the most efficacious model of primary care is a hybrid one combining virtual and in-person interaction. We think that the mix of in-person and virtual is probably 80% virtual. We also think that most visits will be triggered by clinicians reaching out to patients in response to a change in remotely monitored data, perhaps a new fever, change in sleep patterns or weight change for a patient with heart failure.</p>
<p>The implications of visits being mostly virtual and largely triggered by changes in data are profound. It means that offices become places for problem-solving and procedures. It means clinicians spend their days responding to signals from patients and probably have their schedules largely unfilled until the night before. It means that patients will need to adopt passively collected and remotely monitored data.</p>
<p>We think this model ultimately will result in more frequent, shorter, virtual interactions that happen nearly continuously over text and be supplemented by email, phone and video. We also think this approach will deliver much better clinical outcomes and more rapid improvement since both the patient and clinician have much more data on how diseases are progressing.</p>
<p>There are risks with this model. It requires patients with mobile phones and devices to engage and respond to clinicians and ensure their remote monitoring devices stay online. Most importantly, patients need to follow the advice of virtual providers and prompts to get in-person labs, diagnostics or care when needed. Further, clinicians will need to be trained to conduct virtual clinical examinations and to incorporate as well as respond to remote monitoring data.</p>
<p>The COVID-19-fueled adoption of virtual care will hopefully create the demand on the part of patients and desire on the part of clinicians to embrace our “click-and-mortar” vision for care. These models have the potential to deliver more proactive, more engaging and, we think, far better care.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Humans may not have totally mastered getting objects to space, but we’ve done a pretty good job so far. The hundreds of satellites that orbit the Earth are proof enough that ‘send stuff to space’ is firmly in humanity’s capacity. But what about refueling, repairing, or even adding capabilities to spacecraft or satellites once they’re up there?</p>
<p>In the past few years, a host of companies have started to turn what has long been seen as a pipe dream into a real possibility. Now, satellite servicing company Starfish Space and space mobility provider Benchmark Space Systems will be entering into a new partnership aimed at advancing these much-needed capabilities – and their first demonstration will take place next month, on space startup Orbit Fab’s Tanker 1 mission.</p>
<p>Orbit Fab, which was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/orbit-fab-gas-stations-in-space-seed-funding/">finalist in our TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield</a> in 2019, will be sending up an operational fuel depot on a SpaceX Falcon 9 in June. The tanker is the first of what Orbit Fab is envisioning as a “gas station in space” – in-orbit propellant available to satellite customers who will no longer be limited in terms of their spacecraft&#8217;s active life by the amount of fuel they take up on launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Benchmark Space Systems and Orbit Fab already have an agreement to combine Benchmark’s Halcyon thruster system and the fuel depot startup’s fluid transfer interface (imagine a refueling apparatus) into an integrated propulsion package.</p>
<p>This is where Starfish Space comes in. It will be testing its CEPHALOPOD rendezvous, proximity operations and docking (RPOD) software with Benchmark’s Halcyon thruster system to make sure that the refueling demonstration is as accurate as possible. The RPOD software is entirely autonomous and can give small servicing vehicles up to 8 times more maneuvering capability, the company says.</p>
<p>Demonstration missions like the one in June are just the beginning. Refueling capacity could not only extend the mission length of satellites and other spacecraft, it could help open the door to new types of space missions and the emerging space economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When disaster strikes, costs pile up quickly. Flood waters can wipe out the foundation of a home or building, just as much as wildfires can burn down the walls or the entire structure. For residents and business owners, rebuilding and rebuilding quickly is crucial: they ultimately need some place to live and offer services, and they often can’t afford to be shut out for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Of course, the need for speed among consumers hits the brick wall that is the insurance industry and government’s timeline for dispersing post-disaster insurance claims and aid. It’s not uncommon for federal aid to take months or even years to arrive, and insurance companies can often take months as well to process claims, particularly after large disasters like hurricanes where thousands of claims arrive simultaneously.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hidorothy.com">Dorothy</a> is a startup that is aiming to bridge the gap by offering, well, gap loans to users who already have existing private insurance or federal flood insurance policies. The idea is to extend cash as quickly as possible after qualification, and then Dorothy gets paid back when a claim is later processed. Much like other advance cash startups in other sectors, Dorothy takes a fee based on the size of the loan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s underwriting model assesses the likelihood that a claim will be approved given the details of a particular disaster and the user’s insurance policy.</p>
<p>Arianna Armelli and Claudio Angrigiani founded the company last year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, naming it for the character from the Wizard of Oz who repeatedly said “there’s no place like home.” They met each other in graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania and explored different ways to solve the challenges of disaster finance.</p>
<p>Armelli, for her part, had experienced these challenges firsthand in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. She was an architect, and her office in Manhattan had to be evacuated. She returned a few days later, but over time, realized that many of her friends still couldn’t return to their homes even weeks after the hurricane had passed. She volunteered with recovery efforts, and I “went house to house in the Rockaways to remove drywall from their basements,” she said.</p>
<p>She continued her career, spending nearly six years as an architect and urban planner, and that training drove some of her early ideas about how to improve post-disaster recovery. “I thought the answer to these problems was designing better infrastructure and long-term sustainable solutions with planning,” she said. “After six years in planning, [I] realized these were 40-year projects.”</p>
<p>After meeting Angrigiani, the two explored ways to make the insurance system better for end users. They began by investigating how better flood data could help insurance companies underwrite better policies and process claims faster. They realized over time though that the insurance industry was quite sclerotic, and that a third-party provider of better flood predictive data wasn’t going to have a large impact on outcomes.</p>
<p>As COVID bared down on the world, they then explored business interruption insurance. Using their technology for disaster prediction, they saw an opportunity to offer “a financial supplementary product for businesses,” essentially a “credit line product that is offered to commercial business owners similar to a credit card,” Armelli said. That idea eventually morphed into the company’s current product offering targeting property owners, both businesses and individuals, with the same sort of gap loan to solve immediate cash-flow problems.</p>
<p>Dorothy participated in <a href="https://www.urban-x.com/company/dorothy/">the latest cohort of Urban-X</a> and closed a pre-seed round this past February. The company has raised a $250,000 debt facility to further test out its gap loan product, and it has 25 qualified customers in its pipeline. It’s early days, but an interesting new bet on how to make insurance actually useful when people face some of the toughest moments of their lives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">a new crop of startups</a> that are building new offerings in a world increasingly filled with massive disasters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://finary.eu">Finary</a>, a new French startup that wants to change how you manage your savings, investments, mortgage, real estate assets and cryptocurrencies. The company lets you aggregate all your accounts across various banks and financial institutions so that you can track your wealth comprehensively over time.</p>
<p>After attending Y Combinator, the startup has just closed a $2.7 million (€2.2 million) seed round led by Speedinvest with Kima Ventures and angel investors, such as Raphaël Vullierme also participating.</p>
<p>If you know people who have a ton of money, chances are they tend to be at least 40 or 50 years old — you don’t become rich overnight after all. And they tend to manage their investment portfolio through a wealth management service with tailor-made services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“There’s very little tech in wealth management. Advisors are also incentivized to sell you some financial products in particular,” co-founder and CEO Mounir Laggoune told me. In that situation, the company in charge of the financial product is generating revenue for the advisor — not the client.</p>
<p>At the same time, a new generation of investors is starting to accumulate a lot of wealth. And yet, they don’t have the right tools to allocate it properly. Younger people want to see information directly. They want a way to track information in real-time, or near real-time. And they want to be able to take some actions based on that data.</p>
<p>Finary wants to build that service based on those principles. It starts with an API-based aggregator. When you create a Finary account, you can connect it with all your other accounts —&nbsp;bank accounts, brokerage accounts, mortgage and real estate, gold, cryptocurrencies, etc.</p>
<p>The startup leverages various open banking APIs to be as exhaustive as possible. For instance, “you can connect a Robinhood account and a Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne account,” Laggoune said. Behind the scenes, Finary uses Plaid and Budget Insight, runs its own bitcoin and Ethereum nodes to track wallet addresses, estimates the value of your home through public data and a proprietary algorithm.</p>
<p>After that, you can see how much money you have, how it is divided between your investment pools, the current value of your gold and cryptocurrency assets and more.</p>
<p>“Our long-term vision is that we want to build a virtual wealth manager for Europe,” Laggoune said.</p>
<p>That’s why Finary recently launched its premium subscription called Finary+. With a premium account, you can see how much you’re paying in fees and track your performance — more features will get added over time.</p>
<p>A few months after launching its platform, Finary already tracks €2 billion in assets across thousands of users. With today’s funding round, the startup will roll out its service to more countries and more financial institutions in France, Europe and the U.S. The company is also working on mobile apps.</p>
<p>This is an interesting take on wealth management as Finary doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. Legacy players want you to use a single bank for all your financial needs. But you end up paying a lot of fees and you have to use old and clunky interfaces.</p>
<p>Finary isn’t yet another wealth management service. It’s a holistic service that lets you use multiple banks and services while remaining on top of your assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Four years after joining as Facebook&#8217;s first VP of VR, ex-Xiaomi exec Hugo Barra has left the company, he said in a social media <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10157618478316612">post</a> Tuesday.</p>
<p>Barra led Facebook&#8217;s VR efforts during a particularly tumultuous time for Oculus, coming aboard to helm the division as the once independent arm was folded deeper into its parent company after the departure of co-founder and CEO Brendan Iribe. During Barra&#8217;s time at Facebook, the company pivoted from PC-based VR systems towards all-in-one designs, relying on a partnership with Barra&#8217;s previous employer Xiaomi to help the company scale its entry-level Oculus Go headset which has since been discontinued.</p>
<p>The executive was eventually replaced in his role leading AR/VR inside Zuck&#8217;s inner circle by long-time Facebook veteran Andrew Bosworth and subsequently moved to a role leading partnerships. Barra leaves months after the launch of Facebook&#8217;s $299 Quest 2 headset, which arrived to positive reviews, and on the cusp of the company&#8217;s first foray into AR-based smart glasses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When Mark Zuckerberg approached me 5 years ago to come to Facebook to lead the Oculus team and work on virtual reality, I knew I was jumping into an ambitious journey to help build the next computing platform but I couldn&#8217;t have imagined just how much this team would get done in just a few years,&#8221; Barra wrote in a public Facebook post.</p>
<p>Barra didn&#8217;t detail where he&#8217;ll be landing next, but said he&#8217;s joining an effort in the healthcare technology space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Logistics and delivery providers are territorially split between Earth and space, with companies like Amazon and FedEx working to master ground, air and drone transportation, and new entrants like SpaceX honing its expertise in space launch.</p>
<p>Autonomous transportation startup Aevum wants to do both. And it was just issued a patent that will help it move dexterously between space launch to low Earth orbit, and air cargo and drone deliveries here on Earth.</p>
<p>The key is Aevum’s unmanned aircraft system, which it calls Ravn X. So far, Aevum has only publicly discussed its plans for the Ravn X in the context of space launches. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/space-startup-aevum-debuts-worlds-first-fully-autonomous-orbital-rocket-launching-drone/">It works like this</a>: the Ravn X uses conventional jet fuel and takes off from an airport runway, like a plane, but it has a rocket nested in its belly that deploys at high altitude to deliver payload to space. As the second stage detaches, the Ravn X returns to Earth using conventional touch-down techniques, ready for another delivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new Aevum patent, which was issued on May 4, is for a unique modular payload design positioned in the belly of the drone. With the new system described in the patent, that rocket payload module can be switched out for a cargo bay to carry deliveries around the world, or a drone module that can carry up to 264 smaller drones for last-mile delivery services. Theoretically, the Ravn X could depart from an airport, deliver its payload to space, return back to the airport to be reloaded with a filled cargo module, then take off again for earthbound deliveries.</p>
<p>While the exact amount a Ravn X can carry depends on the distance it&#8217;s traveling, the Ravn X air cargo will be able to carry up to 15,000 lbs and the space delivery payload will be able to carry up to 330 lbs. As of now, the rockets are expendable, but the company has plans for 100% reusability across its space launch and air cargo operations.</p>
<p>Aevum’s business model includes operating autonomous transportation and logistics as a service and partnering with existing logistics providers. One interesting possibility for the company is partnerships with logistics giants that so far have been effectively cut-off from space deliveries due to the vertically integrated models of companies like SpaceX, which handles logistics and launch services in-house.</p>
<p>“We aim to enable FedEx, Amazon, UPS, DHL, and others to build upon the logistics infrastructure they have already mastered,” Aevum CEO Jay Skylus said. “Any or all of these respected giants could partner with Aevum or purchase a fleet of Ravn X for their own and add space launch to their offerings. Space logistics should no longer be separated from general logistics.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082462" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082462" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2082462 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jay-Skylus-with-Ravn-X-Final-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082462" class="wp-caption-text">Aevum founder and CEO Jay Skylus with Ravn X</p></div></p>
<p>Likewise, large companies that have struggled to establish drone delivery services could use the Ravn X’s drone module to deliver and deposit drones over a central area, like a city center, for last-mile deliveries.</p>
<p>“The patent is so significant because what the patent allows you to do is say – the existing FedEx and UPS logistics architecture that&#8217;s sorting 70,000 packages an hour right now could not service the needs of defense and space because fundamentally that logistics infrastructure was designed to go from Earth to Earth and not Earth to space,” Skylus explained. “But if you really look at the problem and study it in detail, you know the missing link to allow this existing infrastructure to now be able to service the space domain – that missing link is what we just patented.”</p>
<p>Skylus imagines Ravn X fleets operating around-the-clock. “In my company, what matters is asset utilization. For any reusable flying machine, it doesn’t generate revenue on the ground. My machines will fly around the clock, every day,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company still has a ways to go before it still takes to the skies, however. Ravn X is still undergoing ground test operations and will begin flight testing this year at an FAA-licensed testing facility for unmanned aircraft systems. Aevum’s intention is to fly with the United States Air Force’s ASLON-45 mission this fall and to take its air cargo service live next year.</p>
<p>Because the Ravn X has so many different capabilities, it will need to pursue a few different FAA certifications: for space launches, a license from the FAA Commercial Space Transportation office; for cargo operations, an FAA aircraft type certification and standard airworthiness certification.</p>
<p>“What we’ve patented is the next layer and large batch of connections in the global logistics infrastructure,” Skylus said. “Space logistics shouldn&#8217;t be separated from logistics that already exist.”</p>

The company <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-18/3-updates-on-the-spotify-mobile-experience-to-help-improve-accessibility/">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s soon launching a limited beta that will introduce automatic transcripts for its own Spotify Exclusive and Original shows, with the larger goal of enabling transcripts across all podcasts published to its platform in the future. The company also introduced a handful of other accessibility improvements alongside the announcement, including readability features and options for text resizing.</p>
<p>The new transcripts feature will automatically generate transcripts for Spotify&#8217;s own shows, allowing users to read the text of the podcast on their iOS or Android device, either with or without sound.</p>
<p>This can be useful from an accessibility standpoint, as it makes the audio programs available to a wider audience that includes those who are hard of hearing or deaf. However, it also makes it easier for any listener who wants to jump to a particular part of a conversation without having to fast-forward or rewind to trying to find the right spot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2153866" style="width: 332px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153866" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2153866" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png?w=322" alt="" width="322" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png?resize=71,150 71w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png?resize=142,300 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png?resize=322,680 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Transcript-2.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Users will be able to scroll and navigate the provided transcripts, then click on any paragraph to start streaming the show from that point, the company explains.</p>
<p>If Spotify makes good on its promise to make transcripts available across its full podcast library, it could save podcasters from having to do the extra work of transcribing shows and publishing those to their website. Instead, they could simply inform listeners that those who wanted a transcript could visit Spotify. Plus, the feature could steer users away from <a href="https://podcast9.com/">third-party apps offering transcripts,</a> while competing with Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://podnews.net/update/apple-podcasts-transcription-search">podcasts transcription search</a>. (And it could potentially signal that Apple is poised to release an update in this area in the near future, too, given its recent investment in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">redesigned Apple Podcasts app</a>, which will now include subscriptions.)</p>
<p>The transcripts feature will roll out in the &#8220;coming weeks,&#8221; Spotify said.</p>
<p>Alongside the news of the beta, Spotify introduced a handful of readability improvements to aid low-vision and visually impaired users better see various buttons in the app, like those to start listening or shuffle play, by adjusting the button&#8217;s color, text formatting and size.</p>
<p>And while Spotify already supports the system-wide text size changes known as Dynamic Type, it&#8217;s now allowing users to increase text sizes even more through a new feature under Settings on iOS. (Settings &#8211;&gt; Accessibility &#8211;&gt; Display &amp; Text Size; tap &#8220;Larger Text&#8221; and drag the slider.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like “innovation,” machine learning and artificial intelligence are commonplace terms that provide very little context for what they actually signify. AI/ML spans dozens of different fields of research, covering all kinds of different problems and alternative and often incompatible ways to solve them.</p>
<p>One robust area of research here that has antecedents going back to the mid-20th century is what is known as stochastic optimization — decision-making under uncertainty where an entity wants to optimize for a particular objective. A classic problem is how to optimize an airline’s schedule to maximize profit. Airlines need to commit to schedules months in advance without knowing what the weather will be like or what the specific demand for a route will be (or, whether a pandemic will wipe out travel demand entirely). It’s a vibrant field, and these days, basically runs most of modern life.</p>
<p><a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/people/">Warren B. Powell</a> has been exploring this problem for decades as a researcher at Princeton, <a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/jungle/">where he has operated the Castle Lab</a>. He has researched how to bring disparate areas of stochastic optimization together under one framework that he has dubbed “<a href="https://castlelab.princeton.edu/sda/">sequential decision analytics</a>” to optimize problems where each decision in a series places constraints on future decisions. Such problems are common in areas like logistics, scheduling and other key areas of business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Castle Lab has long had industry partners, and it has raised tens of millions of dollars in grants from industry over its history. But after decades of research, Powell teamed up with his son, Daniel Powell, to spin out his collective body of research and productize it into a startup called <a href="https://www.optimaldynamics.com">Optimal Dynamics</a>. Father Powell has now retired full-time from Princeton to become Chief Analytics Officer, while son Powell became CEO.</p>
<p>The company raised $18.4 million in new funding last week from Bessemer led by Mike Droesch, who recently was promoted to partner earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/bessemer-venture-partners-closes-on-3-3-billion-across-two-funds/">with the firm’s newest $3.3 billion fundraise</a>. The company now has 25 employees and is centered in New York City.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bessemer Venture Partners closes on $3.3 billion across two funds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/bessemer-venture-partners-closes-on-3-3-billion-across-two-funds/embed/#?secret=imT5kWtDW6" data-secret="imT5kWtDW6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So what does Optimal Dynamics actually do? CEO Powell said that it’s been a long road since the company’s founding in mid-2017 when it first raised a $450,000 pre-seed round. We were “drunkenly walking in finding product-market fit,” Powell said. This is “not an easy technology to get right.”</p>
<p>What the company ultimately zoomed in on was the trucking industry, which has precisely the kind of sequential decision-making that father Powell had been working on his entire career. “Within truckload, you have a whole series of uncertain variables,” CEO Powell described. “We are the first company that can learn and plan for an uncertain future.”</p>
<p>There’s been a lot of investment in logistics and trucking from VCs in recent years as more and more investors see the potential to completely disrupt the massive and fragmented market. Yet, rather than building a whole new trucking marketplace or approaching it as a vertically-integrated solution, Optimal Dynamics decided to go with the much simpler enterprise SaaS route to offer better optimization to existing companies.</p>
<p>One early customer, which owned 120 power units, saved $4 million using the company’s software, according to Powell. That was a result of better utilization of equipment and more efficient operations. They “sold off about 20 vehicles that they didn’t need anymore due to the underlying efficiency,” he said. In addition, the company was able to replace a team of ten who used to manage trucking logistics down to one, and “they are just managing exceptions” to the normal course of business. As an example of an exception, Powell said that “a guy drove half way and then decided he wanted to quit,” leaving a load stranded. “Trying to train a computer on weird edge events [like that] is hard,” he said.</p>
<p>Better efficiency for equipment usage and then saving money on employee costs by automating their work are the two main ways Optimal Dynamics saves money for customers. Powell says most of the savings come in the former rather than the latter, since utilization is often where the most impact can be felt.</p>
<p>On the technical front, the key improvement the company has devised is how to rapidly solve the ultra-complex optimization problems that logistics companies face. The company does that through value function approximation, which is a field of study where instead of actually computing the full range of stochastic optimization solutions, the program approximates the outcomes of decisions to reduce compute time. We “take in this extraordinary amount of detail while handling it in a computationally efficient way,” Powell said. That’s where we have really “wedged ourselves as a company.”</p>
<p>Early signs of success with customers led to a $4 million seed round led by Homan Yuen of Fusion Fund, which invests in technically-sophisticated startups (i.e. the kind of startups that take decades of optimization research at Princeton to get going). Powell said that raising the round was tough, transpiring during the first weeks of the pandemic last year. One corporate fund pulled out at the last minute, and it was “chaos ensuing with everyone,” he said. This Series A process meanwhile was the opposite. “This round was totally different — closed it in 17 days from round kickoff to closure,” he said.</p>
<p>With new capital in the bank, the company is looking to expand from 25 employees to 75 this year, who will be trickling back to the company’s office in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in the coming months. Optimal Dynamics targets customers with 75 trucks or more, either fleets for rent or private fleets owned by companies like Walmart who handle their own logistics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Marqeta has long been a fintech darling, but it's less well-known than other companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The IPO market is gearing up for a hot close to the second quarter and a hotter Q3.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s The Exchange&#8217;s takeaway from recent IPO filings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/">from Monday.com (enterprise planning and communications)</a> and a number of SPAC-led combinations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">from Bird (scooter sharing)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/industrial-automation-startup-bright-machines-hauls-in-435m-by-going-public-via-spac/">Bright Machines (AI-powered microfactories)</a> and others. Looking ahead, Squarespace (site design and hosting) will direct list this week, while Oatly (pressed grain juice) and Procore (construction tech) will price and complete traditional IPOs in the next few days.</p>
<p>Late last week, Marqeta (card issuing and payments tech) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001522540/000119312521162113/d64065ds1.htm">filed</a> as well, and just this morning, Flywire (global payments) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521164506/d469729ds1a.htm">set a price</a> range for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/will-fintech-unicorn-flywires-proposed-ipo-reach-escape-velocity/">its own debut</a>. The two fintechs are our targets today, though we&#8217;ll take them in sequential posts.</p>

<hr />
<p>Public equities have seen some price declines in recent sessions, and there&#8217;s been observable multiples-compression afoot among both tech stocks and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-up-multiples-down-morning-brief-100154568.html">shares more generally</a>. But many companies are betting that it remains a fertile moment to list. A slow drift downward in the value of technology revenue, in other words, is not stopping what could be an enthusiastic exit market from here to the end of the year.</p>

Let&#8217;s narrow our focus to Marqeta, long a darling of the fintech market though less well known than some companies in its sector due to its infrastructure nature.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Marqeta, it powers the payment card tech behind products that you use, like Square, a key customer and driver of the unicorn&#8217;s growth. Marqeta exhibits a number of fascinating fintech characteristics (majority revenue from interchange, a rabidly competitive market) that make it very interesting to unspool.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alek Koenig spent four years at Affirm, where he was head of Credit.</p>
<p>There he saw firsthand just how powerful the alternative lending model could be. Koenig realized that it wasn’t just consumers who could benefit from the model, but businesses too.</p>
<p>So in November 2019, he founded <a href="https://www.settle.com/">Settle </a>as a way to give e-commerce and consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies access to non-dilutive capital. (Not every company wants to raise venture money). By June 2020, the startup had launched its platform, which is designed to help these businesses manage their cash flow. Over time, he recruited a previous co-worker, Shane Moriah, to serve as Settle’s CTO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And today, the company is announcing that it has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by Kleiner Perkins. This follows a previously unannounced $6 million seed raise led by Founders Fund in November 2020. Other investors in the company include SciFi (Affirm founder Max Levchin’s VC firm), Caffeinated Capital, WorkLife Ventures, Background Capital and AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli.</p>
<p>With the pandemic leading to a massive shift toward digital and online shopping, e-commerce and CPG businesses found themselves with the challenge of keeping up with demand while trying to manage their cash flow. The main problem was the lag between accounts receivables and accounts payables.</p>
<p>“These companies suffer from the problem where there are these huge cash flow gaps from buying inventory, waiting to receive it and then turning it into revenue,” Koenig explains. “It takes quite a bit of time for these customers to actually get revenue from all those inventory purchases they need to make. What we do is make it really easy for companies to pay their vendors with extended payment terms.”</p>
<p>Settle does this by automatically syncing to a business’ accounting software and combining that with working capital products it’s developed.</p>
<p>Put simply, Settle will pay a vendor, and then brands can pay Settle back when they turn that COGS (cost of goods sold) into revenue. The startup says it also saves brands money on expensive wire fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2153819" style="width: 354px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2153819" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2153819" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="344" height="258" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg 1768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Settle-screen-shot.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2153819" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Settle</p></div></p>
<p>“Businesses really value getting cash sooner, so they can use it in their operations,” Koenig said. “We’ve worked to reimagine the CFO suite for brands, starting with integrated financing and bill pay solutions.”</p>
<p>The concept of non-dilutive capital is not a new one with other startups tackling the space in different ways. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/pipe-which-aims-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue-raises-more-money-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe</a> aims to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts.</p>
<p>Settle is focused on the e-commerce vertical, and building a unique product for that category, Koenig says, rather than trying to build a product targeting several different industries.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be a mediocre product for everybody,” he told TechCrunch. “But rather a phenomenal product for this vertical.”</p>
<p>Since its launch last June, Settle has seen its business jump by 1,000%, although it’s important to note that’s from a small base. Settle is currently working with more than 300 brands, including baby stroller retailer Lalo, Spiceology and men’s skincare brand Disco. So far, all of its growth has been organic.</p>

<p>“Last year when the pandemic hit, offline retail shut down and e-commerce got a big boost. But that meant that a lot of these companies were running out of orders and were out of stock on many items, so they were just kind of leaving money on the table,” Koenig said. “Once they started using us, they were able to buy more inventory, so we actually help them make more profit, and not just create more sales.”</p>
<p>His reasoning for that last statement is that by giving these businesses the ability to purchase items in bulk, they could get cheaper price per unit costs as well as cheaper shipping costs.</p>
<p>The company is planning to use its new capital in part to grow its team of 20, as well as raise more debt so that it can continue lending money to businesses.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins&#8217; <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/monica-desai/">Monica Desai Weiss </a>said her firm believes that Koenig and CTO Moriah’s expertise in underwriting, capital markets and e-commerce give the pair “a rare skill set that’s unique to their market.”</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also drawn to the company&#8217;s embedded approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas most lending businesses are fairly transactional and opportunistic, Settle becomes deeply embedded in the way their merchants forecast and grow,” she told TechCrunch. “That approach has demonstrated inherent virality and their timing is perfect &#8212; the past year has changed consumer behaviors permanently and also produced massive opportunities for global entrepreneurship via ecommerce. In that way, we see the umbrella of e-commerce expanding massively in the coming years, and we believe Settle will be key to enabling that shift.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The influence of a founder on their company&#8217;s culture cannot be overstated. Everything from their views on the product and business to how they think about people affects how their company&#8217;s employees will behave, and since behavior in turn informs culture, the consequences of a founder&#8217;s early decisions can be far-reaching.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not very surprising that Expensify has its own take on almost everything it does when you consider what its founder and CEO David Barrett learned early in his life: &#8220;Basically everyone is wrong about basically everything.&#8221; As we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">part 1 of this EC-1</a>, this led him to the revelation that it&#8217;s easier to figure things out for yourself than finding advice that applies to you. Eventually, these insights — and the adventurous P2P hacker attitude he nurtured alongside his colleagues and Travis Kalanick at Red Swoosh — would inform how he would go about shaping Expensify.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Expensify&#8217;s culture can&#8217;t be separated from its hiring and growth processes — by joining the company, employees self-select into a group that isn&#8217;t likely to get hung up about trade-offs.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It&#8217;s striking how Expensify has managed to maintain this character 13 years later, even <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">on the threshold of an IPO</a>. How did this happen? During a series of interviews in February and early March, we found the answer is tied to the level of thought and effort this expense management business puts into its culture.</p>
<p>You see, the people at Expensify are prepared to invent their own playbook, develop it and, if needed, rewrite it completely. Its HR policies and strategy are tailored to find people who would have fun building an expense management product. It has a unique growth and recognition scheme to offset the drawbacks of a flat organizational structure. It&#8217;s even got a &#8220;Senate&#8221; that vets all major decisions. No kidding.</p>
<p>All this, and more, has ultimately helped Expensify reach more than 10 million users and achieve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/">$100 million in annual revenue</a> with just 130 employees. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at how Expensify makes it happen.</p>
<h2>&#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done&#8221;</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear Expensify&#8217;s unusually high employee-to-revenue ratio is intentional: &#8220;We want the fewest people necessary to get the job done,&#8221; Barrett says. But how do you actually achieve it? How do you hire and keep people who can deliver such results? Barrett had to learn how the hard way.</p>
<p>Expensify&#8217;s first team was based in San Francisco and comprised Barrett&#8217;s old Red Swoosh and Akamai colleagues, who joined a few months after Akamai fired him. A small team was enough to get started, but it was much more difficult to hire additional people. Barrett is eager to clarify the Valley is not really the best place to recruit talent: &#8220;Sure, Silicon Valley has a ton of really awesome people, but all of them have jobs!,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discovery has ordered a new reality show, to air in 2022, which will be an eight-episode competition series where competitors will vie for a chance to take a trip to the International Space Station on a commercial Axiom Space mission. The winner will be a crew member for AX-2, the second mission from Axiom to transport a fully private group of space travelers to the ISS following AX-1, which is set to take place as early as next January.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">Axiom and NASA went into detail about AX-1</a> earlier this month in a press briefing, explaining that the mission will span eight days and take four paying customers to the orbital science station for a brief stay, with an overall price tag of $1.69 million being paid to NASA for the privilege (which excludes the value of some in-kind supply transport services that Axiom is providing).</p>

<p>Axiom will be using a SpaceX Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport its private astronaut customers to the ISS for AX-1. The initial press materials for the &#8220;Who Wants to Be an Astronaut?&#8221; series doesn&#8217;t specify which vehicle will be used for the AX-2 mission that will play host to the winner, but it&#8217;s reasonable to expect it&#8217;ll be SpaceX for that one as well, given that it&#8217;s the only fully private trip provider active so far.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Discovery describes the actual selection process that will take place during the reality series:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hat does it take to win a coveted seat to space? The process will be grueling and only a select few will make it through the rigorous selection process. The series will follow each of the contestants competing for the opportunity in a variety of extreme challenges designed to test them on the attributes real astronauts need most, and as they undergo the training necessary to qualify for space flight and life on board the space station.</p>
<p>In the end, one lucky candidate, deemed to have the right stuff by a panel of expert judges, will punch their ticket for an adventure few have ever taken. The series will chronicle each pivotal moment along the way &#8211; from lift off to re-entry and the return home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The competition is open to &#8220;everyday people,&#8221; and there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.discovery.com/shows/who-wants-to-be-an-astronaut?fbclid=IwAR1CBy18VL_jeMnjMYxv-EjPzDTWDRDskIQM3P6IfMko687rHyKDVDhCb78">application form with the requirement of a short, 30 to 60-second accompanying video</a> if you want to throw your hat in the ring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidewalk Labs, Alphabet’s urban innovation organization, has announced the launch of Pebble, a vehicle sensor that’s designed to help manage parking in cities by providing real-time parking and curb availability data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it works: Small spherical sensors are stuck to the ground on parking spaces to note the absence or presence of a vehicle. Then solar-powered gateway hardware, which can be strapped easily to street poles, uses IoT to connect the sensor to the cloud through the cellular network. The data is then viewed and analyzed by real estate developers, parking operators or municipal agencies via a dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pebble doesn’t use cameras or collect identifying information about a person or vehicle, and is touting a “privacy preserving” approach. Sidewalk Labs has been relatively quiet since it </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/sidewalk-labs-shuts-down-toronto-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down its $1.3 billion tech-enabled real estate project in Toronto amid privacy concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year ago. Rather than try to tackle large urban infrastructure projects, the company appears to be focusing its efforts on smaller-scale solutions that can be used by private and public entities to improve cities. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, Sidewalk Labs unveiled </span><a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/sidewalk-labs-unveils-delve-tool-to-enhance-urban-development/587065/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delve</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a design tool that uses machine learning to help developers, architects and planners create optimal design plans for urban projects. Just a few weeks ago, Sidewalk Labs spinout Replica &#8212; an AI-powered data platform that uses machine learning to generate “synthetic” populations whose behaviors can be tracked in order to simulate plausible scenarios in the real world &#8212; </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/replica-secures-41-million-in-series-b-funding-to-change-how-cities-plan-and-operate-301273415.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secured $41 million in Series B funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninawolpow/2021/04/21/sidewalk-labs-spinout-replica-raises-41-million-series-b/?sh=5f7dff8828b0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority relied on Replica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic to adapt its public transit schedule. Now, as the country begins to open up in earnest, those with a stake in parking and mobility, especially cities looking to unroll sustainable transport recovery plans, might consider using tools like Pebble to manage parking supplies effectively. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/8/3079/pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9% and 56% of traffic, and all the pollution that comes with it, is caused by people who are cruising for parking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pebble says its real-time parking availability can be integrated into navigation apps, like Google Maps, through an API to help users spend less time circling the block.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real-time parking information can also alert would-be drivers when spaces are limited before they even leave home, leading them to use alternative travel modes, such as park-and-ride transit or ferries,” wrote Sidewalk Labs’ senior creative technologist, Nick Jonas, in a </span><a href="https://medium.com/sidewalk-talk/dbb79b570fda"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing the launch. “For example, a </span><a href="http://www.accessmagazine.org/fall-2007/smarter-parking-transit-stations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart parking program at a BART park-and-ride station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reduced driving by a monthly average of nearly 10 miles per person — and even shortened commutes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cities could certainly benefit from a tool that could monitor curb and municipal parking, the effort involved could be enormous. Imagine a city like New York widely placing individual sensors to mark street parking spaces! It would be quite the job, not to mention difficult to define static parking spaces. Sidewalk Labs says it is already working with pilot customers to manage tens of thousands of parking spaces, but it did not reply to a request for more information about whether or not any of those pilot customers are cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blog post announcing the Pebble launch, Sidewalk Labs covers a range of potential use cases. City agencies that apply Pebble hardware to curbs can also gain insights on how to help businesses </span><a href="https://www.planning.org/planning/2021/spring/poor-curb-management-is-costing-cities-billions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generate revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by assigning relevant curb space for things like outdoor dining and applying flexible programs like dynamic pricing, which adjusts on-street parking rates based on supply and demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sidewalk Labs also says real estate developers can use its insights to create shared parking zones or build less parking if they can prove to cities that sufficient parking already exists to meet demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it seems more efficient parking would make for people relying further on cars, Sidewalk Labs says the opposite is true. Jonas says that Pebble can help &#8220;reduce driving and new parking in several ways,&#8221; including by helping real estate developers collect the data needed to provide compelling counterarguments for city ordinances requiring certain amounts of parking spots be built for new residential and office spaces.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pebble can help [&#8230;] prove that parking demand can be met through existing spaces or shared parking zones, reducing the need to build new spaces,&#8221; Jonas said. And in terms of traffic generated by drivers searching for spots, Pebble can help by &#8220;facilitating direct navigation to a parking space,&#8221; which can make a dent in the &#8220;30 percent of traffic congestion that occurs from drivers circling for a parking space.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of those infrastructure benefits, Jonas notes that Pebble can help with economic and convenience incentives that encourage commuters to opt for other methods of transit instead of driving.</p>
<p>&#8220;By facilitating dynamic pricing programs, Pebble can help cities &#8216;right-price&#8217; parking and encourage alternative travel modes,&#8221; he noted, adding that based on early data from <a href="http://www.accessmagazine.org/fall-2007/smarter-parking-transit-stations/">BART pilots</a> in the Bay Area, Pebble data including &#8220;direct navigation and real-time space availability data can also encourage people to use park-and-ride transit rather than driving all the way into an office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the operating thesis upon which Sidewalks Labs is based is that cities would be able to run much more efficiently, effectively and safely if they can just address the existing data gaps and blind spots about how people actually live in, and navigate them. Pebble looks like it could be a key ingredient in help fill in the blanks for parking and garage usage.</p>
