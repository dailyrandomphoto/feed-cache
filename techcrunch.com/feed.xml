										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fount.co/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a robo-advisor startup in South Korea, has raised a $33.4 million Series C round to beef up its machine learning-based platform development and hire staff. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></p>
<p>The latest round was led by Hana Financial Investment, along with Nice Investment. Returning backers Smilegate Investment, KT Investment, Shinhan Capital and Korea Development Bank also participated.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series C brings its total funding to about $58.5 million, and the company’s valuation is now estimated at $209 billion, CEO Youngbeen Kim told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company will continue to invest in its technology development for the next three years, about an additional $85 million (100 billion won), Kim added.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Founded in November 2015 by Kim, Fount launched its first beta robo-advisor service in February 2016. The following month, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-rogers-6">Jim Rogers</a>, an advisor of Fount, invested in the company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After gaining regulatory approvals for advising investment in November 2017, Fount launched its mobile app in June 2018. </span></p>
<p>The pandemic spurred the trend that people set up an emergency fund or create an investment portfolio to grow their wealth and save for retirement through contactless investment services such as robo-advisers. South Korea&#8217;s three robo-adviser startups, including Fount, exceeded a total of $1 billion in assets under management in January 2021, up 402.9% year on year, based on a local media <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210117000248">report</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount surpassed $730 million assets under management as of March 2021. As per its press release, its core market is people aged 20-49, including about 66.8% of millennials. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its AI-powered platform invests on users’ behalf by using algorithms and data for people who know they need to invest money to grow their wealth but don’t know much about investing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount’s AI-based BlueWhale product analyzes more than 52,000 cases of global economic data and market indices and automatically proposes a customized and diversified portfolio that it can later rebalance as necessary. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers its robo-advisor service to approximately 20 South Korea-based B2B clients, including the lead investor Hana Financial investment, Samsung Life Insurance, MetLife and Hyundai Motor Securities. The company is in talks with additional financial companies for having partnerships. It also claims that it has 260,000 registered users as of June 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Global robo-advisors assets under management are projected to increase to $2.8 trillion in 2025 from $1.37 trillion in 2021, based on its statement citing <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-investment/robo-advisors/worldwide?currency=usd">Statista report</a>. South Korean robo-advisors’ assets under management are expected to grow up to $25 billion in 2025 from $8.36 billion in 2021. </span></p>
<p>When asked about overseas expansions, Kim said it focuses on the home market now and does not have a concrete plan for global penetration.</p>

<h2>Relativity Space completes Stage 1 testing of Terran 1 rocket</h2>
<p>Relativity Space said Friday it had completed Stage 1 testing of the Terran 1 rocket, including hydro proof testing, cryogenic proof testing and flight pressure testing. From here, the company needs to complete post-integration testing, which will take place at Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p>
<p>Relativity is aiming to launch the world&#8217;s first entirely 3D-printed rocket to orbit in early 2022. Watch Relativity engineers lift Stage 1 onto the test stand here:</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/william-shatner-to-fly-on-blue-origins-next-human-spaceflight-on-october-12/">Yes, you read that right.</a> The 90-year-old actor, known for having played Captain James T. Kirk on “Star Trek,” will be joining Chris Boshuizen and Glen de Vries on a launch that is scheduled to fly on October 12. If all goes to plan, he will best Wally Funk as the oldest person to go to space. (Funk, of course, hitched a ride to orbit also with Blue Origin.)</p>
<p>Blue Origin’s own Audrey Powers, who serves as the company’s vice president of New Shepard Mission &amp; Flight Operations, will round out the four-person crew.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<p>The next launch of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard rocket comes as the company faces a torrent of scrutiny after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/chief-blue-origin-complaint-author-disputes-cause-of-termination-while-the-space-companys-ceo-does-damage-control/">21 current and former employees went public</a> with accusations of safety concerns and sexual harassment at the company. The FAA said it was “reviewing the information” detailed in the essay, but so far there&#8217;s no signs of anything interrupting the launch schedule.</p>
<h2>NASA will be smashing a spacecraft into a satellite</h2>

<p>File this one under, <em>God, I love science</em>. NASA has now set a date for what it&#8217;s calling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/nasas-armageddon-style-asteroid-deflection-mission-takes-off-in-november/">DART, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, a mission that feels like it&#8217;s ripped straight from a Hollywood script. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to go down: NASA will launch two satellites to a relatively nearby pair of planetoids &#8212; a large asteroid and a &#8220;moonlet&#8221; in its orbit. The moonlet is small, exactly the kind of space body that poses a threat to Earth, so NASA will be testing the possibility of intercepting one by smashing into it at nearly 15,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p>DART is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg in Southern California at 10:20 PM on November 23, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, after being delayed this summer.</p>
<h2>The UAE wants to send a probe to the asteroid belt in 2028</h2>
<p>Speaking of asteroids, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/the-uae-aims-to-launch-a-probe-to-the-asteroid-belt-between-mars-and-jupiter-in-2028/">United Arab Emirates Space Agency is planning its most ambitious mission yet</a>. The agency, which was only formed in 2014, wants to send a spacecraft to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter in 2028. While the exact scientific goals of the mission have not yet been announced, any data the spacecraft collects could help deepen our understanding of the origins of the universe. That’s because asteroids are thought by some scientists to be celestial leftovers from when the solar system was formed.</p>
<p>After launching, the spacecraft will have a long and winding journey: It will travel 3.6 billion kilometers over five years, boomeranging around both Venus and Earth to build enough velocity to eventually arrive at the asteroid belt beyond Mars in 2030. The UAE aims to land the spacecraft on an asteroid in 2033.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 11, 2021! It’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/equity-monday-i-hear-this-fintech-thing-is-going-to-be-big/">Monday, y’all</a>, and that means we’re all strapping back into work mode. Looking ahead, we’re expecting two public debuts this week (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">GitLab and AvidXchange</a>), and we’re just heading into earnings season. Get hype! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"><strong>Apple appeals Epic decision:</strong></a> Remember when Apple managed to avoid a monopoly ruling and wound up being told by a judge to let third-party developers tell users that there were other ways to buy their iOS software? Well, Apple isn’t really big about the idea. So it’s appealing the ruling and asking for a stay. In an era when Microsoft is building inroads with developers, Apple appears confident in its market position to the extent that it’s comfortable moving in the opposite direction. (I’m reminded of the old-timey phrase my dad learned from a farmer: “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.”)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/reddit-hires-former-google-cloud-exec-as-its-first-chief-product-officer/"><strong>Reddit hires former Google Cloud exec:</strong></a> Reddit, a place where communities can run forums for anything under the sun (from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/">the niche</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/">the mainstream</a>), is building out its executive team. Normally, we’d add “in anticipation of an IPO” to that comment, but given that Reddit is having a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">smashing time raising private capital</a>, we doubt that any sort of liquidity event is in the near-term offing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">Inside NerdWallet’s IPO filing:</a> </strong>Not every venture-backed company is building enterprise software. NerdWallet is one such company. It’s essentially a content play that writes stuff for consumers and SMBs in search of financial products and advice. The goal is to provide unbiased commentary &#8212; and make fat commissions. It’s a pretty good business overall, though its IPO filing details the impacts of both COVID (on growth) and a recent push on the advertising front (harming profits).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/how-los-angeles-is-preparing-for-the-air-taxi-takeoff/"><strong>LA works to figure out air taxis:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Once, when visiting Brazil, I was told that the São Paulo elite get around by helicopter. That made sense given that the traffic I experienced in that lovely city was fang-meltingly miserable. LA is something akin to the American São Paulo from a traffic perspective. So it’s not a huge shock that LA is ahead of the market on figuring out how air taxis are going to work. If they are going to work at all.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/varda-space-industries-will-send-its-first-space-factory-to-orbit-on-a-spacex-falcon-9-rocket/"><strong>Space factories?</strong></a> Varda Space is going to get its first space factories into orbit in 2023 thanks to SpaceX launch systems and hardware help from Rocket Lab. It’s going to send up three vesicles, which will include a factory (manufacturing?) module and a way of coming back to Earth.

<h2>BaaS served three ways: A closer look at a rapidly evolving market</h2>
<p>Ryan Lawler continues his exploration of the emerging banking-as-a-service sector by examining three different BaaS strategies:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey banking as a service.</li>
<li>Playing matchmaker between banks and fintechs.</li>
<li>Buying a bank to get into BaaS.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;If you’re looking to spin up a new fintech app or want to add banking, debit cards or other financial services to your existing business, knowing how each of these competitors is positioned to work with customers and bank partners is key,&#8221; he writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HR technology has been thrown into the spotlight in the last 20 months: COVID-19 has changed the way we work, and so how we manage people in the world of work has had to change, too. Today, a Munich-based startup called <a href="https://www.personio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personio</a>, which has built a big business out of how to address that issue specifically for small and medium enterprises, is announcing $270 million in funding on the heels of strong demand for its services, and to help it fuel its next steps. With this Series E, Personio&#8217;s valuation is jumping up to $6.3 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups &#8212; HR or otherwise &#8212; in Europe at the moment.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Greenoaks Capital Partners, with new investors Altimeter Capital and Alkeon also participating. Index Ventures, Accel, Meritech, Lightspeed, Northzone and Global Founders Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; were also in the round. Index and Meritech led the company&#8217;s previous round, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> only in January of this year</a>. That Series D round was at a $1.7 billion valuation &#8212; meaning the figure has grown by 3.7x in 10 months, a mark of how fast Personio itself has been growing.</p>
<p>Personio today provides recruiting and onboarding, payroll, absence tracking and other major HR functions in an all-in-one platform aimed at European SMEs (typically 10-2,000 employees). It now has 5,000 customers &#8212; compared to 3,000 in January. While Personio will continue to grow that range of tools, it will also expand into what CEO Hanno Renner describes as &#8220;people workflow automation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216060" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially, this is about speeding up the process of doing HR-dependent work in other applications that may exist outside of Personio by automatically populating HR information and triggering actions within those apps, which might have otherwise taken much longer to complete manually. This could, for example, involve creating and issuing an employment contract, or turning access to certain apps on or off when a person joins or leaves an organization.</p>
<p>If Personio&#8217;s existing platform could be thought of as &#8220;the Workday for SMEs&#8221; &#8212; a suite of HR tools that work together for the needs of SMEs in the same way that enterprises have with their own large, multi-faceted platforms aimed at them &#8212; then the automation tools that Personio is now adding might be thought of as the company&#8217;s answer to UiPath or ServiceNow for SMEs, using machine learning, robotic process automation and other techniques to take away some of the more repetitive busy work involved in tasks related to HR.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on it for 12 months, and we now have 5,000 customers that we learn from using our product as it is,&#8221; Renner said in an interview. The crux of the issue is about getting software in different silos to work together more quickly, so that when, for example, a contract needs to go out to a prospective hire, foot dragging doesn&#8217;t mean the hire might sign elsewhere, or a fired employee can&#8217;t still get into a company&#8217;s IT system. &#8220;HR processes go beyond HR. They involve other functions and departments. Delays not only waste time, they could have detrimental outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pitch for Personio up to now has been that it&#8217;s part of the group of enterprise startups that have tapped a lucrative seam of customers, SMEs, by simply building products for them. SMEs as a sector is huge &#8212; there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38365/attachments/2/translations/en/renditions/native" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25 million SMEs in Europe alone</a>, accounting for more than 99% of all enterprises &#8212; but it is often overlooked, because it is fragmented around a wide range of verticals and interests, with varying IT budgets that are sometimes very small or not there at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the world of HR, Renner says that was an even more acute state of affairs. Most SMEs track HR-related data on Excel spreadsheets, or just plain paper. &#8220;What we see is that day-to-day, 70% of SMEs don&#8217;t have any kind of HR solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But digital transformation hasn&#8217;t completely overlooked the sector, and so more forward-thinking SMEs have gradually adopted sales, finance and CRM software, and that has &#8220;trickled down&#8221; to thinking about HR, he said.</p>
<p>Personio now believes that this will also help with its pitch to sell its customers automation. A typical SME, the company estimates, now uses on average some 40 different apps, with many of these needing data from HR systems to work. The idea is that Personio will now be able to provide those connectors to speed up how all of it works.</p>
<p>The company has a lot of growing left to do: When you consider that there are 1.7 million businesses in the subset of SMEs that Personio targets (10-2,000 employees), that is just a tiny percentage of the market.</p>
<p>It means that growth is likely to come to Personio, with or without the newer automation piece taking off, so the funding &#8212; raised opportunistically, before Personio needed it &#8212; will be handy. What the new technology does give it, regardless, is a window into potentially also providing automation services to SMEs beyond those of HR over time, and so this significant hike in valuation is likely related to that diversification as much as for the bigger opportunity to build more HR inroads into the SME space.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“While small businesses are the backbone of the European economy, they have been underserved and overlooked by legacy players for too long. Personio democratizes enterprise capabilities and delivers a step change in productivity, simplifying HR workflows across the full employee lifecycle,&#8221; said Neil Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, in a statement. &#8220;</span>We are lucky to be partners with many of the leading private technology companies in the world, and I am confident that the Personio team is just getting started on their mission. Launching the People Workflow Automation category will deliver even more value to businesses across Europe. We are proud to join Personio at this thrilling stage of their journey and look forward to being partners for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Longer term, that could involve going public &#8212; but the emphasis there is on <em>longer</em>. Personio has now raised $500 million and Renner said that it is at least 18-24 months away from thinking about that next step. &#8220;We are not in a hurry to go public,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google TV is adding <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/more-you-personalized-profiles/">multiple user profiles</a> to allow everyone in a household to access their own personalized space with their Google account. Google says with personalized profiles, users will get TV show and movie recommendations tailored just for them, easy access to their personal watchlist and help from their Google Assistant.</p>
<p>The search giant outlined in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/more-you-personalized-profiles/">blog post</a> that as users watch TV, their profile takes their interests and preferences into account to help them discover more content that they’re likely to enjoy. Parents can also set up a kids profile to give their children access to movies and shows under their supervision. Each Google account has its own watchlist so that content you want to watch later will show up in your own profile and stay separate from other users’ lists.</p>
<p>Google also notes that you can “ask for recommendations by saying, ‘what should I watch?’ or get help streamlining your day by saying “show me my day.” Your profile is linked to your account’s Google Assistant, so you’ll get the personalized answers you are looking for.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216370" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company says it’s easy to set up a new profile as your downloaded apps and app login details will be used across profiles so you won’t have to start from scratch each time you set up a new profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216394" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216394" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216394 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png" alt="" width="1000" height="590" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216394" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google also stated that it’s making its screensaver-like feature &#8220;Ambient Mode&#8221; more useful by adding more personalized information and recommendations cards. For instance, your TV will now keep you up to date with info based on your profile on things like the weather, news, sports and more. Users will be able to scroll through on-screen shortcuts to do things like quickly view photos or start playing music. If users are gone for a longer period of time, their TV will fully shift to Ambient Mode’s photos or curated artwork.</p>
<p>Google TV also expanded its live TV options with the integration of streaming service Philo into its live TV features, in addition to YouTube TV and SLING TV. Users who add Philo as their live TV provider will see their shows on the Live TV tab and their recommendations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Support for profiles and the new ambient mode features will begin rolling out on Chromecast with Google TV and Google TVs from Sony and TCL soon. Profiles will be available globally, while Ambient Mode cards will be first available in the U.S. only.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Have you ever sat in a shared college dorm kitchen space with your roommate and decided to start a business?</p>
<p>I should be clear here: We didn’t really decide to start a business; it was more of a project to create a tool that we could use while studying in school.</p>
<p>Born out of our own frustrations with gathering the right study materials to prepare for exams, Jacques Huppes and I started jotting down what the ideal platform for easily sharing resources like study guides and class notes with other students would look like. We knew we needed to create a simple interface to get started, which was shortly followed by the tedious process of manually uploading hundreds of documents we had gathered from our own previous exam prep and from other friends at the university.</p>
<p>After just three weeks, our idea began to blossom, with friends from other universities asking if we could build the platform to share their school’s study resources as well. We simply asked for their documents and started to subdivide the content based on university. Our company, StuDocu, was officially born and expanding faster than we ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>Our first investment was a USB hard drive, which traveled with us from dorm to dorm — we’d knock on doors to share our story with as many students as possible. We’d use the hard drive to plug into their laptops, copy their files and upload them to the StuDocu website that evening.</p>
<p>While more and more students are now going digital, in 2010 we’d often encounter students with handwritten or printed notes, which we’d collect and carry back on the train ride to Delft to scan and upload in the library. For the first three years, we worked from our dorm rooms in Delft before moving to Amsterdam to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">grow our business</a>.</p>
<p>We have introduced many iterations of the platform based on feedback and data. In the beginning, we worked based on what we thought was needed, using our own frustration with studying as the guide for how the platform should evolve. One of our other co-founders, Lucas van den Houten, introduced the idea of measuring data we gathered from users via Mixpanel, and from there we were able to give the platform new life. Suddenly, data was telling us where to grow and where to improve. Over the years, we have developed many features and continue to run A/B tests based on the hard data now available to us.</p>
<p>Building a website is a lot of work, but for us, each update had a direct correlation to the increasing uploads and student engagement we set out to achieve. To see those small successes day after day was reassuring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic Leap has had one hell of a journey, and to their credit, it seems investors are still addicted to giving them money.</p>
<p>The augmented reality startup announced today that they have raised $500 million at a $2 billion valuation from existing investors. The round echoes the terms of an October 2014 raise where Magic Leap raised $542 million at a reported $2 billion valuation. Quite a bit has happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>Curiously, Magic Leap decided not to actually disclose any of the specific investors participating in this latest fundraise. At this point, the company has raised $3.5 billion in total funding according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, meaning that most of the investors they&#8217;ve brought in haven&#8217;t fared too well thus far.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest valuation is a far cry from the company&#8217;s $6.7 billion valuation they reached in 2019, but for a startup that nearly shut down last year, it could be a lot worse. Magic Leap fired a healthy chunk of its staff and was forced to raise hundreds of millions at slashed valuation terms last year. The startup also replaced its founder Rony Abovitz with former Microsoft VP Peggy Johnson as CEO.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to turn things around by revamping its messaging with a focus wholly on enterprise audiences after years of trying to compete with Microsoft for military contracts (and failing) and trying to compete with Microsoft for enterprise clients (with some success), all while attempting to also stay on consumer radars by bankrolling expensive games for their very expensive headset.</p>
<p>Alongside news of this new round, we also got a new rendering, via CNBC, of the startup&#8217;s next AR glasses product. The device seems to have gotten a much smaller device footprint, but Magic Leap didn&#8217;t have too much to say on the device&#8217;s new capabilities. In a press release, Magic Leap says that it will roll out the new hardware, called the Magic Leap 2, sometime next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has started shipping to dealers replacement battery modules for recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles after delays caused by shutdowns at multiple manufacturing plants as a result of the widespread shortage of semiconductors.</p>
<p>The two battery assembly facilities, in Holland and Hazel Park, Michigan, resumed production at the end of September. At that time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">GM said</a> that replacement battery modules would be shipped to dealers as soon as mid-October.</p>
<p>Vehicles will be prioritized according to “specific build timeframes,” or the batches of vehicles in which it believes defects appear to be clustered, GM said. The replacement process should take around two days at a dealership, and the new batteries will come with an eight-year or 100,000-mile limited warranty. GM is also launching new diagnostic software by mid-November to monitor EV batteries, which will also be installed at a dealership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The recall was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects, a torn anode tab and folded separator, that together can increase the risk of fire. It’s the third time GM has issued a recall for the vehicle, and the most comprehensive, spanning all Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017.</p>
<p>The news will surely be welcome to Bolt drivers, who were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</a> to park their vehicles away from their homes in case of fire risk. GM also advised Bolt owners to not park within 50 feet of other vehicles, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/gm-tells-some-bolt-owners-to-park-50-feet-away-from-other-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>In all, GM is anticipated to spend around $1.8 billion on costs associated with fixing defective Bolt batteries. The automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/gm-says-it-will-seek-reimbursement-from-lg-chem-for-1b-chevy-bolt-recall-losses/">seek reimbursement</a> from its battery partner, LG Chem, to the tune of around $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Africa’s telecommunication provider Telkom SA SOC Ltd has since October discontinued Netflix Inc. from its phone and internet set-top box, said a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/telkom-says-netflix-no-longer-available-on-south-africa-provider?sref=gni836kR">report</a>.</p>
<p>Telkom&#8217;s Content Executive Wanda Mkhize said in a statement that the partnership between the two firms would not be renewed and declined to provide further details, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>We have reached out to both companies and will update this post as we learn more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix has been exploring growth opportunities across Africa over the last few years in the hope of growing its subscriber base and revenues. It’s not clear whether it has plans to build a different route to consumers and existing subscribers in South Africa now that its relationship with Telkom has ended.</p>
<p>Last month, the company announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/netflix-free-plan-kenya/">free plan</a>, available on Android mobile phones, in Kenya to attract new subscribers &#8212; who have access to “about one-quarter of its TV shows and movies”.</p>
<p>Netflix, in a bid to win and retain subscribers across Africa, now features content produced in various markets across the continent, including South Africa’s &#8220;Queen Sono&#8221;, Kenya’s &#8220;Sincerely Daisy&#8221; and Nigeria’s &#8220;Two weeks in Lagos&#8221;.</p>
<p>The video streaming service is looking to tap 303 million people, about 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. The number of people connected to mobile internet is expected to grow to about 40% of this population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Netflix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cheaper and faster internet across the continent has provided a space for video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon.inc to gain a foothold across the continent.</p>
<p>Netflix still has another partner in the country. MultiChoice Group Limited, the continent’s largest pay-TV provider, now offers Netflix and Amazon.Inc as part of its paid video services in South Africa after signing deals with the two firms mid last year. The move aims to retain MultiChoice’s subscriber numbers, creating more of a moat around its own budget streaming service, Showmax, introduced in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has pulled several &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; ads that violated its policies by promoting apps that encouraged prospective users to spy on their spouses&#8217; phone.</p>
<p>These consumer-grade spyware apps are often marketed to parents wishing to monitor their child&#8217;s calls, messages, apps, photos and location, often under the guise of protecting against predators. But these apps, which are often designed to be installed surreptitiously and without the device owner&#8217;s consent, have been repurposed by abusers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spy on the phones of their spouses</a>.</p>
<p>The rise in the use of so-called &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; (or spouseware) prompted an industrywide response in recent years to combat the spread of phone monitoring apps. Antivirus makers have worked to better <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/coalition-against-stalkerware-expands-membership">detect stalkerware</a>, and federal authorities are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">taking action</a> against spyware makers that further expose their victims to security threats. Last August, Google banned ads in users&#8217; search results that promoted apps that are designed &#8220;with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216253" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But TechCrunch found five app makers were still advertising their stalkerware apps as recently as last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not allow ads promoting spyware for partner surveillance. We immediately removed the ads that violated this policy and will continue to track emerging behaviors to prevent bad actors from trying to evade our detection systems,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">FTC bans spyware maker SpyFone, and orders it to notify hacked victims</a></li>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Google said its <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6016086">policy on enabling dishonest behavior</a>, which governs the promotion of spyware, bans ads from promoting intimate partner surveillance, but does not extend to ads that promote tracking a child&#8217;s activity or workplaces monitoring their employees&#8217; devices, the spokesperson confirmed. The policy also exempts private investigation services, though Google would not say if or how it determines for what purpose an app is used.</p>
<p>Vocal supporters of Google&#8217;s efforts against stalkerware have expressed concerns with the policy&#8217;s enforcement. Malwarebytes, a founding member of the <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, a group of companies committed to combating the growing threat of stalkerware, said last year that <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2020/07/stalkerware-advertising-ban-by-google-a-welcome-if-incomplete-step/">the policy was &#8220;incomplete&#8221;</a> since it allowed stalkerware makers to &#8220;skirt the rules by changing the face of what they’re selling, without changing the core technology within.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesperson for Google declined to provide specifics of how Google&#8217;s enforcement works, but said it looks at a combination of factors to determine if an ad violates its policies, such as looking at the text and images of the ad, how the product is promoted and the landing pages of the ads when clicked.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that several stalkerware apps used a variety of techniques to successfully evade Google&#8217;s ban on advertising apps for partner surveillance and were able to get Google ads approved.</p>
<p>In one case, mSpy, a spyware app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/">had a major security lapse in 2018</a>, ran Google ads that linked to an interstitial web page on an entirely separate domain from mSpy&#8217;s website, which tripped up Google from detecting that the app was also being marketed to spy on &#8220;your kids, husband or wife, grandma or grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another stalkerware maker, ClevGuard, which in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spilled the phone data on thousands of victims</a>, ran Google ads that linked to a page on its website that said the app could be used on a spouse to &#8220;dispel any doubts in a relationship.&#8221; The page was hidden from Google&#8217;s search index using a &#8220;robots&#8221; file that tells search engines what should and shouldn&#8217;t appear in search results. TechCrunch found two other stalkerware apps using this same technique to run ads, which Google said also violated its policies.</p>
<p>Other violating ads were more overt. PhoneSpector, a spyware maker based on Long Island, NY, ran ads that promoted the app as a way to &#8220;catch a cheater.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of September, Google said it <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10957124">will suspend</a> the accounts of advertisers for three months who repeatedly violate its ad policies, including for promoting spyware for targeting spouses.</p>
<p>None of the stalkerware companies responded to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The potential for telehealth across Africa is vast and promising as mobile connectivity deepens, and innovations that could potentially bridge the doctor-patient ratio gap increase, according to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-nl-mhealth.pdf">Deloitte report</a>.</p>
<p>One company that is planning to drive the wave of telemedicine across the continent, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, is <a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a>, a Ghanaian health tech startup that is set to open 100 virtual centers across seven markets in Africa over the next six months.</p>
<p>As it rolls out these centers, mPharma said its end goal is to deliver quality primary care in communities they serve by providing medical examinations, a service the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson said lacks in most telemedicine structures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We saw this as an opportunity to leverage our pharmacies as virtual doctor offices so that patients could get examined remotely during a virtual consultation. This is what makes mPharma&#8217;s telemedicine unique,” Rockson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said that mPharma already provides about 10,000 physician consultations to patients at the startup’s network of pharmacies, and that the new system will enable them to do it electronically too, reaching more people.</p>
<p>Originally founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">to manage</a> prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, mPharma also runs retail pharmacy operations and provides market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh">Rockson</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"> Daniel Shoukimas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/">James Finucane</a>, mPharma is one of the well-funded startups across Africa, raising over $50 million since inception; this includes <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/">a Series C round</a> of $17 million, led by U.K.&#8217;s development arm CDC Group last year. Other <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/mpharma-raises-6-6-million-in-series-a-funding-463dafda6e0b">existing investors</a> include Silicon Valley backer Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Shravin Bharti Mittal of Bharti Global Limited &#8212; an Indian Conglomerate, Social Capital and Golden Palm Investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MPharma also enjoys expertise backing from well-experienced professions in the pharmaceutical industry. They include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S. and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board.</p>
<p>The tech startup plans to use its network of pharmacies to build what they describe as a digital primary care service. It will <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/telemedicine-2-0-mpharmas-vision-to-transform-primary-care-in-africa-576fad3152cb">offer</a> all-in-one diagnostics services using digital “stethoscope, otoscope, thermometer, and examination camera with built-in illumination for high-definition skin and throat images powered by Tytocare”, a telehealth service.</p>
<p>The doctor will also be in a place to request rapid diagnostics tests to be carried out, a service that will be supported by a licensed community health nurse as the medic consults remotely.</p>
<p>Patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia, where mPharma has a presence, are set to benefit from the virtual consultations. It is raising more funding to further grow its business across the continent.</p>
<p>“We currently have five centers open. We have done an assessment of all our pharmacies and plan to establish the Mutti Doctor locations (the virtual centers) based on the needs of the community. We have already identified the first 100 locations,” said Rockson.</p>
<p>The tech startup’s efforts will add to services of tens of other startups across Africa offering variations of telemedicine, like Vezeeta, an Egyptian doctor appointment booking startup. Vezeeta fast-tracked the rollout of home-visit solutions, teleconsultation and online pharmacies across Egypt and Saudi Arabia last year after landing $40 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>Quro Medical, a South Africa startup, also offers home care complemented by telemedicine service, a step it had to take following the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the exposure of COVID virus on patients and the doctors. The health startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/south-africas-quro-medical-comes-out-of-stealth-with-1-1m-to-expand-its-hospital-at-home-service/">received $1.1 million</a> in April this year to help the company increase its reach and improve care among its patients.</p>
<p>Rocket Health, with a presence in Uganda and Kenya, also offers consultation, pharmacy and lab services electronically and through a USSD service, making these services accessible to people without internet connection too.</p>
<p>As the pandemic rages on, the industry is expected to continue growing, especially in emerging markets with poor health infrastructure and where the doctor to patient ratio remains grim, when compared to the richer nations.</p>
<p>According to World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">data</a>, countries across sub-Saharan Africa have an average of 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people. This is against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in some of the most developed countries.</p>
<p>Telemedicine is envisaged to bridge this gap and inspire partnerships and birth more startups like Bima, which provide other ranges of services, including health insurance policies. The Europe-based startup, which offers services in emerging markets, recently received $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>The African pharmaceutical market is also expected to grow exponentially as the population balloons, thus providing a space for innovation and a market for startups offering mobile health solutions.</p>
<p>Across Africa, the Deloitte report says, East Africa is the most promising region in terms of healthcare investment owing to its integration and the growing economy, supported by various sectors, including agriculture and tourism. Increased demand for services and products as consumers get more spending power will also increase in healthcare and telecom spend, it said.</p>
<p>As more startups are launched, a market intelligence report by Salient on innovations in healthcare across sub-Saharan Africa said that they will need to come up with ways to retain customers as competition grows and also come up with methods to partner. The partnerships could be with e-commerce companies for the faster distribution of products and to develop digital ordering, payment and fulfillment systems.</p>
<p>“If mHealth’s opportunity is to be fully exploited, stakeholders will need to proactively seek strategic partnerships, public-private or otherwise, and build cooperative and sustainable business models,” the Deloitte report said.</p>
<p>Deloitte remains upbeat that the industry will take off and recommended that startups such as mPharma use data for better public health supply chain planning and visibility, to forge partnerships and to inform company growth.</p>
<p>Rockson hopes that other telemedicine services can utilize the infrastructure his startup has set up to improve the services they offer to patients.</p>
<p>“We are not looking to compete directly with existing telemedicine providers but rather enable them to plug their service into our remote medical examination solution to close the gap they currently face when providing a teleconsult.”</p>
<p>MPharma, which employs 400 people, says it is set to create an additional 340 opportunities over the next six months by employing a wide-range of specialists, including engineers and clinicians.</p>
<p>It recently entered the ninth market after it was contracted by the Gabonese government to build a drug supply chain infrastructure. This comes months after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">entered the Ethiopian market</a> with plans to franchise its brand and focus more on building and refining its infrastructure for a seamless sourcing and distribution system. This in the hope of solving the challenges facing the pharmaceutical market across Africa, including unpredictable supply chains, exorbitant prices and low orders.</p>

		Luca Rossettini is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was Branson versus Bezos, rocket against rocket, in the race to send the first billionaire into space.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">announced</a> on June 7 that Jeff Bezos, its founder, would fly on the firm’s first crewed mission scheduled for July 20. That same day, <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/">Parabolic Arc</a> reported that Virgin Galactic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/">planning</a> to send Richard Branson on a suborbital flight on July 11. And both aimed to beat the third space-going billionaire, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>More than half a century after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, space exploration is clearly on the upswing again. However, today’s missions reflect far more than the ambitions of billionaires, even if Musk, Bezos and Branson have generated the most headlines for their personal space plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, we’re seeing the emergence of a true space economy. This new sector is in its exponential growth phase, and what unifies current commercial projects is the influx of investments in new technologies and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today’s explorers have plans for expansion that range from the outer limits of our imagination — travel to other planets or colonizing Mars — to the launches of thousands of telecommunication, global navigation and Earth observation satellites, with massive investments being made.</p>
<p>The size of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/2018_ast_compendium.pdf">global space economy</a> &#8212; which combines satellite services and ground equipment, government space budgets and global navigation satellites equipment &#8212; is estimated to be about $345 billion. Startup space ventures <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Start_Up_Space_2020.pdf">brought in $5.7 billion</a> in 2019, easily besting 2018’s $3.5 billion record. By 2040, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space">more than $1 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re at the start of a gold rush in outer space — and our track record for the sustainable development of any environment during gold rushes hasn’t been particularly noteworthy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The threat of catastrophic space collisions is growing</h2>
<p>We are at a critical tipping point for ensuring the safe and sustainable development of new business opportunities in space. Many of these activities use the same regions of the Earth’s orbit, which is not an infinite space. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html">NASA</a>, more than 100 million pieces of orbital debris of about 1 mm or larger are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors. Much more debris &#8212; too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions &#8212; exists in the near-Earth space environment.</p>
<p>In an environment where both debris and spacecraft are traveling at velocities in excess of 15,700 mph in low-Earth orbit, even a 5 mm nut can shred a solar panel like it was made of paper. In fact, NASA reports that millimeter-sized orbital debris represents the highest mission-ending risk to most robotic spacecraft operating in low-Earth orbit. As space becomes more and more congested, unsafe or irresponsible actions by any one actor could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Advances in reusable rockets, which lowered the cost to launch 1 kilogram of payload mass to orbit, and the miniaturization of satellites have all helped to create this threat of a traffic jam in Earth’s orbit. Nearly <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/visualizing-easrth-satellites-sapce-spacex/">3,000 active satellites</a> are currently in orbit above our planet, and this number will likely skyrocket in the coming years. A 230% increase in satellite launches per year is expected by 2025, with 24,000 satellite launches now in planning, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/space-infrastructure-is-the-next-investment-frontier-and-spacs-are-a-launch-pad-11618294752#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20experts%20predict%20a,applied%20to%20fly%2040%2C000%20satellites.">according to MarketWatch</a>. And that figure doesn’t even include launches by SpaceX, OneWeb or Kuiper. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613591/spacexs-starlink-satellites-are-clearly-visible-in-the-skyand-astronomers-arent-happy/">SpaceX’s</a> Starlink alone has applied to fly 40,000 satellites.</p>
<p>The cost to launch 22 tons to low-Earth orbit has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/06/space-tech-transforming-satellite-launches-with-blockchain/">declined</a> from $200 million to about $60 million thanks to reusable rockets. Satellite applications that once required one massive high-performance satellite with a cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars can now be tackled with constellations of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/small-satellites-growth-space/#:~:text=It%20says%20it%20can%20build,able%20to%20endure%20for%20years.">cheaper</a> ($1 million), smaller, lower-performance satellites working together to provide a global service.</p>
<p>While the performance of a single smaller satellite is still inferior to that of a much larger one, the use of data from multiple satellites can often produce comparable results. Moreover, the architecture of a constellation is highly scalable, so as soon as newer generations of satellites are launched, the performance of the infrastructure as a whole increases exponentially.</p>
<h2>Sustainable development requires new technologies and better governance</h2>
<p>Sustainable economic expansion will require innovative solutions to support traditional and new customers throughout the life cycle of a space mission, from a careful analysis of a mission&#8217;s requirements to end-of-life decommissioning.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions will require completely new space-based infrastructures that can streamline launch, operation and decommissioning. D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier, for example, is a space transportation vehicle designed to host a batch of satellites, transport them to orbit and release them individually into distinct orbital slots. This deployment service complements the one offered by launch providers, which targets only the most strategic orbits, enabling satellite operators to cover the last mile in a significantly shorter time and use all the resources of their spacecraft to extend the duration of the mission itself.</p>
<p>This is the first step toward the creation of permanent space logistic infrastructures that can move spacecraft from one orbit to another, extend the life of older vehicles, perform repairs and collect satellite wrecks and other debris.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding sustainable growth in the space economy are too important and consequential to be left to a single company or country.</p>
<p>To strengthen international cooperation and establish a set of ground rules, we need a new model of space governance based on consensus among countries, with common standards. While the technology for debris-capturing spacecraft is already attainable, for example, there are still legal challenges to allow an operator based in a country to approach, capture and remove a space object launched by another country. Formulating global regulation to address this kind of operation is an essential step that can open new markets and business opportunities.</p>
<p>Forty-eight organizations and other government and industry stakeholders, including D-Orbit, formed the <a href="https://spacesafety.org/">Space Safety Coalition</a> (SSC) in 2019 to actively promote best practices for the long-term sustainability of space operations. The SSC has developed guidelines for avoiding launch and on-orbit collisions, minimizing human casualties from spacecraft or debris reentry and minimizing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) events, among other best practices for the overall long-term sustainability of space operations.</p>
<p>This industry-led sustainability effort needs to be adopted by all space stakeholders. How we develop and regulate the space economy will have long-lasting repercussions, and the window for avoiding mistakes is rapidly closing.</p>
<p>It is essential that we lose no time in developing the infrastructure, best practices and governance that will broaden humankind’s ability to operate in space and create still-unimagined opportunities for us all.</p>

<p>In its announcement of the meeting with Haugen, the Oversight Board mentioned its ongoing interest in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">secret Facebook program known as &#8220;cross check&#8221;</a> that allowed some high profile users to circumvent the platform&#8217;s rules. The board said it was specifically examining whether the company had been &#8220;fully forthcoming&#8221; when answering questions on the cross check system and plans to share its findings in a report later in October.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of the program in an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=series_facebookfiles"> investigative series on Facebook published last month</a>. Those reports drew on documents provided by Haugen, who at the time served as an unrevealed source for the paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today released its second minor update to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios-15/">iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/">iPadOS 15</a>, which includes an &#8220;important security update&#8221; for a zero-day bug under active exploitation.</p>
<p>Both iOS 15.0.2 and iPadOS 15.0.2, which are available to download on supported devices now, include a fix for a memory corruption vulnerability that allowed an application to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of device access, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846">Apple says on its security support page</a>.</p>
<p>While details on the bug remain thin, Apple warns that it &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; — so it&#8217;s probably a good idea to update your devices right away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The updates also address a number of other glitches in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, including an issue that caused the iPhone Leather Wallet and with MagSafe not to connect to Find My, a bug that could cause AirTags not to appear in the ‌Find My‌ Items tab, and another that caused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/carplay/">CarPlay</a> to fail to open audio apps or to disconnect during playback. There&#8217;s also a fix for a glitch that saw photos saved to your library from Messages deleted after removing the associated thread or message.</p>
<p>Apple is currently testing the first major update to iOS 15.1, which will be the first major update to iOS 15. This update will re-enable SharePlay in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">FaceTime</a>, add new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max camera features and bring support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet. It&#8217;ll probably include a handful of bug fixes, too.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When building a startup, you’re making what feels like a million decisions on timing — when to launch to time the market, when to hire that key role, when to raise another round. But one of your most important timing decisions might be one you aren’t even considering yet: When to approach the enterprise. If you aren’t debating that now, chances are you’re overlooking a big opportunity.</p>
<p>I saw this time and again while working with dozens of startup CEOs while at Greylock Partners. Approaching the enterprise can feel daunting for early-stage teams. Many founders would push back when I suggested it, and I get why: It’s uncomfortable and maybe even counterintuitive. A commonly heard refrain was: &#8220;We&#8217;re not ready. We&#8217;re too early. We want to optimize our product more first.&#8221; They were afraid that if they talked to large enterprise companies too soon, they’d blow it.</p>
<p>In my experience, the opposite is true. At a startup, you’re constantly trying to maximize learning in the tightest loops possible. The earlier you start, the more valuable the knowledge and iterations you accrue. Your go-to-market is no different.</p>
<p>I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company <em>and</em> woo the enterprise at the same time.</p>
<h2>A short history lesson</h2>
<p>Take Slack, for example. A darling of startups across the Valley and beyond, Slack grew into a can’t-live-without technology for many teams. It&#8217;s a success by nearly anyone’s standards, and yet, it is a company that didn’t survive as an independent public company. Why? Because it couldn’t quite break into the enterprise on its own timetable.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I’m here to tell you it’s possible to be both a product-centric company and woo the enterprise at the same time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Slack enjoyed hypergrowth among startups, but it got beat out by Microsoft Teams on the big deals. Microsoft used its enterprise credibility, deep distribution channels and raw muscle to block Slack from signing big companies that had to work within established protocols and existing infrastructure. Teams might not have had the same stellar user experience, but it met enterprises where they were and played by the buying rules they understood.</p>
<p>The result? Slack got acquired by Salesforce for $27.2 billion 12 years after it was founded.</p>
<p>To be clear, Slack’s acquisition — the largest in Salesforce’s history — is not a bad outcome. Lots of startups dream of such an exit, but it&#8217;s probably not the one the company was seeking given its darling status and enormous popularity. It was a catch-up move, a way to use Salesforce’s weight to get a shot at competing with Teams.</p>
<p>The question is, if Slack had considered selling into the enterprise sooner, could it have survived as an independent public company?</p>
<p>A bottoms-up approach to growth, like Slack famously championed, is fantastic, until it’s not enough. Having helped dozens of portfolio companies approach the enterprise at Greylock Partners and now as a startup CEO myself, here’s some advice on how to avoid common missteps:</p>
<h2>Start sooner than you think you should</h2>
<p>Some of the most commercially successful companies in the world today engaged with enterprise customers before they even had a product. The purpose is to gather intelligence about what a customer would want, what they’d value or how they’d evaluate their product. Startups can gain important information that may help shape their trajectory and get the product enterprise-ready much faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime">partnering with audio entertainment production studio Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts. The two companies have entered into a creative programming and strategic agreement, under which Audio Up is expected to create new podcasts for SiriusXM and its platforms, including the SXM app, Pandora and Stitcher.</p>
<p>Audio Up, which was established in 2020, is a podcast content production studio that has created a slate of original scripted audio entertainment featuring marquee names across music, Hollywood and publishing, including Machine Gun Kelly, Garrett Hedlund and Stephen King.</p>
<p>The agreement gives SiriusXM an exclusive first-look option for new Audio Up original podcast concepts and exclusive rights to manage and sell advertising inventory in connection with any podcast produced for SiriusXM. Audio Up is expected to be an additional creative driver for SiriusXM in connecting artists, labels, brands and creators of all types in developing new audio entertainment programming across SiriusXM channels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216150" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Audio Up also announced today that it has completed a $12 million Series B funding round led by SiriusXM. Further, Andrew Moss, SiriusXM&#8217;s senior vice president of business affairs and programming operations, is joining the board of directors of Audio Up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Audio Up is known for creating podcasts that combine music, entertainment, and rich storytelling to create bold new listening experiences, and we&#8217;re thrilled to welcome them to our extended SiriusXM family,” said Scott Greenstein, the president and chief creative officer of SiriusXM, in a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-and-audio-up-inc-enter-into-creative-and-strategic-agreement-to-develop-new-original-scripted-podcasts-and-audio-entertainment-concepts-301396824.html?tc=eml_cleartime"> press release.</a></p>
<p>A variety of original podcasts from Audio Up’s back catalog will also be represented across the SXM app, Pandora and Stitcher, including Halloween in Hell, The Ballad of Uncle Drank, Bedtime Stories of the Ingleside Inn, Sonic Leap and Make It Up as We Go.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the vast reach and wide diversity of listeners that SiriusXM, Pandora and Stitcher together represent, we not only have a massive new multi-platform outlet for our original programming, but in SiriusXM we have a creative ally who shares our ambitions to keep pushing podcasting forward,” said Audio Up CEO and founder, Jared Gutstadt, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The agreement with Audio Up follows SiriusXM’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">$325 million acquisition of Stitcher</a> last year. The deal meant that thousands of podcasts moved to the SiriusXM roster, after which the company said it now had the “the largest addressable audience” in the United States for digital audio, including music, sports, talk and podcasts, covering 150 million listeners. It has also tried to differentiate Pandora from competitors by offering multiple pricing tiers and unique show formats,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/pandora-expands-its-music-and-podcasts-product-pandora-stories-with-help-from-siriusxms-guests/"> like Pandora Stories</a>, aided by SiriusXM&#8217;s guests.</p>
<p>SiriusXM’s new partnership with Audio Up will further its investments in podcasting and help it continue to compete with others in the audio space, as numerous companies are also looking to expand their podcast offerings. For instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/spotifys-catalog-tops-a-million-podcasts-consumption-increased-by-triple-digits-over-last-year/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/shonda-rhimes-iheartmedia/">iHeartMedia</a> have made notable acquisitions to acquire original podcasting content, as well as tools for podcasters to help run their businesses. Additionally, Apple is also investing in podcasts and recently made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-go-live-worldwide/">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions live</a> across more than 170 countries and regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disney&#8217;s newest digital service, Disney Genie, is <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/10/disney-genie-launching-at-walt-disney-world-resort/">launching on October 19</a> at Walt Disney World Resort. The service, first <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">unveiled</a> in August, is an update to the company&#8217;s earlier line-reservation tools for Disney&#8217;s parks, allowing guests to plan and update their itineraries, book time slots for the most popular attractions, and optionally purchase paid access to the fast lanes&#8217; &#8220;<a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/genie/lightning-lane/">Lightning Lane</a>&#8221; entrances, either à la carte on top attractions or through the &#8220;Genie+&#8221; add-on.</p>
<p>The service will replace Disney&#8217;s older FASTPASS, FastPass+ and Disney MaxPass services, as Disney Genie will roll out across Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort, the company said.</p>
<p>At the core of the Disney Genie experience is a smart trip-planning capability that maps out a personalized itinerary based on which rides, attractions or food and entertainment experiences guests want to make sure to do while at the parks. That means Genie users can customize their day based on not only the top attractions, but also their general interests &#8212; like whether they need to incorporate Princess meet-and-greets into their day, or if they&#8217;d rather seek out the best cocktails at the park&#8217;s bars, for instance.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216108" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216163" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216163" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="404" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=680,404 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/780w-463h_100821_disney-genie-WDW-date_1.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Disney (choosing your interests in the app)</p></div></p>
<p>Before Genie, guests could make up to three reservations in advance of a park visit through the FastPass+ scheduling system, and could then continue to make reservations through the My Disney Experience app after those first three reservations had been used. But this free system made it difficult to get reservations on top rides, as it favored Disney resort-goers who could book 60 days in advance, while others got a 30-day window. It also didn&#8217;t make all top rides (aka Tier 1 attractions) available for the initial booking.</p>
<p>Disney Genie aims to address some of these issues, but for a fee. That&#8217;s led to quite a bit of <a href="https://blogmickey.com/2021/08/disney-fans-overwhelmingly-dislike-disney-genie-announcement/">backlash</a> from Disney fans who feel they already pay enough for their Disney trips and don&#8217;t want to add more charges. In fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9fP50klEPE">the video announcement</a> has a ratio of 12,000 dislikes to just 948 likes, as of the time of writing. However, paid fast-lane access to a park&#8217;s main attractions is a common staple at Disney&#8217;s theme park competitors &#8212; and one that can help those who have tighter schedules ensure they get everything done.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9fP50klEPE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Genie&#8217;s WDW launch on October 19, guests will be able to choose from the two paid options &#8212; either individual access to up to two Lightning Lanes or Genie+&#8217;s broader selection.</p>
<p>Disney says the following rides are available for the à la carte option: Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Space Mountain at Magic Kingdom, Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure and Frozen Ever After at Epcot, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and Mickey &amp; Minnie&#8217;s Runaway Railway at Disney Hollywood Studios, and Avatar Flight of Passage and Expedition Everest at Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom.</p>
<p>While picking two options could help speed up your wait times, it may not include your must-have ride selections.</p>
<p>Disney Genie+, meanwhile, opens up Lightning Lanes at a total of 40+ attractions across the four parks instead, including many more of the Tier 1 rides. It will be priced at $15 per ticket per day at Walt Disney World Resort and $20 per ticket per day at Disneyland Resort, when available.</p>

<p>The à la carte pricing will vary by date, attraction and park, Disney says. While Disney hasn&#8217;t announced specific ranges for each ride, it has offered some examples. It says the Lightning Lane entrance to Remy&#8217;s Ratatouille Adventure will be $9 per person on October 19 and $11 per person on October 23. But on those same dates, the Lightning Lane entrance to Expedition Everest &#8211; Legend of the Forbidden Mountain will be just  $7 per person, while Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance will be $15 per person.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s news of the October 19 launch at Walt Disney World Resort, the company is also detailing how the feature is integrated into its My Disney Experience app. This is the app offering access to your tickets, park maps, showtimes, online food ordering and more.</p>

<p>Today, many park-goers turn to third-party apps like those from TouringPlans.com or other indie developers, as well as Disney fan blogs, to get tips about how to plan their route through a given park to ensure they see all the main attractions and events. But Genie promises to help prioritize your trip for you directly in its own My Disney Experience app, using the company&#8217;s understanding of things like wait times and other park changes &#8212; like rides that temporarily closed or other delays. This in-house option could potentially impact the revenue streams from the third-party businesses that have sprung up to address park planning needs.</p>
<p>Plus, unlike static plans, Genie&#8217;s experience will adapt to users&#8217; days and their own unexpected plan changes &#8212; like needing to head back to the hotel to let little kids nap, taking an unplanned snack break or deciding you want to ride something twice. As you adjust your plans, Genie also updates your itinerary. And this aspect of the service is offered for free, even if you&#8217;re not paying for fast-lane entry.</p>
<p>Disney has not yet announced when Disney Genie will launch at Disneyland Resort, but <a href="https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/08/introducing-disney-genie/">said</a> earlier that it would arrive this fall.</p>

The city of Los Angeles — eager to introduce zero-emission transportation — wants to ensure the launch of air taxis doesn&#8217;t repeat past mistakes.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">To help prepare Los Angeles for the new tech, a nonprofit organization spun out of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti&#8217;s office is working with air taxi developers and local residents to develop a policy toolkit in advance of commercial operations later this decade.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to be hammered out before then. Foremost, the aircraft must be certified with the Federal Aviation Administration &#8212; a mammoth task in and of itself. But even beyond aircraft certification, companies will also need to plan for infrastructure, namely vertiports, or where the air taxis will take off and land. And these come with real issues like noise pollution and zoning laws that have the potential to affect not only city residents but other transportation networks, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.urbanmovementlabs.com/">Urban Movement Labs</a> was spun out of the mayor’s Office of Economic Development in 2020 to become a standalone 501c(3) nonprofit aimed at shaping the future of mobility in the city. This year, the organization commenced an urban air mobility (UAM) partnership with the mayor’s office and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation to drill down into how the city can integrate UAM into existing infrastructure and transportation networks in a way that maximizes equity and accessibility.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2209157" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The partnership is being funded, in part, by Archer Aviation and Hyundai’s Urban Air Mobility division.</p>
<p>“We have a commitment from Hyundai and Archer to actually focus on assisting us in developing this policy toolkit,” Sam Morrissey, UML’s executive director, explained to TechCrunch in a recent interview. “That&#8217;s everything from the policies around where these vehicles will fly, the air routes, where these vehicles may land outside of commercial airports … and other related policies around planning for [vertiports].”</p>
<p>Joby Aviation has coordinated with UML since the organization was formed, and German UAM developer Volocopter joined as UML’s newest partner earlier this month.</p>
<p>“Our role is to really facilitate the new deployment of technology in Los Angeles,” Morrissey said. He added that the city wants to avoid the ex post facto scramble to regulate transportation technologies, like what happened after the launch of Uber, Lyft and scooter rental services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Particularly in 2016, when Uber Elevate started talking about flying taxis in cities, the city of Los Angeles said, ‘We need to have a separate entity that can help focus this.’”</p>
<h2>The infrastructure challenge</h2>
<p>UML fashions itself as a three-way bridge between the city, private industry and, most importantly, Los Angelenos. The three perspectives may not always align. The launch of electric air taxis, in particular, presents unique challenges that need to be solved, everything from fire risk and zoning issues to noise pollution and issues that cause disagreement among stakeholders.</p>
<p>Consider vertiports. While certifying the aircraft is solely in the jurisdiction of the FAA, &#8220;if you want to build new infrastructure on the ground, this is obviously a municipal and a city question,&#8221; <span class="il">Greg</span> Bowles, Joby&#8217;s head of government affairs, explained to TechCrunch. &#8220;The way you want to use that, the access to that, the permitting, those are all municipal [issues].&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey said companies are primarily approaching route planning from a market standpoint — for example, looking at where people currently use Uber Black, the ride-sharing company&#8217;s premium service — while Urban Movement Labs wants to overlay that onto a regional-planning approach that accounts for how UAM would support existing transportation networks in the long term.</p>
<p>Siting and zoning laws are another issue. Beyond the easy-to-imagine NIMBYism that may crop up once potential vertiport sites are located, operational tempo, or flights per hour, could affect how many air taxi operators can use a given site.</p>
<p>While both Archer and Joby have announced private partnerships with REEF Technology to convert assets like parking garages into vertiport sites (and UML recognizes that these locations make a great deal of sense for a number of reasons), the city’s own regulations must still be accounted for before air taxis can start ferrying customers.</p>
<p>“Converting the roof of a parking structure sounds good, but you ultimately still need [the building and safety departments] to come in and say that this deck can support these aircraft, that the fire suppression needs are adequate enough,” Morrissey said.</p>
<p>A major question mark is whether and how many vertiports will be exclusive-use versus shared among the companies. One can imagine air taxi takeoff and landing sites like airport gates (homogenous and shared among all airlines) or more like gas stations (branded, competitive and offering different amenities). This, too, could be another potential point of contention between the city, its residents and the air taxi companies.</p>
<p>At least in the beginning, however, many companies may decide that working together &#8212; to set standards relating to noise and charging, for example &#8212; is the faster route to overall commercialization and adoption than working separately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t really look at this as a competitive space,&#8221; Bowles said of Joby&#8217;s work on vertiport standards. &#8220;This is something we have to build, so we&#8217;re working with a lot of the other OEMs and future operators.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160169" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160169" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160169" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Joby-Aviation_Aircraft_3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160169" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.jobyaviation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joby Aviation <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The final question, of course, is the perennial one: Who’s going to pay for it?</p>
<p>“When we think about vertiports in the future, it&#8217;s going to be really a combination of who provides the capital to build and operate that vertiport, and a conversation with the city as far as who can access those vertiports and what the pros and cons might be to a community, of having open-access vertiports versus not open access,” Archer’s head of business development, Andrew Cummins, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Echoing Cummins, UML&#8217;s urban air mobility fellow, Clint Harper, said that while the city of Los Angeles has been clear about its preference for an “OEM-ambiguous” infrastructure, much of the final network will depend on whether vertiports are completely private enterprises or built through public-private partnerships. “They&#8217;re different funding models to bring infrastructure into reality,” he said. “Depending on what that funding model looks like, I think will tell us whether it&#8217;s going to be a multioperator type of facility or a single operator facility.”</p>
<p>Volocopter&#8217;s chief commercial officer, Christian <span class="il">Bauer, told TechCrunch</span> it was the company&#8217;s viewpoint that “we need an open system” for all OEMs. “We do not want to invest into real estate,” he added.</p>
<h2>Working with the city and beyond</h2>
<p>Many of these questions are big and will likely take years to reconcile. In part, that’s because cities are still awaiting guidance from federal regulators. Harper told TechCrunch that UML is staying flexible as recommendations from the FAA, National Fire Protection Association and the International Code Council’s building code continue to evolve.</p>
<p>For their part, air taxi OEMs are also working at the federal level to provide input into developing policies. Archer, Joby and Volocopter are all also working with federal regulators and city municipalities.</p>
<p>Looking to the rest of the year and into next, UML said it’s reaching out to transportation advocacy groups, like pedestrian safety or cyclist organizations, as well as social issue groups that focus on things like homelessness, to understand how to plan for urban air mobility. Equity is particularly important in transportation planning in order to avoid repeating past mistakes: The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, found that California&#8217;s people of color and low-income residents are <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/inequitable-exposure-air-pollution-vehicles-california-2019#ucs-report-downloads">disproportionately exposed</a> to tailpipe emissions.</p>
<p>Much of the work on the city side is simply ensuring that relevant city departments are up to date on the latest developments with vertiports. Some of that comes down to ensuring the building and safety and fire departments, among others, can assign full-time staff to prepare for vertiports and new infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Morrissey said UML is trying to be methodical.</p>
<p>“I think the reality is that these vehicles are coming, and we really want to do everything we can to plan for it but stay out of the hype cycle.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Varda Space Industries, a startup that wants to build in-space manufacturing facilities, will be sending its first spacecraft to orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2023.</p>
<p>The actual spacecraft &#8212; the startup’s first to go to orbit &#8212; will be made by SpaceX’s rival launch company, Rocket Lab, which will also make two subsequent space vehicles for Varda. The three vehicles will be outfitted with two Varda-made modules: a microgravity manufacturing module and a reentry capsule.</p>
<p>The aim is for each spacecraft to spend approximately three months in orbit, with the reentry module bringing back around 40-60 kilograms of manufactured materials.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216122" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/">Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Space manufacturing startup Varda inks deal with Rocket Lab for three spacecraft&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/space-manufacturing-startup-varda-inks-deal-with-rocket-lab-for-three-spacecraft/embed/#?secret=gsx1Tib6X3" data-secret="gsx1Tib6X3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Varda’s goal is to unlock the benefits of microgravity &#8212; which can only be found for sustained periods in space &#8212; for manufacturing novel materials, like bio-printed organs or specialized semiconductors. The startup’s bet is that the potential market for such materials is high enough to make the effort worth it.</p>
<p>The Torrance, California-based startup has been moving fast since its founding by SpaceX veteran Will Bruey and Founders Fund principal Delian Asparouhov a little less than a year ago. Varda announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/varda-space-industries-closes-42m-series-a-for-off-planet-manufacturing/">$42 million Series A</a> in July, and plans on following an aggressive launch schedule, with two launches in 2023 and a third in 2024.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will be one of many objects aboard the Falcon 9 rideshare mission, a new and lucrative program that spreads the cost of going to space between customers by allowing them to essentially carpool to space. SpaceX promises to slash the cost of launch to as low as $1 million for an individual customer looking to send up to 200 kilograms of payload to sun synchronous orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
