										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://onpopcorn.com/">Popcorn</a> wants to make work communication more fun and personal by offering a way for users to record short video messages, or &#8220;pops,&#8221; that can be used for any number of purposes in place of longer emails, texts, Slack messages, or Zoom calls. While there are plenty of other places to record short-form video these days, most of these exist in the social media space which isn&#8217;t appropriate for a work environment. Nor does it make sense to send a video you&#8217;ve recorded on your phone as an email attachment, when you really just want to check in with a colleague or say hello.</p>
<p>Popcorn, on the other hand, lets you create the short video and then send a URL to that video anywhere you would want add a personal touch to your message.</p>
<p>For example, you could use Popcorn in business networking scenario, where you&#8217;re trying to connect with someone in your industry for the first time &#8212; aka &#8220;cold outreach.&#8221; Instead of just blasting them a message on LinkedIn, you could also paste in the Popcorn URL to introduce yourself in a more natural, friendly fashion. You could also use Popcorn with your team at work for things like daily check-ins, sharing progress on an ongoing project, or to greet new hires, among other things.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2194586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?w=336" alt="" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png 390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Popcorn-iPhone-Chat.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /></p>
<p>Videos themselves can be up to 60 seconds in length &#8212; a time limit designed to keep Popcorn users from rambling. Users can also opt to record audio only if they don&#8217;t want to appear on video. And you can increase the playback speed if you&#8217;re in a hurry. Users who want to receive &#8220;pops&#8221; could also advertise their &#8220;popcode&#8221; (e.g. try mine at U8696).</p>
<p>The idea to bring short-form video to the workplace comes from Popcorn co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinspraggins/">Justin Spraggins</a>, whose background is in building consumer apps. One of his first apps to gain traction back in 2014 was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/looksee-debuts-a-tinder-meets-instagram-for-connecting-around-shared-photos/">Tinder-meets-Instagram experience called Looksee</a> that allowed users to connect around shared photos. A couple years later, he co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/unmute-reinvents-the-phone-hotline-with-an-social-calling-app/">a social calling app called Unmute,</a> a Clubhouse precursor of sorts. He then went on to co-found <a href="https://www.9count.co/">9 Count</a>, a consumer app development shop which launched more social apps like BFF (previously Wink) and Juju.</p>
<p>9 Count&#8217;s lead engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hochberg-44858351/">Ben Hochberg</a>, is now also a co-founder on Popcorn (or rather, Snack Break, Inc. as the legal entity is called). They began their work on Popcorn in 2020, just after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the rapid shift to remote work that&#8217;s come in the days that followed could now help Popcorn gain traction among distributed teams. Today&#8217;s remote workers may never again return to in-person meetings at the office, but they&#8217;re also are growing tired of long days stuck in Zoom meetings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Popcorn, the goal is to make work communication fun, personal and bite-sized, Spraggins says. &#8220;[We want to] bring all the stuff we&#8217;re really passionate about in consumer social into work, which I think is really important for us now,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;You work with these people, but how do you &#8212; without scheduling a Zoom &#8212; how do you bring the &#8216;human&#8217; to it?,&#8221; Spraggins says. &#8220;I&#8217;m really excited about making work products feel more social, more like Snapchat than utility tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a lot Popcorn would still need to figure out to truly make a business-oriented social app work, including adding enhanced security, limiting spam, offering some sort of reporting flow for bad actors, and more. It will also eventually need to land on a successful revenue model.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbyECYAbh_Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Currently, Popcorn is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1539175761#?platform=iphone">free download</a> on iPhone, iPad and Mac, and offers a Slack integration so you can send video messages to co-workers directly in the communication software you already use to catch up and stay in touch. The app today is fairly simple but the company plans to enhance its short videos over time using AR frames that let users showcase their personalities.</p>
<p>The startup raised a $400,000 pre-seed round from General Catalyst (<a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/niko-bonatsos/">Nico Bonatsos)</a> and <a href="https://www.dreammachine.vc/">Dream Machine</a> (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/alexia-tsotsis">Alexia Bonatsos</a>, previously editor-in-chief at TechCrunch.) Spraggins says the company will be looking to raise a seed round in the fall to help with hires, including in the AR space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix today <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587">announced</a> it will begin testing mobile games inside its Android app for its members in Poland. At launch, paying subscribers will be able to try out two games, &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; and &#8220;Stranger Things 3&#8221; &#8212; titles that have been <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things:_The_Game">previously</a> available on the Apple App Store, Google Play and, in the case of the newer release, on other <a href="https://bonusxp.com/#games">platforms</a> including <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/stranger-things-3-the-game/9pmddq228fqd?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">desktop</a> and <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things_3:_The_Game">consoles</a>. While the games are offered to subscribers from within the Netflix mobile app&#8217;s center tab, users will still be directed to the Google Play Store to install the game on their devices.</p>
<p>To then play, members will need to confirm their Netflix credentials.</p>
<p>Members can later return to the game at any time by clicking &#8220;Play&#8221; on the game&#8217;s page from inside the Netflix app or by launching it directly from their mobile device.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s still very, very early days and we will be working hard to deliver the best possible experience in the months ahead with our no ads, no in-app purchases approach to gaming,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said about the launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let’s talk Netflix and gaming. </p>
<p>Today members in Poland can try Netflix mobile gaming on Android with two games, Stranger Things: 1984 and Stranger Things 3. It’s very, very early days and we’ve got a lot of work to do in the months ahead, but this is the first step. <a href="https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r">https://t.co/yOl44PGY0r</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1430896997238595587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company has been expanding its investment in gaming for years, seeing the potential for a broader entertainment universe that ties in to its most popular shows. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">the E3 gaming conference back in 2019</a>, Netflix detailed a series of gaming integrations across popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite and its plans to bring new &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; games to the market.</p>
<p>On mobile, Netflix has been working with the Allen, Texas-based game studio <a href="https://bonusxp.com/">BonusXP</a>, whose first game for Netflix, &#8220;<a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things:_The_Game">Stranger Things: The Game</a>,&#8221; has now been renamed &#8220;Stranger Things: 1984&#8221; to better differentiate it from others. While that game takes place after season 1 and before season 2, in the &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; timeline, the follow-up title, &#8220;Stranger Things 3,&#8221; is a playable version of the third season of the Netflix series. (So watch out for spoilers!)</p>
<p>Netflix declined to share how popular the games had been in terms of users or installs, while they were publicly available on the app stores.</p>
<p>With the launch of the test in Poland, Netflix says users will need to have a membership to download the titles as they&#8217;re now exclusively available to subscribers. However, existing users who already downloaded the game from Google Play in the past will not be impacted. They will be able to play the game as usual or even re-download it from their account library if they used to have it installed. But new players will only be able to get the game from the Netflix app.</p>
<p>The test aims to better understand how mobile gaming will resonate with Netflix members and determine what other improvements Netflix may need to make to the overall functionality, the company said. It chose Poland as the initial test market because it has an active mobile gaming audience, which made it seem like a good fit for this early feedback.</p>
<p>Netflix couldn&#8217;t say when it would broaden this test to other countries, beyond &#8220;the coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The streamer recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/netflixs-stranger-things-comes-to-roblox-ahead-of-its-july-4-premiere/">announced</a> during its second-quarter earnings that it would add mobile games to its offerings, noting that it viewing gaming as &#8220;another new content category&#8221; for its business, similar to its &#8220;expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news followed what had been<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-current-quarter-forecast-misses-estimates-shares-fall-2021-07-20/"> a sharp slowdown in new customers</a> after the pandemic-fueled boost to streaming. In North America, Netflix in Q2 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-bleeds-subscribers-in-us-and-canada-with-no-sign-of-recovery/">lost a sizable 430,000 subscribers</a> &#8212; its third-ever quarterly decline in a decade. It also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-bleeds-subscribers-in-us-and-canada-with-no-sign-of-recovery/">issued weaker guidance</a> for the upcoming quarter, forecasting the addition of 3.5 million subscribers when analysts had been looking for 5.9 million. But Netflix downplayed the threat of competition on its slowing growth, instead blaming a lighter content slate, in part due to Covid-related production delays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Curio Wellness <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/curio-wellness-launches-30m-fund-to-help-women-and-minorities-own-a-cannabis-dispensary/">announced its innovative franchise program in 2020</a>, and today it’s bringing the program across the United States. The company is now accepting franchise applications in ten states, including MD, VA, PA, OH, MO, NJ, FL, MA, MI, and IL.</p>
<p>The program is designed to lower barriers to opening a dispensary. Anyone can apply to secure a franchise license, and diverse founders can seek capital through the Curio Wellness Fund. Curio Wellness expects to be able to sponsor 40 to 50 retail stores. The company is also rebranding its retail operations to Far &amp; Dotter.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke to Jerel Registre, Managing Director at Curio WMBE Fund, who says the fund raised 20 million to date and expects to close the fundraising on October 31. He’s proud of the fund’s investor base, pointing to the diverse investor base representing 40% of the fund.</p>
<p>“My focus on the fund is driving diverse entrepreneurship,” Registre said. “The reason cannabis is such a great industry to do that in is that it’s a growing opportunity. It’s just a great ocean to put the boat on in terms of increasing diversity among entrepreneurs. It’s an area of the economy, and it’s a hot industry where there’s an understanding of the need for diversity.”</p>
<p>Registre points out that while the cannabis industry’s customer and employee base are often diverse, there’s often a lack of diversity in the executive and business ownership group. That’s what Curio Wellness is trying to address.</p>
<p>The fund provides selected franchisees with up to 93% of the capital needed to open a location. But it’s more than capital. It’s clear while speaking to Registre that his team is dedicated to formulating a proven strategy for their franchises. He points to Chick-fil-a as an example, saying, while he doesn’t like the company’s relationship with its franchisees, it provides a market-leading cohesive brand statement. Through Curio&#8217;s program, franchisees are provided with two phases of support. The first provides capital to franchisees to open their Curio Wellness Center and assist them in obtaining licenses, selecting a location and hiring and training employees. Once the location is operational, the fund intends to provide ongoing support around managing, sales and marketing, store operations, and ensuring employees stay updated on product information.</p>
<p>“After more than two years of effort to design an effective method of providing capital to diverse entrepreneurs in the cannabis industry, it is a personal honor to officially begin the application process and to truly expand diversity and enable economic empowerment in the industry,” said Registre. “The Fund is a true testament to Curio’s goal to address systemic barriers and create generational wealth among aspiring women, BIPOC, and disabled veteran entrepreneurs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This program is spinning up at the right time. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/2020-was-a-defining-year-for-cannabis-what-comes-next/">Cannabis was one of the winners of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, resulting in record sales and consumer acceptance. As a result, the time is right for dispensary ownership to reflect their local neighborhoods better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is looking to create a standalone advisory committee for election-related policy decisions, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/technology/facebook-election-commission.html">The New York Times</a>. The company has reportedly approached a number of policy experts and academics it is interested in recruiting for the group, which could give the company cover for some of its most consequential choices.</p>
<p>The group, which the Times characterizes as a commission, would potentially be empowered to weigh in on issues like election misinformation and political advertising — two of Facebook&#8217;s biggest policy headaches. Facebook reportedly plans for the commission to be in place for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections and could announce its formation as soon as this fall.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s election commission could be modeled after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">Oversight Board</a>, the company&#8217;s first experiment in quasi-independent external decision making. The Oversight Board began<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-oversight-board-controversy/"> reviewing cases in October of last year</a>, but didn&#8217;t gear up in time to impact the flood of election misinformation that swept the platform during the U.S. presidential election. Initially, the board could only make policy rulings based on material that was already removed from Facebook.</p>
<p>The company touts the independence of the Oversight Board, and while it does operate independently, Facebook created the group and appointed its four original co-chairs. The Oversight Board is able to set policy precedents and make binding per-case moderation rulings, but ultimately its authority comes from Facebook itself, which at any point could decide to ignore the board&#8217;s decisions.</p>

<p>A similar external policy-setting body focused on elections would be<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/facebook-trump-oversight-board-decision/"> very politically useful</a> for Facebook. The company is a frequent target for both Republicans and Democrats, with the former claiming Facebook censors conservatives disproportionately and the latter calling attention to Facebook&#8217;s long history of incubating conspiracies and political misinformation.</p>
<p>Neither side was happy when Facebook decided to suspend political advertising after the election — a gesture that failed to address the exponential spread of organic misinformation. Facebook asked the Oversight Board to review its decision to suspend former President Trump, though the board ultimately kicked its most controversial case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/">back to the company itself</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Y Combinator application season is upon us. I have been through YC a couple of times and have reviewed thousands of applications as a volunteer in later years.</p>
<p>Typically, you hear advice focused on ways to improve your YC application so it gets accepted. Here are some tips on what not to do and why so many YC applications get rejected. I&#8217;ve also put down some advice about what else to anticipate and take into consideration as you navigate the application process.</p>
<p>In short, don’t overthink your application, and keep it simple and straightforward.</p>
<h2>When should I submit my YC application?</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When in doubt, read YC’s instructions and answer the question literally. Avoid verbose marketing lingo and keep answers short and concise.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The best applications are often those made at the last minute, because applicants do not overthink their responses and toil over details they think need to be shoved into a question. While I do not recommend submitting applications at the deadline because the system has had issues receiving submissions, you can capture the essence of last-minute submissions by being clear and concise.</p>
<p>Remember that your application should be good enough to get an interview, not win a prize. Go back to work instead of spending more time perfecting an application.</p>
<p>YC experiments frequently. For this batch and the last, there was an early deadline that would give accepted teams access to YC before the batch officially began. Applying early gives you an opportunity to land an interview in the early round and to update your application to be considered in the standard round.</p>
<h2>Is it OK to submit my YC application late?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a lot of advice out there on how to grab people&#8217;s attention, but there&#8217;s one aspect of marketing that <a href="https://robertkatai.com/">Robert Katai</a> thinks isn&#8217;t talked about as often: maintaining their attention. The solution, he says, is a combination of content strategy and positioning.</p>
<p>Based in Romania, Katai is known for his podcasts and speeches covering the gamut of content marketing. A product manager at online graphic design platform <a href="https://www.creatopy.com/">Creatopy</a>, he also works with clients as a freelance content strategist, and it is in this capacity that he was recommended to TechCrunch via our growth marketer survey. (If you have growth marketers to recommend, please <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">fill out the survey</a>!)</p>
<p>Katai was recommended by multiple Romanian clients and contacts who vouched for his content strategy prowess, so we were curious to know more. Who is he? And is his advice applicable beyond borders?</p>
<p>The short answer is yes. In a freewheeling interview, Katai spoke about how content marketing should integrate with users&#8217; daily lives, and how content can be repurposed across multiple formats. He also shared some insights on the booming Romanian startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you help your clients as a freelancer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Katai: </strong>One of the two things I&#8217;m doing is that I&#8217;m helping clients with creating their content strategy based on their objective. You can get web traffic, but you can also create a message and build the brand. You don&#8217;t have to start at the beginning; You can rebuild the brand later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m working with a Romanian outsourcing company that started in 1993. They pioneered this industry in our city of Cluj-Napoca, but lately they started to realize that they should be more attractive from a sales as well as from an employee perspective. So I worked with them to perform an internal audit to see why employees love the company, why they leave, why they stay and what they want from the company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192106" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192106" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?w=300" alt="Robert Katai" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Robert-Katai.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robert Katai.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, I got to the idea that they needed to reshape their brand to not just have people notice them but to also maintain their attention. And here comes the content: I started an ambassador program, because there are people outside of the company who love it.</p>
<p>I also recommended they create an internal print magazine. It&#8217;s a very well-designed magazine that their 200 to 300 employees can take home and read. It&#8217;s not just about the job; it&#8217;s also about their hobbies, things to do in the city and some thought leadership articles that can inspire them to have a better life.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s the second way you are helping clients?</strong></p>
<p>Apart from content strategy, I&#8217;m working with clients on their positioning for their audience, community and market, but also sometimes in terms of employer branding. Content can be a bridge between the two ways I am helping clients, because I&#8217;m using a lot of content marketing here and not focusing only on performance or growth marketing hacks. I&#8217;m helping them understand that if they want to establish a memorable, long-lasting brand in the market, they have to make content marketing part of their life.</p>
<p>If they want to reposition themselves in the industry, they need to say: Okay, these are the kinds of content we have to create for our goals; who will amplify the content, who will connect with us, and who will consume the content. Today, content creation is free — everybody can do it. The hard part is how you distribute and amplify that. And here&#8217;s how I can help the startups: Make a big piece of content and repurpose it in several small pieces; get it in front of people so that the brand is on their minds.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>How can brands achieve that top-of-mind status?</strong></p>
<p>We all know that there are four kinds of content: Text, video, pictures and audio. These four formats never die. The platform can change, but the format will stay the same. A video can be an Instagram Reel, a documentary or something else, but it&#8217;s a video. The same goes for a photo. So the content strategy I&#8217;m working with is how brands can use that content ecosystem.</p>
<p>When I work with my clients — and also with Creatopy where I&#8217;m a product marketer — I recommend them to use content to build their brand and be visible to their users every day in their feeds. Every morning, when their customers are waking up and checking their phones, they don&#8217;t open a newspaper. They will open Twitter, Instagram or Facebook, and maybe then when they get out of the bathroom and make coffee, they will open YouTube and connect with Alexa.</p>
<p>I really believe that brands should create content that can just be in the mind of the user. Snackable content, Reels, TikTok … It doesn&#8217;t matter what we call it.</p>
<p><strong>You also talked about repurposing content. Can you explain that?</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take the interview you&#8217;ve done with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/to-stay-ahead-of-your-competitors-start-building-your-narrative-on-day-one/">Peep Laja</a>. You could have recorded it as a video. And he covered several topics, so you could have several short videos — 30 seconds, three minutes, whatever. You can publish them daily on your site or social media channels with a comment that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the link to the full article.&#8221; But remember that on LinkedIn, that link will need to go into the comments section, not the post itself.</p>
<p>You can also have a longer video that you can publish on social media or on Wistia, asking people to give their email — so now you also have subscribers.</p>
<p>Then the second type of content you can create is audio. You already have it from the recording. You don&#8217;t have to publish the full 45-minute conversation, but you can have a five-minute audio clip, and again link to the articles.</p>
<p>Now we have video and audio, but what if you also designed quotes with his headshot and messaging? If it&#8217;s part of a series, you should also give it a name.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not just motivational; it&#8217;s educational, too, so you should take these quotes and create carousels for Instagram and LinkedIn. The first slide should grab attention — it can be a question. The second slide can be a link to the interview so that even if people don&#8217;t click it, it will be on their minds. Then you can have slides with insights.</p>
<p>The last slide will always be a call to action: Asking people to share, comment or save it for later — it&#8217;s the new currency on Instagram! And once you have your Instagram carousel, you create a PDF and publish it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So now you have five formats of content from one piece of content.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, how much do we owe you?! Just kidding, we actually do some of that for the Equity podcast, for instance. Now, what other advice do you have for startups?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big advocate of documenting the process. Just imagine if Mark Zuckerberg had done that and you could read how he launched Facebook and so on. Noah Kagan is doing that right now. I think startup founders should do it, not just from the PR and marketing perspective, but for their audience. Even if your audience is not paying for your product right now, they are staying with you and giving your brand an essence in the industry.</p>
<p>Just think about what Salesforce is doing right now: They <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/there-could-be-more-to-the-salesforce-video-streaming-service-than-meets-the-eye/">launched Salesforce+</a>, which is like Netflix for B2B. It&#8217;s to get the attention of professionals and also maintain it, and I believe this is the currency of the big companies today: People&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p><b>Do you work with any startups in Romania? And do you have any impressions to share on the </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/8-investors-tell-us-the-story-behind-the-romanian-startup-boom/"><b>Romanian startup ecosystem</b></a><b>?</b></p>
<p>Yes, I help a few Romanian startups with their content marketing and positioning. Sometimes other startups email me with questions, so I help them, too, but I don&#8217;t charge for email advice. I work with the ones that are looking for a long-term or project-based collaboration.</p>
<p>Startup founders here in Romania are curious, and very courageous to experiment even if it won&#8217;t necessarily work. And Romanian startups are very smart. For instance, <a href="https://planable.io/">Planable</a> is doing a great job with content, social media and positioning. We also have social media analytics company <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/">Socialinsider</a>, which this year launched virtual events, and <a href="https://www.typingdna.com/">TypingDNA</a>, which wants to get rid of needing to log in with passwords and was founded by a former colleague.</p>
<p>I also found that the founders here work harder than their teams and don&#8217;t just leave others do the work — at least the ones I have met. We have several startup events in Romania: <a href="https://www.howtoweb.co/">How to Web</a>, and <a href="https://techsylvania.com/">Techsylvania</a> here in Transylvania.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like this name, but people say that Cluj-Napoca is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/06/the-silicon-valley-of-transylvania/">&#8220;Silicon Valley of Romania.&#8221;</a> Lots of startups have been launched here, but the city that is getting more and more traction is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oradea">Oradea</a>, where the bet on education is paying off.</p>
<p><em>(If you are a tech startup founder or investor in Cluj or Oradea, fill in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/we-want-your-city-in-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">TechCrunch&#8217;s European Cities Survey 2021</a>.)</em></p>

For now, YouTube is inviting Premium subscribers to test this feature, which lets users watch picture-in-picture videos in a mini player while browsing other apps. The testing period for Premium users ends on October 31, but YouTube does not have a timeline to share on when all U.S. iOS users will gain access to the feature.</p>
<p>Though this is a mobile feature, Premium subscribers must enable the ability to test it <a href="http://youtube.com/new">via the YouTube experiments website</a> on the desktop. Last year, YouTube made opting into experiments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">a Premium perk</a>.</p>
<p>If you scroll down on the experiments website, you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Picture-in picture on iOS&#8221; with the option to try it. Then, if you watch a video on the YouTube app, you should see a picture-in-picture display of the video when you navigate out of the app.</p>

<p>Once viewing a video via picture-in-picture, you can adjust where the video appears on your screen and how big it is. When you tap on the video, you&#8217;ll return to the YouTube app. If you lock your phone, the video will pause.</p>
<p>Some users have <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/">reported</a> that you might need to delete and reinstall the YouTube app to get it to work.</p>
<p>This feature is different from existing picture-in-picture functionality on the YouTube iOS app because it allows you to continue watching a video even while navigating elsewhere on your phone. Similar features already exist on streaming apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/netflix-finally-gets-picture-in-picture-support-on-ipad/">Netflix</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The May 2021 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">executive order</a> from the White House on improving U.S. cybersecurity includes a provision for a software bill of materials (SBOM), a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various components used in building a software product.</p>
<p>An SBOM is the full list of every item that’s needed to build an application. It enumerates all parts, including open-source software (OSS) dependencies (direct), transitive OSS dependencies (indirect), open-source packages, vendor agents, vendor application programming interfaces (APIs) and vendor software development kits.</p>
<p>Software developers and vendors often create products by assembling existing open-source and commercial software components, the executive order notes. It’s useful to those who develop or manufacture software, those who select or purchase software and those who operate the software.</p>
<p>As the executive order describes, an SBOM enables software developers to make sure open-source and third-party components are up to date. Buyers can use an SBOM to perform vulnerability or license analysis, both of which can be used to evaluate risk in a product. And those who operate software can use SBOMs to quickly determine whether they are at potential risk of a newly discovered vulnerability.</p>
<p>“A widely used, machine-readable SBOM format allows for greater benefits through automation and tool integration,” the executive order says. “The SBOMs gain greater value when collectively stored in a repository that can be easily queried by other applications and systems. Understanding the supply chain of software, obtaining an SBOM and using it to analyze known vulnerabilities are crucial in managing risk.”</p>
<p>An SBOM is intrinsically hierarchical. The finished product sits at the top, and the hierarchy includes all of its dependencies providing a foundation for its functionality. Any one of these parts can be exploited in this hierarchical structure, leading to a ripple effect.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, given the potential impact, there has been a lot of talk about the proposed SBOM provision since the executive order was announced. This is certainly true within the cybersecurity community. Anytime there are attacks such as the ones against Equifax or Solarwinds that involve software vulnerabilities being exploited, there is renewed interest in this type of concept.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clearly, the intention of an SBOM is good. If software vendors are not upgrading dependencies to eliminate security vulnerabilities, the thinking is we need to be able to ask the vendors to share their lists of dependencies. That way, the fear of customer or public ridicule might encourage the software producers to do a better job of upgrading dependencies.</p>
<p>However, this is an old and outmoded way of thinking. Modern applications and microservices use many dependencies. It’s not uncommon for a small application to use tens of dependencies, which in turn might use other dependencies. Soon the list of dependencies used by a single application can run into the hundreds. And if a modern application consists of a few hundred microservices, which is not uncommon, the list of dependencies can run into the thousands.</p>
<p>If a software vendor were to publish such an extensive list, how will the end users of that software really benefit? Yes, we can also ask the software vendor to publish which of the dependencies is vulnerable, and let’s say that list runs into the hundreds. Now what?</p>
<p>Clearly, having to upgrade hundreds of vulnerable dependencies is not a trivial task. A software vendor would be constantly deciding between adding new functionality that generates revenue and allows the company to stay ahead of its competitors versus upgrading dependencies that don’t do either.</p>
<p>If the government formalizes an SBOM mandate and starts to financially penalize vendors that have vulnerable dependencies, it is clear that given the complexity associated with upgrading dependencies the software vendors might choose to pay fines rather than risk losing revenue or competitive advantage in the market.</p>
<p>Revenue drives market capitalization, which in turn drives executive and employee compensation. Fines, as small as they are, have negligible impact on the bottom line. In a purely economic sense, the choice is fairly obvious.</p>
<p>In addition, software vendors typically do not want to publish lists of all their dependencies because that provides a lot of information to hackers and other bad actors as well as to competitors. It’s bad enough that cybercriminals are able to find vulnerabilities on their own. Providing lists of dependencies gives them even more possible resources to discover weaknesses.</p>
<p>Customers and users of the software, for their part, don’t want to know all the dependencies. What would they gain from studying a list of hundreds of dependencies? Rather, software vendors and their customers want to know which dependencies, if any, make the application vulnerable. That really is the key question.</p>
<p>Prioritizing software composition analysis (SCA) ensures that when dependencies are analyzed in the context of an application, the dependencies that make an application vulnerable can be dramatically reduced.</p>
<p>Instead of publishing a list of 1,000 dependencies, or 100 that are vulnerable, organizations can publish a far more manageable list in the single digits. That is a problem that organizations can much more easily deal with. Sometimes a software vendor can fix an issue without having to upgrade the dependency. For example, it can make changes in the code, which is not always possible if we are merely looking for the list of vulnerable dependencies.</p>
<p>There is no reason to disdain the concept of SBOM outright. By all means, let’s make the software vendors responsible for being transparent about what goes into their software products. Plenty of organizations have paid a steep price because of software vulnerabilities that could have been prevented in the form of data breaches and other cybersecurity attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s heartening to see the federal government take cybersecurity so seriously and propose ways to enhance the protection of applications and data.</p>
<p>However, let’s make SBOM specific to the list of dependencies that actually make the application vulnerable. This serves both the vendor and its customers by cutting directly to the sources of vulnerabilities that can do damage. That way, we can address the issues at hand without creating unnecessary burdens.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is rolling out a major update for its iOS smartphone app with new controls, improved management and cool visuals. Version 4.0 also gives you the choice between two different sized widgets for your iPhone home screen. As detailed by <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/558/tesla-releases-new-iphone-tesla-app-android-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Tesla Software Updates</em></a>, both feature the same information: the name of the car, battery percentage, location (or charging info), unlock status, an image of the vehicle and the time the information was last updated. Tesla previously had a &#8220;Today&#8221; extension for iOS that was nowhere near as comprehensive as the new widgets.</p>
<p>In terms of controls, you can send commands to your car immediately upon opening the app, instead of waiting for the vehicle to wake up. There&#8217;s also enhanced phone key support that essentially lets you unlock multiple Teslas.</p>
<p>An updated visual that should be immediately noticeable is the new 3D vehicle render. There are also new animations when you charge your car and in the climate and controls sections. Design-wise, Tesla has ditched the charging section and now displays that info when your car is plugged in. You can also view Supercharging history from within the app. While the speed limit, valet mode and sentry mode settings have been moved to a new category titled Security, which includes tips on how to use the Bluetooth, phone key and location services.</p>
<p>To sum up, this is the biggest update to the EV maker&#8217;s iOS app in a while. Recently, Tesla has mainly focused on providing bug fixes and improvements, outside of the introduction of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-powerwall-owners-can-now-help-balance-the-grid-in-california-052917432.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">Virtual Power Plant</a> enrolment in July.</p>

		Adi Levanon has been an early-stage VC for nearly a decade, with a strong focus on fintech investments since 2015, both in the U.S. and Israel. Currently, she is the Tel Aviv-based investor at <a href="https://flintcap.com/">Flint Capital</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Even with its vast local talent, it seems Israel still has many hurdles to overcome in order to become a global fintech hub. [ … ] Having that said, I don’t believe any of these obstacles will prevent Israel from generating disruptive global fintech startups that will become game-changing businesses.”</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3731717,00.html">wrote</a> that back in 2018, when I was determined to answer whether Israel had the potential to become a global fintech hub. Suffice to say, this prediction from three years ago has become a reality.</p>
<p>In 2019, Israeli fintech startups raised over $1.8 billion; in 2020, they were said to have raised $1.48 billion despite the pandemic. Just in the first quarter of 2021, Israeli fintech startups raised $1.1 billion, according to IVC Research Center and Meitar Law Offices.</p>
<p>It’s then no surprise that Israel now boasts over a dozen fintech unicorns in sectors such as payments, insurtech, lending, banking and more, some of which reached the desired status just in the beginning of 2021 —  like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">Melio</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/">Papaya Global</a>, which raised $110 million and $100 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve been fortunate to invest (both as a venture capitalist and personally) in successful early-stage fintech companies in the U.S., Israel and emerging markets  —  Alloy, Eave, MoneyLion, Migo, Unit, AcroCharge and more.</p>
<p>The major shifts and growth of fintech globally over these years has been largely due to advanced AI-based technologies, heightened regulatory scrutiny, a more innovative and adaptive approach among financial institutions to build partnerships with fintechs, and, of course, the COVID pandemic, which forced consumers to transact digitally.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed fintechs to become essential for business survival, acting as the main contributor of the rapid migration to digital payments.</p>
<p>So what is it about Israeli-founded fintech startups that stand out from their scaling neighbors across the pond? Israeli founders first and foremost have brought to the table a distinct perspective and understanding of where the gaps exist within their respective focus industries —  whether it was Hippo and Lemonade in the world of property and casualty insurance, Rapyd and Melio in the world of business-to-business payments, or Earnix and Personetics in the world of banking data and analytics.</p>
<p>This is even more compelling given that many of these Israeli founders did not grow within financial services, but rather recognized those gaps, built their know-how around the industry (in some cases by hiring or partnering with industry experts and advisers during their ideation phase, strengthening their knowledge and validation), then sought to build more innovative and customer-focused solutions than most financial institutions can offer.</p>
<p>Having this in mind, it is becoming clearer that the Israeli fintech industry has slowly transitioned into a mature ecosystem with a combination of local talent, which now has expertise from a multitude of local fintechs that have scaled to success; a more global network of banking and insurance partners that have recognized the Israeli fintech disruptors; and the smart fintech -focused venture capital to go along with it. It’s a combination that will continue to set up Israeli fintech founders for success.</p>
<p>In addition, a major contributor to the fintech industry comes from the technological side. It is never enough to reach unicorn status with just the tech on the back end.</p>
<p>What most likely differentiates Israeli fintech from other ecosystems is the strong technological barriers and infrastructure built from the ground up, which then, of course, leads to the ability to be more customized, compliant, secured, etc. If I had to bet on where I believe Israeli fintech startups could become market leaders, I’d go with the following.</p>
<h2>Voice-based transactions</h2>
<p>Voice technologies have come a long way over the years; where once you knew you were talking to a robot, now financial institutions and applications offer a fully automated experience that sounds and feels just like a company employee.</p>
<p>Israel has shown growing success in the world of voice tech, with companies like Gong.io providing insights for remote sales teams; Bonobo (acquired by Salesforce) offering insights from customer support calls, texts and other interactions; and Voca.ai (acquired by Snapchat) offering an automated support agent to replace the huge costs of maintaining call centers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI-powered voice transcription service Otter.ai is expanding its Otter Assistant feature for Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex. Otter.ai first released this feature for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/otter-ais-new-assistant-can-automatically-transcribe-your-zoom-meetings/">Zoom users earlier this year in May</a>. With this new integration, Otter Assistant can now join and transcribe meetings on more platforms, even if the Otter user is not attending the meeting.</p>
<p>The Otter Assistant automatically joins calendared meetings and records, takes notes and shares transcriptions with meeting participants. If a user decides to skip a meeting altogether, they catch up on the discussion through the recorded notes afterwards. The tool can also help in instances where you have overlapping meetings or larger meetings where only a portion of them are relevant to you.</p>
<p>To use the new tool, users need to synchronize their calendars with the service. The assistant will then automatically join all future meetings, where it appears in the meeting as a separate participant, for transparency’s sake.</p>
<p>“With more companies adapting to a hybrid work model where professionals work and take meetings in-office, at home, and on mobile, many are looking to Otter as a tool to improve team communication and collaboration,” said Otter.ai co-founder and CEO Sam Liang in <a href="https://blog.otter.ai/press-release-otter-assistant/">a statement</a>. “We’re excited to make using Otter even easier and more accessible no matter where or how people conduct and participate in meetings.”</p>
<p>The new integration will be handy for those who attend meetings across several platforms, as the tool can keep all of your meeting notes in one place. The Otter Assistant is available to Otter.ai Business users. The business tier starts at <a href="https://otter.ai/pricing">$20 per month</a> and includes features like two-factor authentication, advanced search, audio imports, custom vocabulary, shared speaker identification and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to easily manage compensation strategies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you haven’t noticed yet, the hiring market is a hot one &#8212; and getting more complicated as enterprise talent acquisition leaders face technology gaps while assessing candidates. This leads to difficulty in determining compensation.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/KjwTCTHPBd5v2jTeu?messageId=1wZPjR23diElFlfUU&amp;rn=gIsxWYIBSZulGdzlmcoNkI&amp;re=gIt92YuwWah12ZAh2YuVncjh2YlRnLsxWYoNmI&amp;sc=false">Compa</a>. The offer management platform provides “deal desk” software for recruiters to more easily manage their compensation strategies to create and communicate offers that are easy to understand and are unbiased.</p>
<p>Charlie Franklin, co-founder and CEO of Compa, told TechCrunch it was frustrating to lose a candidate at the compensation stage, so the company created its software to reduce the challenge of relying on crowdsourcing data or surveys to compare pay.</p>
<p>“Recruiters often lack the data and tools to figure out how much to pay people and communicate that effectively,” Franklin told TechCrunch. “We see talent acquisitions teams like a sales team. If you think of it from that perspective, they need to close a candidate, but to ask the recruiter to operate off of a spreadsheet slows that process down.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194156" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194156" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2194156" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg 3088w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Compa-cofounders.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194156" class="wp-caption-text">Compa co-founders, from left, Charlie Franklin, Joe Malandruccolo and Taylor Cone. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Compa</p></div></p>
<p>With Compa, recruiters can input pay expectations and compare recent offers and collaborate with other team members and hiring managers to reach pay consensus quicker. The software automates all of the market intelligence in real time and provides insights about compensation across similar industries and organizations.</p>
<p>The company, based in both California and Massachusetts, emerged from stealth Thursday with $3.9 million in seed funding led by Base10 Partners. Participation in the round also came from Crosscut Ventures and Acadian Ventures, as well as a group of strategic angel investors including 2.12 Angels, Oyster HR CEO Tony Jamous and Scout RFP co-founders Stan Garber and Alex Yakubovich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jamison Hill, partner at Base10 Partners, said via email his firm was doing research in the ESG “megatrend,” particularly looking for startups focused on compensation management, when it came across Compa.</p>
<p>He was attracted to the founders’ “clarity and conviction” on the company’s vision, their understanding of the pay gap in the market, how Compa’s solution would “create a new wave of smarter, more-data driven recruiting teams” and how it was enabling employers to use compensation and a positive offer management approach to differentiate itself from competitors.</p>
<p>“They deeply understand the nuances that come with enterprise-level HR teams and bring that expertise to every aspect of Compa&#8217;s product offering, which is why we believe Compa can emerge as a leader in this trend and chose to partner with this very special team,” Hill added.</p>
<p>Franklin, who previously led human resources M&amp;A at Workday, founded Compa last year with  Joe Malandruccolo, who was on the engineering side at Facebook and Oculus, and Taylor Cone, who has done innovation consulting for organizations like Stanford University.</p>
<p>The company was bootstrapped prior to going after the seed round and will use the capital to expand the team and create additional products that fit into its mission of “making compensation fair and competitive for everyone,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>Going forward, he adds that job offers and compensation need to catch up to how quickly the world is changing. As more people work remotely and companies want to attract a diverse workforce, compensation will be an important factor.</p>
<p>“This is a long-term trend we are seeing in HR — compensation becoming more transparent — not just a spreadsheet shared internally, but a transition from secretive to open and accountable, Franklin said. “Technology is catching up to that, and we have the ability to produce outcomes that drive differences in pay.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders Fund and Paradigm are leading an investment in a platform that&#8217;s aiming to wed music rights with NFTs, allowing user to buy shares of songs through the company&#8217;s marketplace, earning royalties as the music they&#8217;ve invested in gains popularity.</p>
<p>The venture, called <a href="https://royal.io/">Royal</a>, is led by Justin Blau, an EDM artist who performs under the name 3LAU, and JD Ross, a co-founder of home-buying startup Opendoor. Blau has been one of the more active and visible figures in the NFT community, launching a number of upstart efforts aimed at exploring how musicians can monetize their work through crypto markets. Blau says that as Covid cut off his ability to tour, he dug into NFTs full-time, aiming to find a way to flip the power dynamics on &#8220;platforms that were extracting all the value from creators.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span></p>
<p>Back in March, weeks before many would first hear about NFTs following the $69 million Beeple sale at Christies, Blau set his own record, selling a batch of custom songs and custom artwork for a collective $11.7 million worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Royal&#8217;s investment announcement comes just as a broader bull run for the NFT market seems to reach a fever pitch with investors dumping hundreds of million of dollars worth of cryptocurrencies into community NFT projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes. While visual artists interested in putting their digital works on the blockchain have seen a number of platforms spring up and mature in recent months to simplify the process of monetizing their art, there have been fewer efforts focused on musicians.</p>
<p>Paradigm and Founders Fund are leading a $16 million seed round in Royal, with participation from Atomic &#8212; where Ross was recently a General Partner. Ross&#8217;s fellow Opendoor co-founder Keith Rabois led the deal for Founders Fund.</p>

<p>The company isn&#8217;t sharing an awful lot about their launch or product plans, including when the platform will actually begin selling fractionalized assets, but it seems pretty clear the company will be heavily leveraging Blau&#8217;s music and position inside the music industry to bring early fans/investors to the platform. Users can sign-up for early access on the site currently.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As NFT startups chase more complex ownership splits that aim to help creators share their success with fans, there&#8217;s plenty of speculation taking off around how regulators will eventually treat them. While the ICO boom of 2017 led to plenty of founders receiving SEC letters alleging securities fraud, entrepreneurs in this wave seem to be working a little harder to avoid that outcome. Blau says that the startup&#8217;s team is working closely with legal counsel to ensure the startup is staying fully compliant.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s bigger challenge may be ensuring that democratizing access to buying up music rights actually benefits the fans of those artists or creates new fans for them, given the wide landscape of crypto speculators looking to diversify. That said, Blau notes there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement among the current ownership spread of music royalties, largely spread among labels, private equity groups and hedge funds.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;A true fan might want to own something way earlier than a speculator would even get wind of it,&#8221;Blau says. &#8220;Democratizing access to asset classes is a huge part of crypto’s future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jessica Ko was head of design at Google and then Opendoor, she realized that her teams spent about 90% of their time digging around Dropbox looking for assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, they’d find older versions. Or they couldn’t find what they were looking for. Or even worse, they’d accidentally pick the wrong asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was such a chaotic process,” Ko recalls. “Anyone could go in and alter things and change folder structures around. It was a total mess, and just continued like that because there was no alternative.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Opendoor grew in size, the problem became an even bigger one, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Designers were quitting because it was giving them so much anxiety,” Ko recalls. “Dropbox hadn’t solved it yet. Google Drive was not a good alternative either. Designers deal with files the most, and we’re exchanging files constantly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the frustration and stress the problem of file storage and sharing caused, not being able to locate the correct assets also led to errors, which in turn led to lots of money lost, according to Ko.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We spent a lot of money on photo shoots because we couldn&#8217;t find new things, or people would have to recreate designs,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, she said, designers weren’t the only ones who needed to access the assets. Finance teams were constantly needing them for things like creating pitch decks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2018, Ko left Opendoor to set about solving the problem she was tired of dealing with by creating file storage for modern design workflows and processes. Or put more simply, she wanted to build a new kind of cloud storage that would serve as an alternative to Dropbox and Google Drive “built by, and for, creatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, Ko (CEO) teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Zirbel (CTO) to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launch San Francisco-based </span><a href="https://www.playbook.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which she describes as the “Dropbox for designers,” to tackle the challenge. And today, the startup has emerged from stealth and announced it has raised $4 million in a seed funding round led by Founders Fund at a $20 million post-money valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors in the round include Abstract, Inovia, Maple, Basis Set, Backend, Wilson Sonsini and a number of angels, including Opendoor co-founder and CEO Eric Wu, Gusto co-founder Eddie Kim and SV Angel&#8217;s Beth Turner.</span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, Playbook claims it can automatically imports, tags, categorizes an organization&#8217;s entire media library, in minutes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When starting out, the first thing Playbook set out to do was attempt to reinvent the way folders exist for assets, with subfolders underneath. And then, the company set about trying to change the way people share files. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since so much is done over email and Slack these days, version control becomes even more difficult,” Ko told TechCrunch. So Playbook, she said, has built a storage system that can be accessed by all parties as opposed to just sending files via different channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, these assets have been dropped into what feels like a file cabinet,” Ko said. “But these days, sharing assets is much more collaborative and there’s different kinds of parties involved such as freelancers and contractors. So who is managing these files, and controlling the versions has become very complex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook offers 4TB of free storage, which Ko says is 266 times the free version of Google Storage and 2,000 times that of Dropbox</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The hope is that this encourages users to use its platform as an all-around creative hub without worrying about running out of storage space. It also a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">utomatically scans, organizes and tags files and has worked to make it easier to browse files and folders visually.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194268" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194268" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2194268 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0-Playbook-Team-e1629938420572.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194268" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Playbook</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Playbook opened a beta version of its product to the design community and got about 1,000 users in two months. People continued to sign up and the company at one point had to close the beta so that it could manage all the new users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it has about 10,000 users signed up in beta. Early users include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual freelancers to design teams at companies like Fast, Folx and Literati.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven-person company wants to focus on getting the product “right” before attempting to monetize and launch to enterprises (which will likely happen next year), Ko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Playbook is focused on the needs of freelancers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company believes that the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/07/freelance-work-grows-amid-covid-19-math-stats-game-hiring-in-demand.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponential growth of freelancers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post-pandemic means “cloud storage needs to be smarter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to first solve that use case, and unlock the problem from the bottom up,” Ko told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, another strategy behind that initial focus is that freelancers can also introduce Playbook to the companies and enterprises they work for, so the marketing then becomes built into the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can transfer assets and files through Playbook to their clients, who tend to adopt,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Playbook is helping manage over 2 million assets and says it has “hundreds of waitlist sign-ups” every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Zirbel said the startup wants to branch out into i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mage scanning, similarity, content detection, previewing and long-term cloud storage and tons of integrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are lots of interesting technology challenges when you focus on the creative side of cloud storage,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Fund’s John Luttig said when the firm first met Ko and Zirbel last year, it was “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear that they had a depth of understanding and thoughtfulness around file management” that his firm hadn’t seen before. Plus, in his view, there has been very little innovation in cloud storage since Dropbox launched in 2007. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The product leverages modern design, collaboration principles, and artificial intelligence to make file management much faster and easier,” he wrote via email. “Given their design-centric backgrounds, they’re extremely well-positioned to rethink the user experience for file systems from the ground up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playbook, he said, is able to leverage recent advancements in computer vision and design “to build a far better product to manage and share files.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">St. Louis-based grocery chain Schnucks (one of those “With a name like Smucker&#8217;s, it has to be good” situations, one imagines) <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/08/26/2287087/0/en/Schnuck-Markets-Becomes-World-s-First-Grocer-to-Deploy-Intelligence-Robots-Chainwide.html">announced this week</a> that it will be deploying technology from Simbe Robotics across its 111 U.S. locations.</p>
<p>The deal comes a year and a half into a global pandemic that has substantially increased interest in automation, particularly around essential businesses &#8212; a qualifier that certainly applies to grocery stores.</p>
<p>Simbe’s mobile robots provide inventory scanning, offering a constantly updating picture of what’s on the store shelves and what needs to be restocked. Anyone who’s ever worked retail can almost certainly tell you that doing inventory is one of the biggest headaches in the industry, often requiring hours-long shutdowns or overnight marathons to complete.</p>
<p>The &#8220;multi-year&#8221; chain-wide rollout comes four years after Schnucks first began piloting the tech. Over the years, the partnership has gradually expanded. Simbe says its shelf-scanning Tally robot is capable of reducing out of stock items by 20-30% and can detect 14 times more missing inventory than traditional human scanning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194489" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194489" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2194489" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/schnucks_simbe_03.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194489" class="wp-caption-text">Schnuck Markets deploys Tally robot by Simbe Robotics to its stores &#8211; bringing shelf insights for better shopping experience. Photographed on Friday, Aug. 13, 2021, in Des Peres, Mo. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Simbe</p></div></p>
<p>“By deploying Tally to all stores, we are fully operationalizing these insights into our supply chain and expanding our ability to leverage real-time data to make revenue impacting decisions,” Schnucks VP Dave Steck said in a release. “Tally has become an integral component of our stores, streamlining operations and ultimately creating a better store experience for our customers and teammates.”</p>
<p>A number of companies are working to automate the world of inventory scanning, including Brain Corp and Bossa Nova, though the latter was dealt a massive setback when Walmart ended a large contract at the end of 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Which terms come to mind when you think about SaaS?</p>
<p>&#8220;Solutions,&#8221; &#8220;cutting-edge,&#8221; &#8220;scalable&#8221; and &#8220;innovative&#8221; are just a sample of the overused jargon lurking around every corner of the techverse, with SaaS marketers the world over seemingly singing from the same hymn book.</p>
<p>Sadly for them, new research has proven that such jargon-heavy copy — along with unclear features and benefits — is deterring customers and cutting down conversions. Around 57% of users want to see improvements in the clarity and navigation of websites, suggesting that techspeak and unnecessarily complex UX are turning customers away at the door, according to <a href="https://www.creative-copywriter.net/saas-marketers-its-time-to-tune-up-your-2021-strategy">The SaaS Engine</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say SaaS marketers aren’t trying: Seventy percent of those surveyed have been making big adjustments to their websites, and 33% have updated their content. So how and why are they missing the mark?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			They say there’s no bigger slave to fashion than someone determined to avoid it, and SaaS marketing is no different. To truly stand out, you need to do thorough competitor analysis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are three common blunders that most SaaS marketers make time and again when it comes to clarity and high-converting content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not differentiating from competitors.</li>
<li>Not humanizing &#8220;tech talk.&#8221;</li>
<li>Not tuning their messaging to prospects’ stage of awareness at the appropriate stage of the funnel.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’re going to unpack what the research suggests and the steps you can take to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Blending into the competition</h2>
<p>It’s a jungle out there. But while camouflage might be key to surviving in the wild, in the crowded SaaS marketplace, it’s all about standing out. Let’s be honest: How many SaaS homepages have you visited that look the same? How many times have you read about &#8220;innovative tech-driven solutions that will revolutionize your workflow&#8221;?</p>
<p>The research has found that of those using SaaS at work, 76% are now on more platforms or using existing ones more intensively than last year. And as always, with increased demand comes a boom in competition, so it’s never been more important to stand out. Rather than imitating the same old phrases and copy your competitors are using, it&#8217;s time to reach your audience with originality, empathy and striking clarity.</p>
<p>But how do you do that?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Picsart COO Tammy Nam said it was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than $1 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://picsart.com/">Picsart</a> announced this morning that it has raised a $130 million round led by SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2. The new capital infusion pushes the company&#8217;s valuation north of the $1 billion mark, though it declined to get more specific.</p>
<p>Per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>, the company&#8217;s preceding round of capital, in 2019, valued the company at around $600 million. We can infer from the two figures that Picsart&#8217;s valuation went up materially in its latest round.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not incredibly hard to figure out why. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">chatted with the company earlier this year</a>, noting that it was over the $50 million ARR mark, and that the company expected to crest the $100 million ARR threshold this year. The company said today it has surpassed that goal. Precisely how far? The company would not disclose.</p>
<p>Picsart COO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammynam/">Tammy Nam</a> told TechCrunch in an interview this week that her company was now past a $100 million run rate, and that it was worth more than a flat $1.0 billion after the SoftBank round. That was the extent of our ability to mine her for details.</p>
<p>What we can say, then, is that the company is doing nine figures of revenue that start with one, and that it is worth ten figures that also start with a one. That gives Picsart a maximum revenue multiple of just under 20x, though we expect the correct figure is in the low tens.</p>
<p>What makes the Picsart news fun, apart from its constituent large numbers, is that its product is quite cool. That&#8217;s something that we can&#8217;t say about most unicorns that we write about here at TechCrunch. The company builds mobile and desktop image and video editing tools for consumers and professionals alike, which means that you have likely seen work created by its tools in the wild. And frankly, because they are something that anyone can use &#8212; unlike, say, HR-focused APIs or what have you &#8212; it&#8217;s a startup that feels more tangible than most.</p>
<p>Picsart provides both free and paid services. Its paid products include more images for users to work with &#8212; watermark removal and the like. The company also offers a teams-focused plan with multi-seat purchase options, though Nam said that because her team had not yet publicized the option to their user base, it&#8217;s too early to tell how the product is faring. It&#8217;s effectively in beta, she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More broadly, the company&#8217;s monetization efforts are succeeding. We can tell that from Picsart&#8217;s revenue growth. Happily, Nam provided a bit more context, saying that the company had millions of subscribers today. She sees more room for growing, explaining that if her company tripled its gross subscriber number, the resulting cohort would still be a &#8220;drop in the bucket&#8221; when compared to its active user tally. There again, Picscart was somewhat coy with the data. It previously said that it had reached 100 million monthly actives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">in October of 2017</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/31/creative-focused-app-picsart-hits-100m-maus-attracting-brands-tired-of-trolls/">130 million in 2019</a> and around 150 million earlier this year. Picsart would only say that it has <em>more</em> than 150 million today.</p>
<p>Turning to the company&#8217;s revenue mix between consumers and business users, Nam stressed that the dividing line between the two is especially blurry among Generation Z, which by our understanding is a key Picsart user demographic. That makes it difficult to parse the precise revenue mix at the company today. However, Nam told TechCrunch that its business revenue represented around 30% of total revenue in an interview earlier this year, which provides directional guidance for us today.</p>
<p>She also noted in our recent chat that business usage of Picsart was rising, as SMBs became increasingly digital in the COVID-19 era. How that shift in market demand will impact Picsart&#8217;s revenue mix over time should prove interesting.</p>
<p>So, what about an IPO? Sadly, that was likely just delayed. It&#8217;s great news for Picasart that it raised so much new capital, but for those of us hungry to get more S-1s, and more quickly, such large capital events can delay liquidity as the company in question wants to put the new funds to work.</p>
<p>Still, provided an even medium growth rate, we&#8217;d hazard that Picsart won&#8217;t struggle to match its final private valuation when it does file. We just want that to happen quickly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Airbnb announced on Thursday it will allow anyone with available space to sign up to provide housing for Afghan refugees. The new initiative aims to build upon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/airbnb-to-provide-free-temporary-housing-for-20000-afghan-refugees/">Airbnb’s initial commitment</a> to provide free temporary housing for 20,000 Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>The company says existing Airbnb hosts and anyone else can sign up to provide free or discounted stays to Afghan refugees through its dedicated <a href="https://www.airbnb.org/">website for emergency housing</a>. Airbnb notes it waives its fees on all refugee stays. For those who are unable to open up their homes but are still eager to help, Airbnb says they can aid the crisis by donating money to support housing for Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Airbnb announced its initial commitment to house 20,000 Afghan refugees and said the company will cover the costs for the housing, using funds from contributions to its nonprofit Airbnb.org and a specific Refugee Fund established by that division, as well as personal contributions from Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky himself.</p>

<p>“Since the announcement, we have received enormous interest from people within the Airbnb community and beyond looking for ways to support Airbnb and Airbnb.org’s work with partner organizations to house Afghan refugees. In many cases, we have heard from people who want to offer their space free of charge,” the company said <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/how-to-support-afghan-refugees/">in a statement.</a> “​​The response has been overwhelming and today we’re sharing more details on how people can help us expand on efforts to meet this unprecedented need for temporary, emergency stays for refugees arriving from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Airbnb.org and Airbnb are also extending support to the federal government, along with states and cities that have expressed interest in receiving refugees to help provide stays as needed.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s housing initiatives come at a time when tens of thousands of people are attempting to flee Afghanistan. Amid the crisis, companies and governments are facing increasing pressure to aid refugees fleeing the country. There are currently nearly 2.5 million registered refugees from Afghanistan, according to the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/afghanistan.html">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
