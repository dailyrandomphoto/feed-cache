										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About a decade ago, I remember having a conversation with a friend about big data. At the time, we both agreed that it was the purview of large companies like Facebook, Yahoo and Google, and not something most companies would have to worry about.</p>
<p>As it turned out, we were both wrong. Within a short time, everyone would be dealing with big data. In fact, it turns out that huge amounts of data are the fuel of machine learning applications, something my friend and I didn&#8217;t foresee.</p>
<p>Frameworks were already emerging like Hadoop and Spark and concepts like the data warehouses were evolving. This was fine when it involved structured data like credit card info, but data warehouses weren&#8217;t designed for unstructured data you needed to build machine learning algorithms, and the concept of the data lake developed as a way to take unprocessed data and store until needed. It wasn&#8217;t sitting neatly in shelves in warehouses all labeled and organized, it was more amorphous and raw.</p>
<p>Over time, this idea caught the attention of the cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. What&#8217;s more, it caught the attention of investors as companies like Snowflake and Databricks built substantial companies on the data lake concept.</p>
<p>Even as that was happening startup founders began to identify other adjacent problems to attack like moving data into the data lake, cleaning it, processing it and funneling to applications and algorithms that could actually make use of that data. As this was happening, data science advanced outside of academia and became more mainstream inside businesses.</p>
<p>At that point there was a whole new modern ecosystem and when something like that happens, ideas develop, companies are built and investors come. We spoke to nine investors about the data lake idea and why they are so intrigued by it, the role of the cloud companies in this space, how an investor finds new companies in a maturing market and where the opportunities and challenges are in this lucrative area.</p>
<p>To learn about all of this, we queried the following investors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caryn-marooney/">Caryn Marooney</a>, general partner, Coatue Management</li>
<li>Dharmesh Thakker, general partner, <a href="https://www.battery.com/our-team/member/dharmesh-thakker/">Battery Ventures</a></li>
<li>Casey Aylward, principal, <a href="https://www.costanoavc.com/team-member/casey-aylward/">Costanoa Ventures</a></li>
<li>Derek Zanutto, general partner, <a href="https://capitalg.com/team/derek-zanutto/">CapitalG</a></li>
<li>Navin Chaddha, managing director, <a href="https://www.mayfield.com/team/navin-chaddha/">Mayfield</a></li>
<li>Jon Lehr, co-founder and general partner, <a href="https://www.work-bench.com/team">Work-Bench</a></li>
<li>Peter Wagner, founding partner, <a href="https://www.wing.vc/people/peter-wagner">Wing Ventures</a></li>
<li>Nicole Priel, managing director, <a href="https://www.ibexinvestors.com/#leadership">Ibex Ventures</a></li>
<li>Ilya Sukah, partner, <a href="https://matrixpartners.com/team/ilya-sukhar/">Matrix Partners</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Where are the opportunities for startups in the data lakes space with players like Snowflake and the cloud infrastructure vendors so firmly established?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Caryn Marooney:</strong> The data market is very large, driven by the opportunity to unlock value through digital transformation. Both the data lake and data warehouse architectures will be important over the long term because they solve different needs.</p>
<p>For established companies (think big banks, large brands) with significant existing data infrastructure, moving all their data to a data warehouse can be expensive and time consuming. For these companies, the data lake can be a good solution because it enables optionality and federated queries across data sources.</p>
<p><strong>Dharmesh Thakker: </strong>Databricks (which Battery has invested in) and Snowflake have certainly become household names in the data lake and warehouse markets, respectively. But technical requirements and business needs are constantly shifting in these markets &#8212; and it’s important for both companies to continue to invest aggressively to maintain a competitive edge. They will have to keep innovating to continue to succeed.</p>
<p>Regardless of how this plays out, we feel excited about the ecosystem that’s emerging around these players (and others) given the massive data sprawl that’s occurring across cloud and on-premise workloads, and around a variety of data-storage vendors. We think there is a significant opportunity for vendors to continue to emerge as “unification layers” between data sources and different types of end users (including data scientists, data engineers, business analysts and others) in the form of integration middleware (cloud ELT vendors); real-time streaming and analytics; data governance and management; data security; and data monitoring. These markets shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<p><strong>Casey Aylward: </strong>There are a handful of big opportunities in the data lake space even with many established cloud infrastructure players in the space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business intelligence/analytics/SQL may end up converging with machine learning/code like Scala or Python in certain products, but these domains have different end users and communities, programming language preferences and technical skills. Generally, architectural lock-ins are a big point of fear within core infrastructure. This is true for end users with their cloud providers, storage solutions, compute engines, etc. Solutions will be heterogeneous because of that and technology that enables this flexibility will be important.</li>
<li>As data moves around today, it is being reprocessed in each platform, which at scale is inefficient and expensive. There is an opportunity to build technology that allows users to move data around without rewriting transformations, data pipelines and stored procedures.</li>
<li>Finally, we&#8217;re seeing more traction around general data processing frameworks that are not MapReduce under the hood, especially in the Python data science ecosystem. This is a transition from Hadoop or even Spark, since they aren’t always best suited for unstructured, more modern algorithms.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[However, finding funding for startups is still a “difficult task today” said one, as the ecosystem suffers from a lack of "scale capital" for later rounds.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We surveyed five investors from the Brussels, Belgium ecosystem, and overall the mood was upbeat.</p>
<p>Investors are backing companies in smart living, life sciences (“a really promising sector for Belgium”), B2B, &#8220;industry 4.0,&#8221; fintech, mobility, health and music tech. Food tech appears “an overcrowded space.” Another says: “COVID confirmed our strategy to invest in local companies and with a sector focus on smart living life science and tech.”</p>
<p>Belgium has a “dynamic ecosystem of health actors, from biotech firms, universities and startups and scaleups. We follow the #BeHealth initiative, which unites the various parts of the Belgian health sector.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Belgium is “not a market for B2C startups” as it has a “small but complex market with different regions/cultures/languages.” They are focusing on Belgium and neighboring countries for investing.</p>
<p>However, finding funding for startups is still a “difficult task today” said one, as it suffers from a lack of &#8220;scale capital&#8221; for later rounds.</p>
<p>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in the city? “As a well-educated environment, multicultural, multilingual,” says one. “The ecosystem is very dynamic, with great opportunities. While valuations are usually lower compared to other hubs in Europe, there is quite some money available on the market,” says another.</p>
<p>Brussels’ geography makes it “very well-connected to Europe and international by nature.” It is multicultural and multilingual, so as a result startups position themselves for international expansion, “whether first to France or the Netherlands or beyond. For investors that are scoping opportunities in Belgium, they should recognize that Belgian startups are well-suited for international growth.”</p>
<p>As a small and very dense country, Belgium “already has a distributed founder geography.”</p>
<p>Investors have also been advising companies “to make sure that they have enough cash to last until the end of next 2021 at least.”</p>

Smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Univercells — Series C.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
More startups needed in the smart living sector. In general, companies with international ambitions maintaining local sticky jobs.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Daring entrepreneurs within growing markets.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We are wary of blockchain and crypto currencies.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
More than 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Life sciences, including biotech, is a really promising sector for Belgium. On the contrary, Belgium is not a market for B2C startups (small but complex market with different regions/cultures/languages).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
They feel Brussels is one of the main tech hubs in Belgium. Though the private equity and risk-on mentality is still not here. Finding funding for startups is still a difficult task today.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t think it will have a substantial impact, as many startups were already favoring remote work and flexible working hours.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Definitely travel and hospitality (part of smart living). It suffered a lot. But it&#8217;s a good time to invest. It&#8217;s an opportunity for startups to rethink their model and challenge the way they were seeing things before.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 confirmed our strategy was right … to focus on local competitiveness in the backbones of our economy: smart living, life sciences and tech. But within each sector, each company may be impacted differently. So a case-by-case analysis and in-depth due diligence is a necessity more than ever. Our advice to startups is to consider this environment will stay for another year and to plan the cash flows very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The last lockdown giving much more freedom to companies to continue to operate and witness that many of them adapted their way of working to stay operational.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.univercells.com">Univercells</a> Series C.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
More companies active in smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Blockchain and crypto.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Fintech is doing well in Brussels. We like an Antwerp mortgage B2B fintech: <a href="https://www.opercredits.com/">Oper</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
As a well-educated multicultural, multilingual environment.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Most startups are already used to working remotely so the impact for the hubs is less, as they and their clients proved able to work elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?</strong><br />
Travel and hospitality will suffer a lot in this COVID crisis. Life sciences are well-positioned to address the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID confirmed our strategy to invest in local companies and with a sector focus on smart living, life sciences and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
In medtech, essential medical intervention some green shoots benefit from the crisis.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The last lockdown pushed companies to adapt their business model and to focus on the new situation.</p>
<h2>Alexandre Dutoit, partner, ScaleFund</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
We aim at bridging the equity gap between seed rounds and Series A.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Kaspard, a silver economy company having developed a fall-detection technology.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We like B2B. Industry 4.0 type of deals lack a bit in our opinion.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Above all, we need a great team. Then we want to see some commercial traction, being POCs, first contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Food tech appears to us as an overcrowded space. A lot of B2C entrepreneurs are doing &#8220;more of the same.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We focus on Belgium and neighboring countries.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Biotech is definitely a hit in Belgium. Fintech and music tech are also growing.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The ecosystem is very dynamic, with great opportunities. While valuations are usually lower compared to other hubs in Europe, there is quite some money available on the market.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t see that coming, especially as entrepreneurs like to network, share experiences and be in an emulative environment.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong></p>
<p>Very few, as great teams are able to adapt. We have in our portfolio a company closely tied to events that has been able to rethink its business model and is now even more profitable compared to before the crises. Besides, companies that foster remote work or can install service at a distance will be short-term winners.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID has not impacted our strategy. Entrepreneurs are afraid of the uncertainty and lack of perspective. We encourage them to prepare themselves for the next opened window and to work on tech and processes, while reassuring them on the financing side.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Utopix, a startup linked to the event industry, has been able to rethink its business model as their sales were falling down. They have down their best month ever since then.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
I have seen hope after the summer period when companies were angry to do business again. Unfortunately, that hasn&#8217;t lasted very long. We try to remain positive and focus on important things.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Brussels is a growing scene for startups, very well-connected to Europe and international by nature.</p>
<h2>Olivier de Duve, partner, Inventures Investment Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
At Inventures, we invest in a range of startups that have strong financial returns and a measurable social and environmental impact. Looking to 2021, we’re most excited about the mobility sector, HR tech, the blue economy (investing in technologies around water and ocean health) and the circular economy. These sectors started to grow rapidly in Europe, and we’re excited to source some great deals in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We just led a round in MySkillCamp, a Belgian HR tech company that equips SMEs and corporates with an adaptable platform for employee learning. MySkillCamp has been stunning us with their rapid growth, even during the pandemic, and it’s a testament to the fact that companies need solutions for upskilling and reskilling their workforce.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I’ll flip this question to be investor-centric. We’d really like to see more impact venture capital firms that are active in the Series B and beyond stage in Europe. For now, the largest impact VCs are concentrated in the US — having that source of capital here in Brussels or in neighboring ecosystems will help earlier-stage European VCs continue to scale and support their portfolio companies in later rounds. Having that access to capital is key for making a sustainable ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Our investment thesis is to find startups that are financially strong and tackle one of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Broadly that has meant companies in health, mobility, renewable energy, climate and more. As we’re rounding out our second fund, our next investment has to hit our sweet spot of clear commercial traction, a stellar team and solid plans for scaling internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Several markets are oversaturated like shared light vehicle scooters or telemedicine solutions. D2C medical devices is also a tough market to break into. Given the pandemic situation, startups active in the recreational sector like tourism and sport are struggling more than ever. All products or services that are not digital are less resilient and will need to shift as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
About half of our startups are coming from Belgium. We’ve historically invested in the U.K., France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, however we’re open to investing across the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Two sectors that come to mind are mobility and health. Belgium is a hyperconnected country, and mobility startups that address user needs for a more sustainable and efficient transportation will do well here. As for health, Belgium has a dynamic ecosystem of health actors, from biotech firms, universities, and startups and scaleups. We follow the #BeHealth initiative, which unites the various parts of the Belgian health sector. One company that we wanted to highlight is Citizen Lab — they are a digital democracy platform that helps local governments organize voting, participatory budgeting and more. They’re setting the conversation around civic tech and we’re so excited to see what the founders Wietse Van Ransbeeck and Aline Muylaert have in store for 2021.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Belgium is a multicultural, multilingual country — so startups that are grown here naturally are positioning themselves for international expansion, whether first to France or the Netherlands or beyond. For investors that are scoping opportunities in Belgium, they should recognize that Belgian startups are well-suited for international growth and a role that they could play as investors is helping to introduce Belgian startups to other markets.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
As a small and very dense country, Belgium already has a distributed founder geography. In Brussels we have Co.Station, which is home to dozens of startups. However, we also see strong growth in innovation coming from Leuven, Ghent, Antwerp, Liege — and these cities are maximum two hours away by train. Our latest investment, MySkillCamp, for example, is based in Tournai, with an office in Brussels.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
We found out in our portfolio that companies are quite resilient to the crisis because they are addressing societal issues like health, climate and energy. SaaS companies or other digital services are also less exposed, which points out that digitalization is key to survive. Companies that are highly dependent on large governmental contracts could be more exposed to shifts in spending patterns due to COVID.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy so much as our post-investment strategy. Since the pandemic started, we’ve been “all hands on deck” with helping our portfolio companies weather the storm — from organizing new fundraising to scoping out new markets and helping on strategic growth projects. We’ve been advising our companies to make sure that they have enough cash to last until the end of next 2021 at least. What we’re seeing is that contracts are taking longer to be signed, especially for our companies looking to partner with governments that are more cash strapped and limited because of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Definitely! On the ecosystem level, we’ve seen a lot of fundraising activity in the last six months, particularly in the health and biotech sector — one example of that is Belgium-based Univercells. For our portfolio, we’ve seen that tools that serve governments and the transition to a more digital economy has created enormous opportunities for our B2B and B2G companies to thrive during this time.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
A few moments have given us hope during 2020. Seeing the racial reckoning in the U.S. spark conversations in Europe about justice and D&amp;I has given me a lot of hope around the role of the venture capital and startup sector in creating a more equal society. Initiatives like Diversity VC are helping us to do that. Also, the sheer number of startups with climate benefits, from cultured meat to sustainable packaging and more, has showcased the financial viability and the demand for expanding the world’s options for sustainability — another large societal challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Belgium is home to a vibrant, active and fast-growing startup scene!</p>

<h2>Will ride-hailing profits ever come?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1996010" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996010" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1996010" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-ORNG.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1996010" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.nigelsussman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nigel Sussman <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Before the pandemic began, I took about seven or eight hailed rides each month. Since I began physically distancing from others to stem the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020, I&#8217;ve taken exactly <strong>10 hailed rides</strong>.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but last year, Uber and Lyft both reported steep revenue losses as travelers hunkered down at home. Today, Alex Wilhelm says both transportation platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">plan to reach adjusted profitability by Q4 2021</a>.</p>
<p>He unpacked the numbers &#8220;to see if what the two companies are dangling in front of investors is worth desiring.&#8221; Since he usually doesn&#8217;t focus on publicly traded stocks, I asked Alex why he focused on Uber and Lyft today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Utter confusion,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investors have bid up their stocks like the two companies are crushing the game, instead of playing a game with their numbers to reach some sort of profit in the future,&#8221; Alex explained. &#8220;The stock market makes no sense, but this is one of the weirder things.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the theater, a &#8220;four-hander&#8221; is a play that was written for four actors.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m appropriating the term to describe this roundup by Greg Kumparak, Natasha Mascarenhas, Alex Wilhelm and Jonathan Shieber that recaps their favorite startups from Techstars accelerators.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/techcrunchs-favorites-from-techstars-boston-chicago-and-workforce-accelerators/">The quartet selected four startups each</a> from Chicago, Boston and Techstars Workplace Development.</p>
<p>&#8220;As always, these are just our favorites, but don’t just take our word for it. Dig into the pitches yourself, as there’s never a bad time to check out some super-early-stage startups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neoinsurance company Metromile began trading publicly this week after it combined with a special purpose acquisition company.</p>
<p>Metromile will likely be one of 2021&#8217;s many SPAC-led debuts, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/as-more-insurtech-offerings-loom-ceo-dan-preston-discusses-metromiles-spac-led-debut/">Alex interviewed CEO Dan Preston</a> to learn more about the process and what he learned along the way.</p>
<p>A notable takeaway: &#8220;Preston said SPACs are designed for a specific class of company; namely those that want or need to share a bit more story when they go public.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have a hard time envisioning all of the hurdles deep tech founders must overcome before they can land their first paying customer.</p>
<p>How do you sustainably scale a company that probably doesn&#8217;t have revenue and isn&#8217;t likely to for the foreseeable future? How big is the TAM for an unproven product in a marketplace that&#8217;s still taking shape?</p>
<p>Vin Lingathoti, a partner at Cambridge Innovation Capital, says entrepreneurs operating in this space face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/commercializing-deep-tech-startups-a-practical-guide-for-founders-and-investors/">a unique set of challenges</a> when it comes to managing growth and risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often these founders with Ph.D.s and postdocs find it hard to accept their weaknesses, especially in nontechnical areas such as marketing, sales, HR, etc.,&#8221; says Lingathoti.</p>

<p>This week, auto insurance startup Metromile completed its combination with SPAC INSU Acquisition Corp. II.</p>
<p>Last Friday, health insurance company Oscar Health announced its plans to launch an initial public offering.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Past performance is no guarantee of future results, but using 2020 debuts by neoinsurance firms Lemonade and Root as a reference point, Alex says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">the IPO window is wide open for other players</a> in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the companies in our group are pretty good at adding customers to their businesses,&#8221; he found.</p>

<p>The people who produce viral TikTok duets, in-demand Substack newsletters and popular YouTube channels are doing what they love. And the money is following them.</p>
<p>Many of these emerging stars have become media personalities with full-fledged production and distribution teams, giving rise to what one investor described as &#8220;the enterprise layer of the creator economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>More VCs are backing startups that help these digital creators monetize, produce, analyze and distribute content.</p>

<p>Simple agreements for future equity are an increasingly popular way for startups to raise funds quickly, but &#8220;they don’t generate the same paperwork exhaust,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Alex Wilhelm noted this week</a>.</p>
<p>This creates cognitive dissonance: Investors see a hot market, while people who rely on public data (like journalists) get a different picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;SAFEs have effectively pushed a lot of public signal regarding seed deals, and even smaller rounds, underground,&#8221; says Alex.</p>

<p>Many enterprise companies were snapping up container security startups before the pandemic began, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/container-security-acquisitions-increase-as-companies-accelerate-shift-to-cloud/">but the pace has picked up</a>, reports Ron Miller.</p>
<p>The growing number of companies going cloud-native is creating security challenges; the containers that package microservices must be correctly configured and secured, which can get complicated quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisitions we are seeing now are filling gaps in the portfolio of security capabilities offered by the larger companies,&#8221; says Yoav Leitersdorf, managing partner at YL Ventures.</p>

<p>In December 2019, Alex Wilhelm began reporting on startups that had reached the $100M ARR mark. A year later, he decided to reframe his focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly what we managed was to collect a bucket of companies that were about to go public,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Since then, he has recalibrated his sights. In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/two-50m-ish-arr-companies-talk-growth-and-plans-for-the-coming-quarters/">the latest entry of a new series focusing on &#8220;$50M-ish&#8221; companies</a>, he studies SimpleNexus, which offers digital mortgage software, and photo-editing service PicsArt.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Danny Crichton filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/softbank-and-the-late-stage-venture-capital-j-curve/">a column about Softbank&#8217;s Vision Fund</a> that tried to answer a question he asked in 2017: &#8220;What does a return profile look like at such a late stage of investment?&#8221;</p>
<p>Softbank&#8217;s recent earnings report shows that its $680 million bet on DoorDash paid off handsomely, bringing back $9 billion. Compared to its competition, &#8220;the fund is actually doing quite decent right now,&#8221; he wrote. But Softbank has invested $66 billion in 74 unexited 74 companies that are worth $65.2 billion today.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;SoftBank quietly chopped half of the performance fees for its VC managers, from $5B to $2.5B, which led us to ask: are the best investments in the fund already in SoftBank’s rearview mirror? One upshot: WeWork seems to have turned something of a corner, with some improvements in its debt profile portending more positive news post-COVID-19.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tony Florence isn&#8217;t as well known to the public as other top investors like Bill Gurley or Marc Andreessen, but he&#8217;s someone who founders with SaaS and especially marketplace e-commerce companies know &#8212; or should. He&#8217;s responsible for the global tech investing activities for NEA, one of the world&#8217;s biggest venture firms in terms of assets under management (it closed its newest fund with $3.6 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/nea-venture-capitals-quiet-giant-closes-on-3-6-billion/">last year</a>).</p>
<p>Florence has also been involved with a long list of e-commerce brands to break through, including Jet, Gilt, Goop, Casper, Letgo, and Moda Operandi.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because we talked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/maisonette-is-becoming-a-go-to-brand-for-fashion-conscious-families-heres-the-strategy/">earlier this week</a> with one of his newer e-commerce bets, <a href="https://www.maisonette.com/">Maisonette</a>, that we wanted to ask him about brand building more than a year into a pandemic that has changed the world in both fleeting and permanent ways. We wound up talking about how customer acquisition has changed; what he thinks of the growing number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">companies</a> trying to roll up third-party sellers on Amazon; and how upstarts can maintain momentum when even younger companies become a shiny new fascination for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Note: one topic that he couldn&#8217;t and wouldn&#8217;t comment on is the future of one founder who Florence has backed twice, Marc Lore, who stepped down from Walmart last month to begin building what he <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/1/15/22232033/marc-lore-walmart-leaving-jet-city-future-capitalism">recently told Vox</a> is a multi-decade project to build “a city of the future.” (More on this to come, evidently.)</p>
<p>Part of our chat with Florence, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows:</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve funded a number of very different businesses that have managed to grow even as Amazon has eaten up more of the retail market. Is there any sector or vertical you wouldn&#8217;t back because of the company?</strong></p>
<p>TF: You have to be thoughtful about Amazon. I wouldn&#8217;t say there&#8217;s one particular area that you either can ignore or feel like you&#8217;re completely comfortable and open to, given the scale of their platform. At the same time, there are founding principles and fundamentals that we think about as they relate to companies being able to compete and operate successfully.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And these are what? You&#8217;ve backed Marc Lore, Philip Krim (of Casper), Sylvana and Luisana of Maisonette. Do they have something in common?</strong></p>
<p>TF:  Sometimes [founders] come at the problem organically; they&#8217;re living it [and want to solve it]. Other times, somebody like Marc sees a business opportunity and just attacks it. But there are commonalities. These are folks who are very customer centric, who are focused on good, fundamental unit economics, and who are obsessive about their people, their teams. It takes a village to build a young successful company, and all of those founders you mentioned are great at recruiting world-class people. There&#8217;s a sense of vision and mission and culture.</p>
<p>When you wake up and decide to do something, the majority of people you talk to just want to tell you the reasons why it can&#8217;t work, so it also takes a certain [wherewithal] to have such conviction around what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re kind of all in on it, and you&#8217;re going to break through no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Maisonette was going to open a brick-and-mortar store but put a pin in that plan because of COVID. Will we go back to seeing direct-to-consumer brands opening real-world locations when this is over? Has the pandemic permanently changed that calculation?</strong></p>
<p>TF: Leading up to the pandemic, a lot of the young DTC companies that were direct-to-consumer brands, and even the traditional e-commerce marketplaces, were experimenting with offline. Some of it was out of necessity, frankly. Sometimes [customer acquisition costs] became so expensive that it was actually cheaper for them to go offline. In other cases, it was done because the customer wanted that closed loop experience, as with [mattress maker] Casper.</p>
<p>A lot of companies [opened these stores] in a contained way and it worked really well. It&#8217;s very accretive financially to the overall business contribution, margin wise. It was accretive for the overall customer experience. And in many cases, it didn&#8217;t cannibalize anything. It just expanded the [total addressable market].</p>
<p>We&#8217;re spending a lot of time right now continuing to think through what are the permanent changes that are going to come out of the pandemic, but I would say the omnichannel model has really has started to take shape and succeed if you look at big retailers like Walmart and Target, so I think there will be an omnichannel dynamic to many of these companies that we&#8217;re talking about. Also, over the last 12 months, the cost of acquisition and the efficacy of marketing has swung back in the favor of these young companies. It&#8217;s improved to a point where we don&#8217;t really even need to think about offline.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I know it had become expensive to acquire customers digitally because it was so crowded out there. Did it become less crowded?</strong></p>
<p>TF: There were very few platforms that these companies could use pre pandemic that weren&#8217;t oversaturated . . . it was just very competitive, and that would bid up the cost of acquisition. In the last 12 months, you&#8217;ve seen big parts of that market go away. With airlines and financial services and a lot of the spend going way down, it&#8217;s become a lot cheaper for companies to market digitally.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Still, it feels at times that it&#8217;s hard to maintain a brand&#8217;s momentum over time; there&#8217;s always some new outfit nipping at its heels. How does a brand keep itself fresh and relevant in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>TF: There&#8217;s a hits dynamic &#8212; a fad dynamic &#8212; in the consumer space, so that&#8217;s always a challenge. You [compete by] continually reinventing and adding [to your offerings]. You see that in social categories, you see that in marketplaces [where they add] managed services and other components [like] payments, and you clearly see it in the way some of the direct-to-consumer companies continue to add new products to the mix.</p>
<p>You focus on the core aspects of your brand and its mission and vision and make sure that the customers really feel that. There&#8217;s a community dynamic that has really occurred the last four or five years around e-commerce companies. Glossier is a great example of a company that built a great community around a core set of product offerings, and that has really propelled that company beyond its core customer customer base.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a contextual commerce opportunity. Goop is a great example this; Gwyneth [Paltrow] brilliantly came up with [an effective way] to merge content and commerce, and that&#8217;s something a lot of companies in the commerce space have started to invest in.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Content, community and not necessarily speed, so focusing on what Amazon does not. Can I ask: do you think Amazon needs to be reigned in?</strong></p>
<p>TF: If you&#8217;re competing with them [in the] cloud market or a commerce market, they&#8217;re a very formidable competitor, and you got to take them very, very seriously. They&#8217;re at a scale that&#8217;s just incredibly impressive. But I do think you&#8217;re seeing a lot of innovation around the edges and companies finding areas that Amazon maybe can&#8217;t focus on or isn&#8217;t focusing on.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you think of these Amazon Marketplace roll-ups that we&#8217;re seeing? There&#8217;s been at least a half of dozen of them already, including Thrasio, which announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/">$750 million</a> this week. All are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/">raising money</a> hand over first.</strong></p>
<p>TF: We haven&#8217;t made an investment in the area, though we&#8217;re watching very closely. It can be a very capital intensive strategy to execute on because you&#8217;re buying brands and then bringing them onto the platform to consolidate and grow, but there&#8217;s just an enormous long tail to the e-commerce space and this is an opportunity to consolidate that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Like, an infinite opportunity? How many roll-ups can the market support?</strong></p>
<p>TFL I do think that we&#8217;ll see a handful of these companies get to decent scale. The question will be whether you&#8217;ve got more of an arbitrage going on [by] buying companies and generating synergies or there&#8217;s some fundamental bigger breakthrough. If you could use AI [and] machine learning to understand how to better serve customers and think about customer acquisition a little bit better, that would be really interesting. If there are real economies of scale to the supply chains [or] baseline infrastructure, that would certainly be interesting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early on. It remains to be seen how this is gonna play out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chronic allergy sufferers know well the daily discomfort of seasonal allergies and environmental allergies. They also likely know about allergy shots &#8212; the treatment that requires you to go into an office to get shots on a weekly or monthly basis. But there is a lesser-known treatment, allergy drops, that requires a bit less effort. <a href="https://www.wyndly.com/">Wyndly</a>, a startup participating in Y Combinator&#8217;s current batch, aims to make allergy drops more accessible to people.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, Dr. Manan Shah, an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, throat doctor), would have his patients come in for an evaluation and then prescribe them personalized allergy drops to train their immune system to fight off allergy triggers.  When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Shah, began treating his patients suffering from allergies via telemedicine. That went well so Dr. Shah and his cousin, Aakash Shah, took their idea to Y Combinator. They showed their idea was working well in Denver, Colorado but wanted help taking it nationwide.</p>
<p>Through Wyndly, Dr. Shah can conduct both allergy testing and treatment via telemedicine. Unlike allergy shots, allergy drops can be taken at home. Wyndly aims to treat environmental allergies, like cats, dogs, dust mites, mold, pollen, trees, grasses and weeds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Most people don’t realize there is this other option,&#8221; Dr. Shah said. &#8220;I think most people think the only option for allergies are shots or taking antihistamines every day. we educate people there is this wonderful therapy and we can make it available to you in the most convenient way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Wyndly works by first evaluating a patient&#8217;s allergies. Patients can either submit a recent allergy test to Wyndly, or take Wyndly&#8217;s at-home finger prick test. Next, Wyndly prepares personalized allergy drops for the patient and sends a vial to the patient&#8217;s home. Then, at some point during the day, patients take five drops under the tongue. Dr. Shah said most patients see a decrease in their symptoms after taking these drops daily for six months.</p>
<p>Wyndly costs $99 per month for allergy drop treatment, which could come out to around $594 in total, if a patient takes them for six months. If you become a patient, the allergy test costs $0 but if you don&#8217;t become a patient, the test costs $200.</p>
<p>While allergy drops are easy to take, there&#8217;s a caveat. Insurance companies typically do not cover the cost of the treatment, while they generally do for allergy shots. But Wyndly says it aims to be the same cost as what someone would pay for insurance-covered allergy shots plus co-pays.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that these allergy drops are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. While they are made using the same medications that are FDA-approved for allergy shots, the compounded medication is not itself approved and regulated by the FDA, Dr. Shah said.</p>
<p>Down the road, Wyndly may look to treat food allergies but Shah says there&#8217;s not enough data about its safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to see a little more research and for the field to reach a consensus on safety,&#8221; Shah said. &#8220;We hope to do food in the future if it ends up being proven to be really effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wyndly is has been in Y Combinator for a little over a month now and has been slowly expanding its offerings. Through partnerships with physicians, Wyndly is able to offer its services in 38 states throughout the country. By the end of 2022, Wyndly hopes to be in all 50 states.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This week on Extra Crunch Live, Busque and Senkut discussed Guideline's Series B pitch deck — which Senkut described as a "role model" — and how they built trust over time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even though Kevin Busque is a co-founder of TaskRabbit, he didn&#8217;t get the response he was hoping for the first time he pitched his new venture to Felicis Ventures&#8217; Aydin Senkut. Nonetheless, he said the outcome was one of the best things that could have happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of glad that he didn&#8217;t invest at the time because it really forced me to take a hard look at what we were doing and really enabled us to become Guideline,&#8221; said Busque. &#8220;That seed round was an absolute slog. I think I spent seven or eight months trying to raise a round for a product that didn&#8217;t exist, going purely on vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, that idea evolved into Guideline, which describes itself as &#8220;a full-service, full-stack 401(k) plan&#8221; for small businesses. Eventually, Senkut did write a check — Felicis led Guideline&#8217;s $15 million Series B round. Today, Guideline has more than 16,000 businesses across 60+ cities, with more than $3.2 billion in assets under management. The company has raised nearly $140 million.</p>
<p>This week on Extra Crunch Live, Busque and Senkut discussed Guideline&#8217;s Series B pitch deck — which Senkut described as a &#8220;role model&#8221; — and how they built trust over time.</p>
<p>The duo also offered candid, actionable feedback on pitch decks that were submitted by Extra Crunch Live audience members. (By the way, you can submit your pitch deck to be featured on a future episode using this link <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">right here</a>.)</p>
<p>We’ve included highlights below as well as the full video of our conversation.</p>
<p>We record new episodes of Extra Crunch Live each Wednesday at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST/8 p.m. GMT. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/check-out-the-amazing-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-february/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Check out the February schedule here.</a></p>
<h2>Episode breakdown:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How they met: 1:30</li>
<li>Building trust: 11:30</li>
<li>Inside Guideline&#8217;s Series B deck: 16:00</li>
<li>Pitch deck teardown: 33:00</li>
</ul>
<h2>How they met</h2>
<p>Senkut and Busque met nearly a decade ago, when Busque was still at TaskRabbit. Several years later, Busque launched out on his own and went fundraising for his original idea. Even though he got a no from Senkut, it wasn&#8217;t an easy decision.</p>
<p>Looking back, Senkut said he had much more freedom to follow his instincts while angel investing.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an institutional fund with LPs, we were feeling the pressure of checking all the checkmarks,&#8221; explained Senkut. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing how, sometimes, being more structured or analytical actually does not always lead you to make better decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Busque came back around after the pivot, looking to raise a Series B, Senkut called it a &#8220;no-brainer,&#8221; particularly because of the type of CEO Busque is.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opinion of Kevin as a person is that he&#8217;s an excellent wartime CEO, but also he&#8217;s a product visionary,&#8221; said Senkut. &#8220;We call them &#8216;missionary CEOs.&#8217; There are mercenary CEOs who can extract every ounce of dollar from a rock, but we are gravitating much more toward CEOs like Kevin who are focused on product first. People who have a really acute vision of what the problem is, and. a very specific vision for how to solve that problem and ultimately turn it into a long-term scalable and successful company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Busque said he was drawn to Senkut based on his level of conviction, explaining that Senkut doesn&#8217;t always have to go by the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he wants to write a check because the founder is great or the product is great, he does it,&#8221; said Busque. &#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily that he has to see a certain metric or growth pattern.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Building trust</h2>
<p>Obviously, years of staying connected and communicating (and not just about Guideline) laid the foundation for building a relationship. Busque said the honesty in their conversations, including Senkut&#8217;s initial rejection, lended itself greatly to the trust they have.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedlabs/create-your-perfect-ai-soulmate">new BuzzFeed quiz</a> is the first in what Director of Product for Quizzes Chris Johanesen said he&#8217;s hoping will be a series of &#8220;stunt-y experiments&#8221; that the publisher launches this year.</p>
<p>The quiz, timed for Valentine&#8217;s Day weekend, promises to &#8220;create your perfect boyfriend (or girlfriend) using AI technology.&#8221; Johanesen said it&#8217;s designed to &#8220;poke fun at the situation we&#8217;re all in&#8221; (quarantine, obviously), as well as the &#8220;weird world of online dating.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take the quiz, you answer a series of multiple-choices questions about what you&#8217;re looking for in your ideal romantic partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The questions will probably feel familiar to anyone who&#8217;s taken a quiz on BuzzFeed or elsewhere online, but the answer should be a lot more unique: Johanesen noted that in a normal online quiz, there might be &#8220;12 or 20 different results that are written, and that’s pretty much it.&#8221; With this one, &#8220;you could retake it dozens of times and never get the same results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johanesen explained that the BuzzFeed team generated an enormous variety of different profile images using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleGAN">StyleGAN</a> technology. For the text, BuzzFeed staff contributed personality traits, text messages quotes, hobbies and &#8220;weird, dark stuff&#8221; that the quiz combines algorithmically.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UV9t3oslLF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/buzzfeed-quiz-party/">With BuzzFeed&#8217;s new feature, you can take a Quiz Party with friends</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With BuzzFeed&#8217;s new feature, you can take a Quiz Party with friends&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/buzzfeed-quiz-party/embed/#?secret=UV9t3oslLF" data-secret="UV9t3oslLF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re mostly trying to embrace the absurdity of it,&#8221; he added. (I saw this myself when I tried out a demo earlier this week and was assigned a girlfriend who wanted to show off her &#8220;collection of scabs.&#8221;) &#8220;We try to match it a little bit to some of your inputs so that it&#8217;s not totally random. &#8230; An early version was more realistic, but it wasn&#8217;t as fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Johanesen said he&#8217;s hoping to create more quizzes that are &#8220;more generative,&#8221; where a writer might come up with a concept but they don&#8217;t have to &#8220;handwrite every single option.&#8221; Still, it sounds like this approach requires significant editorial work, which Johanesen doesn&#8217;t expect to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could definitely use machine learning models to write a quiz, but it probably wouldn’t be very good,&#8221; he said. Instead, the team is interested in &#8220;that intersection of what technology can do that humans can’t, and what humans can do that technology can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>More broadly, he noted that BuzzFeed is experimenting to find new ways to refresh the quiz format, for example with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/buzzfeed-quiz-party/">the Quiz Party feature</a> and <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahaspler/quiz-streaks-buzzfeed">Quiz Streaks</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, South Korean e-commerce and delivery giant <a href="https://rocketyourcareer.usa.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> filed to go public in the United States. As a private company, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupang">Coupang has raised billions</a>, including capital from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/sequoia-backs-coupang-koreas-answer-to-amazon-with-100-million/">American venture capital firm Sequoia</a> and Japanese telecom giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/coupang-raises-2-billion-from-softbanks-vision-fund/">SoftBank and its Vision Fund</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Coupang&#8217;s revenue growth is nothing short of fantastic.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Coupang&#8217;s offering, coming amidst the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/unpacking-qualtrics-brand-new-s-1-filing/">public debut of a number of well-known technology brands</a>, will be a massive affair. Its first S-1 filing indicates that its IPO will raise capital in the range of $1 billion, far larger than the $100 million placeholder that is more common.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s scale makes its lofty IPO fundraising goals reasonable. Coupang is huge, with revenues north of $10 billion in 2020 and in improving financial health as it scales. And its revenue growth has <em>accelerated</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps that explains why the company is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-coupang-ipo-idUSKBN2AC1EL">reportedly targeting a valuation of $50 billion</a>.</p>
<p>This afternoon, let&#8217;s dig into the company&#8217;s historical growth, its improving cash flow and its narrowing losses. Coupang&#8217;s debut will create a splash when it lands, so we owe it to ourselves to grok its numbers.</p>
<p>And as there are other e-commerce brands with a delivery function waiting in the wings to go public &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">Instacart comes to mind</a> &#8212; how Coupang fares in its IPO matters for a good number of domestic startups and unicorns.</p>
<h2>Coupang&#8217;s surging scale</h2>
<p>The company&#8217;s growth across the last half-decade is impressive. Observe its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021001984/coupang-sx1.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20_276">yearly revenue totals</a> from 2016 through 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016: $1.67 billion.</li>
<li>2017: $2.4 billion (+43.7%).</li>
<li>2018: $4.05 billion (+68.8%).</li>
<li>2019: $6.27 billion (+54.8%).</li>
<li>2020: $11.97 billion (+90.9%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, some of that 2020 growth is COVID-19 related, but even taking that into account, Coupang&#8217;s revenue growth is nothing short of fantastic. And what&#8217;s better is that the company has cut its losses in recent years:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Minneapolis voted Friday to ban the use of facial recognition software for its police department, growing the list of major cities that have implemented local restrictions on the controversial technology. After an ordinance on the ban was approved earlier this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/MinneapoliSam/status/1360257819170250760">13 members of the city council</a> voted in favor of the ban, with no opposition.</p>
<p>The new ban will block the Minneapolis Police Department from using any facial recognition technology, including software by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/clearview-ai/">Clearview AI</a>. That company sells access to a large database of facial images, many scraped from major social networks, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">federal law enforcement agencies</a>, private companies and a number of U.S. police departments. The Minneapolis Police Department is <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology">known to have a relationship with Clearview AI</a>, as is the Hennepin County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, which will not be restricted by the new ban.</p>

<p>The vote is a landmark decision in the city that set off racial justice protests around the country after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd last year. The city has been in the throes of police reform ever since, leading the nation by pledging to defund the city&#8217;s police department in June before backing away from that commitment <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html">into more incremental reforms</a> later that year.</p>
<p>Banning the use of facial recognition is one targeted measure that can rein in emerging concerns about aggressive policing. Many privacy advocates are concerned that the AI-powered face recognition systems would not only disproportionately target communities of color, but that the tech has been demonstrated to have technical shortcomings in discerning non-white faces.</p>
<p>Cities around the country are increasingly looking to ban the controversial technology and have implemented restrictions in many different ways. In Portland, Oregon, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">new laws passed last year</a> block city bureaus from using facial recognition but also forbid private companies from deploying the technology in public spaces. Previous legislation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban/">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/facial-recognition-bans-coming-soon-to-a-city-near-you">Oakland</a> and <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban">Boston</a> restricted city governments from using facial recognition systems, though didn&#8217;t include a similar provision for private companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The All-22 tape is perhaps one of the most valued tools for professional football coaches because it allows the viewer to see all 22 players on the field at the same time. It improves a coach&#8217;s line of sight and, most importantly, helps avoid missing a critical motion or player.</p>
<p>The upshot: It removes the blind spot. The concept of this tool can — and should — be applied in the startup world as well. Successful founders and investors understand the playbook on both sides of the ball. For founders, that means being able to zoom out and see each of their employees&#8217; points of view and being inclusive. Without an All-22 tape, founders can mistakenly spend too much on engineering while ignoring the product rollout strategy, or forget to communicate with employees outside of their bubble of interest. A company can become fragmented as more blind spots emerge, which can ultimately lead to oversights that damage its reputation, operations or even its ability to raise money from investors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a skillset that is developed through practice. Luckily, Eghosa Omoigui, the founder and managing general partner of <a href="http://www.echovc.com/">EchoVC Partners</a>, a seed and early-stage technology venture capital firm serving underrepresented founders and underserved markets, is coming to Early Stage 2021 to give early-stage founders the tools they need to develop their own All-22 tape.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-part-1-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=earlystage2021&amp;utm_content=echopartners&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=echopartnerspost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Early Stage – Operations &amp; Fundraising</a> is a virtual event focused on early-stage founders happening on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-part-1-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=earlystage2021&amp;utm_content=echopartners&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=echopartnerspost&amp;display=TRUE">April 1 &amp; 2</a>. The event will include breakout sessions led by investors and experts that break down the most difficult parts of building a business.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look of Omoigui&#8217;s talk:</p>
<h2><strong>The All-22 View</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving line of sight and dynamic field of play aperture is rarely discussed but hugely important. Great founders, operators and investors have an understanding of playbooks on both sides of the ball. We&#8217;ll talk through learnings and some ideas on how to build muscle memory and skillsets.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Omoigui, who was previously director of consumer internet and semantic technologies at Intel Capital, will share his experiences and tips to help founders see every aspect of their company. Register for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-part-1-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=earlystage2021&amp;utm_content=echopartners&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=echopartnerspost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Early Stage 2021</a> today and catch his All-22 Tape talk.</p>

		Bertrand Piccard initiated the <a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/">Solar Impulse Foundation</a> after his history-making flight around the world in a solar-powered plane. Fueled only by the rays of the sun, his flight proved that existing methods and technologies can provide clean energy and solutions that protect the environment in a profitable way.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Five years ago I landed the Solar Impulse 2 in Abu Dhabi after flying around the globe powered solely by solar energy, a first in aviation history.</p>
<p>It was also a milestone in energy and technology history. Solar Impulse was an experimental plane, weighing as little as a family car and using 17,248 solar cells. It was a flying laboratory, full of groundbreaking technologies that made it possible to produce renewable energy, store it and use it when necessary in the most efficient manner.</p>
<p>The time has come to use technology again to address the climate crisis affecting us all. As we enter the most crucial decade of climate action — and most likely our last chance to limit global warming to 1.5°C — we need to ensure that clean technologies become the only acceptable norm. These technologies exist now and they can be profitably implemented at this crucial moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Hundreds of clean tech solutions exist that protect the environment in a profitable way,					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here are just four innovations from our solar-powered plane that the market can start using now before it’s too late.</p>
<h2>From insulating the cabin to insulating our homes</h2>
<p>The building sector is one of the largest energy consumers in the world. Next to a reliance on carbon-heavy fuels for heating and cooling, poor insulation and associated energy loss are among the main reasons.</p>
<p>Inside Solar Impulse&#8217;s cockpit, insulation was crucial for the plane to fly at very high altitudes. Covestro, one of our official partners, <a href="https://www.covestro.com/en/company/strategy/attitude/solar-impulse">developed an ultra-lightweight and insulating material</a>. The cockpit insulation performance was 10% higher than the standards at the time because the pores in the insulating foam were 40% smaller, reaching a micrometer scale. Thanks to its very low density of fewer than 40 kilograms per cubic meter, the cockpit was ultra-lightweight.</p>
<p>This technology and many others exist. We now need to ensure that all market players are motivated to make hyperefficient building insulation their standard operating procedure.</p>
<h2>From propelling an electric aircraft to propelling clean mobility</h2>
<p>Solar Impulse was first and foremost an electric airplane when it flew 43,000 km without a single drop of fuel. Its four electric motors had a record-beating efficiency of 97%, far ahead of the miserable 27% of standard thermal engines. This means that they only lost 3% of the energy they used versus 73% for combustion propulsion. Today, electric vehicle sales are soaring. According to the International Energy Agency, when Solar Impulse landed in 2016, there were approximately 1.2 million electric cars on the road; the figure has now risen to over 5 million.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this acceleration is far from enough. Power sockets are still far from replacing petrol pumps. The transport sector still accounts for one-quarter of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Electrification must happen much more quickly to reduce CO2 emissions from our tailpipes. To do so, governments need to boost the adoption of electric vehicles through clear tax incentives, diesel and petrol engine bans, and major infrastructure investments. 2021 should be the year that puts us on a one-way road to zero-emission vehicles and puts thermal engines in a dead end.</p>
<h2>An aircraft microgrid can work for off-grid communities</h2>
<p>To fly for several days and nights, reaching a theoretically endless flight potential, Solar Impulse relied on batteries that stored the energy collected during the day and used it to power its engines during the night.</p>
<p>What was made possible with Si2 on a small scale should guide the way to future-proofing power-generation systems that are made up entirely of renewable energy. In the meantime, microgrids, like those used in Si2, could benefit off-grid systems in remote communities or energy islands, allowing them to abolish diesel or other carbon-heavy fuels already today.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, we are looking at smart grids. If all &#8220;stupid grids&#8221; were replaced by smart grids, it would allow cities, for example, to manage production, storage, distribution and consumption of energy and to cut peaks in energy demand that would reduce CO2 emissions dramatically.</p>
<h2>Energy efficiency in the air and on the ground</h2>
<p>Solar Impulse&#8217;s philosophy was to save energy instead of trying to produce more of it. This is why the relatively small amount of solar energy we collected became enough to fly day and night. All the airplane parameters, including wingspan, aerodynamics, speed, flight profile and energy systems, had therefore been designed to minimize energy loss.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach still stands out against the inefficiency of most of our energy use today. Even though the IEA found energy efficiency improved by an estimated 13% between 2000 and 2017, it is not enough. We need bolder action by policymakers to encourage investors. One of the best ways to do so is to put strict energy efficiency standards in place.</p>
<p>For example, California has set efficiency standards on buildings and appliances, such as consumer electronics and household appliances, estimated to have saved consumers more than $100 billion in utility bills. These measures are as good for the environment as they are for the economy.</p>
<h2>Si2 was the future; now, it should define the present</h2>
<p>When we used all these different innovations to build Solar Impulse, they were groundbreaking and futuristic. Today, they should define the present; they should be the norm. Next to the technologies mentioned above, hundreds of clean tech solutions exist that protect the environment in a profitable way, many of which have received the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution Label.</p>
<p>Just as for the Si2 technologies, we must now ensure that they enter the mainstream market. The faster we scale them, the faster we will set our economy on track to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and attain sustainable economic growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber and Lyft lost a lot of money in 2020. That&#8217;s not a surprise, as COVID-19 caused many ride-hailing markets to freeze, limiting demand for folks moving around. To combat the declines in their traditional businesses, Uber continued its push into consumer delivery, while Lyft announced a push into business-to-business logistics.</p>
<p>But the decline in demand harmed both companies. We can see that in their full-year numbers. Uber&#8217;s revenue fell from $13 billion in 2019 to $11.1 billion in 2020. Lyft&#8217;s fell from $3.6 billion in 2019 to a far-smaller $2.4 billion in 2020.</p>

<hr />
<p>But Uber and Lyft are excited that they will reach adjusted profitability, measured as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and even more stuff stripped out, by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>

But after the year from hell, Uber and Lyft are pretty damn certain that their highly adjusted profit dreams are going to come through.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s unpack their latest numbers to see if what the two companies are dangling in front of investors is worth desiring. Along the way we&#8217;ll talk BS metrics and how firing a lot of people can cut your cost base.</p>
<h2>Uber</h2>
<p>Using normal accounting rules, Uber <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020/">lost $6.77 billion in 2020</a>, an improvement from its 2019 loss of $8.51 billion. However, if you lean on Uber&#8217;s definition of adjusted EBITDA, its 2019 and 2020 losses fall to $2.73 billion and $2.53 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>So what is this magic wand Uber is waving to make billions of dollars worth of red ink go away? Let&#8217;s hear from the company itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition and financing related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiative related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Er, hot damn. I can&#8217;t recall ever seeing an adjusted EBITDA definition with <em>12</em> different categories of exclusion. But, it&#8217;s what Uber is focused on as reaching positive adjusted EBITDA is key to its current pitch to investors.</p>
<p>Indeed, here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s CFO in <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/11/uber-technologies-uber-q4-2020-earnings-call-trans/">its most recent earnings call</a>, discussing its recent performance:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain on track to turn the EBITDA profitable in 2021, and we are confident that Uber can deliver sustained strong top-line growth as we move past the pandemic.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if investors get what Uber promises, they will get an unprofitable company at the end of 2021, albeit one that, if you strip out a dozen categories of expense, is no longer running in the red. This, from a company worth north of $112 billion, feels like a very small promise.</p>
<p>And yet Uber shares have quadrupled from their pandemic lows, during which they fell under the $15 mark. Today Uber is worth more than $60 per share, despite shrinking last year and projecting years of losses (real), and possibly some (fake) profits later in the year.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cloud monitoring platform <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">Datadog</a> has <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/about/latest-news/press-releases/datadog-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-sqreen/">announced</a> that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.sqreen.com">Sqreen</a>, a software-as-a-service security platform. Originally founded in France, Sqreen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/sqreens-security-shield-automagically-blocks-attacks-on-your-web-app/">participated</a> in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2016.</p>
<p>Sqreen is a cloud-based security product to protect your application directly. Once you install the sandboxed Sqreen agent, it analyzes your application in real time to find vulnerabilities in your code or your configuration. There’s a small CPU overhead with Sqreen enabled, but there are some upsides.</p>
<p>It can surface threats and you can set up your own threat detection rules. You can see the status of your application from the Sqreen dashboard, receive notifications when there’s an incident and get information about incidents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For instance, you can see blocked SQL injections, see where the injection attempts came from and act to prevent further attempts. Sqreen also detects common attacks, such as credential stuffing attacks, cross-site scripting, etc. As your product evolves, you can enable different modules from the <a href="https://www.sqreen.com/plugins">plugin marketplace</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sqreen&#8217;s security shield automagically blocks attacks on your web app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/sqreens-security-shield-automagically-blocks-attacks-on-your-web-app/embed/#?secret=9GTawufCDe" data-secret="9GTawufCDe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Combining Datadog and Sqreen makes a lot of sense, as many companies already rely on Datadog to monitor their apps. Sqreen has a good product, Datadog has a good customer base. So you can expect some improvements on the security front for Datadog.</p>
<p>Sqreen raised a $2.3 million round from Alven Capital, Point Nine Capital, Kima Ventures, 50 Partners and business angels. It then participated in TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield — it made it to the finals but didn&#8217;t win the competition. The startup attended Y Combinator a bit later.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/sqreens-security-shield-automagically-blocks-attacks-on-your-web-app/">2019</a>, Sqreen raised a $14 million Series A round led by Greylock Partners with existing investors Y Combinator, Alven and Point Nine participating once again.</p>
<p>Datadog and Sqreen have signed a definitive acquisition agreement. Terms of the deal remain undisclosed and the acquisition should close in Q2 2021.</p>

<p>The collaborative online office and document service was not loading as of around 9 a.m. ET on Friday, preventing anyone who relies on the service from accessing their cloud-stored data.</p>
<p>In a since-deleted tweet, Notion asked if &#8220;any users have a contact at Name.com,&#8221; the web host that Notion relies on for its domain name. In a reply, Name.com said it was &#8220;working with the owners of this domain to address this issue as quickly as possible.&#8221; Notion replied: &#8220;Could you let us know where you&#8217;re messaging us to address this?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a statement shortly after its first tweet went out, Notion told TechCrunch: &#8220;We&#8217;re experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users. We are actively looking into this issue, and will update you with more information as we receive it via <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus">our status page</a> on Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notion didn&#8217;t say specifically what the DNS issue is. Domain name servers, or DNS, is an important part of how the internet works. Every time you go to visit a website, your browser uses a DNS server to convert web addresses to machine-readable IP addresses to locate where a web page is located on the internet. But if a website or its DNS server is not configured correctly, it can cause the website not to load.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not clear exactly who is responsible for this particular DNS issue.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ember today announced that founder Clay Alexander will transition to Group CEO effective February 16. In his place, the Los Angeles-based smart mug company is bringing on Jim Rowan as Consumer CEO. The executive served as CEO of Dyson from 2017 to 2020, after five years as COO.</p>
<p>It’s a big get for a relatively small company like Ember, which is best known for its smart, heated mugs. Founded in 2012, the hardware startup most recently raised a $20 million Series D in early 2019, bringing its total funding up to just shy of $50 million.</p>
<p>Alexander’s continued role at the company points to additional categories for Ember beyond consumer. “When I founded Ember, I knew there were endless applications for our temperature control technology and with Jim joining our team, we’ll be able to focus on our emerging healthcare vertical and use our technology to help improve and even save lives,” the exec said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Courtesy of clever technology and smart design, the company has built a pretty sizable footprint for what might otherwise be a fairly niche product, expanding retail sales to Target, Costco, Best Buy and Starbucks, among others. The startup has done so while maintaining a low headcount of around 100 staffers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have great IP, great design and great innovation, all around precise temperature control,&#8221; Rowan said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;Obviously that started with the temperature control mugs and flasks, but that IP lends itself to so many other application. For me, that golden thread of being able to use that in myriad of different industries and markets is really, really exciting. One of them, of course, is the cold chain, which has become a lot more important since the beginning of the pandemic. That’s a good indication of how you can disrupt and innovate in new markets.</p>
<p>Rowan has previously served as the COO of BlackBerry and as a senior exec at Flextronics. After exiting Dyson, he joined both PCH International and KKR as an advisor. It&#8217;s Dyson, however, that provides the most direct analogy for what the executive hoping to do at Ember. At its core, Dyson is a company that moves air. That translates to vacuums, fans, hairdryers and myriad other product categories.</p>
<p>The underlying question is how Ember&#8217;s proprietary heating and cooling tech can translate to other fields. On an industrial level, it means, potentially, helping keep foodstuff and medicine at a predetermined temperate while shipping in the international cold chain. It also means additional consumer products built around the same underlying tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be a lot more products that come out, beyond the current mugs and travel mugs,&#8221; Rowan says. &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole bunch of new products which are in the consumer pipeline and will launch in the next year or couple of years. And then you have the expansion into new geographies with existing products.&#8221;</p>
<p>That largely means Asia (Rowan will remain based in Singapore) and Europe. Thus far Ember&#8217;s footprint has been U.S.-centric, though a push toward online commerce amid the pandemic has helped expand it some. There does, however, remain a question of how high the ceiling is on adoption for a $130 electric smart mug. Ember has yet to release any actual numbers, and Rowan, whose experience at Dyson has more than familiarized him with selling premium products at a premium price point, isn&#8217;t ready to commit to a lower price point or less premium take on the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, of course, that low end of the mug category is ready available at your local 99 cent store, and that&#8217;s not likely a space Ember is raring to compete in. And certainly those products &#8212; unlike its current lineup &#8212; likely wouldn&#8217;t end up in Apple Stores. Instead, it seems likely the company will continue a play as a premium consumer brand into additional categories at a more rapid pace. &#8220;The actual technology can expand into a whole bunch of new areas beyond just beverages because of the temperature control technology,&#8221; Rowan said.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">One year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/joby-aviation-raises-590-million-led-by-toyota-to-launch-an-electric-air-taxi-service/">nabbing $590 million from investors led by Toyota</a>, and a few months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/">picking up Uber’s flying taxi business</a>, <a href="https://www.jobyaviation.com/">Joby Aviation</a> is reportedly in talks to go public in a SPAC deal that would value the electric plane manufacturer at nearly $5.7 billion.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">News of a potential deal comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">another big SPAC transaction in electric planes (for Archer Aviation)</a>. If the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42feff1d-8228-4c93-bd78-b537d9eb9fa7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times&#8217;</a> reporting is accurate, then that would mean the two will soon be publicly traded at a total value approaching $10 billion.</p>

<p>It’s a heady time for startups making vehicles powered by anything other than hydrocarbons, and the SPAC wave has hit it hard.</p>
<p>Electric car companies Arrival, Canoo, ChargePoint, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra and The Lion Electric Company are some of the companies that have merged with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/spac/">SPACs</a> — or announced plans to — in the past year.</p>
<p>Now it appears that any company that has anything to do with the electrification of any mode of transportation is going to get waved onto the runway for a public listing through a special purpose acquisition company vehicle — a wildly popular route at the moment for companies that might find traditional IPO listings more challenging to carry out but would rather not stay in startup mode when it comes to fundraising.</p>
<p>The investment group reportedly taking Joby <del datetime="2021-02-12T13:39:53+00:00">to the moon!</del> out to public markets is led by the billionaire tech entrepreneurs and investors Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, and Mark Pincus, who launched the casual gaming company, Zynga.</p>
<p>Together the two men had formed Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company, earlier in 2020. The shell company went public and raised $690 million to make a deal.</p>
<p>Any transaction for Joby would be a win for the company’s backers, including Toyota, Baillie Gifford, Intel Capital, JetBlue Technology Ventures (the investment arm of the U.S.-based airline) and Uber, which invested $125 million into Joby.</p>
<p>Joby has a prototype that has already taken 600 flights, but has yet to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration. And the success of any transaction between the company and Hoffman and Pincus’ SPAC group is far from a sure thing, as the FT noted.</p>
<p>The deal would require an additional capital infusion into the SPAC that the two men established, and without that extra cash, all bets are off. Indeed, that is probably one reason why anyone is reading about this now.</p>

<p>Alternatively powered transportation vehicles of all stripes and covering all modes of travel are the rage right now among the public investment crowd. Part of that is due to rising pressure among institutional investors to find companies with an environmental, sustainability and good governance thesis that they can invest in, and part of that is due to tailwinds coming from government regulations pushing for the decarbonization of fleets in a bid to curb global warming.</p>
<p>The environmental impact is one chief reason United chief executive Scott Kirby cited when speaking about his company’s $1 billion purchase order from the electric plane company that actually announced it would be pursuing a public offering through a SPAC earlier this week.</p>
<p>“By working with Archer, United is showing the aviation industry that now is the time to embrace cleaner, more efficient modes of transportation,” Kirby said. “With the right technology, we can curb the impact aircraft have on the planet, but we have to identify the next generation of companies who will make this a reality early and find ways to help them get off the ground.”</p>
<p>It’s also an investment in a possible new business line that could eventually shuttle United passengers to and from an airport, as TechCrunch reported earlier. United projected that a trip in one of Archer’s eVTOL aircraft could reduce CO2 emissions by up to 50% per passenger traveling between Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport.</p>

<p>The agreement to go public and the order from United Airlines comes less than a year after Archer Aviation came out of stealth. Archer was co-founded in 2018 by Adam Goldstein and Brett Adcock, who sold their software-as-a-service company Vettery to The Adecco Group for more than $100 million. The company’s primary backer was Marc Lore, who sold his company Jet.com to Walmart in 2016 for $3.3 billion. Lore was Walmart’s e-commerce chief until January.</p>
<p>For any SPAC investors or venture capitalists worried that they’re now left out of the EV plane investment bonanza, take heart! There’s still the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/22/lilium-raises-another-240m-to-design-test-and-and-run-an-electric-aircraft-taxi-service/">German tech developer Lilium</a>. And if an investor is interested in supersonic travel,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/boom-wants-to-build-a-supersonic-jet-for-mainstream-passengers-heres-its-game-plan/"> there’s always Boom</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey and rapper Jay Z have created an endowment to fund bitcoin development initially in Africa and India, Dorsey said on Friday.</p>
<p>The duo is <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1360114881978982403">putting 500 bitcoin</a>, which is currently worth $23.6 million, in the endowment called ₿trust. The fund will be set up as a blind irrevocable trust, Dorsey said, adding that the duo won’t be giving any direction to the team.</p>
<p>₿trust is looking to hire three board members. The mission of the fund is to “make bitcoin the internet&#8217;s currency,” a job application describes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Government in India has so far been reluctant to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Friday’s move comes as New Delhi is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/">inching closer to introducing a law that would ban private cryptocurrencies</a> in the nation. It is also looking to create its own digital currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though India is the software development capital of the world, we haven&#8217;t contributed to bitcoin core development in any significant way,&#8221; explained Varun Deshpande, co-founder of <a href="https://onjuno.com/">OnJuno</a>, which is building a digital banking platform from India for Asian Americans, to TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India plans to introduce law to ban Bitcoin, other private cryptocurrencies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/30/india-plans-to-introduce-law-to-ban-bitcoin-other-private-cryptocurrencies/embed/#?secret=vFLBwp6iId" data-secret="vFLBwp6iId" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;India always had the skills to contribute but lacked the right incentives. Today&#8217;s initiative is even more significant since it provides the right incentives for developers from the world&#8217;s largest democracy to contribute and have a say in bitcoin&#8217;s protocol development and bring in a diversity of thoughts in shaping the future of money. The irony is as India prepares a bill to ban bitcoin in India, the world is turning to our massive technical talent in India to secure and safeguard the bitcoin network.&#8221;</p>
<p>Africa, most especially Nigeria, on the other hand, has experienced a surge in cryptocurrency transactions in recent years. Last year, Nigerians traded more than <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/01/06/nigerians-traded-more-than-400m-worth-crypto-2020/">$400 million worth of cryptocurrency</a> on major local crypto exchanges, and the country is <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1947769/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us/">only second to the U.S.</a> in terms of volume of bitcoin traded in the last five years.</p>
<p>Africans that trade cryptocurrencies rely on them because they offer protection against currency devaluation and for value exchange during cross-border transactions. In Nigeria, bitcoin trading became ubiquitous last year <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/10/25/africa/nigeria-end-sars-protests-analysis-intl/index.html">during the #EndSARS protests</a> that rocked the country. When donations for the protests began to flow from all parts of the country and in the diaspora, the Nigerian government shut down the bank accounts used for this effort. But bitcoin became a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nigerian-activists-bitcoin-endsars-police-brutality">lifeline</a> keeping the crowdfunding activities alive.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been growing concerns that the Nigerian government had intentions to regulate cryptocurrency in the country. Last week, those doubts were actualized as the country&#8217;s apex bank gave a <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/africa/1970446/nigerias-central-bank-takes-aim-at-cryptocurrency-again/amp/">directive</a> to banks and financial institutions from dealing in cryptocurrency or facilitating payments for cryptocurrency exchange platforms.</p>
<p>Dorsey has long supported the adoption of cryptocurrency. Square <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/square-cash-expands-bitcoin-buying-and-selling-to-all-users/">already supports bitcoin</a> and last year <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/2020-bitcoin-investment">acquired about $50 million worth of bitcoin</a> for its corporate treasury, and Twitter is studying the potential use of bitcoin to pay its employees and vendors.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1359501275650547714?s=20">CNBC earlier this week</a>, Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said, “We’ve done a lot of the upfront thinking to consider how we might pay employees should they ask to be paid in bitcoin, how we might pay a vendor if they ask to be [paid] in bitcoin and whether we need to have bitcoin on our balance sheet should that happen. It’s something we continue to study and look at, we want to be thoughtful about over time, but we haven’t made any changes yet.”</p>
<p>Many high-profile industry executives have called for nations to embrace bitcoin. Balaji Srinivasan, an angel investor and entrepreneur who previously served as the chief technology officer of Coinbase, earlier this month made a case for <a href="https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/">why India should embrace bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>“India has the talent to pull this off. Such a move would make international headlines, attract global support from the world&#8217;s technologists and financiers, differentiate India from the increasingly zero-sum economic policies pushed by America and China, and put the country at the forefront of a trillion dollar industry,” he wrote, envisioning the potential unblocking bitcoin would create for India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Kenya said this week that it will use bitcoin as a reserve currency amid the Kenyan Shilling volatility against the dollar. Last year, the country was <a href="https://www.usefultulips.org/combined_Sub%20Saharan%20Africa_Page.html">only second to Nigeria</a> in bitcoin trading in Africa. Dorsey&#8217;s plan is a follow-up on his <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/into-africa-tech-leaders-weigh-in-on-jack-dorseys-planned-move-to-the-continent/amp/">visit to the continent</a> in 2019 when amid meeting with key political and tech stakeholders, he made a startling reference to the continent&#8217;s budding cryptocurrency usage. “Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!),” he said at the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sweden&#8217;s data protection authority, the IMY, has fined the local police authority €250,000 ($300,000+) for unlawful use of the controversial facial recognition software <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/clearview-ai/">Clearview AI</a>, in breach of the country&#8217;s Criminal Data Act.</p>
<p>As part of the enforcement the police must conduct further training and education of staff in order to avoid any future processing of personal data in breach of data protection rules and regulations.</p>
<p>The authority has also been ordered to inform people whose personal data was sent to Clearview &#8212; when confidentiality rules allow it to do so, per the IMY.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its investigation found that the police had used the facial recognition tool on a number of occasions and that several employees had used it without prior authorization.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this month</a> Canadian privacy authorities found Clearview had breached local laws when it collected photos of people to plug into its facial recognition database without their knowledge or permission.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7VFRk9VAsl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Clearview AI ruled &#8216;illegal&#8217; by Canadian privacy authorities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clearview AI ruled &#8216;illegal&#8217; by Canadian privacy authorities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/embed/#?secret=7VFRk9VAsl" data-secret="7VFRk9VAsl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;IMY concludes that the Police has not fulfilled its obligations as a data controller on a number of accounts with regards to the use of Clearview AI. The Police has failed to implement sufficient organisational measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data in this case has been carried out in compliance with the Criminal Data Act. When using Clearview AI the Police has unlawfully processed biometric data for facial recognition as well as having failed to conduct a data protection impact assessment which this case of processing would require,&#8221; the Swedish data protection authority writes in a <a href="https://www.imy.se/nyheter/police-unlawfully-used-facial-recognition-app/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The IMY&#8217;s full decision can be found <a href="https://www.imy.se/globalassets/dokument/beslut/beslut-tillsyn-polismyndigheten-cvai.pdf">here</a> (in Swedish).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are clearly defined rules and regulations on how the Police Authority may process personal data, especially for law enforcement purposes. It is the responsibility of the Police to ensure that employees are aware of those rules,&#8221; added Elena Mazzotti Pallard, legal advisor at IMY, in a statement.</p>
<p>The fine (SEK2.5 million in local currency) was decided on the basis of an overall assessment, per the IMY, though it falls quite a way short of the maximum possible under Swedish law for the violations in question &#8212; which the watchdog notes would be SEK10 million. (The authority&#8217;s decision notes that not knowing the rules or having inadequate procedures in place are not a reason to reduce a penalty fee so it&#8217;s not entirely clear why the police avoided a bigger fine.)</p>
<p>The data authority said it was not possible to determine what had happened to the data of the people whose photos the police authority had sent to Clearview &#8212; such as whether the company still stored the information. So it has also ordered the police to take steps to ensure Clearview deletes the data.</p>
<p>The IMY said it investigated the police&#8217;s use of the controversial technology following reports in local media.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, U.S.-based Clearview AI was revealed by The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">New York Times</a> to have amassed a database of billions of photos of people&#8217;s faces &#8212; including by scraping public social media postings and harvesting people&#8217;s sensitive biometric data without individuals&#8217; knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>European Union data protection law puts a high bar on the processing of special category data, such as biometrics.</p>
<p>Ad hoc use by police of a commercial facial recognition database &#8212; with seemingly zero attention paid to local data protection law &#8212; evidently does not meet that bar.</p>
<p>Last month it emerged that the Hamburg data protection authority had <a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-01/545_2020_Anhörung_CVAI_ENG_Redacted.PDF">instigated proceedings</a> against Clearview following a complaint by a German resident over consentless processing of his biometric data.</p>
<p>The Hamburg authority cited Article 9 (1) of the GDPR, which prohibits the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, unless the individual has given explicit consent (or for a number of other narrow exceptions which it said had not been met) &#8212; thereby finding Clearview&#8217;s processing unlawful.</p>
<p>However, the German authority only made a narrow order for the deletion of the individual complainant&#8217;s mathematical hash values (which represent the biometric profile).</p>
<p>It did not order deletion of the photos themselves. It also did not issue a pan-EU order banning the collection of any European resident’s photos as it could have done and as European privacy campaign group, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/clearview-ai-deemed-illegal-eu">noyb</a>, had been pushing for.</p>
<p>Indeed, noyb is encouraging all EU residents to use <a href="https://clearview.ai/privacy/requests">forms on Clearview AI&#8217;s website</a> to ask the company for a copy of their data and ask it to delete any data it has on them, as well as to object to being included in its database. It also recommends that individuals who find Clearview holds their data submit a complaint against the company with their local DPA.</p>
<p>European Union lawmakers are in the process of drawing up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">risk-based framework to regulate applications of artificial intelligence</a> &#8212; with draft legislation expected to be put forward this year, although the Commission intends it to work in concert with data protections already baked into the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Earlier this month</a> the controversial facial recognition company was ruled illegal by Canadian privacy authorities &#8212; who warned they would “pursue other actions” if the company does not follow recommendations that include stopping the collection of Canadians&#8217; data and deleting all previously collected images.</p>
<p>Clearview said it had stopped providing its tech to Canadian customers last summer.</p>
<p>It is also facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/">a class action lawsuit</a> in the U.S. citing Illinois’ biometric protection laws.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clearview-ai-investigation-idUSKBN24A110">Last summer</a> the U.K. and Australian data protection watchdogs announced a joint investigation into Clearview&#8217;s personal data handling practices. That probe is ongoing.</p>
