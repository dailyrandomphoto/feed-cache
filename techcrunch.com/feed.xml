										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two weeks ago, TPG&#8217;s Rise Fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/airtel-africa-sells-200m-mobile-money-business-stake-to-tpgs-rise-fund/">invested $200 million in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV</a> (AMC BV) &#8212; the mobile money business of telecom <a href="https://airtel.africa/">Airtel Africa</a>. After closing the deal, the Bharti Airtel subsidiary noted that it was still in discussions to sell additional minority stake (25% of the issued share capital) to more potential investors.</p>
<p>Today, it has announced a new investor &#8212; global payments provider Mastercard in a deal that will see Airtel Africa receive an additional $100 million for its mobile money business. AMC BV &#8212; which operates one of the largest financial services in the continent, giving users access to mobile wallet, support for international money transfer, loan, and virtual credit card &#8212; is valued at $2.65 billion.</p>
<p>The two firms are no stranger to one another. In 2019, they <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/airtel-africa-announces-partnership-with-mastercard-to-transform-digital-payments-landscape-and-connect-100-million-consumers-in-africa/">inked</a> a deal that enabled Airtel Africa&#8217;s 100 million subscribers in 14 nations access to Mastercard&#8217;s global network. (That partnership didn&#8217;t see any money exchange between Mastercard and Airtel Africa.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Airtel Africa and Mastercard said today they have &#8220;extended commercial agreements and signed a new commercial framework which will deepen their partnerships across numerous geographies and areas including card issuance, payment gateway, payment processing, merchant acceptance and remittance solutions, amongst others.&#8221;</p>
<p>AMC BV&#8217;s $2.65 billion valuation on a cash and debt-free basis remains unchanged from the last time. This means TPG&#8217;s Rise Fund and Mastercard will own 7.55% and 3.775.% stake respectively upon the completion of their deals. For Mastercard, the transaction will close in two tranches — $75 million invested at first close (which will be finalized in the next four months), and $50 million to be invested at the second close.</p>
<p>By selling off a minority stake in the mobile money business to The Rise Fund, Mastercard and other potential investors, the telecom operator believes it can raise enough cash to monetize its mobile money business and pursue a possible listing in four years.</p>
<p>In addition to receiving investments from TPG&#8217;s Rise Fund and Mastercard, Airtel Africa has begun selling off some assets as well. Last week, the company sold 1,424 telecommunications towers companies in Madagascar and Malawi to Helios Towers for $119 million. Both Helios and Airtel Africa also agreed to trade tower assets in Chad and Gabon, although the details remain undisclosed.</p>
<p>These efforts are geared towards the company&#8217;s pursuit of strategic asset monetisation, investment opportunities, and, ultimately, debt reduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;With today&#8217;s announcement, we are pleased to welcome Mastercard as an investor in our mobile money business, joining The Rise Fund, which we announced two weeks ago,&#8221; CEO of Airtel Africa, Raghunath Mandava said of the investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a continuation of our strategy to increase the minority shareholding in our mobile money business with the further intention to list this business within four years. We are significantly strengthening our existing strategic relationship with Mastercard to help us realise the full potential from the substantial opportunity to improve financial inclusion across our countries of operation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Competition in China&#8217;s gaming industry is getting stiffer in recent times as tech giants sniff out potential buyouts and investments to beef up their gaming alliance, whether it pertains to content or distribution.</p>
<p>Bilibili, the go-to video streaming platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/with-170m-users-bilibili-is-the-nearest-thing-china-has-to-youtube/">for young Chinese</a>, is the latest to make a major gaming deal. It has agreed to invest HK$960 million (about $123 million) into X.D. Network, which runs the popular game distribution platform TapTap in China, the company announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dual-listed in Hong Kong and New York, Bilibili will purchase 22,660,000 shares of X.D.&#8217;s common stock at HK$42.38 apiece, which will grant it a 4.72% stake.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partners will initiate a series of &#8220;deep collaborations&#8221; around X.D.&#8217;s own games and TapTap, without offering more detail.</p>
<p>Though known for its trove of video content produced by amateur and professional creators, Bilibili derives a big chunk of its income from mobile games, which accounted for <a href="https://ir.bilibili.com/static-files/98bfad59-0a57-467c-a3f4-e250c3bada4b">40% of its revenues</a> in 2020. The ratio had declined from 71% and 53% in 2018 and 2019, a sign that it&#8217;s trying to diversify revenue streams beyond distributing games.</p>

<p>Tencent has similarly leaned on games to drive revenues for years. The WeChat operator dominates China&#8217;s gaming market through original titles and a sprawling investment portfolio whose content it helps operate and promote.</p>
<p>X.D. makes games, too, but in recent years it has also emerged as a rebel against traditional game distributors, which are Android app stores operated by smartphone makers. The vision is to skip the high commission fees charged by the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi and monetize through ads. X.D.&#8217;s proposition has helped it attract a swathe of gaming companies to be its investors, including fast-growing studios Lilith Games and miHoYo, as well as ByteDance, which built up a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/bytedance-gaming/">3,000-people strong gaming team</a> within six years.</p>
<p>Bilibili&#8217;s investment further strengthens X.D.&#8217;s matrix of top-tier gaming investors. Tencent is conspicuously absent, but it&#8217;s no secret that ByteDance is its new nemesis. The TikTok parent recently outbid Tencent to acquire Moonton, a gaming studio that has gained ground in Southeast Asia, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bytedance-videogames-mooton/bytedance-acquires-gaming-studio-moonton-at-around-4-billion-valuation-sources-idUSKBN2BE0ES">Reuters</a>. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is also vying for user attention away from content published on WeChat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies had to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. For SOSV-backed <a href="https://www.achiko.com/">Achiko</a>, this meant shifting its focus from mobile payment services to affordable COVID-19 screening. Achiko&#8217;s platform combines an app called Teman Sehat (&#8220;Health Buddy&#8221; in Indonesian) for payments and keeping test records, and proprietary low-cost testing kits using DNA aptamers, or synthetic strands of DNA, that are cheaper to manufacture than rapid or PCR tests.</p>
<p>The testing kits, formerly code-named Gumnuts and now called Aptamex, were developed in a partnership with Barcelona-based biotech company <a href="https://regenacellx.com/">RegenaCellx.sl</a> and completed the first phase of its clinical validation trials in January, with the goal of moving to production in the second quarter of this year. Teman Sehat, meanwhile, was built on technology that Achiko had developed for a payments aggregator called Mimopay.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Achiko listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange the next year. Chief executive officer Steven Goh told TechCrunch that the company was in the process of expanding into buy now, pay later services in 2020 when COVID-19 disrupted international travel. As a result, the compliance process would have been much more lengthy and expensive. Achiko decided to see what could be created with its existing technology to address the pandemic instead, and launched Teman Sehat as a result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The app offers incentives for people to get tested, take payments and keep records of test results that could be used for check-ins by workplaces and businesses. While working on Teman Sehat, however, Goh said Achiko’s team realized that the cost of COVID-19 PCR and rapid tests were too high for many people in emerging markets. While frequent mass testing might eventually be accessible in the United States and Europe, Goh told TechCrunch &#8220;the actual wholesale costs of rapid tests would be $5 to $8. By the time, you’re actually delivering a rapid test in the field, it could be anything between $20 and $70, and if you’re in a country like the Philippines or Indonesia, that sort of price point is too high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Achiko decided Teman Sehat’s potential would be limited unless it was coupled with a low-cost testing solution, and began working with Regenacellx.sl. In January, it appointed Dr. Morris Berrie, co-founder and chairman of <a href="http://www.ttsglobalinitiative.com/">TTS Global Initiative,</a> as president to help with the development and production of Aptamex.</p>
<p>Achiko’s team emphasizes it is not meant to be a replacement for PCR and rapid tests. Instead, Aptamex will serve as an affordable screener, costing under 25 cents USD per kit, that can be used frequently (daily or every other day), and people who test positive will be referred to PRC or rapid tests.</p>
<p>Berrie told TechCrunch that the benefit of aptamers is that they are inexpensive to produce and can be ordered from suppliers of synthetic DNA. &#8220;It is incredibly cheap and synthetic and the test itself is non-invasive. All these things are big pluses. The most important of all is the price point is a fraction of other testing kits available,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To use Aptamex, people gargle a mouthwash, spit a sample into a tube and drop it off at a testing center. Then the saliva sample is diluted in Aptamex’s aptamer test conjugate and scanned with a spectrophotometer to see if the aptamers bind to the COVID-19 spike protein. Results are available within an hour and can be sent through Teman Sehat. <a href="https://www.achiko.com/2021/01/25/achiko-concludes-phase-1-study-of-project-gumnuts-for-covid-19-testing/">Phase 1 testing for Aptamex </a>in Indonesia showed results of 91% sensitivity (or how often it correctly showed a positive result) and 85% specificity (or how well it identified true negatives) in field tests.</p>
<p>Procurement and manufacturing for Aptamex tests is currently underway in Taiwan, and Achiko is preparing filings with Indonesia’s Ministry of Health with the target of shipping kits by the beginning of the third quarter. It is also applying for CE certification in Europe and plans to apply for FDA approval in the United States, too.</p>
<p>Goh said aptamers can used to develop tests for other pathogens, and applied in other formats, including microfluidics and electronic sensors. This means Aptamex can be adapted for COVID-19 mutations and eventually be used to screen for other diseases. One potential barrier to the use of aptamers in diagnostics is the lack of standardized protocols and kits, but Achiko believes those can be developed as the cost of chemical synthesis decreases and databases of aptamers are created.</p>
<p>In the future, Achiko will continue to focus on health tech instead of financial products. &#8220;There’s no intention to be a financial services platform going forward,&#8221; Goh said. &#8220;The vision of being able to use a new technology stack to detect first with COVID, but any universe of other pathogens or indications of possible ailments, and having a platform to integrate these things in a contemporary way is something we believe is worthwhile.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cendanacapital.com/">Cendana Capital</a>, a San Francisco-based fund of funds manager, has amassed stakes in more than 100 venture firms since launching in 2010. For the most part, it did this by focusing on managers who are raising funds of $100 million or less in capital, even foregoing stakes in beloved outfits like Forerunner Ventures and Uncork Capital as their assets under management ballooned well beyond that amount.</p>
<p>Yet as the market changed, however, Cendana founder Michael Kim began to play with that formula. Last spring, for example, when he closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/cendana-capital-which-has-been-backing-seed-funds-for-a-decade-has-278-million-more-to-invest/">$278 million</a> in new capital commitments, he said planned to invest in the seed-stage managers he has always backed, but that he planned to funnel a small amount of capital to pre-seed managers raising $50 million or less, as well as to invest in a sprinkling of international managers.</p>
<p>Now Kim is back with a brand-new fund that sees him covering even more ground. Called Cendana&#8217;s Nano fund, it has raised $30 million in capital from existing Cendana backers to invest in up to 12 investment managers who are piecing together funds of $15 million or less capital. There are too many smart people right now making smaller bets for Cendana not to make the move, he suggests. We talked with Kim about the fund &#8212; and the changing landscape more broadly &#8212; in a chat has been edited lightly for length.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the thesis behind this Nano fund?</strong></p>
<p>MK: The seed market has evolved a lot over the last 18 months to 24 months. You have this whole world of Twitter VC, meaning people who have a lot of strong opinions and an operator-investor perspective, but who may not have substantial funds behind them. You have solo capitalists like Lachy Groom and Josh Buckley, who&#8217;ve gone out and raised hundreds of millions of dollars. You also have the AngelList rolling funds. I think there are probably more than 100 rolling funds out there, and probably 95% of them are [headed by] people who are working at the big tech or private tech companies, and it&#8217;s more of a vehicle of convenience for their friends to invest alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And you think they need more capital than is floating out there already?</strong></p>
<p>MK: I think we are the only institutional LP that is focused at this stage, because as you know, many of the funds of funds and university endowments and family offices have to write big checks, so they&#8217;re not going to be investing a little bit into a tiny $10 million fund.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What are you looking for exactly?</strong></p>
<p>MK: The goal is to find the next Lowercase Capital. Not everyone knows this, but Chris Sacca’s first fund was $8 million and it returned 250x. Manu Kumar of K9 Ventures &#8212; his first fund was $6.25 million and returned 53x. So you can generate substantial alpha with these smaller funds.</p>
<p>Historically, we would meet with fund managers, and when they said, ‘We’re going to raise a $10 million to $15 million fund,’ we were like,’Okay, sounds interesting. Let’s talk when you’re raising your second fund.’ But we realized that we’re missing out an entire segment of the market. So Nano was created to capture that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why draw a line in the sand at $15 million?</strong></p>
<p>MK: First, if you&#8217;re going to be running a $100 million seed fund, you have to be writing $1.5 million to $2 million checks, and that&#8217;s a super competitive space right now, because not only are there other seed funds but also a lot of firms &#8212; Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed, General Catalyst &#8212; that are very active at the seed stage. We&#8217;re coming across a lot of these managers who want to stay small, because by writing $300,000 to $400,000, they&#8217;re not competing against Sequoia or Forerunner Ventures; they’re just sliding into the round.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you worry they will just get washed out of that investment later through subsequent checks from bigger players?</strong></p>
<p>MK: Right now, we now have more than 100 portfolio funds within Cendana, and we did some data analysis. We looked at the fund size, and then the average ownership of each fund. And it turns out there&#8217;s a baseline of about 15% of a fund, meaning if you&#8217;re a $100 million fund, the average ownership stake [you have in your startups] is around 15%. If you&#8217;re a $50 million fund, the average ownership is about 7.5%.</p>
<p>We then looked at performance across our fund managers, and it turns out that of funds with $50 million in capital &#8212; our better-performing funds &#8212; have more ownership than 7.5%. They have more like 10% to 12%. Now, when you look at these tiny funds, if you&#8217;re a $15 million fund, 15% of that [should equate to] 2.2% ownership, but we are seeing that these tiny funds are actually getting more like 4% to 5% ownership. They&#8217;re punching above their weight because of who is involved.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who have you backed so far?</strong></p>
<p>MK: The first one is Form Capital, a fund from Bobby Goodlatte and Josh Williams. Both were early at Facebook; Bobby led the team that designed Facebook Photos and was later an [entrepreneur-in-residence] at Greylock. Josh cofounded Gowalla (acquired by Facebook).</p>
<p><strong>TC: How big a fund are they raising and how much are you giving them?</strong></p>
<p>MK: They raised a $15 million fund, and our strategy is to [account for] 20% of [each of these funds], so we wrote them a $3 million check.</p>
<p>The second fund manager is Jeff Morris Jr.; he runs a fund called Chapter One. He was a senior product guy at Tinder and and an active angel, and he raised a $10 million fund last year into which we wrote a $2 million check.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And the third?</strong></p>
<p>MK: The third manager hasn’t closed the fund, so I can’t disclose his name, but he was a very early employee at Uber and ran their data teams.</p>
<p>The last is an interesting example because this person could probably go out and raise $100 million, but to my point about not wanting to compete against everyone in the world in writing a big check, he&#8217;s content to write [sub $500,000] checks into interesting data analytics and AI and machine learning companies, and everybody wants him involved because of his experience and his network of data scientists worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When Chris Sacca dove in, it was his full-time job, I think. Do you care if these managers are focused solely on investing?</strong></p>
<p>MK: No. With Nano we&#8217;re investing in people who may actually have a day job, which would not be a fit for our main fund, but with our Nano fund, our aperture is wider. We welcome anyone out there looking to manage $15 million or less to reach out.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Well, to be clear, you have <em>some</em> criteria. What is it?</strong></p>
<p>MK: No matter who we invest in, they have to have investment experience and an investment track record. What we really look for at the end of the day is a person who has some sort of advantage &#8212; whether it&#8217;s domain expertise or networks. So you could be an amazing computer scientist in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon and if you&#8217;ve made some investments [we’d talk with you]. It could be someone coming out of Stripe or PayPal or Facebook or an entrepreneur in Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A $30 million fund of funds is going to get committed pretty fast in this market. Is the plan to raise maybe one every year?</strong></p>
<p>MK: We have an incredible top of the funnel, and as you&#8217;re alluding, we&#8217;re going to be inundated. But we walk in there and try to meet with everybody.</p>
<p>We’re also in discussions with our existing fund managers to create a nano fund for [some of] them. So, you know, imagine one of our fund managers, running a $100 million fund. Why not create a $10 million nano vehicle with them where they could write $250,000 to $500,00 check? They don’t want to fill up their fund with these small checks, but you could see how, if they were to create this smaller vehicle, it could be very interesting for them for a returns perspective.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So you’d write them a check for a third of this nano fund . . .</strong></p>
<p>MK: And their LPs would fill in the rest. I’m sure they’d be excited to do it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of Deliveroo raising more than $2 billion ahead of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on the London Stock Exchange this week, another hopeful in the food delivery sector has closed a super-sized round. <a href="https://glovoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, a startup out of Spain with 10 million users that delivers restaurant take-out, groceries and other items in partnership with brick-and-mortar businesses, has picked up a Series F of $528 million (€450 million).</p>
<p>Glovo aims to become the market leader in the 20 markets in Europe where it is live today, in part by expanding its &#8220;q-commerce&#8221; service &#8212; the delivery of items to urban consumers in 30 minutes or less &#8212; and it will be using the money to double down on that strategy, including hiring up to 200 more engineers to work in its headquarters in Barcelona, as well as hubs in Madrid and Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>This is a milestone funding round not just for the company, but its home country: it marks the largest-ever round raised by a Spanish startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We started in Spain, where you have access to far less capital than other countries in Europe. We do more with less and that&#8217;s made us leaner,&#8221; said Sacha Michaud, the co-founder of the company, in an interview this week. &#8220;We’ve got our own strategy and it seems to be working.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Lugard Road Capital and Luxor Capital Group (the former is an affiliate of the latter), with Delivery Hero, Drake Enterprises and GP Bullhound also participating. All are previous backers of Glovo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re thrilled to have the continued backing of Luxor Capital Group and all of our existing investors. Over the last few months, we’ve moved very, very quickly but our vision remains unchanged,&#8221; said Oscar Pierre, Glovo&#8217;s other co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;This investment will allow us to double-down in our core markets, accelerate our leadership position in places where we are already very strong and continue to expand our excellent Q-Commerce division, as well as bring new innovations to our unique multi-category offering to extend more choice to our customers.”</p>
<p>Valuation is not being disclosed with this round, but when it raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$166 million Series E</a> in December 2019 &#8212; just ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic that truly changed the face of delivery services in many parts of the world &#8212; the company had a valuation of $1.18 billion, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/89297-92/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. Michaud would only confirm to me that it was &#8220;definitely an up-round,&#8221; which would put it at at least $1.7 billion, based on that estimate.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of a very busy period of fundraising in the sector as investors the race to get in on the delivery of hot food, groceries and other necessities in Europe &#8212; a fast-growing business model in the most normal of times that blasted off in the last year as an essential service for consumers confined to their homes, often by government mandate, to stave off the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Just in the last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillas</a> in Berlin raised $290 million on a $1 billion+ valuation for its on-demand grocery business; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/everli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everli</a> out of Italy (formerly called Supermercato24) raised $100 million (Luxor is one of its investors too); Turkey&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/getir-becomes-a-unicorn-with-2-6bn-valuation-301256950.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getir</a> &#8212; also rapidly expanding across Europe &#8212; picked up $300 million on a $2.6 billion valuation as Sequoia took its first bite into the European food market; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly Zapp</a> in London has also closed $100 million in funding. Earlier in March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/czech-on-demand-grocery-delivery-startup-rohlik-bags-230m-to-expand-across-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a> out of the Czech Republic bagged $230 million.</p>
<p>Amid all those private raises, we also had Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO yesterday, which &#8212; as IPOs so often do &#8212; exposed some of the trickier aspects of the business. The company &#8212; which is backed by Amazon, a formidable player in food and essentials delivery &#8212; easily raised the most of money of the month &#8212; $2.1 billion in the private placement ahead of the listing &#8212; but then proceeded to slog out its debut on the LSE with shares progressively slumping throughout the day and ending up significantly lower than its offer price.</p>
<p>Areas of concern around Deliveroo serve as cautionary tales for all of them: not just how you price an IPO and what allocation you give to future shareholders, but also the unit economics of your business model, the price of competition, and where labor costs will fit into the bigger picture (and the bottom line).</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve got our own road and we&#8217;re doing a pretty good job,&#8221; Michaud said in an interview when the subject of Deliveroo IPO came up. &#8220;We’re still David versus the Goliath out there.&#8221; Part of that for Glovo has also included some decisions made on rationalizing its own business: the company sold off its Latin American operations in a $272 million deal to its backer Delivery Hero last year to focus solely on Europe and adjacent geographies.</p>
<p>But even before the Series F being announced today, Glovo itself was one of the companies raising money for specific purposes, and those efforts point to how it plans to proceed in the weeks and months ahead on its own growth plan.</p>
<p>In January Glovo announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/spains-glovo-inks-real-estate-tie-up-to-add-more-dark-stores-for-speedy-urban-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strategic deal with Swiss real-estate firm Stoneweg</a>, which pitched in €100 million ($117 million), to co-develop a number of &#8220;dark stores&#8221; in areas where Glovo already operates to improve its distribution networks and help speed up its delivery times.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of a fulfillment operation that complements the hot food that Glovo sells on behalf of its restaurant partners: the dark stores are stocked with items Glovo sells on behalf of other companies such as Carrefour, Continente, and Kaufland, as well as a lot of independent retailers, companies that have not built their own (costly) B2C delivery networks but have wanted to provide that service to consumers nonetheless.</p>
<p>Although the company today promises deliveries in 29 minutes, in many markets, Michaud said, it&#8217;s already averaging 10-15 minutes and the aim is to make that the norm everywhere. This is in part an operational challenge, but also a technical one: this is one reason why the company is adding in more engineers and building out its platform.</p>
<p>Restaurant delivery of hot food remains the biggest category of business for Glovo, he added, but the company has seen a surge of demand for the other kinds of items and is expanding that accordingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Covid, we’ve been delivering pretty much anything you want in your city,&#8221; Michaud said. &#8220;Covid has been an accelerator and has educated the market. Instead of crossing city and spending time waiting and buying items, anything I want and Glovo will bring it to me. Why wouldn’t I do this?&#8221; He believes the more traditional rush of people doing in-person shopping is &#8220;definitely not gong to come back,&#8221; with groceries to be in the same position as restaurants in a couple of years. That&#8217;s leading the company to expand into more areas: &#8220;clothing, fashion and pharmacy, flowers. Hopefully we&#8217;re now in a good position to do that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Labor deliberations</h2>
<p>That position, of course, will involve an important component of this three-sided marketplace. In addition to the restaurants and retailers that partner with Glovo, and the consumers who use the app to buy and get things delivered, there are the delivery people and couriers that do the first- and last-mile work to get the goods into the system, and then to customers. The couriers in the system work today largely on a freelance basis, often balancing jobs on competing apps, and their efforts, and how they are compensated for them, have been the focus of a lot of scrutiny both here and in the U.S.</p>
<p>In short: the companies say couriers have an amazing opportunity to earn money; but many couriers and organizations supporting their cause believe the reality to be far from that.</p>
<p>That has played out with a number of very public protests and is starting now to trickle into formal legal moves to ensure these workers&#8217; rights. Apart from the ethical angle here, it&#8217;s of concern also to investors focused more on the bottom line and the costs that they might mean for businesses that already work on thin margins (or in many cases, losses). Indeed, it&#8217;s very likely that these issues formed part of what weighed on Deliveroo in its public listing and poor debut.</p>
<p>This has also been playing out for Glovo very directly. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost a supreme court case in Spain in September last year</a>, where the court rejected its attempt to classify a courier as self-employed rather than an employee. Now, the country is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/spain-agrees-on-labor-reform-that-will-recognize-delivery-platform-riders-as-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on more formal reforms</a> to put in place guidelines and requirements for companies to mandate benefits to those workers. That will take some time to play out, and in the meantime there are also wider European efforts underway to harmonize the approach across all countries in the EU.</p>
<p>This is a complicated issue, but essentially Glovo advocates to keep the couriers as self-employed, but supports the idea of benefits provided to those workers nonetheless by those taking their services (such as Glovo), and it wants the approach to be Europe-wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think there needs to be more social rights for workers,&#8221; Michaud said. &#8220;We believe in a freelance model with additional social rights that companies like Glovo would give them, but in many countries the regulations are not there for that to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also not all cut-and-dry since it doesn&#8217;t support some of the other aspects of that labor reform. &#8220;We think the rigid strict tables and minimum wages are not the way to fix the problem,&#8221; he added, explaining that the flexibility of the business model does not support that. In short, it&#8217;s negotiating and hoping that it can claw in some expenses while conceding others.</p>
<p>Investors seem ready for these kinds of questions and their longer-term impact, given that the trade-off for them is a foothold in what has been one of the most successful tech efforts in the region.</p>
<p>“Our investment in Glovo reflects our commitment to a company and leadership team that continues to innovate and disrupt in the on-demand delivery space,&#8221; said Jonathan Green, founder and porfolio manager at Lugard Road Capital, in a statement. &#8220;As a long-term investor in Glovo, we are excited to watch the company continue to delight its customers through its unique multi-category offering, amidst an enormous market opportunity in both existing and new geographies.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before you can improve a workflow, you have to understand how work advances through a business, which is more complex than you might imagine inside a large enterprise. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://celonis.com">Celonis</a> comes in. It uses software to identify how work moves through an organization and suggests more efficient ways of getting the same work done, also known as process mining</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a significant partnership with <a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> where IBM Global Services will train 10,000 consultants worldwide on Celonis. The deal gives Celonis, a company with around 1200 employees access to the massive selling and consulting unit, while IBM gets a deep understanding of a piece of technology that is at the front end of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">the workflow automation trend</a>.</p>
<p>Miguel Milano, chief revenue officer at Celonis says that digitizing processes has been a trend for several years. It has sped up due to COVID, and it&#8217;s partly why the two companies have decided to work together. &#8220;Intelligent workflows, or more broadly spoken workflows built to help companies execute better, are at the heart of this partnership and it&#8217;s at the heart of this trend now in the market,&#8221; Milano said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other part of this is that IBM now owns Red Hat, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/29/assessing-ibms-34-billion-red-hat-acquisition/">acquired in 2018 for $34 billion</a>. The two companies believe that by combining the Celonis technology, which is cloud based, with Red Hat, which can span the hybrid world of on premises and cloud, the two together can provide a much more powerful solution to follow work wherever it happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think that moving the [Celonis] software into the Red Hat OpenShift environment is hugely powerful because it does allow in what&#8217;s already a very powerful open solution to now operate across this hybrid cloud world, leveraging the power of OpenShift which can straddle the worlds of mainframe, private cloud and public cloud. And data straddle those worlds, and will continue to straddle those worlds,&#8221; Mark Foster, senior vice president at IBM Services explained.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Celonis pushes beyond process mining into automated workflow tooling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/celonis-moves-beyond-process-discovery-into-automated-workflow-tooling/embed/#?secret=DcPr5gOwr9" data-secret="DcPr5gOwr9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You might think that IBM, which acquired <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises">robotic process automation vendor</a>, WDG Automation last summer, would simply attempt to buy Celonis, but Foster says the partnership is consistent with the company&#8217;s attempt to partner with a broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that this is very much part of an overarching focus of IBM with key ecosystem partners. Some of them are going to be bigger, some of them are going to be smaller, and [&#8230;] I think this is one where we see the opportunity to connect with an organization that&#8217;s taking a leading position in its category, and the opportunity for that to take advantage of the IBM Red Hat technologies…&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The companies had already been working together for some time prior to this formal announcement, and this partnership is the culmination of that. As this firmer commitment to one another goes into effect, the two companies will be working more closely to train thousands of IBM consultants on the technology, while moving the Celonis solution into Red Hat OpenShift in the coming months.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly a big deal with the feel of an acquisition, but Milano says that this is about executing his company&#8217;s strategy to work with more systems integrators (SIs), and while IBM is a significant partner it&#8217;s not the only one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the earliest days of the pandemic, it was no secret that video chat was about to become a very hot space.</p>
<p>Over the past several months investors have bankrolled a handful of video startups with specific niches, ranging from always-on office surveillance to platforms that encouraged plenty of mini calls to avoid the need for more lengthy team-wide meetings. As the pandemic wanes and plenty of startups begin to look toward hybrid office models, there are others who have decided to lean into embracing a fully remote workforce, a strategy that may require new tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getpingpong.com/">PingPong</a>, a recent launch from Y Combinator&#8217;s latest batch, is building an asynchronous video chat app for the workplace. We selected PingPong as one of our favorite startups that debuted last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Our favorite companies from Y Combinator’s W21 Demo Day: Part 2&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-2/embed/#?secret=04IbtlENHk" data-secret="04IbtlENHk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s central sell is that for remote teams, there needs to be a better alternative to Slack or email for catching up with co-workers across time zones. While Zoom calls might be able to convey a company&#8217;s culture better than a post in a company-wide Slack channel, for fully remote teams operating on different continents, scheduling a company-wide meeting is often a nonstarter.</p>
<p>PingPong is selling its service as an addendum to Slack that helps remote product teams collaborate and convey what they&#8217;re working on. Users can capture a short video of themselves and share their screen in lieu of a standup presentation and then they can get caught up on each other&#8217;s progress on their own time. PingPong&#8217;s hope is that users find more value in brainstorming, conducting design reviews, reporting bugs and more inside while using asynchronous video than they would with text.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot to do before we can replace Slack, so right now we kind of emphasize playing nice with Slack,&#8221; PingPong CEO Jeff Whitlock tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Our longer-term vision is that what young people are doing in their consumer lives, they bring into the enterprise when they graduate into the workforce. You and I were using Instant Messenger all the time in the early 2000s and then we got to the workplace, that was the opportunity for Slack&#8230; We believe in the next five or so years, something that&#8217;s a richer, more asynchronous video-based Slack alternative will have a lot more interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Building a chat app specifically designed for remote product teams operating in multiple time zones is a tight niche for now, but Whitlock believes that this will become a more common problem as companies embrace the benefits of remote teams post-pandemic. PingPong costs $100 per user per year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Longtime venture capitalist Hans Tung is a big guy. His size might just be lifesaving.</p>
<p>A first-generation Taiwanese-American who came to the U.S. and to LA specifically in 1984, it was a fraught time for the then 14-year-old. Two years earlier, a 27-year-old, Chinese-American draftsman named Vincent Chin was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/who-vincent-chin-history-relevance-1982-killing-n771291">beaten to death</a> in Detroit by a Chrysler plant supervisor and his stepson, a laid-off autoworker, who believed that Chin was of Japanese descent and were angry over the growing success of Japan&#8217;s auto industry. He was killed the night of his own bachelor party.</p>
<p>Anti-Asian sentiment may have seemed to lessen over the following decades, but it has still remained constant, and Tung as been on the receiving end of it, he says. &#8220;Growing up, I faced my share of taunts, of racial epithets, whether it was in California or Boston or New York. I&#8217;m fortunate that I&#8217;m over 6&#8217;4&#8243; tall and weigh more than 200 pounds,&#8221; or he might be physically harassed at some point, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tung has never been more mindful of his dimensions than now, with anti-Asian sentiment abruptly worsening last year based on political rhetoric about the coronavirus. &#8220;As COVID broke out in China, we knew that Asian Americans would be blamed,&#8221; says Tung, who flies back and forth to China routinely for work as a managing director with the cross-border investment firm GGV Capital. &#8220;We saw this with SARS, too, but it wasn&#8217;t as big a pandemic, so people were being harassed and not killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anecdotally, Tung believes life is more dangerous right now for Asians in the U.S. based on conversations with friends and family members and the worrisome headlines to emerge of elderly individuals in particular being beaten on the streets of <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/03/17/elderly-asian-woman-beats-up-man-attacking-her-in-san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-nab-suspect-elderly-asian-american-man-attacked/story?id=76371868">Oakland</a> and on <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/03/30/asian-man-beaten-unconscious-on-subway/">New York subways</a> and outside of Times Square, as happened on Monday when a 65-year-old woman was <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nypd-arrests-suspect-in-brutal-beating-on-65-year-old-asian-woman/2973656/">viciously attacked</a> in a scene that was filmed by an onlooker and has provoked national outrage.</p>
<p>The numbers back him up. From 2019 to 2020, overall hate crime rate declined while hate crimes targeting Asians increased, as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264">first reported by NBC</a> and based on analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Overall, its examination revealed that while such crimes decreased overall by 7% last year, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150%, with the biggest surge in New York, where anti-Asian hate crimes rose from three in 2019 to 28 last year, an 833% increase.</p>
<p>With those numbers seemingly continuing to climb in 2021, Tung and his partners at GGV Capital decided to take action two weeks ago, quickly settling on what they do best, which is to respond to the rising violence with their financial muscle and network. A first step was <a href="https://twitter.com/GGVCapital/status/1372776918156648452">publicly</a> offering to match $100,000 in donations to organizations that support the AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) communities. GGV&#8217;s move was almost immediately matched by other investors and founders eager to help, including Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Venture Partners and Eric Kim and Chi-Hua Chien of Goodwater Capital, who are also matching up to $100,000 in donations.</p>
<p>Fast-forward and Tung says that 11 days into GGV&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/GGVCapital/status/1377305038796681218">de facto Twitter campaign</a>, roughly $5 million in donations have now been made by more than 175 founders (including Jen Rubio, Stewart Butterfield and Eric Yuan) and members of more than 30 venture firms in a kind of partnership that is &#8220;rare to see in the VC community,&#8221; Tung notes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great start, says Tung, who is among the 15% of Asian-Pacific Islanders who are partners at U.S. venture firms, according to National Venture Capital Association figures.</p>
<p>At the same time, he notes that the problem is ongoing and that more resources &#8212; which everyone is sending on an individual basis to a variety of Asian-American community groups that are dealing with a spiking racism and its implications &#8212; are needed. Indeed, to help funnel donor interest in the right direction, GGV is recommending at least five organizations whose work it believes to be making an impact. These include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://secure.donationpay.org/aajc/">Asian Americans Advancing Justice</a>, <a href="https://www.redcanarysong.net/about-us">Red Canary Song</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-aapi-community-fund">GoFundMe Support the AAPI Community</a>, <a href="https://donate.givedirect.org/?cid=14711">Stop AAPI Hate</a> and <a href="https://compassioninoakland.org/donate">Compassion in Oakland</a>.</p>

<p>Tung takes pains to note that GGV has been active in other campaigns, including AllRaise, the organization that&#8217;s bringing more gender equality to investment firms and to the board room. He says that his partners were also highly moved by the Black Lives Matter movement last spring, donating to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other organizations.</p>
<p>He says that earlier movements &#8212; including an effort by investor Ryan Sarver of Redpoint last year to help both front-line workers and restaurant workers by devising a way for donors to “buy” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/bay-area-effort-to-feed-hospital-workers-partners-with-jose-andres-world-central-kitchen/">chef-made meals for hospital staff</a> &#8212; have been experiences from which he has learned.</p>
<p>One of those lessons is that when something is close enough to one&#8217;s heart, it&#8217;s worth the risk of being perceived as a &#8220;VC who is showing off&#8221; if it moves the needle.</p>
<p>In this case, says Tung, &#8220;so many of these crimes are treated as individual incidents and not as hate crimes,&#8221; which come with more severe penalties, he is determined to raise awareness and visibility into the matter, even if it means making himself more vulnerable about his own experience than he might be fully comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to Asian hate, it&#8217;s such a personal matter,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sarah Kunst, founding partner at Cleo Capital, has worn many hats. She&#8217;s been an entrepreneur, served on plenty of boards, is a contributing author at Marie Clare, has been a senior advisor to Bumble and worked as a consultant in marketing, business development and more.</p>
<p>With all that experience, she knows all too well that the process of fundraising starts well before your first pitch meeting. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re so excited to have Kunst join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed/">Early Stage</a> in July to discuss how to get ready to fundraise.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Kunst has discussed the topic with us. On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, Kunst and one of her portfolio company founders Julia Collins described how to conduct the process of fundraising.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>For example, there is a story to tell, metrics to share and an art to building momentum before you ever start filling your calendar. That all requires preparation, and Kunst will outline how to go about that at our event in July.</p>
<p>Early Stage is going down twice this year, with our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">first event taking place tomorrow</a>! Here&#8217;s a look at some of the topics we&#8217;ll be covering:</p>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>

<li>Four Things to Think About Before Raising a Series A (Bucky Moore, Kleiner Perkins)</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the growth of game-streaming audiences have continued on desktop platforms, the streaming space has felt surprisingly stagnant at times, particularly due to the missing mobile element and a lack of startup competitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://lowkey.gg/">Lowkey</a>, a gaming startup that builds software for game streamers, is aiming to build out opportunities in bit-sized clips on mobile. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup wants to be a hub for both creating and viewing short gaming clips but also sees a big opportunity in helping streamers cut down their existing content for distribution on platforms like Instagram and TikTok where short-form gaming content sees a good deal of engagement.</span></p>
<p>The startup announced today that they&#8217;ve closed a $7 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from a host of angel investors including Figma&#8217;s Dylan Field, Loom&#8217;s Joe Thomas and Plaid&#8217;s Zach Perret and William Hockey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We last covered Lowkey in early 2020 when the company was looking to build out a games tournament platform for adults. At the time, the company had already pivoted after going through YC as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/camelot-lets-twitch-and-youtube-audiences-pay-for-what-they-want-to-see/">Camelot</a>, which allowed audiences on Twitch and YouTube to pay creators to take on challenges. This latest shift brings Lowkey back to the streaming world but more focused on becoming a tool for streamers and a mobile hub for viewers.</p>
<p>Twitch and YouTube Gaming have proven to be pretty uninterested in short-form content, favoring the opportunities of long-form streams that allow creators to press broadcast and upload lengthy streams. Lowkey users can easily upload footage captured from Lowkey&#8217;s desktop app or directly import a linked stream. This allows content creators to upload and comment on their own footage or remix and respond to another streamer&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for streamers has been adapting widescreen content for a vertical video form factor, but CEO Jesse Zhang says that it&#8217;s not really a problem with most modern games. &#8220;Games inherently want to focus you attention on the center of the screen,&#8221; Zhang tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So, almost all clips extend really cleanly to like a mobile format, which is what we&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowkey&#8217;s desktop app is available on Windows and their new mobile app is now live for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lowkey-social-gaming-videos/id1553098190">iOS</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the same day that Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">fizzled at the start of trading</a>, Compass announced via a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521101664/d36119ds1a.htm">fresh S-1 filing</a> that it will reduce the number of shares in its impending flotation and sell them at a lower price.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Taken together, the various market signs could point to a modest to moderate cooling in the tech IPO market.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The move by Compass, a venture-backed residential brokerage, to lower its implied public-market valuation and sell fewer shares is a rebuke of the company&#8217;s earlier optimism regarding its valuation and ability to raise capital. The company&#8217;s IPO is still slated to generate as much as a half-billion dollars, so it can hardly be called a failure if it executes at its rejiggered price range, but the cuts matter.</p>
<p>Especially when we consider several other factors. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">Deliveroo IPO</a>, as discussed this morning, was impacted by more than mere economics. And there are questions regarding how interested seemingly more conservative countries&#8217; stock exchanges will prove in growth-oriented, unprofitable companies.</p>
<p>But added to the mix are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material/">recent declines</a> in the valuation of public software companies, effectively repricing the value of high-margin, recurring revenue. The reasons behind that particular change are several, but may include a rotation by public investors into other asset categories, or an air-letting from a sector that may have enjoyed some valuation inflation in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The killer use case for AR/VR might just be warfare.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft announced that it has received a contract to outfit the United States Army with tens of thousands of augmented reality headsets based on the company&#8217;s HoloLens tech. This contract could be worth as much as $21.88 billion over 10 years, the company says.</p>
<p>Microsoft will be fulfilling an order for 120,000 AR headsets for the Army based on their Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) design. The modified design upgrades the capabilities of the HoloLens 2 for the needs of soldiers in the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios,&#8221;  a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/31/army-moves-microsoft-hololens-based-headset-from-prototyping-to-production-phase/">blog post</a> from Microsoft&#8217;s Alex Kipman reads.</p>
<p>The contract builds on the two-year $480 million contract that Microsoft won back in 2018 to outfit the U.S. Army with augmented reality tech. At the time, the contract detailed that the deal could potentially result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets. “Augmented reality technology will provide troops with more and better information to make decisions. This new work extends our longstanding, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense to this new area,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>Microsoft says this announcement marks the transition from prototyping these designs to producing and rolling them out in the field.</p>
<p>This is a massive scaleup for augmented reality tech that has seen few large-scale rollouts and gives Microsoft a government contractor budget to tackle base technology problems that could scale down to consumer and enterprise-level devices in the future. Many of the industry&#8217;s biggest players in augmented reality have been reluctant or outspoken in their avoidance of military contracts but Microsoft has remained undeterred in competing for these contracts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s daughter-in-law Lara Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CND8tIwrfc4/">promoted a new interview</a> with the former president on Facebook and Instagram Tuesday, but a workaround to Trump&#8217;s ban on two of the world&#8217;s most popular social networks wasn&#8217;t long for this world.</p>
<p>She was apparently swiftly cautioned by Facebook that anything posted &#8220;in the voice of President Trump&#8221; is not currently allowed on Facebook or Instagram and would be subject to removal. Trump himself remains banned on Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">pending a decision by the Oversight Board</a>, the external governing body the company set up to tackle it thorniest platform policy decisions.</p>
<p>Those rules apply to any accounts or pages associated with the Trump campaign as well as any belonging to former surrogates for the campaign, two categories that Lara Trump&#8217;s account falls into. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaraLTrump/posts/1547529562119509">screenshots depicting emails</a> from the company were legitimate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Facebook does still make a news exemption for Trump, presumably for something more akin to a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview, but in this case he was being interviewed by someone involved in his campaign who then planned to promote the video on a campaign-associated account.</p>
<p>While Facebook won&#8217;t host the video itself, Lara Trump opted for a workaround to the workaround, linking to the interview on Rumble, a video sharing website that saw an<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90574842/what-is-rumble-meet-the-video-platform-trumps-supporters-are-flocking-to"> influx of Trump supporters late last year</a>.</p>
<p>She also posted to the video on The Right View, a web-based show previously produced by the Trump campaign that the Washington Post describes as &#8220;a sort of pro-Trump answer to ABC’s &#8216;The View.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News announced this week that it would bring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/03/29/fox-lara-trump-hire/">Lara Trump into the fold</a>, hiring the member of the Trump family on as a paid contributor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year wasn&#8217;t an easy one for just about anybody, but <a href="https://projectinclude.org/remote-work-report/">a new report from Project Include</a> shows that the shift to remote work affected some groups more negatively than others. Unsurprisingly, it was people already struggling against harassment and bias, particularly women of color and those identifying as LGBTQ, who saw the biggest jumps in those behaviors.</p>
<p>The report is based on a survey of about 2,800 people and interviews with tech workers and subject matter experts in numerous countries and industries. There&#8217;s not a lot of good news in it, but why should there be? Sadly, the unprecedented confluence of multiple disasters in 2020 has spawned another, quieter disaster in working conditions.</p>
<p>Remote work has changed how people interact, and the result of that has been, among other things, significant increases to gender- and race-based harassment. Over a quarter of those surveyed reported an increase in harassment and workplace hostility — and of those experiencing increases, 98% were women or nonbinary and 99% were nonwhite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trans people were much more likely to experience harassment and hostility, as were were all Black respondents, especially women and nonbinary people. Asian, Latinx, and multiracial respondents also reported more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132803" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132803" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png" alt="Graphs illustrating the numbers of various demographics experiencing harassment." width="1024" height="1093" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png 1405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=281,300 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=768,820 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=637,680 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Project Include</p></div></p>
<p>The switch to remote productivity and communication seems to have made this harassment difficult to avoid. An increase in reliance on 1:1 communication via chat, email and video calls meant working directly with harassers was inescapable and difficult to report. &#8220;Respondents noted that individual harassers would follow them across online spaces to where they were,&#8221; the report adds.</p>
<p>People with mental health conditions, particularly those with PTSD, were twice as likely to report experiencing harassment than those without.</p>
<p>Changes to expectations and tools meant big increases to anxiety and drops in work-life balance. Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported being expected to work longer days, and more than half said they felt pressure (or were plainly expected) to be online outside of official working hours. The survey reported that 10% said managers were checking in daily, and 5% reported two or more times per day. Others complained about surveillance software like keystroke and screen monitoring.</p>
<p>Workers with disabilities found that companies often chose productivity and collaboration tools that had inadequate accessibility features — for example, Zoom calls without automatic captioning that required lip-reading to keep up.</p>
<p>As for reporting harassment, most said they did not do so because they didn&#8217;t trust their HR department or company at large to handle the complaints properly or respond fairly. One person even reported that it was a person within HR itself that was harassing them. Less than half of respondents said they trusted their company to respond to these issues properly; about a third said they did <em>not</em> trust the company to do so; about the same number said their workplace doesn&#8217;t even have the tools to intervene or solve any issue they might bring up.</p>
<p>These and more statistics are available in the report, which goes into detail on a number of other issues and behaviors, as well as making a number of suggestions as to what companies can do to step up. Of course if your company has waited until now to take action, that&#8217;s a problem right there. But in general the idea is to actually listen to workers, hold leadership accountable and take actions with measurable impact like no-meeting days and generous time-off policies.</p>
<p>Most of all, don&#8217;t expect things to just &#8220;go back to normal.&#8221; CEO of Vaya Consulting Nicole Sanchez puts it best as quoted in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most companies are not ready to bring people back together physically, even electively. People at the executive level are going to be shocked to find out that what they’re actually dealing with is a whole lot of live active trauma. A lot of companies that go back and try and make it like it was before will wonder, &#8220;Why aren’t these pieces fitting together anymore?&#8221; And the answer, I hope, that we get collective agreement on is: Those pieces never fit together. They just fit together for you. Now, you’re seeing all the seams and all of the vulnerabilities, and now you have to reinvent your company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors of the report include Ellen Pao of <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include itself</a>, Yang Hong of Shoshin Insights, and Caroline Sinders of Convocation Design + Research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://datapeople.io/">Datapeople</a>, a startup that sells software designed to make recruiting more equitable, announced that it has raised $8 million across two funding events, including a $5 million round in mid-2020.</p>
<p>The company, which counts <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/">Uncork Capital</a>, <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a> and <a href="https://firstround.com/">First Round Capital</a> as backers, does two things. Its initial product, what Datapeople calls &#8220;Language Analytics,&#8221; scans job postings, offering suggested edits to customers to help them attract a more diverse group of applicants.</p>
<p>And, coming shortly, Datapeople is rolling out what it calls &#8220;Recruiting Analytics,&#8221; a service that provides a high-level view of a company&#8217;s aggregate recruiting efforts. The recruiting side of its software service will keep tabs on diversity data such as the pace at which a company&#8217;s job posting attracts women against related jobs&#8217; own performance, among other bits of data-focused reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per a release that TechCrunch viewed ahead of publication, Datapeople&#8217;s view isn&#8217;t that there aren&#8217;t products in the market that provide charts of how a company&#8217;s recruiting process may be performing at a surface level. Instead its view is when it comes to asking more complex questions about the treatment of different groups of people, current solutions fall short. That&#8217;s the space it intends to place its new product.</p>

<p>TechCrunch caught up with Datapeople co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyland/">Phillip Reyland</a> to chat about its recent capital raises and business performance.</p>
<p>According to Reyland, his startup&#8217;s language product is sold to in-house recruiting teams at mid-market through Fortune 100 companies. Related startup <a href="http://Textio.com">Textio</a> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/textio-raises-12m-seattle-startup-looks-reach-job-candidates-writing-technology/">raised more capital last spring</a>, implying that there&#8217;s enough market demand for job-focused language tooling to support at least two venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>On the recruiting analytics side of the Datapeople house, Reyland told TechCrunch that the recruiting industry is today where marketing was 20 years ago. Given the rise in marketing software that we&#8217;ve seen over that time frame, Datapeople sees a long, broad market for new tooling in its target market.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to track how well Datapeople&#8217;s new product performs, as Reyland told TechCrunch that 2020 was the best year in its history. That, plus the capital it raised last year, means that the startup has a high bar to clear this year. Perhaps the new service will help it meet said goals.</p>
<p>The company intends to roughly double its mid-30s staff number to meet those expectations. It&#8217;s off to a good start, with Reyland telling TechCrunch that its Q1 2021 was &#8220;awesome.&#8221; As the company is, per its fundraising history, pretty early-stage, we&#8217;re willing to wait one more round to hammer it for more specifics.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, my colleague Matt Harris coined the term “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewharris/2019/11/19/fintech-the-fourth-platform-part-one/?sh=1b757166cb28">embedded fintech</a>” to describe how virtually all software-driven companies will soon embed financial services into their applications, from sending and receiving payments to enabling lending, insurance and banking services, an idea that quickly spread within the fintech community.</p>
<p>Vertical apps such as Toast for restaurants, Squire for barbershops and Shopmonkey for car repair shops will deliver financial services to businesses in the future rather than traditional, stodgy financial institutions.</p>

			Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The embedded fintech movement has just begun, but there is already a sister concept percolating: embedded procurement. In this next wave, businesses will buy things they need through vertical B2B apps, rather than through sales reps, distributors or an individual merchant’s website.</p>
<p>If you own a coffee shop, wouldn’t it be convenient to schedule recurring orders for beans and milk from the same software portal where you process payments, manage accounting and handle payroll? The companies that figured out how to monetize financial services via embedded fintech are well positioned to monetize through procurement, too.</p>
<p>Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech. The salon software company Fresha is a typical embedded fintech story. Fresha’s platform is an online and mobile platform specially designed for spas and salons, encompassing appointment scheduling, reporting and analytics, marketing promotions, and point-of-sale capabilities. The software is free for salons; Fresha monetizes through payment processing.</p>
<p>In the future, Fresha will undoubtedly turn to embedded procurement, becoming a logical place for business owners to order and manage inventory like shampoo, scissors, brushes and other supplies. In turn, Fresha can aggregate demand from thousands of spas to place orders with its suppliers, leveraging its scale to negotiate more favorable pricing on behalf of its customers. Borrowing a concept from the healthcare world, vertical software companies will become group purchasing organizations in every sector.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Picture it. It’s September, and you’re at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> about to present your virtual elevator pitch to thousands of attendees around the world. In the short span of 120 seconds, your company will become known to a rapt audience of early-startup influencers including potential customers, investors, tech icons and the media.</p>
<p>An awesome opportunity, amirite? Don’t just picture it — make it happen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">exhibiting in Startup Alley</a>. Yes, it really is that easy. Every early-stage startup that exhibits in Startup Alley gets to pitch to the Disrupt audience.</p>
<p>It’s not only a tremendous opportunity to practice, pitching at Disrupt can have long-term benefits. Don’t just take our word for it. Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, talks about her company’s experience pitching last year at Disrupt 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Startup Alley exhibitors got to pitch to attendees, and we were thrilled with how it went. I recorded the pitch, and now we just shoot potential investors a quick video saying, “take a look at our CEO pitching at Disrupt 2020.” It’s a great piece of marketing collateral.”</p>
<p>Along with the epic exposure that comes from pitching at Disrupt, Startup Alley exhibitors also have a shot at being interviewed during one of the many hour-long Startup Alley Crawls. Each tech category gets its own crawl — we’ll post the specific times in the agenda closer to the show’s opening — and TechCrunch journalists will interview a select number of exhibiting founders from each category.</p>
<p>Here’s yet another reason to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> sooner rather than later. Your pass makes you eligible to participate in Startup Alley+, a curated experience designed to help founders increase their opportunities for exposure and business growth. Only 50 companies — chosen by TechCrunch — will form this cohort, and there&#8217;s no additional cost. Here’s the kicker — the benefits start months before Disrupt 2021 begins. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Learn more about the Startup+ experience here</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that TechCrunch editors award two Startup Alley exhibitors with a Startup Battlefield Wild Card? Those founders get to compete for $100,000 in the always epic Startup Battlefield competition. Who knows? You might follow in the steps of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/recordgram-thinks-your-phone-is-the-new-recording-studio/?_ga=2.255114062.739798790.1561385469-21262877.1546616128&amp;_gac=1.128542206.1559149543.CjwKCAjw27jnBRBuEiwAdjQXDPwyBPHjxvb8oEViYRSrVto53q8pleF-kUlsDn9V24VnEGPCqfrR2BoCsvQQAvD_BwE">RecordGram</a>. That startup, chosen from Startup Alley as a Wild Card, went on to win the Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Exhibiting in Startup Alley is a savvy strategy. You’ll pitch your company to a global audience, gain valuable exposure, meet and connect with influencers and potential customers. Win-win-win.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> takes place on September 21-23. If you want to take advantage of every opportunity, there’s just one item to cross off your to-do list.<strong> </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">Apply for Startup Alley</a> before the early-bird price ($199) expires on May 13 at 11:59 p.m. (PDT).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today is officially launching a new feature called Remix, which offers a way to record your Reels video alongside a video from another user. The option is similar to TikTok&#8217;s existing Duets feature, which also lets users react to or interact with another person&#8217;s video content while creating their own. Instagram&#8217;s new feature has been in public testing before today, so some Instagram users may have already gained access.</p>
<p>We recently reported on Instagram&#8217;s plans with Remix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/snapchat-is-developing-its-own-take-on-tiktok-duets-with-a-new-remix-feature/">when noting that Snapchat was developing a Remix feature</a> of its own. In fact, Snapchat is also using the name &#8220;Remix&#8221; for its TikTok Duets rival that&#8217;s currently in development.</p>
<p>On TikTok, Duets are a key part to making the app feel more like a social network and less of just a passive video-watching experience. Users take advantage of Duets to sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video. They will do things like cook someone else&#8217;s recipe, record a reaction video, or even just watch a video from a smaller creator to give them a boost.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok competitors &#8212; like Instagram Reels, Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight or YouTube&#8217;s Shorts, for example &#8212; have launched their short-form video experiences without a full set of engagement or editing features like TikTok has, making their apps feel like pale knockoffs of the original. Remix on Reels is a first step toward changing that perception, by giving users at least one important option to engage and collaborate with their fellow creatives.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Now you can use the Remix feature in Reels to create your own reel next to one that already exists <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3ad.png" alt="🎭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re capturing your reaction, responding to friends or bringing your own magic to trends, Remix is another way to collab on Instagram <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/eU8x74Q3yf">pic.twitter.com/eU8x74Q3yf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To use the new Remix feature, you&#8217;ll first tap on the three-dot menu on a Reel and select the new &#8220;Remix this Reel&#8221; option. The screen will then split into the original Reel and your own new one, where you can begin to record side by side with the original. When you&#8217;ve finished, you can tweak other aspects of the recording like the volume of the original video or your audio and you can optionally add a voiceover. After applying these or any other edits, you can publish the Remix.</p>
<p>The feature will only be available on newly uploaded Reels &#8212; so unfortunately, if you want your older Reels to be duetted, you either need to reupload them or go back to your old Reel and specifically enable Remix.</p>

<p>Your Remixes will appear alongside any other Reels you&#8217;ve recorded on the Reels tab on your Instagram profile, and you&#8217;ll be able to track who has remixed your content through Instagram&#8217;s Activity tab.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out, starting today, says Instagram. It will be enabled by default on all new Reels published from a public account.</p>
